this said, remain withinthe realm possible combination initial sharp currency depreciation, impositionof still credible exchange rate regime, sticky domestic wage (even price rise) andfiscal probity might sufficient deal longer-term competitiveness problem.24what also surprise light asian experience merit voluntarilyadopting regime floating, polar extreme immutable fix, receive moreattention.25 this particularly surprise give (albeit questionable) hypothesis 22 the great danger arise unilateral malaysian imposition control outgo capital itwould increase investors’ fear policy might follow

the strong currency would pay dividendin significant proportion government’s internal debt service index u dollar. this highlyinteractive non-linear system could also operate reverse confidence

initiative. the code oftransparency still process finalised, current form base upon asensible (to some) radical framework. akin increasingly accept therealm monetary policy, draft code suggest transparency respect tothe supervisors’ mandate, effectiveness powers, democraticaccountability bodies. in effect, code transparency try ensure thesupervisors job implement core principles.as note above, transparency may necessary condition ensure supervisor carryout effectively task implement core principles. but hardly sufficientcondition. while imf monitor compliance code transparency (andalso implementation core principle themselves36), influence imf exertmay relatively limit unless country question active programme theimf. one complementary suggestion might helpful exercise “peer

might usefully try put similarpressure counterpart emerge markets.37 in similar extreme vein, thirdsuggestion would limit aggressively “right establishment” world’smajor financial centres. in effect, bank without adequate supervisory framework theirown country would able conduct international bank business. this may seemradical, dictum among industrial country since 1975 basle concordat.38as well,

money distinct economic social advantages.inflation worth while. it solve, rather causes, economic problems.monetary stability, contrast, major, albeit doubt insufficient, basis forgrowth employment.second, independent central bank safeguard stable money easily. after all, iseasier pursue steady, medium-term-oriented approach, apart day-to-day politicalconcerns. and medium-term-oriented approach, turn, help one respond little bitearlier threat value money, attach undue importance short-termfactors. moreover, give independent central bank, political development exercisea direct impact confidence currency. consider, instance, resignation eccommission two week ago, really affect financial markets. that wouldvery likely quite different currency close day-to-day politics.third, durably sound fiscal policy contribute materially safeguard stable price andthe longer-term room manœuvre. in certain situations, may make sense toleratedeficits while. for instance, part built-in flexibility, context sustainedtax reform stimulate effort investment. but, judge past experience, 5bis review 35/1999demand management via expenditure side ultimately increase influence thestate debt burden.and fourth, event sufficient convergence economic performance theeconomic policy priority exchange rate remain stable long run. quantitativetargets exchange rates, without adequate convergence field anti-inflation policy,are counterproductive. that apply exchange rate major currency areas.exchange-rate target apt lead conflict external stability internalobjectives. and financial market perceive vulnerability arrangements. thatencourages, rather curbs, speculation. if target fall, may easily morepronounced overshooting.happily, four lesson include maastricht treaty. they form foundationfor today’s common currency, euro. first, treaty give european monetary policy theprimary target ensure price stability. second, european system central bank –comprising ecb participate national central bank – assign largemeasure independence task. third, treaty, specifically jointlyagreed stability growth pact, commit national fiscal policy well. the underlyingorientation is: normal cyclical conditions, public sector budget close tobalance surplus. the fiscal policy maker participate country take thisprecept much heart. and fourth, treaty stipulate even general exchange-rateorientations, may formulate council minister special situations, mustnot jeopardise primary objective ecb (namely, ensure price stability).the stipulation maastricht treaty drop heaven come narrow-minded technocrats. hence interpret merely legalistically outcomeof negotiation – outcome could helped. in important respects, all, theyconstitute lesson european monetary history past decades.ivthe euro reality quarter year now. the general public followingits progress interest uncritically, albeit sometimes little muchagitation. not every movement external value amount underlie trend,particularly dollar value reflect unexpectedly strong economic performanceand special international political developments. composure appropriate, disregard isnot. we ecb govern council pursue exchange-rate target, are, ofcourse, interest lastingly strong stable euro. the euro must try gain strengthof predecessor and, all, must win confidence reputation own. aconfidence-inspiring orientation monetary policy important end, insufficient initself. other policy areas, too, must make due contribution. and seem someserious deficiencies, especially far structural policy concerned.that likewise common position ecb govern council members. an underlyingjoint sentiment develop gratifyingly fast among govern council members. wefeel part common body, bear joint responsibility entire euroarea. think in, decision of, govern council far reflect genuinesupranationality, rather mere aggregation national interests. bi review 35/19996incidentally, course good ecb govern council two dutchman aresitting debate decision-making chamber, heavyweight field anti-inflation policy; one president ecb governor thedutch central bank. what make heavyweight stature fact thatthey dutchmen. the crucial factor intellectual capacity and, all, theirunambiguous orientation towards stability. but perhaps factor wayinterrelated.the european system central banks, compose european central bankand national central banks, likewise perform duty pretty smoothly now.after all, maastricht treaty explicitly rely largely national central bank theconduct monetary policy. cross-border cooperation whole function veryefficiently far. there course number minor mishaps. give giganticsize task, could otherwise? but, thing considered, said:the eurosystem works.the important thing is, course, euro currently display high degree ofprice stability. that apply round number currency europe andthroughout world. the high domestic stability u dollar attract particularattention. and backdrop tighten labour market strong domesticgrowth persist years. at rate, sign date ofthe upturn inflation rate use occur business cycle progressed. manycommentators interpret new era. some even go far toconsign phenomenon inflation archive economic history good.the notion secular trend towards stability presuppose structural break trigger twodevelopments: onmarch globalisation, surge productivity due hugeadvances communication data processing. the consequent increase competition issaid lead substantial new cost pressure possibly global glut ofgoods services. in addition, substantial change behaviour policy maker andeconomic agent say occurred. and that, claimed, continue.true though observation undoubtedly are, proposition structural break,resulting final discontinuance inflation, appear over-optimistic. it mustsurely counter number oppose factors:first, decline commodity price presumably, least extent, temporary.some people, indeed, speak ongoing inverse oil-price shock – oil-priceimplosion, speak. judge past experience, however, shock seldom last long.the recent rise may suggest that.second, remain see whether fast pace productivity growth really turn tobe last phenomenon. and easy tell whether primarily drive bytechnological progress. it might also be, least part, reflection; america, longperiod relatively high capacity utilisation; germany, steep rise labour costsduring first half nineties, shed labour thereafter.third, even surge productivity sustained, could lastingly foster price stabilityonly fully exploit distribution purpose re-distribution purposes, letalone over-exploited. that may serious problem america, great 7bis review 35/1999flexibility mobility prevail labour market there. but germany, instance,wage-rate policy – back extent government policy – today largely gear tothe growth productivity, even though unemployment high labour-market flexibilityand mobility far adequate. but event expansionary wage-rate policyand structural rigidity labour market, academic argument higherproductivity automatically imply great price stability hold good longer.and fourth, even tendency towards great stability durably take hold non-monetary field (something know), would release monetary policy, itspart, obligation keep monetary side order. for overly expansionary monetarygrowth always pose threat – price stability stability financialmarkets.we must disregard fact precisely monetary discipline number ofeuropean country – often buttress great autonomy central bank – whichplayed major role way price stability eighty nineties. thatreassured monetary side. and help engender change behaviour areas,too. that effect must reversed. it never appropriate proclaim death inflation.the seemingly dead may actually live longer.by say this, i wish kindle fear inflation. but i want draw attention tothe fact that, third millennium, remain true that:in long run, stable money monetary policy keep monetary growthunder control, market sufficiently flexible, policy maker ensure appropriateunderlying condition keep government finance check. that brave newworld europe – especially since brave number europeancountries – need durably stability-oriented monetary policy, even monetary policyalone cannot safeguard stability content euro.vunfortunately, first quarter-year euro mark number politicaluncertainties. at european level, resignation ec commission highlight someunsolved problems. and economic policy stance specific country presentationhave apparently give rise bewilderment, even debate meanwhile seem havebecome le strident again. but bewilderment evidently also exert after-effects. for,in assertion treaty, presentation understand imply that, inthe final analysis, major precept treaty long posse bind force theyused have.the question appropriate assignment manifestly paramount importance futureanti-inflation policy and, probably, monetary union well. hence i brieflyrevert topic again. first, override question is: should monetary policy havean unequivocal priority mandate, maastricht treaty, primaryorientation towards target monetary stability? or rather integral part aset political decision correct dosage instruments?on score, must clearly recognised: unequivocal mandate monetary policymakers essential precondition independence central bank. and bi review 35/19998independence central bank requires, justification, far-reaching basic consensus.just independence ecb escb ensure by, instance, approval ofall eu country maastricht treaty. but basic consensus imply extract one targetfrom day-to-day political debate make inaccessible political intervention. this iswhy constitutions. if monetary policy maker priority target, onlyobjectives equal urgency, would choose variety economicpolicy goal occasion, thus make value judgements. to that, however, ademocracy one need mandate electorate.hence monetary policy independent presence clear primary mandate.needless say, imply monetary policy maker pay heed toother targets, besides monetary stability, e.g. growth, employment externalequilibrium objectives. but hierarchy target must clear. and must likewise beclear durable monetary stability key contribution achievement othertargets.this bring u second consideration: independence central bank lessimportant nowadays was, say, 1991? if anything, opposite appear case.for one thing, assume – today early ninety – euroarea determine nation state long time come. without central europeandecision-making process free think term nation states, political centralbank would apt generate severe conflict participate countries.for another, financial market become even emancipate since 1991.credibility become even important. and build confidence currency onthe part citizen financial market without doubt one great strength anindependent central bank – only, course, pursue right policies. just look thehistorically low interest rate euro – new currency without stability record itsown, look european central bank, institution without success story itsown. there doubt independence ecb already pay off. but itmust remain effective full. integration ex-ante coordination system policyareas inappropriate.there remain third aspect: primary objective independent monetarypolicy maker pursue? the treaty settle that. and must remain answer. not merelyfor legalistic primarily objective reasons: in long run, inflation always amonetary phenomenon. although sound monetary policy, isolation, cannot alwaysaltogether prevent emergence inflationary trends, make difficult forinflationary trend persist.on hand, monetary policy virtually nothing counter structuralunemployment, mainly prevail today many countries. for example, neitherenhance labour-market flexibility widen unduly narrow wage-rate spread. nor itcreate fiscal wage environment conducive private investment. at best,it could, theory, temporarily low real labour cost mean surprise inflation. then adifferent assignment would simply imply drop goal stability.there remain influence monetary policy business activity relatively lowproportion cyclical unemployment europe today. i intention deny that.but, particularly condition prevail today, confidence continuity 9bis review 35/1999calculability policy important feverish activity. hence forward-looking,steady monetary policy ecb aim right approach term ofeconomic activity well. pursue entire business cycle, policy result inrelatively low interest rates.needless say, continuity signify immobility. but decision must take onthe basis thorough longer-term analysis detail monitor requisite dataand facts. of course, monetary policy must also take due account happen inother policy areas. but clear responsibility, clear priority, own. and ittherefore cannot party negotiation policy maker alliance pact anykind.viwithout doubt, structural deficit labour market many country euroarea constitute serious problem. they must addressed. otherwise, significant successeswill register field employment. the basic thrust adjustment issubstantially known. they must direction great flexibility, great personalresponsibility great differentiation, policy maker naturally need ensure thatthe process socially cushion balanced.to tackle challenge pose one time, are, theory, alwaystwo possible approaches: coordinate agreement competition. it may, course, makesense european country try find common solution labour-market andemployment problem (always provide point right direction). such jointagreements might perhaps enhance acceptability “unpopular” measure individualcountries. but one cannot certain that. it might alternatively throw undue strain oneuropean integration. in particular, might pose difficulty real world: point ofdeparture various country often differ distinctly. moreover, approach mightblur responsibilities. and might encourage unwelcome centralisation direction ofbrussels.in final analysis, all, country always conduct employment policy.it tackle problems. but nowadays, course, political solution alwaysembedded global competition. well, feature competition respond fasterand others slowly. that case, too. enhance effectiveness labourmarkets zero-sum game one country lose job another gains. rather, itis way achieve durable overall employment gain europe. here, countrymust go way. the netherlands definitely one country haveaddressed problem promptly than, say, germany. but country stand still,loses ground. this happen competition. however, curse, ratherthe blessing, competition.viithere doubt euro open many option europe’s future, range fromless dependence exchange rate large effective financial market lowercosts. but le true that, follow advent euro, demand make onthe participate countries, economy policies, risen. now euro hasarrived, policy maker actually choice accept demands. the monetary bi review 35/199910union must engender internal conflict within community. that soimportant country continue meet obligation maastricht treaty full,and, particular, national fiscal policy disciplined. the ecb, late monthlybulletin, therefore rightly call full compliance stability growth pact.in one respect, maastricht treaty take different path envisage thewerner report 1970. although monetary policy conduct supranationally, fiscalpolicy, despite monitoring, remain national hands. this imply vulnerable flank,which protect actual common orientation member states, especiallythe large ones. after convergence criterion already interpret generously forsome country time entry monetary union, essential slow down,let alone stop, fiscal convergence process.for one cannot rule possibility monetary union, too, run stormy seassome day. in long run, hard time probably demand community spirit fromall participate countries. and demand great capacity act takedecisions eu. this make important rectify present politicaldeficiencies set stage soon political “community spirit”. not senseof political super-state, rather clear distribution responsibilities, thecapacity take political action european level.though aware political deficiency procedure rules, i fully appreciate thecurrent capability exist european institution great support theintegration process. in particular, i welcome fact recent summit europeancouncil berlin reach – besides financial agenda – agreement two importantissues: the council take quick clear decision nomination president ofthe next european commission full mandate. and council reaffirm itscommitment include democratic state central eastern europe integrationprocess. in presidency’s conclusion said: “enlargement remain historic priorityfor european union.” nevertheless, priority call reform thecommunity. otherwise, observer may get impression that, discussions, littleseems change past thirty years.as long ago summit meet the hague 1969, tension enlarge anddeepening community perceptible. at time, like today, head ofgovernment link enlargement community reform area agriculturalfunding. and, long ago that, didn’t dare take step towards clear definition offunctions, towards clear new decision-making structure, able respond quickly andsubject unambiguous parliamentary control. it seem almost like miracle that, thesame, community since grow fifteen member states, actually introduce a(hitherto successful) euro eleven country begin year. give theseachievements, community must rest laurels.the common currency impart new momentum european integration. due advantagemust take stimulus. i much hope euro mark end, butrather beginning, ongoing european integration naturally shrink fromfurther enlargement. a clear basic orientation improve ability act takedecisions essential prerequisite development. europe must suffer fateof dinosaurs. 11bis review 35/1999 1bis review 34/1999mr sabirin discus recent development indonesian economypresentation dr syahril sabirin, governor bank indonesia, banque de france, paris inmarch 1999.good evening, lady gentlemen.it great pleasure today kind invitation banque de france, tohave opportunity share recent development indonesian economy. thefinancial economic crisis experience indonesia since july 1997 indeed dramatic andtraumatic. but many step take reverse situation establish conditionsfor stabilization return economic growth. we launch continue implement aneconomic recovery program, design reverse situation, also establish strongerfoundation sustainable growth future.let begin give brief description factor demonstrate progresshas indeed make which, result, allow make positive assessment ofthe indonesian economy. first, value indonesia’s currency, rupiah, clear indicatorsuggesting bad crisis believe over. a may know, pre-crisis levelof around rp 2,430 per us$ early july 1997, rupiah weaken reach low rp17,000 june 1998. this represent loss 85% rupiah’s value bad point. noeconomy could survive hard blow without serious harmful repercussions. one firstpriorities therefore strengthen stabilize value rupiah. a result, sharpvolatility rupiah early 1998 gradually wan due action deter speculative attacks.the monetary authority’s strict discipline support imf international financialinstitutions play important role, push rate range rp 7,500–8,000 end-1998. despite recent weaken currency associate rumor china’sdevaluation, brazilian devaluation, scatter domestic problems, rupiah shownits resilience, signify improve confidence indonesian economic performance andprospects. from mid-october 1998, rupiah move upward downward within range ofonly around 13%. indeed, bank restructure program, detail implementation ofwhich announce week ago, late piece economic recovery program thatcontributed improve confidence.now, let turn macroeconomic indicators. gdp suffer sharp decline aftermath ofthe fall rupiah’s value. indonesia’s gross domestic product, grow 7% perannum decade 1997, grow 4.9% 1997 contract 14% in1998. this contraction due primarily sharp decline production, private investment andlower household consumption due steep depreciation rupiah high interest rate thathad introduce stop free fall currency. we confident, however, rapidfall gdp growth checked. for 1999 economy still post negative growtharound 2% 3% year year, economy estimate positive growth 2000.another important indicator, inflation, show even positive trend. during bad point inearly 1998 indonesia’s inflation rate reach almost 13% one particular month alone, dramaticrise 1997 level 10.3% whole year. in response, adopt tight monetary policy,and work tight discipline adhere preset target monetary aggregate day-to-day basis. these efforts, together policy action secure supply basic necessities,have rewarded. the monthly inflation rate start decline ‘normal’ level lastquarter 1998. we even record negative inflation rate 0.3% october.i also attribute increase confidence bank indonesia’s anti-inflation policy muchimproved transparency conduct monetary policy. begin second quarter 1998we regularly announce, weekly basis, crucial monetary aggregate data compare bi review 34/19992to preset targets. these data, well much information, available everybody toaccess website.in june 1998 recognize concern foreign lender bank system agree toallow foreign bank opportunity exchange loan indonesian state private bankswhich already mature mature prior 1999 new short- medium-term loansguaranteed bank indonesia. this measure demonstrate immediately foreign lender theguarantee put place operative government’s determination tackle problem.at time, recognize trade finance arrears build someindonesian bank currency financial turmoil prejudice current access byindonesian entity trade finance across entire economy. we agree settle arrears andhave pay due amount. most recently, december 1998, clear additional arrears. this was,we believe, important signal international bank community. in addition, banksthat agree maintain trade finance activity indonesia, agree guarantee newtrade finance facility year receive confirmation banks’ commitment.turning briefly corporate sector reluctant enter discussion itscreditors, also agree june 1998 set agency, indonesian debt restructure agencyor indra, provide foreign exchange protection borrower renegotiate theirdebts creditors. strengthen borrower reduce residual foreign exchangerisk improve creditworthiness, thereby create incentive complete restructuring. theseefforts follow jakarta initiative september 1998 aim set rightframework incentive bilateral debtor/creditor negotiations.these measure combined, real money pay foreign creditors, particular bybank indonesia, show real determination resolve current situation. indeed support hasbeen prove expenditure large sum scarce foreign exchange resourcesreflecting high priority give subject. i would urge you, therefore, adopt reflexivereduction activity indonesia. instead, please focus system place theopportunities open within new strengthen framework.another important point i would like mention high level capital-backingrequired jurisdiction new lend indonesia. we believe level provision areexcessive constitute great hindrance resumption activity economy.let also take opportunity share development bank restructuringprogram. it secret pre-crisis indonesian financial system unhealthily fragile andvulnerable external shocks. we certainly underestimate vulnerability domestic

long term?address donald t brash, governor reserve bank new zealand, northernclub, auckland 25 march 1999.introductionmr chairmantoo often, reserve bank and, i suspect, financial markets, incline losesight longer-term, strategic, issue relevance monetary policy. we get preoccupiedwith whether official cash rate really set 4.50 per cent rather at4.25 per cent, detail endure significance real economy life ofordinary new zealanders. i don’t want imply short-term tactic irrelevant – farfrom – much le relevant longer-term issues, particularly theofficial cash rate explicitly review regular basis.so today i want address question, what new zealander expect monetary policy inthe long term?the monetary policy framework profoundly democraticthe first point note answer question answer depend parliamentwants monetary policy deliver. it sometimes suggest reserve bank seem alaw unto itself, don brash seem run country. nothing could thetruth. in new zealand, reserve bank subject act parliament, parliament canchange legislation simple majority. this also true australia, unite kingdom, theunited state many countries, course, true much europe(where european central bank creature maastricht treaty) countrieswhere central bank give essentially unlimited independence constitution.moreover, act parliament require that, within general directive prescribe act,the governor bank must sign write agreement treasurer set quiteexplicitly governor must achieve term office, so-called policytargets agreement. that agreement change mutual agreement time thegovernor’s term office, override order-in-council government want achange governor not.so monetary policy deliver year ahead essentially matter public,through parliament, determine. the reserve bank i bank’s governor heldaccountable performance deliver objective government parliamenthave chosen, requirement produce regular monetary policy statement appearregularly finance expenditure committee parliament.having say that, long present act remain place least, government notchange objective lay monetary policy without tell public. in words, anychange objective must totally transparent and, give inflation essentially form oftheft, seem entirely appropriate. all seem profoundly democratic, make clearthat reserve bank don brash servant parliament.since 1989, reserve bank act make clear monetary policy must use achieveand maintain ‘stability general level prices’, mean define bi review 33/19992policy target agreement. the present agreement, sign i reappointed governor atthe end 1997, define ‘stability general level prices’ mean monetary policyshould aim keep inflation measure cpi exclude credit charges, cpix,between 0 3 per cent 12-monthly period, though agreement also recognisesthat circumstance inflation may legitimately allow fall outsidethat range.but what, i often asked, happen election? fundamentally, depend thenext parliament decides. it inevitable anything (related monetary policy) changeafter election. almost political party record support present legislation,and indeed support present 0 3 per cent target. while policy target agreementcould change agreement governor new treasurer, nopresumption occur. consistency continuity attractive monetary policy aselsewhere, i shall certainly promote change. it perhaps worth note othercentral bank price stability objective quantitative inflation target target thatfall within 0 3 per cent range – best knowledge, none falloutside it. but, repeat, parliament decide final analysis.the present policy target agreementwhat present policy target agreement imply way reserve bankwill formulate monetary policy year ahead? without go great detail, mean thatwe aim keep cpix inflation close midpoint 0 3 per cent target one totwo year ahead.we aim close midpoint recognise that, uncertain fast-changing world,aiming midpoint maximise chance able keep inflation targetrange. aim near either edge target would run high risk unexpected shockswould throw u outside target.and aim keep inflation near midpoint quarter next, one two years’time, recognise monetary policy impact trend inflation overthis kind time horizon.it follow implement policy would principle will accept prospect ofinflation outcome close edge target, conceivably even outside target, thenext quarter reasonably confident inflation would back near centre ofthe target within one two years. clearly, lightly sanction breach agreedtarget – indeed, utmost avoid breaches, either side target – topretend time circumstance keep inflation within target would beto promise deliver. indeed, learn mid-nineties.as aside, reasonably certain headline inflation, cpi include interest rates, willfall zero several quarter year. in 12 month december 1998, headlineinflation 0.4 per cent, low level several decades. we expect 12 months‘increase’ negative shortly.but important nobody misunderstand significance this. have headlineinflation figure go zero breach policy target agreement, itwas breach headline figure rise 4.6 per cent mid-1995. the inflation target thepolicy target agreement explicitly define term cpi exclude interest rates, thevery good

indeed, widen target 0 2 per cent to0 3 per cent end 1996, inflation outcome much 1998 would beenrather uncomfortably close top band. on basis, certainly hard argue thatpolicy 1996 tight.but mistake past, i indicated. and mistake thefuture. without crystal ball, quite inevitable, give huge amount uncertainty whichsurrounds way policy must necessity implemented, namely look forwardone two years.there uncertainty economy begin projection. the projectionwhich publish last week finalise 1 march, yet late comprehensive data wehave economic activity quarter finish five month earlier, know thatdata quarter may revised, revise again, many quarter come. of course, wetry hard offset problem study large number up-to-date statisticalseries, talk score business country, talk audience manyparts country, assess implication several survey business consumerconfidence, ask seven non-executive director assessment economy.as i remark previous occasion, i sometimes suspect god make economic forecastersto make weather forecaster look good, least weather forecaster look windowand see weather like today! economic forecaster luxury. 7bis review 33/1999there also great deal uncertainty ‘how economy works’, word abouthow people business react circumstances. for example, late projection assumethat household expenditure grow slowly economy grow early 1998recession grow recession 1991/92. we make assumptionbecause people carry great deal debt, relative incomes, case adecade ago. we assume take rather le additional debt next fewyears. that seem entirely reasonable assumption, course nobody know withcertainty, particularly give low interest rate kind prevail beenexperienced new zealand many years. there perhaps even uncertainty ‘whatlies around corner’. will u share market continue rise next year two,stabilise present levels, fall substantially? the answer question, haveviews doubt, almost certainly material bear growth u consumerspending potentially therefore world economic growth. but formulate monetarypolicy basis u share market correct downwards, not? similarly fordevelopments japanese economy. even within new zealand, may kind oftotally unpredictable events. another drought perhaps? unlikely surely, certainly notimpossible.all source uncertainty mean that, look back way monetarypolicy formulate march 1999 vantage point of, say, 2002, seem likewell-founded decision finalise decision official cash rate last week mayseem hard justify. because delay monetary policy action effect thataction real economy and, effects, inflation,

(indeed, publish considerable information model whichour projection based.) this help market interpret new information emerges, toadjust monetary condition even adjust official cash rate. of course onlyworks financial market participant understand objective monetary policy newzealand and, basis track record last decade more, understand also thatwe commit deliver objective.what mean practice

possible that, figure december 1998 quarter gdp release thegovernment statistician tomorrow, show growth exactly 0.6 per cent. possible, butunlikely. but important sense doesn’t really matter. not ample time usto adjust policy long mis-assessment slight relevance inflation thesecond half next year, financial market may adjust condition within minutesof announcement. thus december quarter gdp figure turn appreciablystronger bank projected, see market relevant inflationoutlook, monetary condition might well tighten quickly. and vice versa. this precisely whathappened, example, announcement gdp figure march quarter 1998 atthe end june, june quarter end september, september quarter nearthe end december. in case, monetary condition move broadly appropriate direction. bi review

jmcdonough, 29th annual bank symposium, bank financial analystsassociation, new york city, 17 march 1999.good afternoon. i please today discus change nature banking, riskand capital regulation. with new millennium horizon, seem particularly fittingtime discus key trend affect way banker supervisorsthink issues. also, i’m sure many aware, basle committee onbanking supervision currently engage fundamental review accord, thecornerstone exist capital standards. in many ways, change nature bank andits risk lead supervisor revisit current capital framework, i welcome thisopportunity provide perspective risk relate future ofcapital regulation generally.in last several years, witness increase diversity complexity ofbusinesses bank engaged. while lend deposit-taking still themainstays majority commercial banks, many bank grow derivativestrading, security underwrite corporate advisory businesses. some bank haveexpanded traditional credit product line include asset securitizations creditderivatives. still bank greatly increase transaction processing, custody orasset management businesses, pursuit fee income.looking forward next century, i believe see major stride area isuggest call “e-finance”. more bank venture relatively new world on-linepc bank expand electronic bill presentment pay services. bank bemotivated overcome obstacle system incompatibility consumer privacyconcerns, achieve great operate efficiency protect valuable paymentsfranchise. go forward, on-line purchase sale security individual also willcontinue increase, produce grow source commission financial institutions.for banks, development mean increase diversity andcomplexity risk exposed, including, limit to, credit, market andoperational risks. the challenge bank develop risk management systemsthat rigorous comprehensive, yet flexible enough address new risk takeon expand le familiar product areas. today, i would like highlight risksand focus important bank integrate risk management capitalplanning processes. also, i would like focus change nature bank ischallenging supervisor rethink approach capital regulation supervision.despite change bank last years, many already beendiscussed today, credit risk remain predominant risk banks. however, credit riskclearly extend beyond conventional credit product loan letter credit. today,banks take credit risk form margin lend transaction over-the-counter derivative market expose large amount counterparty risk bedifficult measure. they also may engage take credit risk subtleforms. the short-term credit risk future brokerage, clear broke standsbetween customer exchange, often underestimated, substantial, credit bi review 32/19992risks arise settle foreign exchange contracts, examples. credit risk also may existin complicated, le conventional forms, credit derivative tranche ofsecuritized assets.market risk also remain prominent. the upheaval global fix income equitiesmarkets last year lead great deal volatility spread asset price andcaused large swing bank profitability. these event demonstrate world doesn’tnecessarily work way think did, correlation market thatwe previously think unrelated. a bank continue expand global tradingoperations, need understand relationship market increases. this challengeis amplify technological advance financial product innovation contribute toever-more complex market instruments.but clearly, bank expose credit market risk. operational risk alsois grow concern bank industry. the loom issue year 2000 remediation isjust one example. with continue diversification banking, fast pace financialinnovation grow concentration crucial payments, settlement custodybusinesses, importance operational risk rising, especially many large institutions.these institution find probability financial loss result breakdown ininternal control system great ever. a bank expand new line business,such electronic banking, trend likely continue. for instance, consider risk abreach electronic security control lead unauthorized access confidentialcustomer information. should breach severe pervasive, could lead toconsiderable legal reputational problem bank. further, overall rapid pace oftechnological change area mean substantial risk obsolescence.these risk bank must manage, clearly list i set forth isnot exhaustive. in particular, consider bank emerge market country subject aunique set risk result finance investment cycle countries. thosebanks fund domestic asset foreign currency may particularly susceptibleto liquidity risk sharp fluctuation exchange rate market turbulence make itdifficult retain source financing.while i present major risk separate discrete, recentlyhave discover are, fact, inter-related. for instance, see market riskfrequently drive credit risk. in second half last year, saw turbulence fixed-income market produce severe liquidity solvency risk hedge fund marketparticipants. also, learn credit risk may derive operational risks,embedded complex system manage collateral intra-day funding, whichrequire rigorous internal control environments.regardless nature form risk, best way bank protect toidentify risk correctly, accurately measure price it, appropriately control maintainhigh level reserve capital, good time bad. however, many bank notfinding easy develop holistic approach assess manage many inter-related risk face. a particular challenge relate risk assessment appropriatecapital levels, especially give dynamic nature businesses. 3bis review 32/1999before i discus bank tackle issue, let first consider role ofcapital generally relate risk strategy.fundamentally, role capital act buff unidentified, even relativelyremote loss bank may incur future. a bank must hold enough capital cushionboth depositor senior lender losses, leave bank able meet theneeds customers. bank must maintain capital commensurate amount risksthat take hold enough weather financial storms, time severe andof considerable duration. bank low equity capital ratio high variability ofoperating earn prove particularly vulnerable financial distress.however, bank hold capital overcome distress, also providesthem financial flexibility. bank strongly capitalize take advantage ofgrowth opportunities. also, strongly capitalize bank good able promote innovation,whether form new products, new service new distribution channels. this notjust capital resource issue, human resource issue. bank manager able focuson business banking, strategy competition, rather financial difficulties, cancreate innovate and, therefore, add value shareholders.banks also hold capital sign strength customers. clearly know betrue depositor retail side, equally true wholesale side. when aninstitution corporation enter letter credit guarantee swap contracts, need tobe confident bank around three five years, maturity contract.a bank well capitalize credibly state customer client makegood promise pay. more more, client recognize differentiate amongvarious bank basis. a financial service converge competitive pressuresincrease, bank find must vie capital, domestic foreigncounterparts, also investment funds, asset management firms, investment bank andinsurance companies.this equally true emerge market bank find must compete withinternationally active bank previously think solely domestic markets.these bank recognize adequately capitalize institution necessary, notsufficient, condition compete globally attract international fund clients. it willbe challenge banks, particularly high-risk profile opaquefinancial statements, prove clients, counterparties stakeholder areoperating safely soundly.in face increase competitive pressures, bank focus attention onthe role capital, capital level targets, relate strategic plan andobjectives. many bank also spend time assess risk profile andevaluating amount capital need cope adverse outcome normal time andunder reasonable stress scenarios. the sophisticate bank process ofdeveloping internal system methodologies, include formal analytical models, thatenable better. some bank rely capital allocation methodologiestypically use price performance measurement across business product line asa basis analysis. these methodology frequently incorporate different kind ofvolatility-based measure include view unexpected loss, along subjectivemeasures risk. while many system methodology still early stage bi review 32/19994and require refinement, i encourage development, hope assessmentof capital adequacy continue primary focus risk management bankinginstitutions.the senior management bank take evaluate adequacy oftheir current capital levels, also appropriateness capital structure. ideally, thisanalysis would lead process integrate decision business strategy, risk profileand future capital needs.as bank become good identify quantify risks, wellpositioned enhance risk disclosure inform investor fully. while bank investorsultimately bear risk institution, frequently good position tomake knowledgeable business decision bank’s prospects. certainly, investor lesswell inform bank management. in many countries, account disclosure standardsdo provide user financial statement necessary information appropriatelyassess risk determine soundness. a lack transparency discourage capital fromflowing efficiently and, effect, reduce even destroy value.however, positive note, i encourage progress numerous country promotedisclosure transparency, instance regard non-performing loans. the baslecommittee bank supervision, committee global financial system, theinternational account standard committee organization put forthinitiatives enhance relevance, reliability comparability information disclose bythe financial sector. the important initiative national government toapply account transparency frameworks, well voluntary disclosure offinancial institutions.now i discuss change risk environment bank respond tothat challenge, let turn mean current regulatory capital regime.today, major challenge regulator develop capital standard address morecomprehensively full range risk bank institution exposed. thesestandards must also improve differentiation among high-risk low-risk exposure andbetween weak strong institutions. additionally, must flexible enough toaccommodate risk new emerge activities, i mention today.as know, primary tool capital regulation currently set minimum capitalratios devise 1988 basle committee bank supervision. they wereset forth agreement know basle accord, adopted, among reasons,to address slide international capital level occur decade ago. whilethese ratio relatively basic, prove effective achieve goal overthe last decade.over years, risk management approach evolve rapidly, basle accordhas evolve relatively slowly. a market risk management technique developed, wereable incorporate state-of-the-art value-at-risk approach, 1996 market riskamendment. a credit risk management technique advanced, new discipline ofoperational risk emerged, become apparent long-run relevance efficacyof basle accord wan sophisticate institutions. 5bis review 32/1999supervisors long know analyze simple capital ratio isolation lead toincorrect conclusion relative strength institutions. thus, also rely ona review banks’ capital plan market discipline ass bank capital adequacy. aswe go forward, bank supervisor build capital framework three pillar –capital supervision, capital regulation market discipline – look strengthen eachof them.let start capital supervision. the cornerstone supervisory review bank’sprocess assess overall capital adequacy relation risk profile strategyfor capital level structure. supervisor believe review evaluate bank-internal capital adequacy assessment strategies, addition bank compliance withregulatory capital ratios. the good bank’s capital adequacy assessment, good thesupervisor understand bank’s capital strategy. inevitably, aspect take greaterimportance. for one reason, supervisor expect bank operate minimum regulatorycapital ratio include basle accord – prudent assessment help inform byhow much. for another, supervisor seek intervene early enough prevent capital fromfalling prudent level – bank assessment provide another useful tool inidentifying key issue become major problems. with think mind,supervisors tackle challenge develop systematic approach reviewof capital adequacy.supervisors also discuss way enhance market-based discipline. most agree thereshould great role private-sector monitor banks. of course, already existsa fair amount market-based monitoring; however, collection use kind ofinformation usually systematic complete. the first goal improve informationavailable market. with enhance risk disclosure, supervisor able relyon opinion market investors. these opinion reflect quickly price bankdebt share prices, ease bank access capital. by rely onthese market signals, supervisor good able identify address wan capitallevels problem institutions.to extent bank develop discipline internal approach evaluate capital adequacyand capital plans, enhance

minimum bank choose operate. to achieve this, mustfashion set standard greatly distort incentives.supervisors acknowledge current regulation ratio need update moremeaningful, give full range risk bank face today. supervisor always challengedto keep pace financial innovation improvement risk management practices, andthis suggest need frequent monitor maintenance program presentand future accord.in closing, i would like summarize key supervisory objective mindful aswe look revise accord enhance overall capital framework. our first objective,of course, promote safety soundness financial system. our second toenhance competitive equality, allow difference among bank base bi review 32/19996differences risk profiles. these original goal accord. our third todevelop standard fundamentally

sector-specific approach. however, pace change market financialintermediaries bring process global financial integration increasinglyexposed limitation approach. the establishment joint forum onfinancial conglomerate represent initial response dichotomy fragmentedsupervisory structure increasingly integrate markets. the rationale behind anapproach apply comprehensive manner.there three aspect this: firstly, overcome separate treatment micro-prudentialand macro-prudential issues; secondly, bring together major international institution 3bis review 21/1999and key national authority involve financial sector stability; thirdly, integratingemerging market closely process.ultimately, process strengthen cooperation make significant contribution toa good function financial markets. this make possible full utilisation theconsiderable benefit free capital movement provide participant globalfinancial system.3.areas improvement neededrecent event international financial market highlight three area whichimprovement needed.firstly, strengthen effort necessary help identify incipient vulnerability nationaland international financial system concert procedure need betterunderstanding source systemic risk formulate effective financial, regulatoryand supervisory policy mitigate them.secondly, effective procedure require ensure international rule andstandards best practice develop implemented, gap standard areeffectively identify filled.thirdly, improve arrangement necessary ensure consistent international rule andarrangements apply across type significant financial institutions, proceduresexist continuous flow information among authority responsibility forfinancial stability.some elaboration area follows.3.1identification incipient vulnerability concert effort mitigate systemic riskrecent event underscore importance assess domestic vulnerability thelight evolve global condition vice versa, relay assessment torelevant party forestall delay correction inadequate structure ofdestabilising trends.while national authorities, ifis, international regulatory body centralbank group gather ass data segment whole internationalfinancial system, regularly monitor aspect financial system stability, none thebreadth information capacity formulate complete assessment evolve risks.in view many source systemic risk arise, good procedure neededfor

fromfinancial market problems, threat chain reaction financial sector. this hasdemonstrated paramount importance mitigate systemic risk good understandingand alleviate factor bear it. disable shock global financial system canarise variety factor circumstances, include macroeconomic weaknesses, thecollapse major individual institutions, weakness infrastructure underpinsand connect financial

exist arrangement forthe supervision surveillance international financial system could strengthened.sweeping institutional change need realise improvements. instead, aprocess line mandate set motion ensure national andinternational authority group coordinate effort promote stability theinternational financial system improve function market order reducesystemic risk.the follow approach would appear suitable:the g-7 take initiative convene financial stability forum. such forumshould meet regularly ass issue vulnerability affect global financial systemand identify oversee action need address them. the forum would report tothe g-7 minister central bank governors. it would replace series ad hoc groupsthat convene g-7 past year view strengthen theinternational financial system.the forum limit size permit effective exchange view theachievement action-oriented result within reasonable time frame. in developingobjectives, priority programme action, forum would work members,taking account comparative advantages.the member forum would representative national international authoritiesresponsible question international financial stability. it would comprise ministriesof finance, central bank senior supervisory authority – initially g-7 countries. inaddition, ifis key international regulatory group would participate.representation high level (i.e. deputy minister deputy governors,deputy head ifis, chair appoint member international groupings).given need forum manageable size, national representation would belimited three members; ifis (imf ibrd) would represent two participantseach, international organisation (bis oecd) one member each; theinternational regulatory group (bcbs, iosco iais) would represent twomembers each, cgfs cps one each. participation could time bi review 21/19996extended include representative small number additional (i.e. non g-7) nationalauthorities could contribute substantially process, invite attendmeetings guests.the chairperson appoint personal capacity period time isadequate ensure continuity work forum. experience would seem indicate aterm le three years.i would like suggest appointment mr andrew crockett, general manager bis,for term three years.the forum would meet often need achieve objectives. initially two meet ayear could envisaged. the first meet forum could hold spring 1999.the forum could ask member form work group order facilitate work oraddress specific ad hoc issues. a permanent “chairman’s group” compose therepresentatives ifis international regulatory group and, necessary, ofnational supervisor directly involve specific issue could meet around theforum’s meet coordinate follow-up activity forum’s outcome.support forum would provide small secretariat locate bi basle.members secretariat could

otherfactors, one good domestic demand. at early stage, actually theriksbank raise interest rate late autumn 1997, point out, however, thatthe international trend could weak assume main scenario crisiscould lead slowdown sweden well.the signal international slowdown would also affect growth sweden becameincreasingly clear. the riksbank therefore successively revise forecast downwarddirection

transparency contribute theefficient allocation resource ensure market participant sufficient information. – 2 –bis review 17/1999this information mean enable identify risk distinguish one

however, admittedly, limit transparency. some category ofinformation costly compile. in cases, infrequent disclosure may justified. further,confidentiality may warrant circumstances.in determine appropriate degree transparency, benefit must balance costs.transparency mean one-size-fits-all code this. of course, thefinal analysis, transparency reference factor consider relevant, itselfdepends model analysis consider useful. also, transparency give facts, butinference different matter judgment base inference yet another matter.personally, i believe transparency primarily best test good

decade crucial importance develop new economy andrevitalising old ones. when work smoothly, international capital flow help relieveshortages capital previously segment markets. they provide competitiveenvironment encourage innovation. and, afford good return investors, theyhelp put spare capital best possible use. we see value ownregion 1980s early ’90s, and, discuss problem create capitalflows, never forget specific beneficial functions.6. the second characteristic sheer volume capital movement around world. inapril 1995 global value foreign exchange transaction take place average daywas us$1.2 trillion. in april 1998 figure increase us$1.5 trillion, or, put moremeaningful terms, around 48 time daily value world trade. it also worth stressingthat largely private capital

telecommunication informationtechnology mean distance national boundary long importantrestraints. two consequence follow this. first, huge amount money movedinto economy short space time, move quickly. in 1996, 3bis review 35/1999for example, capital flow emerge economy asia rate aboutus$100 billion. by second half 1997 flow region half thatspeed. secondly, negation distance boundaries,

fullyprepared, everything go without hitch? i seriously doubt it. a discussed, agreat deal work already complete plan deal problem, somethingdoes slip cracks, experience failure ‘mission-critical’ systems? how woulda computer failure one area economy affect ability others continue operatesmoothly? how severe could consequence y2k problem emanate abroad? thenumber possible scenario type endless,

2000.what happen millennium roll over? a economist suggest y2k-relateddisruptions induce deep recession. that probably stretch, unlikely escapeunaffected. i anticipate isolate production problem disruption commerce,and perhaps public services, could reduce pace economic activity early 2000. asmentioned above, least mild inventory cycle seem likely develop. but, like theshocks nation’s

activity wouldprove long lasting, recession could conceivably ensue. but let quickly stress i donot think recession scenario high probability. it possible, lot thing haveto go wrong occur, much do prevent occurrence.now might appropriately ask feed representative monetary policy offset y2kdisruption. the truthful short answer ‘not much’. we can’t plow street deliver package andwe would unable reprogram nation’s computer 2000. the y2k problem primarily anissue affect aggregate supply side economy, whereas federal reserve’s monetarypolicy work mainly aggregate demand. we understand create

pact prevent national government use fiscal policy addressthese imbalances. however, implement correctly without undue delay, contrary istrue, compliance stability growth pact provision allow sufficient room formanoeuvre. the centrepiece budgetary provision respect member state themedium-term objective budgetary position close balance surplus. sound governmentfinances important strengthen condition price stability strong andsustainable growth necessary support employment growth. moreover, government achieve bi review 33/19994balanced budget normal period cycle, create safety margin, sufficient allowthe operation automatic stabiliser event slowdown, face unexpectedshocks, without risk excessive deficits.the problem moment euro area whole still far reach thetarget balance budget normal cyclical conditions. substantial structural imbalancescontinue restrict flexibility public sector budgets. in number countries, deficit-to-gdp ratio remain close 3% value set treaty reference excessive deficits,rather medium-term balance surplus position envisage stability growthpact. recent fiscal consolidation rather disappointing. a significant increase overalldeficits, instance response decline real gdp growth rates, could reverse theprogress see recent year reduce deficit-to-gdp ratio across euro area.moreover, case prolong growth slowdown, quite possible deficit willquickly reach excessive levels.so clear utmost importance government make structural improvementsto fiscal positions, would allow regain sufficient flexibility budgetsand, importantly, could effectively contribute support stability growth euroarea. however, despite desirability achieve room manoeuvre swiftly, onlymoderate fiscal consolidation currently envisage medium term. a number stabilityprogrammes aim attain necessary flexibility relatively late date, thisis assumption sustain economic growth low interest rates. it important wesee commitment policymakers ensure swift achievement aim goingbeyond aim envisage programme economic growth pick up.the role longer-term structural reformsthe important area national flexibility relation structural policies.indeed arguable many important challenge face euro area country canonly address national policy area. a march 1998 convergence reportof european monetary institute already identified, urgent need last policyadjustments arise from:• high persistent unemployment largely structural nature;• demographic trend expect place heavy burden future publicexpenditure; and• high level public debt, weigh current budget many memberstates debt level reduced.to start first long-term economic issue, i turn attention contribution thatstructural reform euro area labour market make reduce high level ofeuropean unemployment. a i do comparison euro dollar, let usagain contrast development europe unite states. in 1970unemployment unite states, around 4%, actually significantly high mosteuropean economies. since then, although mark variation usunemployment rate course economic cycle, apparent long-term trend, unemployment rate stand 4.4% january 1999. in contrast, averageeuropean unemployment steadily rise path. the unemployment rate theunited state europe appear broadly converge early 1980s, since thattime unemployment rate unite state eu average. even though theeuro area unemployment rate fell last year, january 1999 figure 10.6% thandouble correspond u rate. 5bis review 33/1999looking late unemployment rate around euro area – range 2.8% inluxembourg (january 1999) 3.6% netherlands (december 1998) 17.8% spain(january 1999) – suggest policy must develop national level. what neededappears national structural reform make sustainable reduction unemployment ratherthan boost euro area aggregate demand. moreover, make labour market flexible canalso make easy cope short-term imbalance demand.however, situation euro area labour market uniformly bad. some countries,particularly flexible labour markets, moderate wage increase lessdiscouraging tax social security policies, manage avoid trend ever-risingunemployment. for example, netherlands, ireland, portugal, austria luxembourg allcurrently show unemployment rate well euro area average. there also example ofother country high unemployment rates, spain, begin take step toreform labour market begin see tangible results. we also look atsome non-participating member states, denmark unite kingdom, seethat high unemployment reduce structural reforms.the need structural reform widely recognised, instance oecd job study atthe november 1997 luxembourg european council meeting, progress new policymeasures already made. first, ‘active labour market measures’ provideeducation, train work experience – particularly target long-term unemployed.second, reform ensure tax social security system make people significantlybetter work it. third, measure ensure low-productivity workersare force labour market. these include reduce burden tax non-wagelabour cost make sure minimum wage scheme collectively bargain wageagreements take account need preserve jobs. i would also wish add that, contraryto suggestions, policy amount ‘competitive devaluations’, structuralreforms wage moderation ‘zero sum game’. they help generate net increase inaverage employment criticise ‘wage social dumping’.the second long-term economic issue i like address today need prepare thesubstantial financial consequence age european populations. on basis currenttrends birth rate life expectancy, unfunded public pension healthcare schemesgenerate high implicit government liability euro area countries. indeed, manycases implicit liability appear magnitude dwarf even largeofficial government debt levels. unless action take quickly, financial burden fallon future generation taxpayer may also threaten soundness government finances.therefore, prepare age population, substantial save need made.the third key issue need make progress reduce high government debt-to-gdpratios substantially increase past two decades. whilst someimprovement run-up start emu, recent progress disappoint theaverage debt-to-gdp ratio euro area fell slightly 73.8% 1998, compare with74.6% 1997. such imbalance undesirable also wide implication theconduct monetary policy. if doubt soundness fiscal policies, caninfluence effectiveness monetary policy instruments, undermine credibility ofmonetary policy.in addition long-term economic issue mention far, i also like emphasisethat structural reform agenda available national government promote economicdevelopment extend well beyond reform labour market public finances. for example,national government take step promote entrepreneurship make easy people bi review 33/19996start run business thus create new jobs. this could involve encourage competitionthrough measure promote entry new firms, reduce administrative burdensthey face, make market competitive facilitate access venture capital.governments also liberalise previously highly regulate sectors, utilities, increaseefficiency reduce price benefit industrial household user services.national government may also wish take step raise productive investment research anddevelopment increase growth expand high-tech industries.the introduction euro common monetary policy certainly renderednational government impotent. with ability vary fiscal policy undertake structuralreforms, national government retain key power address real need theireconomies. if term stability growth pact adhere to, sufficientflexibility allow automatic stabiliser work event slowdown. structuralreforms provide mean achieve last reduction unemployment, preparingfor age population reduce burden government debt. nationalgovernments would well advise press ahead reforms. apart theirown merits, policy would also support ecb maintain price stability theeuro area. 1bis review 32/1999mr greenspan discus financial derivative risk entailspeech

daunt individualcounterparties underlie exposures, presumably swap would never havebeen initiated. moreover, credit risk increasingly subject comprehensive nettingand margin requirement that, although fully remove risk, significantlyameliorate it. and far bank concerned, capital requirement apply risksas loan create credit risk quite similar derivatives.hence, although one may harbor concern overall capital adequacy bank andtheir degree leverage, little distinguish concern risk-adjusted on-and off-balance sheet claims.the one area risk need think so-called potential future exposure. at anyparticular point time small fraction notional value derivative contract arein money – is, positive market value. because price doubtless change inthe future, contract negative even positive value

kingdom bear name, researcher unitedstates soon find similar relationship.7 by early 1960s macroeconomist regard 4see, example, friedman (1956).5 these idea also find similar inquiry time unite kingdom (the radcliffereport) unite state (the commission money credit). however, somedifferences argumentation three reports. for example, radcliffe interventionistwhile porter strong advocate market mechanisms.6porter commission report, p. 434.7phillips (1958), samuelson solow (1960). bi review 30/19994the phillips curve description policy trade-off inflation unemployment.by accept inflation,

canadianinterest rate thereafter tightly constrain objective maintain dollar atthe parity 92.5 u.s. cents.14with respect longer-run policy objectives, know today, fix exchange rateimplied monetary policy canada would mainly determine unite states.however, prevail opinion among economists, reflect porter report, thatcanadian monetary policy could nevertheless serve constructive short-run purpose withrespect range macroeconomic policy objectives, long currency fix ata reasonable value government adequate reserve foreign exchange.at time, policy-oriented economist draw sharp distinction dobetween fix float exchange rate regimes. to understand this, recognizethree factors. first, canada’s float exchange rate regime 1950s – wasthe post-war experience industrialize world go – variation exchangerate quite modest, movement canada-u.s. interest rate differentials.that is, practice, float appear different fix rate regime.second, focus short-run output employment, policy-makers tend

domestic considerationsshould prevail, exchange rate parity allow change. but reopenthe debate exchange rate, topic heat political controversyearlier decade. by 1964, time report published, view canadianauthorities much fix exchange rate system appropriate, theexisting parity right range. 13in part view stem theory inflation emphasize non-monetary factors, e.g. costpush, union seller power, demand shift, struggle income, on.14exchange control eliminate early 1950s. the canadian dollar would remain fixeduntil june 1970.15robert mundell time make contribution would form standard modernmodel open-economy policy analysis. see mundell (1961, 1962, 1963). bi review 30/199964. monetary policy instrument transmission mechanismboth porter commission bank submission describe transmission ofmonetary policy action term effect credit conditions. by credit conditionsthey mean “the whole range term condition affect borrow lend thepurchase sale financial assets.”16 this would include, importantly, interest rates,but also standard creditworthiness, collateral, repayment periods, term andconditions.in general, whereas bank canada17 stress importance availability effects, theporter report incline give central place interest rates. one reasonswhy bank canada put much emphasis credit availability time because,even apart 6 per cent bank loan rate ceiling, believe wide fluctuation ininterest rate feasible. indeed, historical experience quite narrow range ofinterest rate movements. for example, prime lend rate charter banks, key ratein transmission mechanism, never low 4.5 per cent, maximumlegal rate 6 per cent – range 150 basis points. there simply much scopefor borrow cost vary.as outline commission bank, number possible reason thisbelief wide movement interest rate feasible: possibility instrumentinstability (with interest rate swing abruptly), potential effect sharp change insecurity price stability financial institutions, adverse public opinion, theexternal constraint pose fix exchange rate. while commission agree someof concerns, nonetheless argue consideration stand wayof vigorous monetary policy.the porter report accepted, however, description put forward bank canada ofthe way monetary policy affect operation charter banks. the provision cashreserves bank canada would bring change charter bank hold ofliquid assets, time would affect banks’ willingness make loans. however,when quick result deem necessary, bank felt resort direct limit banklending would justified. on several occasion moral suasion employ inthe 1950s, seem work. the commission show little enthusiasm suchintervention. it argue control impair market efficiency, discriminatory, wereof diminish effectiveness time. there also concern clumsiness,especially

conventional belief ordinary monetary policy action werenot effective. and major reason insistence policy package theright mix fiscal monetary policy, plus coordinate debt management policy, thepossible need moral suasion and/or sort direct control bank lending.5. the role debt managementi note package macroeconomic policy advocate 1960s tendedto include debt management policy along fiscal monetary policies. certainly, centralbankers day regard debt management policy integral part macroeconomicpolicy. the porter report sympathy notion. there three discerniblelines think here.first, monetary policy kind debt management open market operationswitching one public sector liability (central bank deposits) another (e.g. treasury bills).second, change relative supply debt could affect liquidity bank hencetheir willingness lend. third, debt management might directly alter term structure ofinterest rates.these notion may great plausibility time, indicationsof segment markets. but time, market segmentation diminish importance bothlenders borrower become increasingly will adjust maturity theircommitments response interest rate difference across term structure. moreover, inthe year follow publication porter report, evidence accumulate support theexpectations theory term structure interest rates. accord theory, long-termrates average expect value future short-term rates, plus liquidity risk premium.although principle latter could vary systematically composition debt changes,in practice effects, exist all, short duration anymacroeconomic impact.c. the canadian policy framework in the 1990s1. the basic propositionsbetween 1960s 1990s, inform opinion appropriate role centralbanks shift radically. the current mainstream view briefly summarize thefollowing four propositions.first, main objective monetary policy preserve value money, wordsto achieve low rate inflation long run. other economic objective notignored, however, price stability best contribution monetary policy canmake towards high employment and, generally, towards prosperous, growingeconomy. second, independent monetary policy, or, precisely, domestically setobjective inflation, logically require float exchange rate. third, markets, pricemechanisms, work efficiently thus provide effective channel transmission 18johnson winder (1962) reuber (1962). bi review

contrast view policy objectivesthe sharp apparent contrast idea practice i sketch twoperiods concern objective monetary policy. nowadays focus job centralbank squarely single objective price

bestcontribution monetary policy make achieving, time, multiple economicobjectives espouse porter. desirable economic outcome never guaranteed, butchances achieve best inflation low stable. that is, low inflation isan indispensable asset achievement economic goals.20consider, example, accept view 1960s exploitable trade-off inflation unemployment. along short-term perspective policy-makers, view lead excessively easy monetary fiscal policy industrialcountries. in canada, find confront enormous destructiveinflation, peak mid-1970s begin 1980s, another bout ofupward pressure late 1980s. moreover, high rate inflation accompany byan economic slowdown 1970s (reflected coin term “stagflation”) andwere follow unusually sharp economic recession early 1980s early 1990s.the idea exploitable long-run trade-off inflation unemployment waseffectively demolish experience. and lesson reinforce success thefirm stance favour price stability take german japanese central bank thelate 1970s. 19the bank long concern restrain inflation. what lack past thesupport theory experience make focus precise explicit. public milestone inthe evolution bank’s view three lecture predecessors: 1966 per jacobssonlecture louis rasminsky objective monetary policy mechanism itoperates; 1982 per jacobsson lecture gerald bouey, highlight need “place tostand” or, words, “nominal anchor”; 1988 hanson lecture john crow, whichsingled price stability objective monetary policy canada. also, i would draw attention togerald bouey’s final annual report, 1986, emphasize cost inflation difficultyof reduce entrenched.20for full explanation relation price stability economic objectives, seethiessen (1998-1999). 9bis review 30/1999the inflation 1970s early 1980s demonstrate costly inflation andhow

maintain low rate inflation.3. understand role exchange rate monetary policyas i explain early lecture, commission prepare report, neitherthe current economic theory canadian experience 1950s provide strongevidence crucial role exchange rate flexibility play operation monetarypolicy open economy like canada’s. when float exchange rate 1950 andagain 1970, push peg rate pressure risingcommodity price associate strong inflow capital. the notion national monetarypolicy independent inflation target feature decisions.as see it, float exchange rate play two key roles. in first place, longrun float currency allow central bank pursue national inflation target, regardlessof behaviour foreign inflation. in second place, variation currency allow thereal exchange rate, hence economy, adjust smoothly international shock torelative prices.it currency capital control begin remove (or increasinglybypassed) post-war period, domestic financial market become deregulate ina number countries, economist come appreciate fully interaction domesticinterest rate exchange rates. in open economy unhindered capital flows, onlywhen real exchange rate move level widely expect appreciate ordepreciate domestic real interest rate temporarily move away internationalcounterparts.furthermore, understand much clearly day movement realexchange rate major part process whereby economy return

need deviate itstarget path. in contrast, fix exchange rate, domestic price would fall belowthat path, perhaps fall absolutely, bring require decline real exchangerate. it clear real exchange rate adjustment work much smoothly thenominal exchange rate adjust. however, benefit exchange rate flexibility berealized, expectation nominal exchange rate must anchor monetary policythat focus maintain low stable inflation medium term.4. increase confidence resilience efficiency marketsit would unthinkable 1960s suggest central bank’sinfluence interest rate was, itself, enough enable keep rate bi

ordirect control see important additional instrument central banks.a key reason change attitude today increase confidence markets. certainly,at central banks, confident 1960s ability financialmarkets absorb change interest rates. at time, accumulate strongevidence support view market mechanism transmit monetary policy actionseffectively.in 1960s porter commission ahead bank, conventional wisdom, inthis. it envisage monetary system key respect would function much today– drive market forces, flexible, frequently undergo rapid change. in itsrecommendations reform, commission look forward world whichmonetary policy would increasingly reliant effectiveness appropriate movementsin financial market prices.in line view, porter report maintain institution market wellable withstand substantial

achieve macroeconomic objectives. in one colourfulphrases, report warn “the authority must restrain excessivetenderness.”21however, present confidence market question philosophy. since the1960s, variety legislative structural change make financial sector still moreresilient flexible. this make transmission monetary policy efficient andhas eliminate residual concern inability market cope

convergence within europe past decade.the eurosystem’s monetary policy strategy treatythe treaty european union, commonly refer maastricht treaty, assign europeansystem central bank (escb) primary objective maintain price stability euro area.in order give clear guidance expectation future price developments, govern councilhas announce quantitative definition primary objective. this clarify treaty’smandate interpret govern council give public european parliamentclear guidance concern assessment success single monetary policy.price stability maintain medium term. it define

rate inflation, accord recent availabledata, 0.8%, measure harmonise basis, consistent definition price stability. itshould also emphasise monetary policy single one therefore bi review 26/19992indivisible – definition. monetary policy decision must base euro area-wideconsiderations, rather national considerations. a simple may sound, commentate onour monetary policy always appear grasp principle.monetary policy need forward-looking, medium-term orientation. monetary policy andshall react every change information produce almost daily basis. itwould over-ambitious therefore risky try steer economy short term. fine-tuningwould likely lead instability stability. to maintain price stability, choose adistinct monetary policy strategy, one reflect special circumstance exist present aswell likely prevail foreseeable future. the eurosystem’s stability-oriented monetarypolicy strategy ensure much continuity possible former strategy ncbs. at thesame time, give due

even well design fully successful monitor price stability – cannot solveeurope’s economic problems. appropriate structural reform implement national governmentsare utmost importance. much progress

europeanunion unite states, particular regard flexibility labour market incentivesto create accept new jobs.monetary policy decision outlook price stabilitysince start year govern council take follow main monetary policydecisions. in december 1998 govern council ecb announce level intereston main refinance operation would 3%. since then, govern council keep rateunchanged, judge serve best maintenance price stability.the 12-month growth rate broad monetary aggregate m3 increase 5.7% january 1999from 4.5% december 1998. this increase mainly due rapidly grow overnight deposits,which account around one-third m3. the three-month move average m3 (for period bi review 26/19994from november 1998 january 1999) increase 4.9%, is, slightly announcedreference value 4½% per annum. in view

however,monetary development need monitor closely come months.with regard broadly base outlook price development risk price stability, newinformation indicator future price development economic

february 1999 report 0.8%, previous month. the currentlow inflation rate partly due substantial reduction energy price past half year, whichhave diminish somewhat recently. decrease unit labour cost also make significantcontribution.in summary, outlook price stability remain favourable and, now, identifiedany significant upward downward pressure price short term. on downward side, theslowdown euro area economy cause concern. on upward side, increase wagepressure relaxation fiscal stance could adversely affect prospect future pricestability. furthermore, recent exchange rate development also need monitor closely inview impact prices.in absence strong upward downward pressure price developments, maintain thecurrent stance monetary policy appear justified. the govern council therefore decide lastweek next two main refinance operation condition apply mainrefinancing operation settle early year. this mean fix rate tender conduct atan interest rate 3.0%. interest rate applicable

eurosystem’s relationship european community institutions, treaty statesthat president ecofin council member european commission may participatein meet govern council ecb, right express view

successfully fulfil mandate treaty, maintain price stability theeuro area, contribute international role euro.allow say word certain proposal make ongoing public debate, mightsuggest focus monetary policy shift towards objective pricestability. some suggestion seem imply eurosystem react le automaticallyto exchange rate movement specific variables. just doctor cannot stop fever byholding

therefore, deliberately exclude kind ofexplicit implicit exchange rate objective target monetary policy strategy.nevertheless, eurosystem’s stability-oriented monetary policy strategy take account theexternal value euro one, potentially important, determinant outlook price stability.if development pose threat price stability euro area, threat assessed.however, factor impart information price

would reason low ecb’s interest rates,which might then, turn, help counteract part prior exchange rate movement.but set exchange rate target might, example, imply central bank increase itsinterest

capital export andinvestments go largely country link share language, culture, legal system andaccounting regimes. another hypothesis may that, period lead world war i, thecommitment policymakers stable monetary fiscal policy highly credible marketparticipants, perhaps reflect share belief commitment gold standard.the policymakers’ challenge today build strong institutional structures, policy

absolute scale global financial market increasing,the size bailout package need fill finance gap international crisis getprogressively large become le feasible assemble. in addition, policymakers must always beconcerned moral hazard appear stand ready help private sector debtor andcreditors escape problem making. finally, i believe must achieve goalswithout attempt step back policy regime prior period clearly unworkable orthat undermine advantage know come free flow capital.so policy solution meet criteria? in overview, i would say probablyare grandiose new solution need implement policy response today’sglobal financial turmoil. rather, i see emphasis basic, sound practices.the need sound institutional underpinningsone lesson suggest pre-1914 period relative stability capital flow importance ofbroadly understand accept institutional arrangements. country wish participate themodern global financial market need modernize institutional underpinnings. several actionscome mind. first, basic underpinnings private property protection need place. thelegal system need define support enforceability contracts. for example, whileinternational bankruptcy procedure seem feasible, adoption improvement nationalbankruptcy system essential high priority. debtor creditor alike need tohave understand rule private sector default resolve andconfidence rule consistently applied. i put high priority bankruptcyprocedures provide self-adjusting mechanism allow private sector tocontinue function even world financial crisis likely occur. various plan toimprove international financial

information facilitatesmarket discipline, strengthen confidence, improve decision make reduce chance thatrumors mislead information could cause instability national global markets. also, byfacilitating market discipline, public disclosure help reinforce supervisory effort encourage banksand company maintain sound risk management practice internal controls. for thesereasons, federal

financial policiesa second lesson history recent experience policymakers must follow sound crediblemacroeconomic, microeconomic financial policies. in particular, necessary condition fiscaland monetary policy are, perceive be, responsible. a see thecrises hit global financial markets, particularly public sector origin,heavy short-term borrow governments, couple fiscal imbalances, recipe forfinancial market crisis. credibility come monetary policy aim achieve price stability,avoiding either general increase decrease price levels, fiscal policy avoid imbalancesand unsustainable public sector debt deficits. in short, absence external control onfiscal monetary policy, policymakers politician must act great deal discipline.however, also know, particularly asia, fiscal monetary rectitude sufficient.many country strong fiscal position sound monetary policy, still suffer frominternational financial uncertainties. microeconomic financial policy must also credible. thepolicies responsible allow free market work without undue bi review 25/19994intervention governmental authorities. we learn governmental influence privatesector borrow invest decision avoided. this true because, theresearch shown, large portion cross-border investment modern era appear insectors financial performance valuation asset hard gauge. in thosecircumstances hint governmental support certainly avoided.recently propose creation “target zones” major currencies, presumably orderto create, part, great stability global financial markets. i think proposal unlikelyto work. we see several occasion scale resource require authority tomove exchange rate direction support fundamentals, market perception ofthose fundamentals, enormous effect term exchange rate movement relativelysmall transitory. if monetary policy use maintain exchange rate within target range,authorities time may choose maintain domestic price stability currencytarget. most monetary policy authority recognize value maintain price stability one ofthe requirement create sound macroeconomic condition sustainable domestic growth. forthe major countries, benefit explicit focus exchange rate stability, rather pricestability sustainable growth, clear.i believe policymakers support great transparency report ownoperations, well private sector activity i discuss above. good timelyinformation promote good allocation resources, include global allocation capital. thefinancial crisis last several year indicate great transparency need level ofexternal debt, include short-term foreign currency debt central government, level ofinternational reserves, include financial derivative positions. for transparency standard mosteffective, require broad participation authority possible. further, must balancethe

financial system. in modern context, i believe findinghas two corollaries. first, must avoid block capital flows, particularly long-term funds.there policymakers advocate capital controls. i need give group ofbusiness economist lesson basic economics, outside room need tobe remind benefit free capital flows. even though current international financial troublesindicate risk free flow capital, benefit substantial contributeimportantly rise standard living. a know, individual country’s pool save doesnot always equal pool investment opportunities. if border close flow capital,interest rate would adjust equilibrate domestic save investment, investmentopportunities, might attractive international standards, might go unfunded lessattractive domestic opportunity would funded. with free flow capital, country agreater pool highly productive investment opportunity benefit inflow capital andthose export capital put save better, reward use. this presume theinstitutional underpinnings outline above.protectionist impulse measure impede flow goods, service managerial know-how must also avoided. while participation free exchange across border create industry 5bis review 25/1999and individual

thereby increase stock good service available u all.conclusionlet conclude say current era globalization quite distinct periodprior world war i, important lesson learn early era. somehistorians argue pre-1914 era notable size relative stability capitalflows. thus far era notable size international capital flows, recently forthe stability. i doubt room improvement regime determine capitalflows. however, i think solution challenge world face requirebuilding institutional mechanism policy expertise allow reliance strength freemarket system. improvement policy discipline, information sharing,

inevitable benefit costs, key question bothfinancial policymakers market participant is: how retain benefit rapidtechnological financial innovation free movement good financial capitalacross national borders, simultaneously protect financial institution marketsfrom risk change might bring? this new question, i sure thatmost audience well aware many effort way public andprivate sector address variety issue question evokes. a always, areno simple answers. but i believe number fundamental principle emerge thatshould use help shape public private policy practices.private market discipline be first line defenseperhaps fundamental principle must guide u private market participantsare first line defense excessive private public risk financial system.private borrowers, lenders, investors, institutions, traders, brokers, exchanges, clearingsystems huge stake contain risk individual agent risk thesystem whole. private market participant discourage excessive risk take bychoosing business firm demonstrate sound risk management systemsand portfolio balance appropriately risk expect return.if private market go perform risk control functions, market price mustsend right signal participant risk reward particular transactionor give firm. in order improve ability market price accurately reflect risksand returns, i believe take action encourage action others atleast three areas. bi review 23/19992first, seek way improve transparency financial institution andmarkets. a know, full information fundamental requirement free andcompetitive markets. more particularly, financial institution individual investor must bewell inform counterparties’ exposures, nature new financialinstruments, extent overall market liquidity. i believe bank financialinstitutions could significantly improve disclosure provide information themarket risk management policy practice value internalrisk measures. at present, market seem grant great weight bank regulatory capitalratios crude indicator institution’s risk profile. that attention drive inlarge part fact regulatory measure provide consistent basis comparison.the regulatory financial community work together identify meaningfulstatistics meet market’s needs.at international level much work done, much remains. one key lessonsof recent financial crisis international account public disclosurestandards often inadequate. an important step forward publication last novemberby international basle committee bank supervision guideline enhancingbank transparency. that report provide guidance bank bank supervisor aroundthe world nature core disclosure provide public. much more,however, do provide public supervisor information needto exert effective market discipline.a second area could improve market discipline affect marketparticipants view come know too-big-to-fail problem. in regard, iwould emphasize fdic improvement act 1991, fdicia, contain rather toughlanguage too-big-to-fail – language i assure board take seriously.perhaps would useful review briefly law says. fdicia require that,regardless size bank, bank resolution method choose fdic leastcostly possible method meet fdic's obligation protect insure deposits. inaddition, fdicia prohibit fdic assist uninsured depositor creditors, orshareholders insure depository institution. add fdicia provision thedepositor preference provision omnibus budget reconciliation act 1993, youhave rather potent reason market discipline deal insureddepositories.the exception obligation so-called “systemic risk exception.” but thesystemic risk exception quite tough explicit. it require concurrence two-thirds ofthe federal reserve board, two-thirds fdic board, secretary treasury inconsultation president conformance least-cost resolution would “haveserious adverse effect economic condition financial activity” fdic isallowed “take action provide assistance necessary avoid mitigate sucheffects.” in addition, systemic risk exception used, insurance fund loss arisingfrom exceptional action must recover special assessment alldepository institution member relevant federal deposit insurance fund. lastly,the comptroller general must subsequently review agencies' action report itsfindings congress. the sum total condition establishes, view, rather highhurdle must clear systemic risk exception used. 3bis review 23/1999the fdicia reform have, i believe, alter market perception too-big-to-fail.nonetheless, obvious need central bank government agency preventa systemic collapse bank financial system, creation seemingly ever-largerfinancial organizations, inherent uncertainty involve management anycrisis leave room doubt observers’ minds. perhaps nature anissue never fully resolved. but seem clear institution, regardlessof size, fail

trichet éclaire le condition du succès de l’eurodiscours de jean-claude trichet, le gouverneur de la banque de france, à la conférence de labanque centrale de hesse tenue à francfort le 22/2/99.monsieur le président, madame et messieurs, c’est un grand plaisir et un honneur pour moid’intervenir ici, à l’invitation de la landeszentralbank de hesse et du center financial study del’université de francfort, en compagnie de conférenciers aussi remarquables. aussi je tiens à vousremercier de donner l’occasion d’évoquer avec vous l’union monétaire européenne et l’avénementde l’euro.il un peu plus d’un mois, s’est produit un événement unique dans l’histoire de l’europe. l’euro estné et le caractère irréversible de ce changement convaincu un nombre croissant d’acteurs de la scènepolitique et économique que le succès de l’euro était une nécessité pour l’europe et le reste du monde.il représente la clé de voûte du marché unique européen qui assurera la prospérité en europe. mais,pour rendre ce succès durable, nous allons devoir affronter, aujourd’hui et demain, un certain nombrede défis.les banques centrales sont au cœur du passage à l’euro, à la fois au niveau européen et au sein deleurs économies nationales. c’est pour cette raison que je souhaite attirer en particulier votre attentionsur le trois point suivants :- premièrement, l’union économique et monétaire repose sur de fondations théoriques etéconomiques solides et profondes qui ont permis une introduction réussie de l’euro sur le marchésde capitaux ;- deuxièmement, la zone euro devra relever un certain nombre de défis si elle veut rester une zone destabilité monétaire où la croissance est durable ;- troisièmement, le succès de l’euro contribuera largement à l’avènement d’une situation monétaireinternationale plus équilibrée.i. l’uem repose sur de fondations solides et profondes qui ontpermis, il y a un peu plus d’un mois, une introduction reussie de l’eurosur le march de capitauxle 31 décembre 1998, le chef d’état et de gouvernement ont adopté le taux de conversionirrévocables de l’euro vis-à-vis de monnaies de onze pay qui avaient été qualifiés pour participer àla zone euro. cette étape historique correspond à l’avènement de l’union économique et monétaire.les progrès impressionnants qui ont été réalisés, en matière de convergence économique, dans lesannées qui ont précédé cette décision, ont contribué de façon déterminante à ce processus. afin dedonner une orientation aux marchés de capitaux, la méthode de détermination de taux de conversionirrévocables de l’euro avait été décidée à bruxelles, le 3 mai 1998.au total, c’est une idée tout à fait fondée qui est à l’origine de la création de l’euro; en outre, cettecréation constitue le couronnement d’un long processus économique et politique (a). de travauxpréparatoires approfondis ont également contribué au succès de l’introduction de l’euro sur lesmarchés de capitaux (b).a. l’uem repose sur de fondations solides et profondes1. la création de l’union monétaire et de la monnaie unique n’est pa un concept récent et abstrait,fruit de l’imagination de quelques uns. bi review 22/19992le traité de maastricht est l’aboutissement d’une série d’initiatives importantes qui appartiennent déjàà l’histoire de l’europe. le rapport werner, élaboré au début de années soixante-dix, introduit leconcept d’union économique et monétaire. le traité de maastricht été négocié, signé et ratifiéd’abord par le douze premier pay puis par le quinze pay de l’union européenne. je rappelleraique treize pay l’ont approuvé sans aucune réserve.2. le bien-fondé de l’uem repose sur le avantages économiques qu’une monnaie unique apporte àl’ensemble de l’europe.l’union européenne (pays hors zone euro compris) compte au total 370 million d’habitants,représente près de 20 % du pib mondial et 21 % environ du commerce international (échanges intra-européens exclus) contre quelque 17 % pour le états-unis et 10 % pour le japon. le avantagesinhérents à la taille même du marché unique sont évidents. il permet à l’ensemble du secteur productifde réaliser d’importantes économies d’échelle et d’affecter l’épargne aux investissements le plusrentables. il renforce également la transparence du marché et il stimule la concurrence dans l’intérêtdes consommateurs.de ce point de vue, la monnaie unique représente le couronnement du marché unique. l’objectif finaldu marché unique ne pouvait être atteint tant que de obstacle monétaires continuaient d’entraver lalibre circulation de biens, de service et de capitaux par le biais de coûts de transaction et derisques de change intrinsèques. demain, no concitoyens bénéficieront de tous le avantages liés àl’utilisation d’un même instrument monétaire dans tout le continent européen, comme c’est le casaujourd’hui de américains sur tout le territoire de états-unis.les avantages de la monnaie unique sont nombreux.la monnaie unique réduit l’incertitude et facilite le décisions d’investissement et de production. ellepermet une juste comparaison de prix à travers l’europe et réduit le coûts de transaction. la zone dela monnaie unique serum caractérisée par la stabilité de prix et un faible niveau d’inflation. cesfacteurs, à leur tour, maintiendront et renforceront la confiance tout en procurant à l’économieeuropéenne un environnement financier favorable.la simple existence de la monnaie unique permet d’emprunter davantage de capitaux dans demeilleures conditions, sur de marchés plus larges, plus profonds et plus liquides.3. la mise en place de l’euro couronne parfaitement le processus de l’uem étant donné qu’elle estfondée sur le respect strict de critères de convergence et sur la stabilité de prix. la convergencedes états membres vers le meilleures performance économiques en est la conséquence.selon un dicton français, il ne faut pa bâtir sur le sable. c’est pourquoi le traité de maastricht ainstitué de critères de convergence auxquels le pay doivent se conformer durablement pourparticiper à l’union monétaire.a cet égard, j’aimerais souligner la performance de la france. la france compte parmi le trois paysqui ont satisfait rigoureusement aux valeurs de référence de tous le critères de maastricht,notamment celui en matière de dette publique. notre stabilité de prix et le ba niveau de no tauxd’intérêt à long terme nous ont placés parmi le trois pays, avec l’allemagne, ayant présenté lesmeilleurs résultats : conformément au traité, no résultats, avec ceux de deux autres économies, ontpar conséquent servi de référence à l’évaluation de ceux de l’ensemble de pays. la banque de francea contribué — directement et indirectement — à ce résultats, en mettant en œuvre une politiquemonétaire indépendante et crédible.a ce propos, je souhaite mettre en avant un point très important. en édifiant une union monétaire, lespays européens n’ont pa seulement fusionné leurs agrégats économiques, commerciaux, financier et 3bis review 22/1999monétaires, faisant de la zone euro un partenaire de premier ring en term de population(290 million d’habitants), de taille du pib, de commerce international ou de masse monétaire : il ontentrepris de créer une zone solide et stable. en fait, l’union monétaire n’est pa une simpleaddition arithmétique de résultats économiques nationaux. elle été créée en prenant commeréférence le performance réalisées par le pay ayant présenté le meilleurs résultats entermes de stabilité monétaire. l’union monétaire est donc composée de pay dont le résultatsmonétaires et financier ont convergé vers ceux de pay dont le monnaies sont le plus stable et lesplus crédibles.l’objectif de autorités monétaires de la zone euro est la stabilité monétaire. le traité de maastricht aconféré une mission claire au système européen de banques centrales (sebc) nouvellement créé,celle de maintenir la stabilité de prix. le sebc est totalement indépendant de autorités nationaleset européennes dans la poursuite de cet objectif.en d’autres termes, le banques centrales nationales sont indépendantes et leurs statuts sontcompatibles avec le traité. le sebc hérité de la crédibilité de banques centrales nationales despays dont le monnaies bénéficient de la meilleure réputation, c’est-à-dire l’allemagne et la france.les 13 octobre et 1 décembre 1998, la bce présenté la stratégie de politique monétaire qui seramise en œuvre durant la phase iii de l’union monétaire. cette stratégie assure la continuité avec lespolitiques monétaires de banques centrales nationales participantes :- la stabilité de prix est définie comme une progression sur un de l’indice de prix à laconsommation harmonisé (ipch) inférieure à 2 % dans la zone euro. la stabilité de prix doit êtremaintenue à moyen terme. définir la stabilité de prix permet également de mettre en oeuvre lesprincipes de transparence et de responsabilité.- un rôle de premier plan été assigné à la monnaie. ce rôle est souligné par l’annonce d’une valeurde référence quantifiée pour la croissance d’un agrégat monétaire large, à savoir m3. la valeur deréférence pour 1999 été fixée à un taux annuel de 4,5 %. il convient de noter que le concept devaleur de référence n’implique pa l’engagement pour le sebc de corriger de façon automatique lesécarts susceptibles d’apparaître à court terme entre la croissance monétaire et la valeur de référence.mais la valeur de référence pour m3 est compatible avec le maintien de la stabilité de prix à moyenterme et permettra de réaliser cet objectif.- le second pilier de la stratégie de politique monétaire est une évaluation d’ensemble de perspectivesd’évolution de prix dans la zone euro considérée dans sa totalité. il est dès lors important de suivreune large gamme de variable économiques et financières comme indicateurs de l’évolution future desprix.la décision coordonnée, prise en décembre, de ramener le taux d’intérêt à 3 % permis à la bced’annoncer que le nouveau niveau de taux d’intérêt prévaudrait “ dans un avenir prévisible ”.la politique monétaire unique ne peut à elle seule assurer la stabilité de prix si elle n’est pasaccompagnée d’une discipline budgétaire appropriée dans l’ensemble de l’union économique etmonétaire.pour part, je citerais trois justification économiques aux disposition du traité qui ont donnénaissance au pacte de stabilité et de croissance.premièrement, en coordonnant le politiques budgétaires de états membres de l’union monétaire, lepacte permet de doser de façon convenable le politiques monétaire et budgétaires (policy mix) au seinde la zone euro. cet élément est essentiel pour la politique monétaire. étant donné que l’europe nedispose pa d’un budget fédéral important, tout comme elle n’est pa dotée d’un gouvernement bi review 22/19994fédéral, la somme de budget nationaux doit servir de budget global pour l’ensemble de la zone euro.cette situation rend nécessaire une surveillance mutuelle étroite et la coordination de politiquesbudgétaires au sein de la zone.deuxièmement, par le biais de l’instauration d’un système de sanction financières en ca de déficitsexcessifs, le pacte permet d’éviter que le économies bien gérées aient à supporter de prime derisque injustifiées.troisièmement, le pacte de stabilité nous permet de réfuter l’affirmation selon laquelle la zone eurone dispose pa de stabilisateurs automatiques en ca de choc asymétriques subis par un état membre.en réalité, en incitant le états à viser à moyen terme une situation budgétaire proche de l’équilibre ouen excédent, le pacte leur permet de laisser s’accroître le déficits budgétaires durant le récessionssans dépasser la valeur de référence de 3 %. bref, il leur permet de se constituer, durant le périodeséconomiques normales, un volant de sécurité budgétaire auquel il peuvent recourir pour résister à unchoc asymétrique.b. le préparatifs technique approfondis ont permis l’introduction réussie de l’euro sur lesmarchés1. d’un point de vue technique, le passage à l’euro au cours du dernier week-end de 1998 été uneréussiteau cours du week-end de passage à l’euro , le sebc suivi le déroulement de opérations deconversion à la bce, dans le banques centrales nationales participantes et dans le principauxétablissements. de échanges réguliers d’informations ont eu lieu par l’intermédiaire d’un réseau depoints de communication entre la bce et le bcn. il n’a été signalé aucun incident susceptibled’entraver le démarrage sans heurt du système, qui ainsi pu débuter normalement s activités le4 janvier, à l’ouverture de marchés.ces résultats témoignent de la qualité de préparatifs auxquels se sont livrés la communauté desbanques centrales et le opérateurs privés de marchés de capitaux, ce derniers mois et années. pource qui concerne la communauté bancaire et financière française, la fin de l’année dernière étéconsacrée à la planification et aux phase de test en vue d’organiser le basculement de marchésfinanciers au cours du dernier week-end de 1998. c’est grâce à ce préparatifs que le processus deconversion été un grand succès.2. ce préparatifs ont permis une introduction réussie de l’euro sur le marchés de capitauxle 4 janvier, l’introduction de l’euro s’est effectuée avec succès. depuis ce jour, l’eurosystème(c’est-à-dire la bce et le onze banques centrales nationales de états membres de la zone euro)assume la responsabilité de la conduite de la politique monétaire dans la zone euro en ayant commeobjectif principal le maintien de la stabilité de prix.nous pouvons aujourd’hui exprimer notre satisfaction devant la manière dont s’est réalisée latransition vers un marché monétaire intégré de la zone euro qui s’est mi en place dès le toutpremiers jours.s’agissant de l’évaluation fondée sur une large gamme d’indicateurs de perspective d’évolution desprix, le conseil de gouverneurs de la bce considéré, lors de sa réunion du 7 janvier, que lesévolutions sur le marchés de capitaux témoignaient d’un accueil favorable de récentes décisions depolitique monétaire de l’eurosystème, indiquant ainsi que le opérateurs de marché anticipaient lemaintien de l’environnement de stabilité de prix. 5bis review 22/1999pour faciliter l’intégration de marchés de capitaux nationaux, un accord portant sur le calcul et lapublication d’un indice de taux d’intérêt de opérations interbancaires été conclu ; cet indice,l’euribor, se substitue aux anciens index nationaux et couvre la gamme de échéances allant de 1 à12 mois. l’euribor est rapidement devenu la principale référence de court terme pour le opérationsen euro. le lancement d’un indice de taux d’intérêt au jour le jour, l’eonia, déjà montré toute saportée en donnant une représentation précise de condition du marché monétaire dans l’ensemble dela zone euro ; il constitue un repère très utile pour le opérateurs de marché et le agent économiquesainsi que pour la bce qui l’utilise comme référence dans une grande majorité de contrats etd’opérations.ii pour que le succès de l’euro soit complet, il faut relever uncertain nombre de défisl’introduction de l’euro constitue en soi une réforme structurelle majeure. mais elle ne seracouronnée de succès que si un certain nombre de conditions, notamment de réformes structurelles,sont remplies et si l’euro s’incarne dans le comportement de dirigeants du monde politique et desaffaires ainsi que dans celui de entrepreneurs, de consommateurs et, par-dessus tout, de nosconcitoyens.a. pour assurer le plein succès de l’euro, le pay européens doivent remplir quatre conditionsil quelques années, il fallu convaincre un grand nombre de sceptiques, tant en europe que dansle reste du monde, que le projet de l’euro était viable. nombreux étaient ceux qui en dénonçaient lesprétendues contradiction et incohérences : par exemple, l’impossibilité de doser de manièreconvenable le politiques monétaire et budgétaire en l’absence d’une fédération politique ;l’impossibilité d’éviter de “ choc asymétriques ” (c’est-à-dire de difficultés frappant l’économied’un pay membre de l’union et pa le autres) ; l’insuffisance de flexibilité et de mobilité réelle de lamain-d’œuvre dans le pay européens, etc. la conclusion était que l’euro ne se ferait jamais ! cescritiques ont été démenties par le faits. mais elles conservent toute leur utilité lorsqu’il s’agit derépondre à la question de condition à remplir pour une pleine réussite de l’euro. on peut ensouligner quatre :- en premier lieu, celle de la crédibilité de la politique monétaire garantie par l’indépendance de labanque centrale européenne, scellée dans le traité de maastricht et fondée sur l’indépendance dechacune de banques centrales nationales. pour être une monnaie crédible, l’euro doit inspirerconfiance aussi bien aux 290 million d’européens de la zone euro qu’aux non-européens aveclesquels nous faisons de affaires. cette confiance ne peut être gagnée qu’en résistant à toute forme depression, notamment politique, sur le mode de gestion de la nouvelle monnaie. le fonctionnementharmonieux de l’équipe monétaire européenne composée de la bce et de banques centralesnationales de onze pay fondateurs facilitera la réalisation de cette première condition.- en deuxième lieu, le respect de disposition du traité et de orientation du pacte de stabilité et decroissance en matière de politique budgétaire. la coordination étroite de politiques budgétaires et lasurveillance vigilante de “ pair ” au sein du conseil informel de onze états membres participant — ” l’euro 11 ” — et du conseil ecofin qui réunit le ministres de finance de 15 sont indispensablespour assurer un “ policy mix ” équilibré dans toute la zone euro. le respect de l’objectif à moyenterme de “ finance publiques proches de l’équilibre ou en excédent ” — il signifie que nul ne doitcéder à la tentation du déficit budgétaire individuel — est essentiel si l’union veut pouvoir faire facecollectivement à de périodes de difficultés économiques et si chaque pay veut pouvoir surmonterdes phase de détérioration de la conjoncture qui n’affecteraient que lui.c’est l’attachement de l’ensemble de gouvernements européens au pacte de stabilité et de croissancequi permis à la bce et aux banques centrales nationales de décider récemment de ramener le tauxd’intérêt à 3 % — une baisse de taux qui ne peut manque de soutenir la croissance. bi review 22/19996- en troisième lieu, tous le pay européens doivent résolument s’engager à entreprendre desréformes structurelles. l’europe continentale connaît un chômage élevé, même si celui-ci enregistréune légère décrue dans la plupart de économies concernées. selon le fmi et l’ocde, ce chômageest, à concurrence de près 80 %, de nature structurelle, c’est-à-dire qu’il est créé par le poids de nospropres règles et règlements. le conseil de la politique monétaire de la banque de france partagecette analyse. certains observateurs extérieurs reprochaient à l’europe, tout récemment encore, de sefocaliser sur l’euro au lieu de se consacrer à la tâche, plus urgente à leurs yeux, de mettre en œuvre lesréformes structurelles indispensables à une création plus dynamique d’emplois.ces critique avaient tort sur l’inopportunité de l’euro mais il avaient raison s’agissant du diagnosticsur le maux qui affligent l’économie européenne. l’euro, loin d’entraver le réformes structurelles,sera complémentaire de celles-ci. la monnaie unique facilitera le mouvements de biens, de serviceset de capitaux au sein de la zone euro, mais elle encouragera également la “ fertilisation croisée ” desmeilleures pratiques grâce au renforcement de la coordination entre le politiques de états membresdans de domaines tels que : marchés du travail, enseignement et formation, incitation au travail et àla création d’emplois, meilleure efficacité de systèmes de protection sociale etc.- en quatrième lieu, tous le responsables économiques d’europe doivent être lucides sur la questioncruciale de la compétitivité. la politique économique de la période antérieure à l’introduction del’euro consistait à surveiller la balance commerciale, la balance de paiements, le marchés de changeet de taux. le gouvernements recevaient ainsi en retour de information constantes sur lesprincipaux indicateurs de l’évolution de l’économie nationale et pouvaient agir en conséquence. avecl’avènement de l’euro, ce indicateurs ont pour la plupart disparu au niveau national, mais ilssubsistent naturellement au niveau de la zone euro. d’où l’importance de disposition du traité surla coordination de politiques budgétaires et de politiques économiques. néanmoins, le règles del’économie de marché continuent de s’appliquer à chacune de économies. le consommateurs créentdes emplois lorsqu’ils choisissent le biens et service qu’ils estiment présenter le meilleur rapportqualité/prix. le chef d’entreprise peuvent répartir ce emplois sur différents site et pay en fonctionde la compétitivité relative de ce sites. il faut donc que le dirigeants de chaque économie nationalesuivent plus attentivement encore qu’auparavant le indicateurs de compétitivité tels que l’évolutiondes coûts unitaires de production, de dépenses de entreprises, et l’environnement fiscal etréglementaire. contrairement à la période antérieure à l’euro, toute perte de compétitivité nes’affichera pa rapidement sur le écrans radar que sont le comptes extérieurs et le marchés dechange. le dirigeants doivent donc redoubler de vigilance sur le suivi de autres indicateurs. leserreurs de politique économique risquent, en effet, être sanctionnées d’une façon plus lente et plusinsidieuse, par la montée du chômage et le ralentissement de la croissance.b. le entrepreneurs, le consommateurs et l’ensemble de citoyens doivent s’approprierl’euro.- avant toute chose, l’indépendance monétaire, la sagesse budgétaire, le réformes structurelles et lacompétitivité de politiques économiques seront vaines si elles ne se traduisent pa dans lecomportement de agent économiques eux-mêmes, c’est-à-dire no concitoyens, — ménages etconsommateurs, mais aussi salariés, ingénieurs, entrepreneur individuels, chef d’entreprise. c’est,en particulier, la raison pour laquelle la banque souhaite délivrer aux entreprises un message trèsdirect : “ l’introduction de l’euro n’est pa une question tactique mais une question stratégique ”.avec le passage à l’euro, il ne s’agit pa seulement de remplacer une expression monétaire par uneautre et de réécrire de programme informatiques. c’est l’ensemble de fonctions de l’entreprise — industrielle, commerciale, financière, etc. — qu’il convient de réexaminer pour évaluer et mettre enœuvre le changements stratégiques nécessaires.les sociétés françaises font preuve d’un intérêt croissant pour le basculement à l’euro, créant desforums de discussion avec la collaboration du ministère de finances. de recommandations ont étépubliées concernant le comptes, le relation avec le service fiscaux et de sécurité sociale et la 7bis review 22/1999conversion du capital. diver disposition législatives ont été adoptées par le parlement, en 1998.elles offrent notamment l’option tout euro, à laquelle le entreprises ont accès depuis le 1 janvier1999.en france, le consommateurs ont été consultés principalement par l’intermédiaire du conseilnational de la consommation. ce consultation vont se poursuivre tout au long de la période detransition. parmi le tâches à accomplir, il reste à prendre de mesures pour venir en aide auxcatégories le plus vulnérables de la population, notamment le personnes âgées et à mener descampagnes d’information en direction de consommateurs. de nouvelles disposition serontégalement nécessaires pour permettre de suivre l’évolution de prix tant au cours de la période detransition qu’après le 1 janvier 2002, le entreprises devant fournir aux consommateurs desrenseignements complets et transparents afin que ceux-ci disposent de toute l’information nécessaire.les pouvoirs public en france sont également pleinement conscients de la nécessité de faireconnaître l’euro aux enfants de écoles, futurs utilisateurs de la monnaie unique.iii le succès de l’euro apportera une contribution majeure àl’amélioration de l’équilibre économique et monétaire mondialdans la situation économique globale actuelle, le succès de l’euro va beaucoup aider à la foisl’europe et le reste du monde, qui vont tirer profit de la prospérité et de la croissance européennes,éléments essentiels de la bonne santé de l’économie mondiale.il est clair que le nouveau cadre monétaire européen et aura de conséquences de grande portée nonseulement pour l’europe et sa population, mais aussi pour l’économie mondiale et la communautéinternationale. la contribution de la zone euro à la stabilité internationale peut être appréciée à l’aunedu développement de relation économiques équilibrées au sein de la zone euro et avec le paysextérieurs à la zone euro, et à celle du renforcement de la stabilité monétaire et financièreinternationale.a. l’établissement de relation économiques équilibréesa) le relation entre l’union monétaire et le autres états européens seront fondées sur lacoopération.la coopération se traduira principalement par la coordination de politiques économiques de 15états de l’union européenne. une telle coordination est requise par le traité et elle est nécessairepour que l’union européenne fonctionne de manière satisfaisante au niveau économique. il estimportant que le dialogue entre tous le états européens se poursuive, même si le passage à l’euromodifiera l’environnement économique traditionnel de l’union européenne ; c’est la raison pourlaquelle le groupe de l’euro 11, composé de ministres de finance de la zone euro, été constitué ets’est déjà réuni plusieurs fois. le dialogue entre tout le party concernées doit prendre en comptel’indépendance totale de la bce et l’objectif de la stabilité de prix qui, en vertu du traité, doitguider la politique monétaire de la zone euro.en particulier, la coordination entre le 15 pay permettra à ceux qui n’ont pa encore rejoint l’unionmonétaire de converger vers la zone euro. le nouveau mécanisme de change qui va li à l’eurocertaines de monnaies concernées (c’est le ca de la drachme grecque et de la couronne danoisedepuis le 1 janvier 1999) apportera sa contribution à ce processus. en favorisant la stabilité de tauxde change, le nouveau mce permettra le bon fonctionnement du marché unique et aidera le pays“ ” à se qualifier pour la monnaie unique.b) l’union monétaire aura aussi de relation étroites avec de pay extérieurs à l’unioneuropéenne. bi review 22/19998premièrement, l’union monétaire et l’union européenne constituent un pôle attrayant pour nosvoisins de l’europe centrale. le résultats atteints par certains d’entre eux au cours de ce dernièresannées témoignent de progrès remarquables. il doivent poursuivre leurs effort afin d’être capablesde rejoindre l’uem dans de bonnes conditions, ce qui est de leur intérêt et de celui de pay membresde l’union européenne.en ce qui concerne la coopération internationale, la zone euro va également jouer un rôle essentiel.elle représente une zone de stabilité et de croissance économique durable pour quelque 290 millionsde citoyens et elle aura certainement une influence déterminante au sein de la communautéinternationale. l’avènement de l’euro va faciliter la coopération internationale en matière économiqueentre le principaux partenaires : états-unis, japon et zone euro. chacun de ceux-ci est en mesure deparler au nom de régions dont l’importance économique est significative et qui sont exposées à desdegrés relativement similaires aux choc pouvant affecter le système financier international. c’estpourquoi l’euro devrait conduire à une relation plus équilibrée dans laquelle chacun de partenairesassumerait sa part de responsabilité dans la construction d’un environnement mondial stable.ce changement institutionnel majeur dans l’architecture du système monétaire international rendunécessaire une représentation internationale de l’eurosystème.c) la représentation internationale de l’eurosystèmele sebc est déjà représenté auprès de institution et de forum internationaux. même si certainesquestions sont encore en voie de règlement, de accord ont été conclus avec le fonds monétaireinternational (fmi), la banque de règlements internationaux (bri), l’organisation pour lacoopération et le développement économique (ocde) et dans le cadre du g7 et du g10. plusrécemment, le fmi accordé le statut d’observateur à la bce.le sebc bénéficie de bonnes relation bilatérales avec le autres banques centrales du monde entier.b .- l’uem renforcera la stabilité monétaire et financièrea) le rôle international de l’euroen ce qui concerne le rôle international de l’euro, je voudrais dire que le sebc adopte une attitude deneutralité.le rôle international d’une devise est une question complexe. une monnaie peut être utilisée pardifférents group d’agents économiques, dans diver desseins, comme monnaie d’ancrage ou commemonnaie de réserve d’une part, et comme monnaie de facturation et de règlement pour le commerceinternational ainsi que comme monnaie d’expression d’actifs financiers, d’autre part.en tout état de cause, le rôle de l’euro comme monnaie internationale dans s différentes fonctionsmettra du temp à se développer.en ce qui concerne la future part de l’euro dans le réserves publiques de change globales, peuts’attendre à ce que le banques centrales de pay hors zone euro réexaminent progressivement leurstratégie de gestion de réserves en fonction de opportunités de diversification offertes par lanouvelle monnaie. de plus, l’euro pourrait jouer un rôle accru de monnaie d’ancrage dans d’autrespays européens envisageant de li le taux de change de leur monnaie à l’euro.en ce qui concerne l’usage privé de l’euro, le agent économiques pourraient utiliser celui-ci pour seprémunir contre de risques en diversifiant la composition de leur portefeuille. si le investisseurs etles emprunteurs internationaux considèrent que l’euro deviendra une monnaie stable, il détiendrontdes actifs libellés en euro pour réduire au minimum le risques dans le cadre de la diversification 9bis review 22/1999internationale de leurs portefeuilles. en outre, un marché financier de l’euro large et liquide peutconduire à un usage étendu de l’euro, usage qui, en retour, pourrait faciliter son développement entant que monnaie de facturation ou de dénomination sur le marchés de produits de base . l’euro vaprogressivement accroître son rôle comme monnaie internationale utilisée par le secteur privé, mêmesi le rythme de son internationalisation peut être variable selon la fonction considérée.b) le relation de change de la zone euro vis-à-vis de principales devise mondialesen ce qui concerne le relation de change entre l’euro et le principales devise mondiales, à savoirle dollar et le yen, je pense qu’il ne faudrait jamais oublier ceci : dans un régime de change flottants,la stabilité du taux de change dépend de données fondamentales de l’économie. c’est pourquoi despolitiques saines et avisées dans le domaines monétaire et budgétaire sont le meilleurs garants d’unfonctionnement approprié du système monétaire international. il est encourageant, à cet égard, denoter que de deux côtés de l’atlantique, nous partageons la même optique globale au sujet d’unemonnaie qui conserve sa valeur et d’un budget tendant à être proche de l’équilibre ou en excédent. encomplément de ce données fondamentales saines, qui sont d’une importance décisive, nous devonspréserver le processus de la coopération internationale et nous devon renforcer cette coopération .elle s’est avérée utile au cours de ce quinze dernières années.en se fondant sur l’expérience et le enseignements de ce dernières années, peut probablementencore améliorer cette coopération internationale, et le fait que trois devise de pay du g7 se soientactuellement fondue dans l’euro pourrait et devrait rendre plus facile et de plus en plus efficace cettecoopération.dans cette perspective, j’aimerais attirer votre attention sur quatre principes, qui sont essentiels pourl’efficacité de la coopération internationale.- le premier principe dont nous ne devon pa nous écarter est le respect du fait que ce sont lesdonnées fondamentales qui commandent l’évolution de taux de change dans le moyen et le longtermes ;- le deuxième principe est la nécessité de recherche un consensus approprié entre le représentants dupouvoir exécutif et le autorités monétaires d’une part, entre le différents pay concernés d’autrepart ;- le troisième principe est le respect de ce que j’appellerais la discipline verbale. le marchés peuventêtre troublés par de déclarations hétérogènes et contradictoires. au contraire, il sont impressionnéspar la cohésion et par la cohérence de déclarations s’en tenant au plus près de “ term de référence ”agréés d’un commun accord ;- le quatrième principe est la nécessaire préservation de la crédibilité de autorités dans tout lescirconstances.durant ce dix dernières années, le communiqués du g7 qui délivraient un message commun relatifaux taux de change ont toujours fait l’objet de la plus grande attention de la part de investisseurs etdes marchés, et se sont révélés efficaces. il s’agit là d’un atout inestimable que nous devon préserveravec le plus grand soin.***en conclusion permettez-moi de souligner trois point : bi review 22/199910d’abord, en ce qui concerne la banque centrale européenne et le système européen de banquescentrales, j’aimerais proposer une métaphore qui pourrait éclairer mon propos. il une équipemonétaire européenne composée de douze joueurs, la bce et le 11 banques centrales nationales.c’est toute l’équipe monétaire de douze qui joue sur le terrain, avec un seul “ esprit d’équipe ”, quiconstitue un de atouts inestimables de l’europe.deuxièmement, le gvii de samedi à bonn nous permis de faire de nouveaux progrès dans lerenforcement de ce que l’on est convenu d’appeler l’architecture financière internationale. on aparfois un peu trop tendance, à mon avis, à insister sur le différences de sensibilité qui se manifestentici et là. ce qui est beaucoup plus important, c’est que la communauté internationale est en accordprofond sur de très nombreux points. qu’il suffise de mentionner ce dont nous somme convenussamedi dernier : importance de “bonnes pratiques” en matière de politique sociale, renforcement dela surveillance de institution à hauts risques, compris le “hedge funds”, création du forum destabilité financière, organisation de deux séminaires en mar et avril avec le pay émergents, réunionde préparation du comité intérimaire.je voudrais particulièrement souligner un point, à savoir le danger spécifiques qui sont associés au“comportement moutonnier”, ce que le américains appellent le “herd instinct” de opérateurs,investisseurs et marchés. ce “comportement moutonnier” caractérisé pendant le 18 derniers mois àla fois l’attitude de investisseurs vis-à-vis de économies émergentes en transition et certainementaussi le marchés de pay industrialisés eux-mêmes. le “comportement moutonnier” pourrait être unde no pires ennemis dans notre recherche de la stabilité financière internationale. selon moi, un desmeilleurs moyens de lutter contre ce phénomène est que chaque pays, chaque emprunteur et chaquesignature accepte d’être parfaitement transparent. seule, une transparence complète et fiable de toutesles entités, qu’elles soient publiques ou privées, permettra d’évaluer correctement le mérites dechacun de ca et de convaincre le investisseurs qu’il faut se méfier de raisonnements par analogie.“comparaison n’est pa raison” dit justement le proverbe.troisièmement, en ce qui concerne le niveau actuel de no taux d’intérêt, je voudrais attirer votreattention sur le fait que, dans tout le économies de la zone euro, le taux de marché s’établissent auniveau le plus ba observé depuis la seconde guerre mondiale. no taux à long terme, notamment,sont extrêmement bas, à 150 point de base environ en dessous du taux le plus ba qui avait étéobservé historiquement pour le dm ou pour le franc au cours de cinquante dernières années, ce quiconstitue une contribution importante à la préservation de la croissance et à la création d’emplois. letaux d’intérêt à trois mois sur le marché monétaire de la zone euro s’établit actuellement à 120 pointsde base au-dessous de taux moyens observés en octobre 1997. le taux d’intervention de la banquecentrale européenne est à 100 point de base environ en dessous de la moyenne de tauxd’intervention de banques centrales nationales de la zone euro. enfin, il est significatif que le tauxd’intérêt réels à court terme soient aujourd’hui, en europe, à 100 point de base environ en dessousdes taux d’intérêt réels à court terme prévalant aux états-unis. comme l’a rappelé wimduisenberg, au nom du conseil de gouverneurs de la banque centrale européenne, lors du gviide samedi, la politique monétaire contribue à créer un environnement favorable à la croissance et à lacréation d’emplois.n’oublions jamais que nous somme le responsables de la confiance dans l’euro de épargnantsd’europe et du monde entier. c’est parce que ce épargnants nous font confiance que nous pouvonsavoir de ba taux d’intérêt de marché. en résumé, c’est en inspirant confiance aux épargnants quenous pouvons insuffler confiance aux emprunteurs.la confiance dans l’euro, c’est notre bien le plus précieux. 1bis review 19/1999mr george talk monetary policy unite kingdom: the economic prospecttext chancellor’s lecture deliver governor bank england, mr e a jgeorge, hertfordshire university 18/02/99.as would expect central banker i talk monetary policy – title of“the economic prospect”. i begin explain try dothrough monetary policy; i’ll describe we’ve doing, now, andwhere might headed.what try doso let begin try do.in one sense that’s easy explain days. the previous conservative governmenthad already 1992 define objective monetary policy term target rate retailprice inflation. the new labour government, immediately assume office, similarlydefined objective term inflation target, go important step further. assoon gordon brown become chancellor exchequer, may 1997, announce thathe would long exercise power set short-term interest rates, heart ofmonetary policy, instead would set inflation target, delegate achievement ofthat target new monetary policy committee establish bank england.this position subsequently formalise new bank england act come intoeffect june last year. that act define bank’s objective “the maintenance ofprice stability, and, subject that, support government’s economic policy, include itsobjectives growth employment”.under act chancellor tell bank precisely understand “pricestability” do set target 2½% particular measure retailprice inflation (rpix – rpi exclude mortgage interest payments); althoughthe act provide chancellor set target year, expectation inpractice set medium long term. that political decision. the task achievingthat target – technical implementation monetary policy – delegated, transparentlyand accountably, mpc. the government long power – the1946 bank england act – issue direction bank field monetary policy,except, term new act, “in extreme economic circumstances”.so objective monetary policy days, immediate sense, could hardly beclearer; objective accept across broad part political spectrum.but important understand objective – permanent effective price stability – isnot simply end itself.now lot people think that, objective define term inflation target,controlling inflation bank england actually care about. we’re oftendescribed lot “inflation nutters”, even “pointy-headed industrial hooligans” whodon’t care real economic activity job – i don’t think epithet arenecessarily intend term endearment! that view i tell profoundly andfundamentally wrong. bi review 19/19992the implication, take view, think trade-off betweeninflation rate economic growth; think would let bite oncontrolling inflation could enjoy high activity low unemployment andrising live standards, are, course, really good thing economic life. at thevery least, say, bite le manic pursuit low inflation, couldavoid bad damage currently inflict upon agriculture, upon largeparts manufacturing, even service sectors.and might even true time. the trouble that, anything shortterm, would likely mean rather le economic damage, low ratherthan high growth employment.often past country behave think promote high growthand employment – i repeat is, course, want see – largely matterof pump demand. we pay little attention structural, supply-side, constraints.all often try buy fast growth high employment expense bitmore inflation. but like try squeeze quart pint pot. and knowthe result: inflation accelerated, often accompany worsen balance payments, untilit could bring back control – eventually bring back undercontrol – push interest rate dramatically force economy recession.we get uptight day interest rate rise ¼%: 14 year ago wewere drive increase interest rate 4% space 17 days. i don’t need remindyou – perhaps i – really miserable social well economic consequences, asright across economy people lose jobs, business homes. but evenmore insidiously, repeat experience boom bust produce pervasive short-termismin business behaviour, infect industry finance, employer andemployees, however much like blame everyone else. the reality periodwas everyone tempt grab much could go good,because know would last.but learn experience. we’ve learn anything shortterm really trade-off growth inflation. what try nowthrough monetary policy keep overall demand economy grow continuouslybroadly line supply-side capacity economy – whole – meet thatdemand. both previous government present one set low inflation target theimmediate objective monetary policy, end itself, effect barometer ofour success keep demand line supply. so real aim monetary policy thesedays achieve stability across economy whole much wide sense.now, lot, frankly, do, directly monetary policy, affect thesupply side – underlie rate growth sustain without cause inflation torise. that depend ultimately ingenuity, productivity, flexibility, theeconomy, though can, course, influence whole raft government policies,ranging education health, taxation social security, balancebetween regulation forms, include regulation labour market, productiveefficiency. like set objective monetary policy, are, course, quiterightly, matter elect politicians.monetary policy operate demand side. and best help give keepoverall demand consistently line supply-side capacity – symmetrically let run 3bis review 19/1999above capacity let fall capacity either – reflect achievement theinflation target. that way moderate rather aggravate unavoidable up anddowns business cycle, enable steady growth, high level employment risingliving standard sustain medium long term. and that, thenwe contribute indirectly supply side create environment encouragesmore rational, longer-term, decision-making throughout economy.so that, chancellor, try do. the debate monetary policy notabout ends, means. we every bite concern growth andemployment price stability – anyone right mind must be.permanently low inflation necessary mean achieve growth employmentsustained medium long term. i don’t think u bank englandor mpc would get half satisfaction fact get involvement inmonetary policy, think control inflation simply end itself.how we’ve doingso much, then, try do. how, then, doing? well – whatever youread newspaper – answer since adopt inflation target theimmediate policy objective, we’ve actually pretty well.inflation past six year fact average 2¾% year targetmeasure recently almost spot 2½% target.but equally important, total output country grow consistently almost sevenyears – 27 consecutive quarter – final quarter last year, average annual rateof around 3%, well long-term rate growth underlie capacity ofsome 2-2½%. we were, fact, period steadily reabsorb economic slackcreated early recession.employment rise recent figure publish yesterday, 1.8 mn since1992, all-time high 27.3 mn. and unemployment rate near 20-year low, notjust uk whole, nearly every region kingdom.encouragingly development labour market produce rather gradual pick-up earn growth compare past period labour market tightening, animportant factor help contain inflation. and balance payment remain insurplus late available data – q3 last year.short-term interest rate – currently 5½% – actually peak last year 7½%. formuch 37 year bank i’d give eye-teeth trough 7½%.long-term interest rates, recently around 4½%, low they’vebeen since late 1950’s. that’s certainly good economy whole, though irecognise necessarily feel good people live interest savings,even though save keep real value far good early period highinflation.the public sector’s balance sheet excellent shape compare rest theworld – government’s borrow requirement position strong sustainable. and bi review 19/19994the true balance sheet bank system, household andcorporate sectors.and top that, england beat springbok rugby – even cricketer didn’t doso well under!yet one read – anyone want talk apparently – bad news.so let disappoint evening, come bad news.where now?by around begin 1997 become clear danger ofhaving much good thing. overall output growth need moderate torun overall capacity constraint – particularly labour market. in fact outputgrowth actually pick course 1997, rate close 3% around 4%,partly impact windfall effect build society demutualisation consumerspending. aggregate demand growth, words, need slow avoidoverheating, essentially background tighten monetary policyduring 1997 first half 1998.but major complication. in autumn 1996 sterling’s exchange rate againstthe core european currency start strengthen, early 1997 alreadyappreciated 17% deutschemark. although sterling appreciate rather lessagainst dollar – also strengthen core european currency thisperiod – sterling’s effective exchange rate index (eri) still rise 13.5%. sterling wentup deutschemark right spring last year.it never entirely clear sterling – dollar – strengthen way, orperhaps appropriately core european currency

rate environment,following exit erm, abrupt appreciation mean internationally-exposed sector economy, include large part manufacture industry, nowsuddenly confront much harsh trade conditions. that, i say, dampen 5bis review 19/1999effect uk economy inflation. but couldn’t rely cool theeconomy us. clearly point exchange rate would stop appreciating, thisexternal dampen effect would work way through. in meantime, need toslow rate growth domestic demand sufficiently avoid overheat economyas whole. the strong exchange rate give u somewhat time would otherwisehave bring domestic slowdown – mean monetary policy needto tighten aggressively would necessary otherwise. but could notavoid tighten policy altogether, even though realise would likely toincrease pressure internationally-exposed sectors, anything thanthe short term would put whole economy – include internationally-exposedsectors try shelter – risk accelerate inflation. i would remind thatright summer last year see sign increase pressure thelabour market, even manufacture sector – reflect increase skill shortage andrecruitment difficulties, employment/unemployment data, gradually increasingpay settlements. the uncomfortable reality, i’ve say often before, monetarypolicy target economy whole – can’t seek protect individual firms, orsectors, regions, however much might wish otherwise. that – i’ve discover – isnot exactly popular idea, there’s question reality it.over past year world – i mean world – change substantially.the exchange rate has, fact, tend gradually soften since last spring decisionto go ahead euro finally confirmed; increasingly since autumn theinternationally-exposed sector economy deal massive blow aresult global economic turbulence.this started, fact, financial disturbance asia latter half 1997, evenas late begin last summer seem might limit impact theoverall world economy. the imf, example, still project 3-3¾% world growthin 1998 1999 respectively, certainly setback compare

reflect differ assessment far particular currencyareas expect affect world slowdown different start points, relatingboth assessment trend domestic demand, close initially tofull capacity, uk euro-zone, well us, act fairly aggressivelyto reduce interest rate since autumn; japan move active fiscal stimulus.and global economic prospect, net external demand industrial countries, wereto

the slowdown – soft land – beenconsciously seek engineer threaten quite rapidly become much sharp decline –or hard land – either expect needed. and that, course, wepromptly change monetary policy stance did, cut interest rate 2% 5½%in space five months.in so, demonstrate inflation target – frequently say is– symmetrical, would least determine aggressive cut rate wethought likely undershoot

duisenberg evaluate single european monetary policyspeech president european central bank, dr willem f duisenberg, theuniversity hohenheim, germany, 09/02/99.ladies gentlemen,the single european monetary policy reality little five weeks. afteryears intensive preparatory work successful economic convergence, monetary policy isnow jointly determine large part europe govern council europeancentral bank. the monetary policy implement eurosystem, name give theecb 11 central bank eu member state participate monetary union.the single currency quote international financial market use non-cashpayments. however, euro appear yet tangible form banknote coins.nonetheless doubt currency, bring existence 1january 1999, play important role within euro area beyond.there good reason confidence, lady gentlemen. overall first weekswent smoothly single currency monetary policy eurosystem. the startdid pas entirely without hitch – expect case, give thesignificance scale project – major complications.monetary union unique outstanding achievement. it provide great opportunity toachieve goal last price stability throughout europe. price stability bestcontribution monetary policy make last economic employment growth ineurope. the national government involve collective wage bargain arebeing call remove structural cause excessively high unemployment. wecan hope introduction euro spur implementation structuralreforms.the stability-oriented monetary policy strategy eurosystemthe treaty establish european community assign european system centralbanks (escb) thereby eurosystem primary objective maintain pricestability. the govern council utmost fulfil task explain itsmonetary policy comprehensible general public. for reason havedeveloped stability-oriented monetary policy essentially consist three mainelements.the govern council publish quantitative definition primary objective, pricestability. this give clear guidance expectation relation future price developments.price stability define increase harmonise index consumer price (hicp)of euro area le 2% compare previous year. the publication thisdefinition provide public european parliament clear benchmark againstwhich measure success single monetary policy, thereby provide thetransparency accountability eurosystem policy.the word “less 2%” clearly define upper limit measure inflation ratewhich compatible price stability. i think i need emphasise deflation – bi review 18/19992sustained fall price – would incompatible price stability. the late available datafor annual rate inflation accord hicp euro area whole fall withinthe definition price stability. this outcome clearly result, all, successfulmonetary policy national central bank year start monetary union.the ecb responsible monetary policy little one month. itwill possible judge success current policy one two years’ time. thisreflects fact transmission monetary policy impulse subject relatively longand variable time lags. the govern council therefore emphasise price stabilitymust maintain medium term. this statement underline need aforward-looking approach monetary policy, also take consideration short-termvolatility price response non-monetary shock beyond control ofmonetary policy.in order achieve goal price stability, strategy rests, particular, two “pillars”.before i explain detail, i like emphasise traditional previouslyestablished macroeconomic relationship could change consequence introductionof euro. this one key reason neither monetary target direct inflationtargeting strategy could applied. our strategy also simple combinationof two approaches. rather, precisely tailor need ecb.the first pillar monetary policy strategy prominent role money. since inflationis ultimately monetary phenomenon medium term, money supply provide anatural “nominal anchor” monetary policy gear safeguard price stability. toemphasise prominent role, govern council publish quantitative referencevalue growth money supply. the first reference value decide upon thegoverning council growth m3 4.5% per annum publish 1 december.this value base above-mentioned definition price stability assume trendgrowth real gross domestic product 2-2.5% per annum, well medium-termreduction velocity circulation m3 around 0.5-1% per annum.we shall not, however, respond mechanistically deviation reference value formoney supply growth, shall first analyse carefully signal relate future pricedevelopments. large sustain deviation normally signal risk price stability.the second pillar monetary policy strategy consist broadly base assessment theoutlook price development entire euro area. this assessment base abroad range monetary policy indicators. in particular, variable could containinformation future price development analyse depth. this analysis notonly provide information risk price development, also help identifythe cause unexpected change important economic variables.some commentator reduce comprehensive analysis inflation forecast. at sametime, demand ecb publish forecast order satisfy theneed transparency accountability. therefore allow make clear: strategyincludes comprehensive analysis numerous indicator several forecasts. to focus asingle official inflation forecast eurosystem specific point time would wayaccurately reflect internal analytical decision-making process. it would impinge uponthe transparency clarity explanation policy. the publication officialinflation forecast would also inappropriate regard accountability ecb, 3bis review 18/1999the forecast base assumption change monetary policy.the success monetary policy ecb primarily measure term themaintenance price stability, accuracy conditional forecasts.the stability-oriented monetary policy strategy eurosystem, i outlined,constitutes new clear strategy. it emphasis primacy goal price stability. ittakes account inevitable uncertainty concern economic relationship inherent inthe transition monetary union associate systemic change guarantee highdegree transparency.ladies gentlemen,allow comment certain suggestion orientation monetary policy whichhave recently appear press. some idea give impression monetarypolicy concentrate upon objective price stability, since stable price havealready achieved. inter alia, suggest ecb react lessmechanistically exchange rate development variable unit labour costs.furthermore, call monetary policy, mean reduction interest rates, tobe use combat unemployment. against background need set clearlythe possibility limitation monetary policy.both reason maastricht treaty many economic analysis show bestcontribution single monetary policy make employment growth concentrate onprice stability. without clear approach danger public may questionthe commitment eurosystem goal maintain price stability. inflationexpectations, risk premia thus long-term rate would rise. this would increase cost ofthe investment necessary sustain last rise standard living.even best possible circumstances, though – i.e. prof possible assurelasting price stability – monetary policy alone cannot solve major economic problem ofunemployment future problem social security systems.the govern council regard current high level unemployment euro area amatter great concern. this problem is, however, predominantly structural one. it mainlythe result rigidity labour good market euro area arisenpartly excessive disproportionate degree regulation. structural economicreforms, target reduction rigidities, appropriate solution. in euroarea country reform implement unemployment figure havedeclined markedly. in addition, i like emphasise moderate wage developmentsand reduction burden tax social security contribution would generally help toreduce unemployment. this would case even country concern tradeheavily neighbour countries. the positive influence low tax wage onemployment clearly overall benefit international perspective. such policyshould denounce “wage dumping”.turning role exchange rate euro important currency outsidethe eu, particular u dollar, eurosystem has, formulate monetary policystrategy, make unambiguous choice. this strategy clearly rule explicit implicitobjectives target zone euro exchange rate. the pursuit exchange rateobjective could easily jeopardise maintenance objective price stability could bi review 18/19994thereby also detrimental real economic development. target zone exchange ratescould, example, lead ecb raise interest rate recession, despiteincreasing downward pressure prices. i sure agree mechanisticresponse change euro exchange rate would optimal. furthermore, isimportant remember live world high capital mobility. exchange rateagreements, might possible implement recently, longerfeasible.the lack exchange rate target mean ecb totally indifferent ortakes account euro exchange rate. on contrary, exchange rate beobserved analyse potentially important monetary policy indicator context ofthe broadly base assessment outlook price developments. a stability-orientedmonetary fiscal policy, stipulate maastricht treaty stability andgrowth pact, essential pre-condition stable euro exchange rate. of course, isno guarantee last exchange rate stability, even fix exchange rate regime.exchange rate fluctuation often cause structural fiscal policy, asymmetric realshocks conjunctural differences. monetary policy would clearly overburden toprevent movement exchange rate.we cannot shall gear monetary policy towards single variable, whether moneysupply aggregate, index, exchange rate inflation forecast particular point intime. nor involve ex ante co-ordination would entail obligation toreact particular commitment plans. the ecb always carefully analyse relevantindicators. in context, particularly important economic cause potentialrisks price stability euro area understand fully possible. appropriatemonetary policy decision also depend upon cause unexpected change importanteconomic variables. the govern council must, example, take view whetherchanges important indicator temporary permanent nature, whether ademand supply shock involved. in deliberation also attempt take accounthow financial markets, consumer firm expect react monetary policydecisions. i believe would contest complex analysis cannot meaningfully bereduced le mechanistic reaction variable single official forecast.in addition, concern often express eurosystem would act transparentlyenough. in context, say transparent monetary policy also necessitate thepublication minute meet govern council disclosure thevoting behaviour individual member council.for sound reason govern council decide adopt approach. the publicationof individual position could easily lead national influence exert theindividual council members. the member govern council must not, however, beseen national representatives. they decide together monetary policy euro areaas whole. the govern council commit go beyond report andexplanatory requirement lay treaty, among comprehensiverequirements international standards.on basis strategy, every first meet month i deliver press adetailed explanation assessment overall economic situation and, particular, theoutlook price stability. the content so-called “introductory statement” closeto central bank refer minutes. in way, public receive comprehensive 5bis review 18/1999information immediately follow meet govern council. in addition, eachmonth shall publish detail report economic situation monetary policythroughout euro area bulletin. such rapid information result meetingsof govern council current economic analysis ecb without doubtdemonstrates high degree openness transparency.the recent monetary policy decision operationsco-operation european central bank always close. in last fewmonths 1998 country participate third stage monetary union co-operatedmore closely. the coordinate reduction lead rate begin ofdecember 1998 clearly show currency union begin de facto start ofstage three. this coordinate measure contribute substantially – know – thestabilisation market expectations.for five week ecb conduct monetary policy operations, mainly inthe form reverse open market operations. the main operation carry aweekly frequency maturity two weeks. so far, five operation beenconducted successfully, fix interest rate 3%.besides reverse transaction constitute main instrument liquidity control andtargeting interest rates, eurosystem offer two “standing” facilities: marginal lendingfacility deposit facility. these access credit institution via nationalcentral banks. the marginal lend facility primarily safety valve short-term liquidityshortages bank system thereby limit upward movement money market rates.to extent, counterpart short-term deposit facility, use absorbshort-term liquidity surpluses. this form low limit money market rates. for startof monetary union interest rate deposit facility set 2% rate themarginal lend facility set 4.5%.as transitional measure, govern council decide establish narrow corridor of2.75-3.25% rate marginal lend facility deposit facility 4to 21 january 1999. the intention facilitate necessary adjustment newinstitutional environment bring transition stage three. a alreadyannounced, 21 january 1999 decide return rate two “standing”facilities set start single monetary policy. since 22 january 1999,therefore, rate deposit facility 2% rate marginal lendingfacility 4.5%.a critical factor decision behaviour money market euro area awhole since begin year. the govern council establish time therehad mark reduction difficulty experience market participant withthe introduction integrate money market and, particular, cross-border liquidityflows. all all, integration money market euro area reach satisfactorystage three week implementation. in analyse money market benoted that, inter alia, mark difference ecb interest rate short-term market rates. on one hand, market rate may include credit risk premia and, theother, expectation may lead difference two rates. bi review 18/19996at meet last thursday govern council confirm early assessment theoutlook price stability. therefore decide leave condition next mainrefinancing operations, 10 17 february 1999, unchanged. they carry asvolume

market therefore usuallyacts price-taker. the ecb thus give advance indication plan allocation. theinterest rate arise monetary policy operation therefore see asindicators prevail market conditions.regular assessment monetary, financial economic situationto conclude, i like briefly report govern council’s current assessment ofthe monetary, financial economic situation. on basis assessment thegoverning council decide last tuesday leave interest rate unchanged.taking account late monetary data december 1998, three-month movingaverage 12-month growth rate monetary aggregate m3 (for period fromoctober december 1998) remain le stable 4.7%. this value close tothe reference value set govern council. accord analysis, evolution ofthe money supply show risk price stability. credit private sector also grewstrongly december last year. although present perceive inflationarysignals, development carefully monitored.with regard broadly base assessment outlook price development therisks price stability euro area, monetary financial development see toindicate favourable assessment late monetary policy decision eurosystem.they indicate market participant expect continuation environment pricestability. long-term rate fell new historical low begin 1999 anoverall downward shift yield curve. therefore, finance condition investment arecurrently exceptionally favourable.at present growth prospect euro area are, however, still mark theuncertainties relate development world economy 1999. these uncertaintieshave negative impact indicator economic climate euro area. there arewidespread expectation economic slowdown near future. this deterioration theexternal economic environment linked, all, financial crisis asia, russiaand latin america. however, mix picture. while growth rate industrialproduction fell november 1998, retail sale figure consumer confidence haverecently show positive trends. furthermore, growth real gross domestic product euroarea relatively robust third quarter 1998. in unite state real growth thefourth quarter actually turn high expected. measure hicp, consumerprices euro area rise 0.8% december 1998. this tenth percentage pointlower november. this development line early trends. it linked, 7bis review 18/1999particular, decline energy price weaken price increase industrialgoods.all all, above-mentioned economic development available forecast 1999 donot indicate noticeable upward downward pressure prices. potential upward riskscould arise change external global economic situation associate effectson euro area, via import producer prices. these development must carefullymonitored. there concern inflationary pressure might develop event strongincrease wage price ease fiscal policy. development exchange rate willalso closely monitor view significance price developments.finally, let emphasise current level real interest rate exceptionally low. ifreal interest rate take simply difference nominal rate currentincrease consumer price (hicp), short-term real interest rate january 1999 stand at2.3%, i.e. around 80 basis point low one year ago. long-term real rate falleneven more, 110 basis points, stand 3% january. these level low,compared country historical data. in line safeguard ofprice stability, current monetary financial condition thus clearly support futureeconomic growth. monetary policy without

hemisphere, natural strong link florida latin america.similarly, 20 year ago i study latin american economic development albert ohirschman, one great development economist time. therefore, topic i would liketo discus even worked, apparently worked, latin america thelast 20 year so.the main message that, 1980s debt crisis, many latin american country embark apath great economic freedom, lessen government intervention market sounderpolicies. those policy provide basis heighten economic dynamism growth, andthereby lead significant benefit citizens, include high incomes, low inflation, awider range economic opportunities. in view audience today, i also mention that,partly consequence improve market-friendly policies, many latin america’sbanking system endeavor become efficient, stable, good integrate withglobal financial markets. a result, latin american bank become good able support theprocess stable, non-inflationary growth future. the current economic financialproblems brazil should, anything, reinforce importance pursue sound fiscal andmonetary policy improvement underlie institution support economic activity.backgroundtwenty year ago, end 1970s, latin america verge move aphase unsustainable economic activity – base high domestic consumption, heavy borrowingfrom abroad, unsustainable currency levels, excessive intervention government theeconomy – decade lose growth lose opportunity know debt crisis. a the1980s began, latin american country saw price export plunge, interest rate skyrocket,and access international capital cut back severely. in harsh new environment, theshortcomings previous policy become even apparent, economic performance faltered.currency value plummet government run reserves, inflation soared, case asmuch triple digit levels, output region contract severely. key social anddevelopmental priority scale back government struggle finance budget andfind fund repay foreign creditors. domestic financial system throw disarray andmany bank severely weakened, direct response shock hit region, andalso result misguide government policy undertake response economic politicalproblems. the main discussion regard latin america seem focus issue ofhyperinflation, high unemployment, repay external debt.not surprisingly, circumstances, job creation 1980s slow, many domesticbusinesses invest, direct foreign investment weak well. these problem notmerely result uncontrollable, external shocks. they also reflect fact manygovernments region slow enact reform would lay foundation futuregrowth. in fact, many case government respond problem policy make thing – 2 –bis review 17/1999worse, better, include wage price controls, freeze domestic interest rates, adoptionof protectionist trade policies. these latter way particularly problematic, latinamerican country general focus grow problem expansion offoreign trade. trade flow period relatively small, compare one mightexpect economy size, trade occur highly tilt toward rawmaterials semi-processed industrial products.in sum, notwithstanding bright spots, tone discussion regard latin america seemedbiased toward discussion problem opportunities.current conditionsi cannot say problem late 1970s 1980s evaporated. indeed, isillustrated current situation brazil, clearly problem still resolved. itcontinues important brazil implement macroeconomic structural policy

situation,appears close achieve promise show generation ago. most countriesin region experience growth since 1980s. indeed, growth rate latin americancountries average 3½% annually decade.in addition, scourge inflation seems, general, bring control. the costswere high, battle seem mainly won. admittedly, bad inflation rates, atabout 40%, still high standard unite states. however, much reducedfrom exist 20 year even 10 year ago. last year, argentina’s inflation rate under1%. that nearly 5000% 1989!knowing many institution involve trade finance, know tradeoutlook region change significantly

american import export roughly match explosion international tradeexperienced throughout world economy period. moreover, many latin americancountries, export grow substantially proportion total production, fraction ofthese export account manufacture good also increased.finally, latin america become active participant flow foreign direct investment andother form capital. in 1990, debt crisis wind up, net direct investment flow tolatin america total $7 billion; 1997, figure rise $51 billion. portfolio capitalflows also grow substantially. although volatile well, netportfolio investment

disastrous economic performance region 1980s, – 3 –bis review 17/1999the realization dramatic improvement economic policy would suffice allow growthand prosperity take hold.first, general acknowledgment, recent reinforcement lesson, prudentfiscal policy crucial economic stability, several economy region madesignificant stride direction. while much leave sphere, appear manycountries learn benefit prudent fiscal policy. fiscal deficit country theregion dropped, case yet declined, serious attention towardachieving improvement mustered. improvement budget balance beenachieved without pain. in many country government payroll slashed, generous transferand subsidy program cut, social expenditure reduced. on otherhand, realization become widespread absence budget-cutting measures,employment wage would become even depressed. moreover, people find thatmany action take cut budgets, include privatization money-losing state enterprises,has lead good service improve quality life.second, substantial dismantle control impose government privatesector price wages. it widely understand excessive budget deficit moneycreation root cause inflation, control private price generallyabolished. government also largely scale back role private wage negotiation well.public control privately contract interest rate financial market price also beeneliminated part. finally, exchange rate many latin american country becomemore flexible, government still intervene foreign exchange markets, agreater understand intervention must underpin appropriate fiscal monetarypolicies.third, role government aspect economy substantially diminished,with accordingly great scope allow private activity competition abroad.internally, many country privatize major businesses. the privatization telebras, thebrazilian telephone company, prominent recent example, privatization proceed evenfurther latin american countries. such privatization many case complementedwith legislation open particular sector great fair competition. additionally, tradebarriers remove many countries, often participation regional agreementsand broad international arrangements. the trade barrier dismantle include bothtariffs non-tariff barriers. in consequence, share foreign trade economic activity hasincreased substantially certain cases. closely associate

government oversight important necessary, progress make inimproving supervision regulation. in particular, effort focus strengthen andmodernizing region’s bank sectors, emerge debt crisis 1980s

andimportant problem remain, progress achieve date important overall recoveryof latin american economy 1990s.having say this, latin america affect major international financial crisis thelast several years, obviously brazil affect currently. the lesson learn fromthese crisis remain subject strenuous debate; i would offer follow observations. – 4 –bis review 17/1999first, appropriate balance fiscal, monetary, exchange rate policy continue matter. the1994–95 mexican crisis current stress brazil indicate market watch closelycountries allow imbalance emerge. in fact, era open capital market rapid capitalmobility, punishment policy mistake arguably even rapid severe beenthe case past.second, may enough country merely avoid excessive budget deficit highinflation. country must take step

question best way enter modern world rapid capital mobility. foreigncapital obviously tremendous benefit help economy modernize grow. at thesame time, tendency foreign investor pull capital country

disturbances. the jury still whether suchcontrols might appropriate economies. it seem clear principal attraction ashort-term measure help economy make full transition fully open capital market.a second question whether fix flexible exchange rate regime appropriate inan era rapid capital mobility. in principle, flexible exchange rate allow economy adjustmore easily change international

fairlydetailed examination bank’s role approach provision credit, light thechanges bank’s balance sheet.iii. extension credit bank japana. the role central bank it balance sheetbefore explain soundness bank’s balance sheet become issue, ineed refer mission central bank.in brief, mission bank japan, central bank japan, issuebanknotes, ensure function currency, contribute sound development thejapanese economy. perhaps “ensuring function currency” sound little abstract.specifically, bank must first ensure stability currency’s value, second maintainan appropriate framework circulation. refer two requirements, role acentral bank often define maintenance price stability financial system stability.on day-to-day level, bank seek fulfil mission engage bankingactivities similar commercial banks. when economy experiencinginflation deflation, bank try restore maintain non-inflationary non-deflationary situation——that is, situation price stability——by influence quantity ofmoney circulation level various interest rates. the bank achieve objective byinfluencing interest rate financial markets. and do basically supply orabsorbing appropriate amount fund purchase sale financial assets. suchactivity central bank call “market operations.” the true bank’sactivities maintain orderly financial system. when stability financial system atrisk due, say, failure commercial bank, bank

naturally cause bank’s balancesheet expand.the key question whether people trust central bank will tohold country’s currency (including banknotes, bear interest). this depend onwhether central bank’s behavior measure expectation people, andwhether continue so. one source clue make judgment thebalance sheet, therefore natural people japan abroad take keen interest inthe bank’s balance sheet.the bank’s balance sheet discuss various perspectives. from theviewpoint people’s confidence central bank, important financial assetsthe bank hold adequate secure banknote issued. this adequacy, i believe, involvestwo specific points. first, bank’s asset must sound financial base must solid——the latter mean bank must sufficient capital base——in order bank tocontinue act decisively central bank total independence intervention third party.second, bank must sufficiently liquid asset portfolio flexibly inject withdrawfunds necessary.i believe bank’s balance sheet also attract grow attention othercountries. some observer express concern expansion bank’s balancesheet sign deterioration assets. this may rapid growth balancesheet associate people’s mind increase nonperforming asset need bedisposed substantial loss. but i state begin speech, set asidetechnical factors, recent expansion bank’s balance sheet primarily result ofactive provision liquidity ease policy. nevertheless, mere suspicion anerosion asset quality serious problem undermine people’s confidence thecentral bank and, turn, national economy. such loss confidence could, example,result japan’s commercial bank firm pay unnecessary premium raisingfunds countries. that bank recognize need vigilant againstdeterioration assets. the policy board, bank’s decision-making body, constantlydeliberates whether various measure implement fulfil bank’s mission couldjeopardize bank’s credibility result change balance sheet.b. three key principle bank japan’s portfolio selectioni next talk philosophy guide bank portfolio selection——inother words, key principle select central bank’s portfolio. there three.the first principle maintain soundness bank’s assets. in words,assets collateral hold bank must high quality.the bank devise number method achieve this. when supply fund tofinancial institution loans, bank acquire financial asset trustworthy ascollateral. when provide fund market operations, purchase financial asset fromfinancial institution seller base repurchase (gensaki repo) agreements. the onlyexception rule market operation bank make outright purchase ofgovernment bonds. thus, credit provide bank secure creditworthiness ofplural entities: creditworthiness financial institution bank lendsdirectly, also government entity non-banking private sector,which issuer debt instruments. this approach common among central banks. atthe bank japan, call “the double-name principle.” – 4 –bis review 15/1999where collateral bank’s loan financial asset purchase marketoperations issue entity private-sector firms, bank ass eligibility ofthese asset accord criteria——that is, internal ratings——and review leastonce year. if firm’s financial performance deteriorated, financial debt firm wouldno long acceptable collateral instrument market operations, even oncebeen deem suitable purposes.of course, measure alone enough. the double-name principle might reducethe probability defaults, take firm’s debt collateral sufficient firm’screditworthiness bolster support commercial bank bank japanis lending. nor desirable bank’s asset collateral concentrate theliabilities firm particular industry. the bank pay careful attention thesoundness individual asset entire portfolio, ensure asset collateral arenot expose linkage risk excessive risk concentration.the second principle maintain neutrality respect resource allocation. if thebank hold excessive quantity certain type financial assets, price make resourceallocation market might distorted. in view role economy, bank shoulddo best minimize influences. the supply fund bank japan contextof monetary policy management aim influence overall level market interest rates.furthermore, provision fund purpose maintain orderly financial system isaimed solely contain systemic risk prevent disruption entire financial system.the third principle maintain liquid assets. the asset bank must ascan liquidate reasonable cost whenever necessary. this bank ready torespond sudden policy decisions. in management monetary policy, bank tocontrol interest rate rapidly move financial markets, must able acquire liquidatefinancial asset instantly order supply absorb funds. the principle apply itsprovision fund maintain orderly financial system. asset liquidity vital bank’scapacity make flexible policy response maintain bank’s financial soundness.bearing mind three principle guide bank selection asset andcollateral, bank make great effort adopt new market operation measure reviewcollateral requirement accommodate current policy agenda. one example isintroduction new market operation tool contribute indirectly development offinancial markets. another bank’s “new measure money market operation inresponse recent situation corporate finance activities,” decide november 13,1998. a state press release, aim measure contribute facilitatingcorporate finance activity devise new method market operation lending.iv. some relate issueshaving outline bank’s principles, i would like examine approach morespecific term address frequently ask question relate balance sheet.a. government debt private-sector debt?the first question whether central bank primarily hold safe asset asgovernment debt. some believe hold private-sector debt reduce quality bankof japan’s assets, bank buy government bonds.in fact, bank already hold substantial amount government securities. itsholding end november 1998, include short-term security (financing bills, fbs), – 5 –bis review 15/1999amounted approximately \52 trillion. this, together government security worthabout \5 trillion borrow repo operations, account approximately two third oftotal assets. however, high ratio typical central banks. in fact, centralbank high proportion government security portfolio federal reserveof unite states. the central bank continental europe primarily purchase private-sectordebt bill deed provide liquidity, therefore government security comprisea small proportion portfolio. the european central bank (ecb), administera common monetary policy country participate european monetary union fromjanuary 1999, also accept government security corporate-sector debt eligibleassets.historically, concept central bank date bank england evolvedfrom commercial bank central bank. the traditional activity central bank haveincluded provision fund rediscounting bill discount commercial banks.thus, long successfully employ corporate-sector debt collateral supplyingfunds adequately manage risk involved, although always easy. beforelarge-scale issuance government bond begin japan, bank japan fact make activeuse corporate-sector debt, especially bills, provide funds.the important issue portfolio selection central bank choice betweengovernment private-sector debt, rather avoidance distortion resource allocationin respective financial markets. base principle, bank intend make great useof selected, sound private-sector debt market operation instrument collateral itdeems necessary achieve current policy objectives, development newmarkets.b. transaction counterpartiesthe second question whether central bank make direct contact thebanking sector, influence economy indirectly. some argue direct contact thecorporate sector undesirable create potential arbitrary behavior centralbank, prolongation life inefficient firms.this matter principle whether central bank limit counterparties tobanks, whether also deal non-banking sector.the concern seem originate bank’s active use private-sector debtthrough mean expansion cp repo operations, may give impressionthat bank excessively involve corporate fund-raising. but concern appear tocontain slight misunderstanding. although bank indeed buy cp——which formof corporate-sector debt——through market operations, buy cp financial institutionsincluding banks, therefore counterparties operation changed.furthermore, bank specify individual cp issue submitted, rather thecounterparty financial institution offer issue choice among deem eligibleby bank. purchase cp different provide commercial bank loan billsin sense bank supply fund commercial bank refinance corporate debt.however, merit consideration whether participation market operation otherbank transaction make open non-bank entities. if look example overseas, itappears ecb carry market operation banks. in unite states,however, federal reserve conduct market operation so-called primary securitiesdealers, many security company account federal reserve – 6 –bis review 15/1999banks. a key point consider counterparty issue whether emphasis interbanktransactions open market transactions. if central bank primarily conduct interbanktransactions, counterparty naturally bank sector. yet seem globaltrend grow preference central bank open market transactions. in japan, bankselects counterparties accord eligibility criterion among banks, securitiescompanies, tanshi company (money market broker-cum-dealers), institution thathave account bank.in final analysis, i think rational solution issue restrictcounterparties banks, choose wide range entity order achieve swiftand certain permeation policy effect adequate control counterparty risk, takinginto account factor change financial structure. it certainly essential themoney market, central bank make transactions, sufficiently develop bothqualitative quantitative terms. in regard, japan soon fully fledge fb marketwith introduction public auction system fb issues. a open market transactionsexpand, lead diversification financial service providers, bank review itsselection counterparties bank’s market operations.c. corporate bond equitiesthe third question whether bank purchase corporate bond equity inview critical state japanese economy. this argument base fact thestock market one time support public sector’s purchase equities. it also theview advocate intervention that, bank concern risks, askfor government guarantees.first all, i would like emphasize central bank create liquidity notcapital. there intrinsically definite limit extent central bank take onprivate-sector risk. assume risk compromise quality asset might impairthe bank’s credibility, need fulfil mission. this bank japan lawof 1997, like previous law, allow bank buy equities, subject largecredit price volatility risks. accordingly, bank cannot purchase equity judge itshould provide fund manner would involve similar degree risk. for samereason, also belief inappropriate bank purchase corporate bond outrightand hold maturity.placement government guarantee perfect solution. although wouldreduce credit risks, purchase corporate bond equity yet involve another problem——itmight lead long-term fix asset bank’s balance sheet. for example, loansextended dic increase rapidly, bank cannot justify extend alonger term necessary government guaranteed. the prolong holdingof asset would reduce bank’s flexibility money market operations. moreover, thebalance sheet leave expanded, would arouse concern decline asset quality. in anyevent, outcome would impairment japan’s credibility, would force japanesebanks firm pay unnecessarily high finance cost overseas.in view current state japan’s financial system, bank prepare providethe dic necessary liquidity order corporation perform role effectively.however, i believe dic subsequently secure longer-term fund swiftlyreplacing bank’s loan government-secured bond issue commercial bank loans. thebank must always ready carry flexible money market operation serve function – 7 –bis review 15/1999of lender last resort whenever necessary. and this, essential bank avoidfixing massive loan dic balance sheet.v. rebuild japan’s economy financial systemi hope remark today able clarify issue concern thebank’s balance sheet. before end speech, since end 1998 week away, iwould like discus japan’s policy agenda new year emphasize bank’scommitment it.the important task 1999, give current state japanese economy, willbe rebuild economy financial system. the role bank workrelentlessly (1) support rebuild japanese economy maintain currenteasy stance monetary policy; (2) continue supply sufficient liquidity ensure thestability financial system.the fundamental problem confront japanese economy shortage ofliquidity, shortage capital reluctance take risk would help economicexpansion. the cure these, i state many times, firstly strengthen capital baseof financial institution restore financial intermediary functions, secondly actpromptly create capital

particularly euro area labour markets,can play reduce unemployment support stability euro. the high level ofeuropean unemployment rightly source deep concern. clearly, approach mostlikely last effect address root cause problem, thesymptoms. the root cause high unemployment european union structural rigidity inlabour market well tax public transfer policies. this view support wide body ofacademic literature also key find oecd job study.the underlie structural nature european unemployment problem see strikinglyif one compare development europe unite state last three decades. in1970,

since theunemployment rate unite state average european union. despiterecording decline last year, euro area unemployment rate 10.4% april 1999, morethan double correspond rate unite states. however, european countries,particularly flexible labour markets, manage avoid trend ever-risingunemployment. for example, netherlands, ireland, portugal, austria luxembourg presenthave unemployment rate well euro area average.if one examine duration unemployment, immediately apparent europe’s problem isprincipally one long-term unemployment. accord oecd figures, around half theunemployed european union work least year, unitedstates, 10% unemployed without work long. this suggest ineurope urgent need improve incentive aim get long-term unemployed backto work.there many good example do - currently do

think amacro-economic explanation required.here i come back low inflation low inflationary expectations, characterisedthe 1990s expansion, clearly absent early expansions. a early expansionsmatured,

complement bank supervision byencouraging bank refrain excessive risk-taking.indeed, i believe market discipline particularly attractive tool encourage safetyand soundness rapidly evolve environment. market discipline inherently flexible andadaptive respect innovations, since market participant incentive change theways evaluate risk innovation adopted.market discipline complement supervision regulationbefore discuss market discipline might complement bank supervision regulation,it useful discus market discipline works. it seem operate two channels.“direct” market discipline exert risk-sensitive debt instrument bankingorganization’s expect cost issue instrument increase substantially anincrease risk profile. for occur, investor must gather collect informationabout bank

determine risk exposure (or default probability) abanking organization. in response perceive increase bank risk, party could thentake variety action increase bank operate costs. for example, purchaser bankclaims could increase bank’s cost fund limit supply credit, privatecounterparties supervisor could reduce bank’s ability engage certain type ofcontracts. the anticipation actions, essentially various type penalties,provides bank organization incentive refrain excessive risk-taking.market discipline come naturally banking. the federal safety net limit directmarket discipline reduce demand disclosure risk-sensitivity debtholders. clearly, insure depositor almost incentive penalize bank excessive 3bis review 71/1999risk-taking. and, uninsured depositors, depositor preference laws, may alsoperceive relatively little need impose high cost bank excessive risk-taking. giventhese incentives, secondary market rate spread debt instrument would beinadequate – irrelevant – barometer bank’s risk would therefore generate littleindirect market discipline. further, real perceive certification soundness providedby supervisory authority may also reduce demand disclosure risk-sensitivityof debt holders. compound disincentive investor evaluate bank risks, theraison d’être bank institution provide credit environment characterize byasymmetric information. therefore, bank inherently opaque difficult assess.nevertheless, seem fairly strong statistical anecdotal evidence support theview direct indirect market discipline currently exert large bankingorganizations. with respect direct market discipline, econometric study relationshipbetween deposit growth portfolio risk generally find uninsured depositorholdings decline increase depository institution’s risk. and, econometricstudies find rate uninsured certificate deposit sensitive measure ofrisk. supervisory experience consistent observations.other type bank liability also appear sensitive risk. for example, periodsof financial stress, risky bank organization tend voluntarily issue subordinateddebt. this precisely would expect subordinate debt market impose riskpremiums bank organizations. above beyond implication issuance costsare risk sensitive, empirical evidence suggest direct market discipline substantialenough subordinate debt market affect actual decision make bankingorganizations.the

risk-sensitivity ofsubordinated debt spread necessary market participant exert indirect marketdiscipline bank organizations, sufficient. market participant outside thesubordinated debt market also must monitor spread ass condition thebanking organization. indeed, market participant confirm “street,” bondmarket, appear pay considerable attention spreads. on balance, empiricalevidence together anecdotal evidence market indicate secondary marketsubordinated debt spread generate indirect market discipline bank organizations.while market discipline currently exert directly indirectly large u.s. bankingorganizations, strength discipline could enhance policymakers numberof promise ways. for example, policy improve disclosure bank risk exposure andinternal capital assessment could potentially improve market’s ability ass risks.another option supervisory policy enhance indirect market discipline linkingsupervisory action secondary market information. for example, secondary marketinformation could use help time bank examinations, possibly limit bank activities, orto potentially raise bank capital requirements. in way, market discipline might strengthenbank supervision. while evidence yet clear whether secondary market indicatorsprovide information supervisor yet have, bad indicator couldconfirm supervisory view could prompt supervisor reassess appraisal banks. bi review 71/19994using subordinate debt enhance market disciplinea promise approach enhance market discipline, receive considerable renewedattention late, adopt subordinate debt policy. there number feature ofsubordinated debt make particularly attractive provide increase marketdiscipline. first all, subordinate debt junior bank liabilities. therefore,these bondholder least likely bail event bank failure, themost likely demand disclosure bank’s condition. second, subordinate debt holdersdo partake upside gain associate risk-taking. hence, least principle, theissuance secondary market spread subordinate debt particularly sensitiveto bank organization risk. in contrast, since equity holder may also benefit upsidegains associate risk-taking, equity issuance may provide inadequate direct

perspective. the majority u.s. bank (more commonly) holdingcompany subordinate debt instrument issue today fixed-rate, noncallable, 10-yearmaturity bond bell whistles. these two feature market, liquidity andstandardization, facilitate comparison market participant secondary marketsubordinated debt spreads. the find recent empirical research spread sensitiveto bank organization risk support depth secondary market. notsurprisingly, market participant claim routinely monitor spread various peergroups, consistent imposition indirect market discipline bankingorganizations, discipline doubt pass banks, particularly ifthe bank make sizable fraction bank hold company.existing proposalsbased appeal characteristic subordinate debt, many observer call forrequiring bank organization issue subordinate debt also call forfrequent issuance debt. require bank organization issue subordinate debtfrequently would force issue risk-sensitive debt, rather insure deposits, whenthe bank’s risk increased. without requirement, empirical evidence thatrisky bank tend shift fund source toward insure deposit away risk-sensitive securities. this evidence provide important motivation policy wouldrequire bank organization regularly issue subordinate debt. in short, mandatory andregular subordinate debt issuance would weaken bank organization’s ability shielditself direct market discipline. 5bis review 71/1999existing proposal mandatory subordinate debt typically share three common elements:first, organization require issue subordinate debt; second, subordinateddebt hold independent third parties; third, bank total subordinate debtoutstanding excess 2 percent risk-weighted assets. there are, however, number ofother practical issue consider design operational mandatorysubordinated debt policy many involve important tradeoff beweighed decide proceed.practical consideration detail mandatory subordinate debt proposalonly large banks? some proposal would require large bank issue subordinate debt.this approach consistent theme i emphasizing, importance ofdifferentiation regulatory standard supervisory practice largest, mostcomplex internationally active bank others. a begin think reform thecapital standards, example, i expect move bifurcate approach unitedstates, apply revise basle accord large, complex, internationally activebanks design simpler, le burdensome approach overwhelm majority ofu.s. banks. in supervisory program, federal reserve already focus increasedattention small number large, complex domestic foreign-owned bankingorganizations. it sensible effort enhance market discipline also focusedon banks.several argument advance suggest policy focus large bank wouldget bang regulatory buck. such bank hold significant systemic riskpotential, bank system’s asset organizations. these theinstitutions become larger, vary service practices, morecomplex and, result, difficult supervise. it also case subordinateddebt issue large bank likely large enough ensure liquid marketfor instrument. finally, large bank organization already voluntarily issue asignificant amount subordinate debt, mandatory policy could introduce withminimal transition costs.bank bank hold company? interestingly, top fifty u.s. insure commercial bank onaverage already finance excess 2 percent risk weight asset subordinateddebt. thus, many large bank already issue subordinate debt amount stipulate inmany exist subordinate debt proposals. this say, however, 2 percentsubordinated debt requirement would bite. currently, bank subordinate debt isheld parent hold company hence traded. thus require bank issuetradable debt would likely increase direct indirect discipline. moreover, theabsence requirement, risky bank organization could shift risk-insensitivedeposits and, effect, avoid market discipline. with requirement, option would beclosed risky bank would high fund costs.most large bank hold company already 2 percent risk-weighted asset subordinate debt, and, case, debt publicly traded. while suchdebt issue voluntary, organization typically come market issue subordinateddebt least twice year. bi review 71/19996most subordinate debt proposal focus banks, however, strong public policyreasons so. insure commercial bank direct access federal safety net,and thus, bank danger moral hazard consequent risk thetaxpayer concentrated. the commercial bank primary concern supervision andregulation, supervisor need market’s help. it follow asubordinated debt policy focus bank parent affiliateorganizations. in addition, subordinate debt issue bank level provide increasedprotection deposit insurance fund. and, policy focus bank would reinforce theregulatory philosophy safety net associate policy limit commercialbanks.how frequently debt issuance required? in design subordinate debt policy,one also need analyze frequency issuance would required. on one hand,frequent issuance could improve quality signal provide spread ofsubordinated debt secondary market, issuance process generally involvesincreased disclosure. this boost information content secondary price may beparticularly important period financial stress. more generally, frequent renewal ofthe information content secondary price may highly beneficial financial andtechnological innovation allow bank organization change financial conditionrapidly. frequent issuance may also result low spread market’s familiarity theissuers increases. this would, course, reduce cost subordinate debt requirement.on hand, low require frequency issuance may allow bank signal theirfinancial condition time issuance. flexibility respect issuance mayalso allow bank avoid unnecessary cost issue subordinate debt period inwhich bond market turbulent. on balance, mandate frequency twice yearwould seem reasonable, would line current practice large bankingorganizations.should subordinate debt standardize characteristic required? there alsotradeoffs associate require bank organization issue standardize debtinstrument maturity, option characteristics, covenants. the benefit ofstandardized debt fairly obvious. it make easy market participant decipher thesignals bank organization’s condition. the cost also pretty clear. a standardizeddebt instrument could costly bank issue others bankcapital structure differ across organizations. and, standardize debt instrument may verycostly certain market conditions. for example, period actual expect interestrate volatility, spread debt without put option may relatively high. i would expect thatthe benefit standardization ensure pure signal relative risk differentbanking institution would outweigh cost associate restriction.should put option required? some proposal advocate requiredsubordinated debt put options. these option suggest two reasons. first,they would provide debt holder powerful tool increase cost bank risk-taking. with put option, debt holder would able force early repayment debt abank change risk profile. second, proposals, put option take closuredecision hand regulator place hand debt holders. notcoincidentally, proposal arise wake save loan crisis 7bis review 71/1999regulators criticize forbearance. put option may also increase indirectdiscipline trigger supervisory actions.as disciplinary may be, strong argument inclusion putoptions. first, exercise put option extremely draconian, induce liquidationsand possibly premature closures. second, high correlation risk across bank mayinduce simultaneous exercise put options, could exacerbate even trigger asystemic crisis.should cap rate pay issuance subordinate debt? other proposalshave advocate subordinate debt policy impose maximum cap rate orspreads treasury comparable maturities. the primary appeal approachis direct market discipline would relatively strong rate cap. bankingorganizations unable issue cap would force low riskiness byshrinking asset change asset mix. a cap could also use strengthenindirect discipline. a bank organization’s inability issue subordinate debt capwould send “red flag” market. alternatively, cap could use triggersupervisory action way bank organization’s capital ratio currentlytrigger prompt corrective action.the downside cap would difficult, perhaps practice impossible, todetermine optimal rate spread serve cap, particularly since optimalcap would vary bond market macroeconomic conditions. a fix cap might harshlypunish bank organization unnecessarily bond market highly illiquid. afixed cap might also highly procyclical. bank organization would force shrink,change asset mix, face supervisory discipline downturn spreadswould likely run fix cap times. while procyclical effect ofmarket discipline unavoidable, fix rate cap may make market discipline policy soseverely procyclical undesirable macroeconomic perspective.as one consider various feature recommend existingsubordinated debt proposals, important keep mind strong reason tostay closely align current market practice conventions. capitalize suchconventions could, course, reduce potential cost subordinate debt policy. and, atthe time, subordinate debt policy align convention could veryeffective. give current deep liquid market subordinate debt, policywould likely improve information content secondary market debt spreads. thesespreads would facilitate increase indirect market discipline.questions value subordinate debt requirementit important recognize cost benefit subordinate debt policy – evenone tailor current market convention – would vary time.subordinated debt time stress. a mandatory subordinate debt requirement would likelybe costly bank organization either market stress, economyis deteriorating, bank financial difficulty. during periods, cost ofissuing risk-sensitive security would likely increase, and, times, force issuance ofsubordinated debt would particularly costly. bi review 71/19998i believe proposal increase market discipline inevitably risk aggravate instability intimes overall stress. eliminate deposit insurance, example, would samequalitative outcome. the key design approach enhance market discipline istherefore ensure favorable tradeoff – sufficiently good control risk-taking goodtimes bad time relative somewhat aggravate risk period overall stress.subordinated debt, relatively long maturity therefore limit ability “run,”appears offer favorable tradeoff..the cost reduce fund flexibility. another major cost subordinate debt proposalwould reduce flexibility financing, result somewhat high cost financingthan would otherwise available. these high cost may also vary business conditions,market conditions, bank conditions.one irony subordinate debt proposal suggest additional regulationis require induce additional market discipline. regulation never costless, must,therefore, ask additional cost might impose consequence mandate.of course, extent proposal follow exist market convention – term ofthe amount, frequency, etc. – incremental cost limited, though, course, thebenefits. it therefore important satisfy benefit outweigh costs.more research importanta subordinate debt proposal is, judgment, promise intriguing. still, remainquestions answered. to move direction answers, federal reserve isworking improve data available market price subordinate debt issuedby bank bank hold companies, well market data could useful insignaling change risk profile bank organizations. we evaluate thedegree price market instrument track change risk profile bankingorganizations, assess usefulness market signal surveillance thefinancial condition large, complex bank organizations, evaluate potentialusefulness data supervisory process. we believe seriouslyconsider impose mandate

would subordinate debt holder uninsured deposit holderswhen raise fund cost risky bank? doe strength penalty associate withbank debt issuance vary systematically across bank liability business cycle? thisresearch may also help u understand strike balance supervision, regulation,and market discipline order effectively achieve safety soundness ourfinancial system.conclusion 9bis review 71/1999i hope

recent crisis east asia, latin america andrussia. new approach advocate context discussion newinternational financial architecture.the response recent crises, follow-up consideration measure prevent similarcrises, possible action meet occur, cover wide spectrum ofpolicies. the debate cover many policy issues: domestic external, macro micro,financial regulatory, national multilateral, relate develop emergingeconomies. eminent academic also contribute debate. at policy level, havebeen discussion g-7, g-24, newly found g-22, g-33 financial stabilityforum, speak commonwealth secretariat, un, imf, world bank bis. indiahas invite participate these. in deliberations, external debtpolicies crucial part. perhaps ideal forum describe new dimensionsbriefly narrate indian position.the new dimension relate external debt policy analyse five broad heads,viz.: level reserve external debt; maturity pattern; issue relate short-term debt;policies relate transparency standards; involve private sector forestallinga debt crisis.level reserve external debtthere always continuous inconclusive discussion optimum level ofreserves. traditionally, however, adequacy reserve mainly link importrequirements. incidentally, recent experience show country holdinglarge level reserve necessarily escape crisis. this show importance ofappropriate policy avoidance excessive comfort level reserves. nevertheless,the level reserve continue important source comfort matter relate bi review 69/19992stability external sector, consequently domestic economy. because theimportance show real level reserve transparent manner, increasingefforts measure unencumbered reserves. the emphasis also shift measure theadequacy reserve relation import measure term short-term liabilities,in particular short-term debt.two notable suggestion regard emanate – one pablo guidotti, deputyfinance minister argentina, second bank international settlements.mr pablo guidotti propose simple guideline policy maker emerge marketeconomies. he suggest country manage external asset liability insuch way always able live without new foreign borrow one year.in words, usable foreign exchange reserve exceed schedule amortisation offoreign currency debt (assuming rollovers) follow year. in term debtmanagement, imply limit size debt, particular short-term debt debtthat fall due repayment.the bis, late annual report, recognise importance country preparingthemselves possibility sudden outflows, identify way reserve canbe build up. one way run trade surplus bi term lessdisruptive solution argentine proposal, namely borrow reserve arrangecontingent lend facility private sector. in view bis, “given swingsof mood markets, authority might certain time find relatively easy andinexpensive lock longer-term foreign currency loan late use. finally, countriesmight make use recently announce contingent credit line offer imf.in conjunction similar private sector arrangements, would joint testimonial tothe soundness country question could contribute materially avoidance ofcontagion problems”.in somewhat similar vein, chairman greenspan express view country could adopta “liquidity-at-risk” standard manage exposure financial risks. this standard wouldgive ex ante probability country would avoid new borrow one year, base onthe level reserves.in india, steadily build reserve encourage non-debt-creating flowsand de-emphasize debt-creating flows. india’s foreign exchange reserve steadilyincreasing years. for instance, last three year saw increase reserve therange $4.7 billion 1996/97, $2.9 billion 1997/98 $3.1 billion 1998/99, i.e. acumulative $10 billion. however, end-march 1996 december 1998, india’s totalexternal debt increase mere $2 billion.our policy build maintain adequate level reserve timeconstraining debt, especially short-term debt, continue though would continuouslymonitor international debate regard.maturity patternin many emerge countries, deregulation liberalisation, adequate attention notbeen pay maturity profile external debt portfolio. in fact, cases, eveninformation gather subject dispense part deregulation. determiningthe maturity micro decision leave final borrowers, whose main consideration wascost. thus, borrower many emerge market economy tend borrow short witha view minimise cost. creditor lend short-term since expect claim mature 3bis review 69/1999quickly. the recent crisis show could risky. the policy dimension relate anappropriate maturity structure, early view micro decision, beingrecognised macro aspect stability issue.elongation average maturity ensure sort private sector burden share time ofcrisis. it important recognise insurance embed long-term debt oftenoutweighs cost.these issue direct relevance corporates’ access external funds, term ofcost period borrowing. the cost borrow may increase account longermaturities, comfort stable flows. in time crisis, cost ofdisruption account destabilise flow may far exceed cost raise longer-termdebt.there issue policy maker could promote ensure optimal maturitystructure. there several view optimal maturity is. there oneinfluential view average maturity country’s external liability exceed acertain threshold, say three years.in india, 1992, emphasis lay cost size debt, also onthe maturity. the desire maturity profile take account policy articulation andclearance individual cases. the average maturity ecb, may aware, fiveyears. basically, consideration size, cost maturity embed clearancemechanism ecb.thus, ecb policy, though liberalise gradually, ensure built-in measurestowards optimal maturity. the instrument objective achieve willcontinue refine time time, take account international development also.short-term debta major source vulnerability asian crisis large stock short-term liabilitiesof bank corporates. in short-term liabilities, debt constitute contractual obligationand thus different footing. a mentioned, link short-term debt andreserves come fore deliberations. there cost build reservesthrough large debt flow since cost debt would generally high return onreserves. however, short-term flow bad short-term finance essential tofinance transactions. in fact, recognise trade-related short-term credit asvolatile non-trade-related credit.overall, appear consensus favour restrain inflow short-termcapital markets, institution regulatory framework sufficientlystrengthened.there is, however, grow debate mean short-term flow becontrolled. major suggestion relate effective monitoring, tax spot transactions, variedreserve requirements, increase capital requirement interbank transactions, change incapital adequacy requirement lend bank non-oecd countries, discouraginglocal firm undertake external borrow impose taxes. quantitative controlshave also recognise effective.the oft-quoted measure relate reserve requirement impose short-term flows. chileand colombia impose unremunerated reserve requirement 30 per cent short-term bi review 69/19994flows, subsequently reduce 10 per cent. this represent tax short-term holdings. theempirical evidence effectiveness inconclusive.a favourite economist never-tried tobin tax, though often beenseriously consider policy makers. the tobin tax proposal envisage levy uniformtax spot transaction foreign exchange. the objective discourage one-nightstand speculator foreign exchange market tax burden inverselyproportional maturity flows. another economist, dornbusch, seek variant thetobin tax, viz., impose tax cross-border flows. this also draw table sofar.paul krugman recently suggest emerge nation consider use tax todiscourage local firm borrow foreign currencies. tax uniform rate alarger impact short-term borrowing, thus operate somewhat similar way thetobin tax.the role financial intermediaries, especially banks, short-term flow figuredpredominantly deliberations. alan greenspan also propose impose increasedcapital requirement borrow bank bring great discipline cross-border interbankmarkets.it accept irresponsible borrow without irresponsiblelending, short-term borrow without short-term lending. hence, argue thatcapital requirement bank system prescribe discourage lendingbanks also. in fact, current policy bias favour short-term lending. the currentbasle accord provide claim bank incorporate oecd country short-term claim (i.e. one year) bank incorporate non-oecd country carry riskweight 20 per cent, whereas long-term claim bank non-oecd country carrya risk weight 100 per cent. the new capital adequacy framework, beenissued bi consultative paper comments, review norm.most proposal effect increase cost short-term debt. hence,these development would interest corporate sector.in india,

(2)an active supervisory program; (3) improve bank disclosure allow marketplace toevaluate institution’s risk posture reward discipline appropriately.in remark today, i would like address many points, particular emphasison supervisory process federal reserve adapt change. at outset, iwould emphasize bank supervision is, nature, dynamic process. our practice mustconstantly improve become quickly outdated. supervisor must also flexible, intheir application supervisory technique bank expectation regard practicesindividual bank follow.perhaps other, u.s. bank system highly diverse, thousand smallcommunity bank small number increasingly large, highly complex, internationally activeinstitutions account grow share total bank assets. neither single supervisory approach,nor single risk management technique work all. that need flexibility adaptation hasbeen well serve dual bank system ability individual state state charteredbanks innovate.large complex bank organizationsone aspect supervision become crucial oversight process relate systemicrisk activity large bank organizations. a decade ago, example, 20largest u.s. bank organization hold 68 percent asset 50 large bank holdingcompanies; 82 percent. then, 20 large hold company hold 37 percent u.s.commercial bank assets; figure rise 64 percent.those figure conceal, course, dramatic increase complexity activitiesrepresented securitizations derivative products. the notional value derivative futurescontracts hold u.s. bank exceed $33 trillion, nearly five time level end 1990.securitizations u.s. banks, $270 billion, grow fast expand beyondconsumer-based loans, credit card auto loans, commercial credits. virtually thesesecuritization derivative activity concentrate among large banks. while notionalvalues amount securitized say almost nothing level underlie risk individualbanks, speak strongly increase volume complexity large bank activity thesomewhat hide risk face. for organizations, balance sheet traditional lend havemuch different mean decade ago.last year, federal reserve respond trend sharpen supervisory focus asmaller number large complex bank organizations, domestic foreign. we giveincreased attention roughly twenty u.s.-owned another ten foreign-owned banks. althoughthey generally large institution supervise, warrant great attention onlybecause size, also on-and off-balance sheet activities, broad range ofproducts services, complex domestic international oversight structure, theirrole payment settlement systems. we refer lcbos, “large, complex bankingorganizations.”in supervise institution recognize unique complex isparticularly necessary analysts, examiners, supervisor understand sound practiceswithin industry compare activity risk management technique among institutions.accordingly, take “portfolio” approach, whereby evaluate practice across institutionswhere find similar business lines, characteristics, risk profiles. this approach foster moreinformed consistent supervision among institution provide supervisory staff greateropportunities identify promote sound practices. it also accommodate readily thedevelopment coordination staff expertise throughout federal reserve system. 3bis review 67/1999the federal reserve’s supervisory approach toward lcbos require ongoing monitoring, include aformal re-evaluation institution’s risk profile quarterly update supervisory plan.this periodic assessment based, part, internal management reports, internal external auditreports, publicly available information. since organization typically conduct broad rangeof regulate activities, supervisory staff must also frequently communicate coordinate ownactivities bank nonbank regulators.management oversight process rest senior staff member designate cpc, “centralpoint contact.” that individual, turn, coordinate virtually interaction federalreserve institution, direct identify team examination supervisory staff

organizational operational structure consider activity ofother supervisor — highlighting, again, need communication coordination. the planshould address major risk (e.g., credit risk, market risk,

statement industry publication need revise 1988 basel capital bi review 67/19994accord improve, generally, credit risk management banks. credit risk alwaysbeen dominant risk banking, yet remain crudely measured. this lack quantitativelyrigorous risk measurement within industry explain develop current accord wedid.the trouble measure credit risk hard. experience banker examiner usuallydistinguish good loan bad one, quantify level risk portfolio basis bank-wide quite different matter. much attention devote exercise within industryand among bank supervisors, solution hand. best practice bank early research thefederal reserve suggest significant stride make credit risk management, theindustry regulator still long way go. it — — high priority forthe industry supervisors.last year, may recall, unite state country represent baselsupervisors committee adopt new capital requirement trade activity base abank’s internal measure “value risk.” that regulatory amendment represent important shiftin regulatory think great willingness regulatory community build riskmanagement practice banks. with market risk, though, basic element “value-at-risk”measure relatively well established, although institution still need strengthen certainaspects calculation management processes.in exercise, necessary data identify current trade position measure thehistorical volatility market value also generally available. the mark-to-market processand short horizon daily trade also help greatly evaluate effectiveness overall“accuracy” market risk models.none crucial element exist today measure credit risk, industry practice yetconverged around particular measure credit risk, even conceptual definition credit loss.some models, example, identify loss borrower defaults, largely reflect viewthat bank hold asset matures. if model forecast default relevanttime horizon, calculate expect loss, “loss rate, give default.” other model take moreof mark-to-market approach, recognize gain loss economic value loanportfolio result default expect defaults, also change creditquality borrower different market economic conditions.as sense, model structure assumption become crucial. moreover, fundamental input— borrower’s credit risk rat — highly subjective largely determine internallywithin bank. some borrower public debt rat recognize rat agencies, mostdo not. even public rat need translate rat schedule bank. this lack ofcredit risk data serious weakness, even large bank lack enough historical defaultexperience give borrower type

banks, domestically abroad.moreover, unlike trade activities, relate capital requirement represent small part ofthe total, credit risk counts. we need get measure right obvious reasons. “getting right”means also provide proper risk management incentive banks.far need do measure manage credit risk do far u.s.and foreign banks. a i noted, much progress make recent years, make mistake. butmuch progress necessary large banks, themselves, gain solid grasp theirrisk exposure risk management purposes, let alone supervisor able substantiallyrevise capital accord. 5bis review 67/1999in recent month federal reserve staff visit number large money center bank understandbetter role credit risk model perform senior management’s internal assessment theinstitution’s capital adequacy. while, again, progress made, result somewhatdisappointing. nearly institution indicate internal reviews, focus largelyon factor target external credit rat regulatory risk-based capital ratiosrelative primary

evaluation bank capital risk-basedcapital ratio. while regulator flat use capital standard internal andmarketplace analysis, must emphasize well-known shortcoming standard make itan inappropriate tool many internal market purposes. we expect institution ahead ofregulators analysis, way around.where model available, generally pertain commercial credits, use principally inset concentration exposure limits, pricing, evaluate performance risk/return basis.important uses, sure, case management indicate risk measure offer asignificant input evaluate institution’s overall capital adequacy.this

animproved capital standard good risk management process, stick management willbe judged, part, ability quantify risk. in large part, virtue also reward. banksthat effectively measure manage risk make price credit better.new capital proposalas i mention earlier, basel committee bank supervision release longawaited consultative report revision 1988 basel capital accord. for large institutions,the accord increasingly weaken change occur financial markets.most importantly bank abroad engage capital arbitrage technique designedto move high quality, lower-risk asset security markets, sometimes reduce capitalcharges asset proportional retain risk positions. in addition, theremaining higher-credit risk asset regulatory capital charge lower-risk assetsthat securitized, change mean resultant capital ratio. for otherreasons, 1988 accord become increasingly undermine risk-weighted capital ratioshave become difficult interpret.modifying accord incredibly complex difficult procedure, must benegotiated among 12 nation affect policy many more, also issue sodifficult. a i noted, underlie approach three equally important legs, reflectefforts respond evolve change financial markets. the first leg modification thecapital accord per se, especially large complex bank organizations, important ofwhich change risk-weighting scheme portfolio assets. the framework call formoving four-weight scheme — asset one weight regardless risk — tomultiple sensitive risk weight also include step curtail loophole deal withsecuritization transactions. the risk weights, turn, would base perhaps one combinationof techniques: external ratings, internal management risk ratings, and/or bank-specific formal riskmodels. please note these, process leverage market’s risk evaluation,including bank management apply purposes. consistency improvement inbank risk management thus prerequisite improved, rational, capital regulation.the second leg increase market discipline. market discipline, course, occur theextent bank make information available creditor counterparties abilityto respond information. thus, consultative document contemplate transparency bi review 67/19996about bank risk-taking control creditor counterparties decide rationallyabout require compensation risk deal bank. of course, objective tocreate incentive rational efficient risk take bank.the final leg supervisory review capital adequacy bank organization. the purposeis twofold: first, ensure bank’s capital position consistent overall risk profile andstrategy and, second, encourage early supervisory intervention. the purpose review toprovide supervisory comfort bank’s internal process assess capital adequacy, andthat bank’s actual capital levels, consistent scale complexity risk takingactivities. in cases, review may well result require individual bank hold morecapital minimum regulatory standard.as think capital standard year ahead, seem appropriate consider morebifurcated approach: one standard large, complex institutions; another banks. thatdirection seem especially necessary pursue sophisticated, risk sensitive measure ofcredit risk capture development technique large complex bankingorganizations. my sense great complexity would unnecessary community banks, wherea simpler, le burdensome approach may quite satisfactory supervisory purpose mostbanks. nevertheless, bank take heart message federal reserve othersupervisors send need strong practice evaluate credit risk.loan loss reserveson topic capital, i would like say word loan loss reserve interaction ofthe federal

else, perception “competition discovery process”which shape thinking. this approach extreme relevance economics go farbeyond this. relate “discovery” “pretence knowledge” permanent danger

theinstitute economic affairs, institution devote study propagation liberal idea – tothe idea liberty. i accept immediately, reflect obvious time constraints.it institute economic affair 1976 publish hayek’s “choice currency: away stop inflation”. i choose subject lecture follow reasons. first allbecause i might comparative advantage subject relate monetary economics.having join executive board

bretton wood system become apparent late 1960s. in 1973 *i wish thank frank browne vitor gaspar valuable co-operation prepare article.1see jürgen badura und otmar issing, geldpolitik, stuttgart

unemployment. the policy bring world unfavourable conjuncture,and could characterise belief “money matter” hubris excessivereliance demand management, ostensibly failed. a robert lucas commented: “this thelegacy stagflation: general loss confidence, whether warrant not, formerly acceptedframework guide discretionary economic management”.4hayek’s view development become clear from, example, excerpt nobellecture, deliver december 1974: “economists are, moment, call upon say toextricate free world serious threat accelerate inflation which, must admitted,has bring policy majority economist recommend even urgedgovernments pursue. we indeed moment little cause pride: profession madea mess things.” he expand upon 1976:5 “practically government history usedtheir exclusive power issue money order defraud plunder people”.it background hayek propose radical solution. it call le thecomplete abolition government’s monopoly issue fiat money, leave way openfor comprehensive competition supply private sector. in hobart paper special no. 70,he spell philosophy respect free competition supply money: “the purpose ofthis scheme impose upon exist monetary financial agency much need disciplineby make impossible them, length time, issue kind moneysubstantially le reliable useful money other. a soon public becamefamiliar new possibilities, deviation straight path provide honestmoney would lead rapid displacement offend currency others. and theindividual countries, deprive various dodge able temporarily toconceal effect action ‘protecting’ currency, would constrain keep thevalue currency tolerably stable” (p.125).although proposal implemented, contribution kindle lively far-reaching debateon role government monetary system, debate address choice freemarket monetary regime government management monetary system via central bank. theproposal profound radical conception lead advocate laissez-faireapproach aspect economic life (milton friedman, example) put defensive.as happened, hayek also hold pretty strong view monetary union europe, ideawhich still rather embryonic stage comment 1978: scheme ofcompeting currency seem “… preferable practicable utopianscheme introduce new european currency, would ultimately effect moredeeply entrench source root monetary evil, government monopoly issueand control money” (p. 126). 3see michael bruno jeffrey sachs, “economics worldwide

chicago 1980, p. 204.5“choice currency: way stop inflation”, iea occasional paper 48, 1976. 3bis review 66/19992.summary presentation assessment hayek’s proposal compete currenciesthe proposal put forward hayek, is, full competition private issuer currency, anextremely interest concept. it relate debate viability unregulated bank tothe literature historical experience free banking.6the basic idea seem follows: create possibility bank issue currency would openthe way competition. bank could issue non-interest-bearing certificate open cheque accountson basis distinct register trade mark. different bank would issue differentcertificates, currencies. the currency different bank would trade variable exchangerates. competition profit maximisation would lead equilibrium bank payinga competitive return liability could survive. since currency correspond non-interest-bearing certificates, crucial requirement maintenance value currency. so, inequilibrium, currency guarantee stable purchase power would exist. bank fail tobuild reputation currency would lose customer drive business.hayek opinion proposal would, implemented, contribute overall stabilityof economy. in monograph wrote: “the past instability market economy theconsequence exclusion important regulator market mechanism, money, fromitself regulate market process” (denationalisation money – argument refined,p. 192; hobart paper special no. 70, 2nd (extended) edition, iea (1978); italic original).let examine characteristic equilibrium envisage hayek’s proposal.7 themarginal cost produce issue currency (in form note coin) rather low(close zero).8 in context type competition envisage hayek, nominal rate ofinterest would drive (close) zero. if real rate interest require lender lend fund toborrowers positive (say 3%), equilibrium loan market would require lender wouldhave reward rate deflation equal real rate. this would produce outcome thathas advocate normative rule inflation friedman past, is, situation inwhich money non-interest-bearing, optimal rate inflation set equal negativeof real rate interest. this analogous, context, well-known correlation betweenfree competition efficiency (pareto optimality).hayek’s privatisation proposal would, initially least, involve multiplicity privately issuedmoneys. if fail trade par, unlikely give financial health thedifferent issuer likely different, also likely multiplicity exchange rate willalso emerge privately issue currencies. so long restriction impose onthe hold different currencies, likely depreciate value would, accord tohayek’s logic, drive existence, lead situation currency stablevalues would remain existence.hayek believe competition currency discovery process, would leadto stable non-inflationary outcome. in respect, may best let hayek speak himself,which i quote denationalisation money: “indeed, if, i convinced, main 6hayek’s proposal must distinguish free banking, refer monetary system without acentral bank, private bank would allow issue currency bank deposit withoutrestriction. a practise 19th century, version free bank involve banknote beingredeemable gold silver coin. (see lawrence h white, free bank britain, theory, experience,and debate, 1800 – 1845. institute economic affairs, london, 1995).7it note that, hayek’s proposal, equilibrium assume exist stable, informationis complete, symmetric acquire cost. see charles goodhart, the evolution central banks, mitpress, 1988.8this assumption make milton friedman seminal paper, “the optimum quantity money” in“the optimum quantity money essays”, aldine publish company, chicago, 1969. bi review 66/19994advantage market order price convey act individual relevantinformation, constant observation course

self-steering mechanism individual constantly induce adjust theiractivities circumstance information abstract signal prices.it serviceable link process communicate effect event never whollyknown anybody require maintain order plan participate personsmatch” (p. 192/193).nevertheless, despite hayek’s claim discovery process, economist would argue thatfree competition respect money couldn’t guarantee either stable efficient outcome.this fundamental point.in order try understand ass hayek’s proposal, essential take close look moneyand role economy. this best do by, were, first break money itsconstituent functions. the classic textbook treatment function money still valid: moneyfulfils three functions, namely (i) unit account, (ii) mean payment (iii) store ofvalue.the use money unit account is, arguably, basic monetary function. it thenumeraire, is, unit quote prices, draw funds, negotiate contracts, forperforming economic calculations. in regard, money basic convention society, thelanguage standard measurement. this seem hayek-like way look atmoney.indeed, fundamental problem economics hayek coordinate plan manyindependent individuals. competition market system lead co-ordination.individuals, act self-interest, respond price signals. prices, turn, reflect theinformation available society. price signal allow transmission previously unknowninformation synthetic relevant way purpose economic calculus. now, prices– impersonal signal provide extensive social division labour – express term ofmoney. irving fisher coin term “money yardstick”.9the unit account represent respective unit money (that is, euro, u dollar, thejapanese yen, etc.) metric measure tape. with inflation deflation, measure tape keepschanging time. the unit account, represent money, become elastic uncertaindimension one time even uncertain dimension extend period time intothe future. inflation deflation, therefore, mean common unit-of-account language or, say,money language, unit account provide foundations, change time. anduncertain inflation, tend accompany high inflation, mean unit account ischanging uncertain ways.this impair efficiency common money language and, therefore, communication co-ordination economy. “its undependability impair meet mind borrower andlenders transactors; impair economic calculation co-ordination” (greenfield andyeager, 1983).10 one

crucially whether unit account always mean thing differentindividuals one moment time. a necessary condition mean thesame thing price stability prevail moment time credible commitmentthat continue

discovery process, would characterise competition bank supply ofcurrency. there many question leave unanswered hayek discovery processwould work practice. how would economy function discovery process? since badissuers are, accord theory, drive fact recourse inflationaryissuance, suggest discovery process would characterise inflation.furthermore, if, say, single stable currency initially emerge discovery process, howcould one sure that, establish monopoly, private issuer would then, time-inconsistent fashion become familiar politically dependent central banks, start toengage inflationary over-issue maximise seigniorage? and even issuer tosurvive, could one sure result oligopoly situation would result collusionand/or instabilities?another potential problem hayek proposal real rate interest would tend varyacross business cycle response short-run pressure supply demand loan sotoo, accord scheme, would rate deflation. and, course, steady rate deflationwould emerge whole private sector discovery process stable, reasonableperson might permit doubt. it would therefore appear outcome earnestly desire byhayek, money stable value, would achieve practice proposal competingcurrencies.in situation money issue many different issuer hayek’s proposal and,either over-issuing agent poor investment decisions, issuesfailed trade parity, many different numeraires could emerge. in principle, could, theend, many numeraires issuers. in presence many numeraires or, moremeaningfully, absence single numeraire, financial communication, base common 12as well know now, govern council ecb opt strict price stability anobjective rather define price stability “as year-on-year increase harmonise index ofconsumer price (hipc) euro area 2%”. price stability, accord definition, “is tobe maintain medium term”. bi review 66/19996money language would provide single numeraire, would degenerate. this wouldprobably result poor co-ordination economy, efficiency decentraliseddecision-making firm households, hallmark capitalist economies, beingjeopardised productive potential economy gravely endangered. the purely privateprovision public good (the unit-of-account function money) would, case, sub-optimalsince private issuer cannot easily underpin single numeraire. nor incentive doso since cannot capture vast social benefit common monetary language provide bythe unit-of-account function money.there issue proposal spirit hayek would confront. first, useof money transaction make subject network externalities. network externalities, turn, mayinhibit free competition may make difficult, impossible, dislodge incumbent issuerwho resort inflationary issuance. in words, network externality would inhibithayek’s discovery process work envisage it. network externality also provide arationale regulation. second, assumption complete, symmetric free informationimplicitly assume hayek proposal apply banking. the remark equally valid interms bank activity (for example, fundamental activity bank evaluation thecreditworthiness borrowers) bank (the special nature balance sheet ofbanks make valuation risk assessment particularly difficult). in absence symmetricinformation, important issue moral hazard, adverse selection systemic stability becomerelevant.13networking externality therefore mean guarantee new entrant marketfor supply money would able dislodge incumbent issuer(s) resort toinflationary issuance, give inertia inherent part phenomenon subject networkingeffects currencies. in case, people will believe claim anypotential new entrant currency will, unlike incumbent(s), turn stable? inmy opinion, many unanswered question hayek’s proposal currency competitionto viable candidate society search stable monetary system.furthermore, unlikely kind uncertainty future price hayek wantedto banish proposal (“..a money stable value really best hope for”) would bethe outcome proposal implemented. hayek’s discovery process could, thecontrary, entail substantial cost practice. accord logic free competition inprivately issue currencies, nominal interest rate would drive zero with, alreadyexplained, deflation outcome. hayek’s proposal would therefore deliver seem topromise, namely price stability. under proposal, would still uncertainty futureprice level.3. hayek gresham’s lawunder hayek’s scheme, market force would determine relative value different competingcurrencies. in words, exchange rate compete currency would float freely.people would want hold currency issuer expect depreciate relativeto one expect hold value term purchase power good services.therefore, good money maintain purchase power would drive depreciation- andinflation-prone bad money. however, inconceivable compete private issuer woulddecide collude fix relative value currencies. they would agree tointervene mutually whenever currency question come pressure market forthese currencies. this would easy do, would likely succeed, afew issuer leave hayekian discovery process reach equilibrium state.although could outcome hayek world compete private currencies, wouldclearly appreciate hayek himself. this arrangement arrive 13see, example, goodhart, op. cit. 7bis review 66/1999at private issuer counter tendency value different money fluctuate againsteach other, bad money would begin drive good money, exact opposite whathayek espoused. in words, gresham’s law would, likely, start apply.as hayek put it: “if law make two kind money perfect substitute payment ofdebts force creditor accept coin small content gold place one largercontent, debtor will, course, pay former find profitable use thesubstance latter”.14 and: “(gresham’s law) false, apply fix rate ofexchange different form money enforced” (italics original15). the bad (i.e. over-issued inflation-prone) money would start drive good (i.e. well-managed andmaintaining stable purchase power) money. more bad money would produce theexpense good money inflation would accelerate.in principle, hayek’s proposal also work national currency produce monopolistically bycentral banks, provide currency question convertible freely exchange againsteach foreign exchange markets. in settings, good national currency tend toincrease importance relative bad, inflation-prone, national currencies. this naturally constrainsthe ability national government use “their exclusive power issue money order defraudand plunder people” (op. cit.). in context, i think fair say widespread use thedeutschmark, example, international investment currency symptomatic enduringsuccess bundesbank maintaining, relative terms, internal purchase power thedeutschmark. however, long national currency remain legal tender within ownnational boundaries, scope good national currency drive bad national currency maynot complete hayek world compete private currency none thesecurrencies status legal tender. in words, hayek’s competition currency goesbeyond limit competition see foreign exchange market nationalcurrencies.if limit competition national currency sufficient constrain domesticmonetary policy engage excessive monetary creation, government may decide tie itshands opt currency board arrangement. this would eliminate possibility anydiscretionary domestic monetary policy action since domestic component monetary basecould change response change foreign currency component base. despite theonly limit experience currency board arrangement date, experience wouldnevertheless allow u declare it, provisionally, success.some government opt arrangement found, however, recentfinancial market turbulence, economy immune contagious spillover despitehaving fairly healthy economic fundamentals. this result currency board arrangement notbeing unequivocal one since government question retain option revoke thearrangement. financial market therefore factor possibility calculation andactions, ensure country suffer contagious effects. this stimulate debate asto whether would good currency board country go beyond currency boardarrangement opt full “dollarisation”, allow domestic currency replace entirelyby “dollar” transactions.hayek espouse denationalisation currencies. he recommend achieve acomprehensive privatisation supply money. it notable that, two route todenationalisation currency take far, neither follow route recommend byhayek. one route take government eu11 international agreement ofequals, result arrival euro. another route so-called 14see denationalisation money, op. cit., p. 142.15see also denationalisation money, op. cit., p. 142 bi review 66/19998“dollarisation”, whereby country voluntarily relinquish currency favour adopt aforeign currency, “dollar”.it appear me, therefore, hayek proposal, likely get either one ofthe follow unfavourable outcomes. on one hand, could see emergence floatingexchange rate different privately issue moneys, result uncertain discovery processwithout guarantee stable outcome, along deterioration economic communicationand co-ordination economy overall. on hand, attempt private issuer pre-empt outcome fix exchange rate currency would probably triggergresham’s law result accelerate inflation.4.the importance inside moneysince birth central banking, government – via central bank – supply financialinstruments simultaneously fulfil three function money i alreadymentioned. they suppress competition supply currency bank reserve (that is, so-called outside money). however, suppress competition supply othercomponents money, is, so-called inside money, supply exclusively theprivate sector. until recently, inside money consist exclusively bank deposit weresupplied competitively banks. however, government nevertheless restrict supply ofmeans payment store value private sector past. but verysubstantially liberalise last 20 year so. the result availability efficientmeans payment also serve good store value (and thus hedge inflation)has improve almost beyond recognition compare available period offinancial repression.although government retain monopoly production high-powered money, theyhave always permit indeed increasingly encourage competition production insidemoney. the upshot outside money comprise rather small fraction totalmoney balance (taking, say, broad definition money stock). after undergo dramaticdecline, particularly period follow second world war, range 1% inthe unite state 5% unite kingdom 6% germany.16 government haveretained monopoly production high-powered money. there good reason forthis. note coin issue central bank and, cases, government unique inthe follow sense: instrument mediate transaction settle withfinality one time, virtue legal tender status. currency alsounique supply unit account whole economy.although privately supply inside money publicly supply outside money compete oneanother transaction medium store value, nevertheless kind symbiotic relationshipbetween two. this is, first, inside money (predominantly bank deposits) may owe itsacceptability fact issuer promise, indeed legally bound, redeem [eitherimmediately (sight deposits), upon maturity (time deposits) period notice (savingsdeposits)] outside money and, second, outside money provide unit account thewhole system without inside money might le acceptable absence single(commodity) numeraire.seen light, appear hayek correct argue efficiency (price) stabilitywould enhance money supply privately competitively. indeed, fact thatmost conventionally measure money stock comprise predominantly inside money,i.e. money supply private enterprise, specifically medium-of-exchange store-of-value function inside money. hayek’s argument free competition supply moneyare therefore, principle, applicable two function inside money. however, i believe 16both u german figure correct estimate hold dollar dm currency heldoutside u germany respectively. 9bis review 66/1999was mistake think economy would best serve

service market europe.5.hayek transpose onto world new payment technology e-moneyhayek’s analysis comment relate world might call analogue money, is,money represent book entry (bank deposits, so-called inside money) form ofpaper note metal coin (so-called outside money). despite fact many early prediction ofthe demise paper money turn false, i think safe say last make wayto ongoing digitalisation revolution reflect dramatic progress computer andcommunications technologies. these development underpin rapid advance paymentand settlement infrastructures. it enable new payment medium emerge compete directlywith mean payment, note coin, issue central bank back bygovernment. new payment medium take many forms, commonly know prepay cardsand debit cards. still advance form digital money, electronic network money, havenow become technically feasible may soon make commercial appearance. these present newopportunities much efficient payment system, time pose new challenge formonetary arrangement monetary policy.an aspect worth emphasise fact central bank money form note coindoes need payment infrastructure order mediate payments. a already noted,central bank money perform payment settlement function (with finality) one thesame time, virtue legal tender status. however, privately issue financial instrument (bankdeposits, example) money sense unless complement payment infrastructure.the analogue payment structure become familiar many country arecheques cheque clearing. the payment technology become available privatesector undergo unprecedented improvements. the effect likely profound. theirwidespread application could eventually mean radical rethink understand bymoney. in particular, increasingly provide private enterprise far great scope tocompete directly central bank note coin payment media.there specific part process deserve special attention. when delaybetween transaction settlement, case exist privately supply paper-based bi review 66/199910payment settlement infrastructure (using cheque paper-based direct debits, example),there element risk attach payment effect way. a number ofdifferent type risk involve – credit risk, interest rate risk, operational risk, etc. the risksinvolved privately base payment medium impart comparative advantage currency atransaction medium, since latter instrument could perform payment andsettlement function (with finality) one time. and virtue legal tenderstatus. this mean note coin facilitate transaction anonymous market situation sincethe seller never concern himself/herself creditworthiness buyer.however, important feature new electronic payment settlement infrastructure itsability (at least potentially) compress transaction settlement time lag virtually zeroin economic time. this create essentially new situation potential obviate many, ifnot all, type risk normally encounter execute payment settlement withinside money and, principle, allow much wide array assets, especially marketable assets, tobe mobilise transaction media. the new technology allow vendor verify purchaserpossesses sufficient fund cover transaction and, principle, permit transfer fundsto vendor’s bank account real time. it allow vendor verify real time thefunds indeed credit his/her account. this allow settlement transaction withfinality occur virtually time transaction itself.privately supply payment instrument therefore potential, complement withthe up-to-date computer communication technologies, provide attractivealternative note coin transaction medium. and, give former also potentiallymuch efficient number ways, inconceivable one could face prospect arapid erosion role note coin transaction medium not-too-distant future.the type network effect support acceptance euro thosesupporting growth electronic competition note coin. more specifically, price peopleare will pay use electronic mean payment increase number existingusers (demand-side economy scale), price would pay would likely tofall result decline unit cost production output expand (supply-side economy ofscale, tend large network products) competition force low cost bepassed customers. this dynamic would, course, start take effect critical massof usage attained.there may also force promote growth electronic mean payment work areunique euro area changeover process stage three (b) economic monetaryunion. the conventional channel access currency retail level (that note coin)will available case euro first three years, throughout stage three (a)of monetary union. the mean access euro households, possibly many smallfirms, may therefore via electronic media, electronic money electronic access productsthat allow scriptural money (bank deposits) denominate euro mobilise transactionpurposes. the non-availability euro form note coin could therefore impart anextra stimulus growth e-money electronic access products.the assumption current perspective new payment instrument beissued private issuers. despite fairly extensive discussion topic among central bankers,there suggestion central bank issue e-money involve new retailelectronic payment infrastructure active participant. therefore, growth electronic meansof payment amount important step process privatisation field thepayments monetary system, especially new digital payment medium compete directlywith analogue-based medium (notes coin) supply central bank. if happen tosuch extent central bank money drive business retail payments, 11bis review 66/1999hayek’s vision would almost achieved.17 but distinct difference because, first, itwould achieve gradual evolution financial market innovation improvementsin payment technologies, rather type top-down legislative decree hadenvisaged remove central bank entirely monetary management and, second, evolutionwould occur without jeopardise single unit account.this gradual process privatisation one central bank might logically expect tooppose, case. on contrary, actively take step help promotethe growth electronic substitute note coin. they seek agreementbetween competent official body potential private sector issuer standardisation – theobjective promote inter-operability different privately supply alternatives.although might seem like proverbial turkey vote christmas, central banker place avery high priority smooth efficient work payment system retail andwholesale levels.therefore, ecb consider essential follow minimum requirement fulfilled:• issuer electronic money must subject prudential supervision;• issuance must subject sound transparent legal arrangements, technical security,protection criminal abuse monetary statistic reporting;• issuer electronic money must legally obliged, request holders, redeemelectronic money central bank money par;• possibility must exist central bank impose reserve requirement issuer ofelectronic money.the ecb also identify two objectives, pursuit deem desirable: theinter-operability electronic money scheme adoption adequate guarantee, insurance orloss-sharing scheme protect depositors. the third requirement mention particularsignificance context current discussion. this because, monetary policy point ofview, “the redeemability requirement is, inter alia, necessary order preserve unit-of-accountfunction money, maintain price stability avoid unconstrained issuance electronicmoney, safeguard controllability liquidity condition short-term interest rate setby escb” (p. 106, ecb annual report, 1998).if whole process trigger availability new electronic retail mean payment finallybrought logical conclusion, suggest dynamic technological development freecompetition, central bank government confront specific problem ofpivotal significance: unit account separate mean payment, stillremaining viable unit account play crucial role provide common moneylanguage whole economy? if mean payment embody unit account, isnotes coin, – time – eliminate transaction medium virtue competition ofthe emerge digital equivalent issue private sector, would familiar exist unit ofaccount, euro, u dollar, pound sterling, etc., continue mean anything? and, not, whatshould official response? i don’t propose address either issue today, mayrest assure crucial concern regard future, albeit probably somewhatdistant future.hayek seem little doubt private enterprise, operate largelyunregulated environment, would deliver monetary system stable, safe efficient. however,i remain rather sceptical whether private sector cope externality involve theprovision smoothly work monetary financial system. it must nevertheless concede thatthe private sector increasingly help evolve monetary financial system, support 17central bank money could, course, remain transaction settlement medium wholesalelevel interbank market. bi review 66/199912increasingly sophisticate payment infrastructures, promise significantly efficientthan system gradually displacing. there is, accordingly, strong case make forattempting introduce system fiat. it preferable evolve piecemealengineering, rather abrupt legislative change seek proponent competingcurrencies free banking, hayek could, justification, regard highpriest. it also bear mind central bank continue play, thistransitional period afterwards, important role regulator financial system by, interalia, set rule competition private supplier inside money.6.hayek’s legacy monetary unionhayek referred, 1978 (op. cit.), possibility monetary union clear strong terms. heput way: “though i strongly sympathise desire complete economic unification ofwestern europe completely free flow money them, i grave doubt aboutdoing create new european currency manage sort supra-national authority. quiteapart extreme unlikelihood member country would agree policy bepursued practice common monetary authority (and practical inevitability countriesgetting bad currency now), seem highly unlikely would betteradministered present national currencies”.at one level, monetary union encompass euro 11 country could, therefore, see aproject diametrically oppose type scheme advocate hayek accord theaforementioned quotes. instead allow private sector compete issue owncurrencies, single currency introduce government come together introduce theeuro top-down fashion legislative decree, continue prohibit private sector fromissuing currency. any attempt private sector issue banknote coin counterfeiting, aserious criminal offence.at another level, one see many strand hayek’s think may influence course ofthe event lead monetary union subtle ways. what happen introduction theeuro indeed achieve denationalisation money, advocate hayek, least theeuro 11 countries. furthermore, euro manage central bank (the ecb) isprotected political interference treaty (the maastricht treaty), member statesare signatories. all national central bank comprise eurosystem independent theirrespective euro 11 government and, accord respective statutes, cannot take instructionsfrom governments.moreover, eurosystem supranational therefore natural politicalcounterpart form supranational government full executive powers. this furtherunderpins independence eurosystem enable pursue mandate ultimateobjective, price stability, without interference government. thus, monetary policy theeuro 11 country denationalise conduct supranational central bank,which politically independent government member states. furthermore, anymonetary finance public sector privilege access financial institution prohibited. theseparation public finance monetary policy thereby ensured.this much line view express hayek:18 “it may still true that, fullagreement monetary policy ought aim for, independent authority fully protectedagainst political pressure free decide mean employ order achieve endsit assign might best arrangement. the old argument favour independent centralbanks still great merit”. he go elaborate “under present condition littlechoice limit monetary policy prescribe goal rather specific actions”. he thencomments employment price stability goal monetary policy, conclude “the twoaims necessarily conflict provide requirement monetary stability give 18friedrich von hayek, the constitution liberty, routledge, london, 1960. 13bis review 66/1999first place rest economic policy adapt them”. last, least, hayek emphasised(again strongly) danger monetary financing: “if preserve function marketeconomy, nothing urgent dissolve unholy marriage monetaryand fiscal policy, long clandestine, formally consecrate victory keynesianeconomics”19 (italics original).7.conclusionshayek explain objective proposal: “the abolition governmentmonopoly money conceive prevent bout acute inflation deflation, whichplagued world last sixty years”. hayek clear put blame: “thebasic tool civilisation – language, morals, law money – result spontaneous growthand design, last two organise power get hold thoroughly corrupt them”.20or, put later, even strong terms: “the history government management money has,except happy periods, one incessant fraud deception”.21 the institutional reformwhich espouse tackle problem indeed radical. it involved, seen, thedenationalisation money achieve complete abolition government’s monopolyover issue fiat money, leave way open supply money determine bycomprehensive private sector competition.i would justice hayek i neglect mention that, early stage thinking,he put forward proposal control inflation become conventional wisdom.in chapter 21 famous book entitle “the constitution liberty” publish 1960, hewonders, i flagged, whether independent monetary authority, fully protect againstpolitical pressure free decide mean employ order achieve end hasbeen assigned, might best arrangement.however, seem view central bank independence inadequate solution since, asearly 1960s, conclude that, light high level government debt, “…an effectivemonetary policy conduct co-ordination financial policy government.co-ordination respect, however, inevitably mean whatever nominally independentmonetary authority still exist fact adjust policy government” (seehayek 1960, page 327). i think clear idea along line theinspiration behind rule procedure eu treaty, i refer particular article 104and 104a.in fact, i would argue one reason hayek’s change mind subsequent advocacy ofcomplete privatisation money, reveal view express constitution liberty in1960 put forward denationalisation money 1978, find hisdisappointment trend monetary institution lifetime. he seem saida much: “… high hope could expect political control money beenbitterly disappointed. … unchecked party politics stable money inherently incompatible”(italics original).22 the tentative answer hayek’s concern – classic timeinconsistency-induced inflation bias – finally find institutional reform. in industrialisedcountries, monetary policy manage (more less) independent central bank withthe key objective maintain price stability. monetary finance public sector excluded.monetary stability protect law social consensus.how would hayek, alive today, see emu ecb? let hazard probably asomewhat bias speculative answer. the route monetary union take member government 19friedrich von hayek, 1978, op. cit.20friedrich von hayek, law, legislation liberty,

robert lucasin nobel lecture recently remind u fact i quote: “…the prediction thatprices respond proportionately change money long run, deduce hume 1752 (andby many theorists, many different routes, since), receive ample – i would say decisive –confirmation, data many time places” (p. 668).23 a i already argued, quality ofmoney, well perform micro-economic function medium ofexchange, store value particular unit account, relate quantity money. toomuch latter, relative ex ante demand money, substantially impair former. sinceinflation ultimately monetary phenomenon, money constitute natural, firm reliable“nominal anchor” monetary policy aim price stability. this account money isgiven prominent role ecb’s monetary policy strategy.therefore, although path take achieve denationalisation money different thanthat advocate hayek, ultimate objective seek hayek, i.e. monetary independencefrom political interference price stability, has, intent purposes, already achieved.of course, i add essential precautionary note price stability never fully achieve inthe sense forward-looking concept ecb must eternally vigilant, act pre-emptive way, ensure inflationary pressure give opportunity translate intoactual inflation. have say this, however, i afraid hayek might favour newcentralised authority monopoly power base money. the treaty maastricht virtuallythe opposite hayek proposed, because, among things, new monetary order inthe eu11 create evolutionary process “constructivist” way per statute afixed date, i.e. first january year.i convince eu11 government have, principle, take

inflation. these externalinfluences offset much high level domestically generate inflation. despite that,inflation target often – fact, belowthe target one month far since mpc set up. a benign effect thosetemporary external influence inflation start wear off, challenge face mpc willbecome, anything, even great first two years.if time lag monetary transmission process mean early judge mpcon inflation track record, criterion assess performance might berelevant? one measure would expectation future inflation. follow gordon brown’sannouncement bank independence 6 may 1997, inflation

towards target, economicforecasters’ expectation become firmly anchor target. the bond market measurehas rise somewhat recent months, although reflect unusually low real yield index-linked debt follow introduction minimum fund requirement uk pensionfunds.does fall inflation expectation matter? the simple answer yes. if mpc anchorinflation expectation target, unexpected movement inflation immediatelylead wage bargainer price-setters change view inflation head hencewill help make le likely inflationary spiral past. both inflation output beless volatile result. bi review 63/19994but also another, albeit one-off, benefit new-found credibility policy thesubsequent reduction inflation expectations. over past two years, inflation close to2.5%. if inflation expectation converge target, inflation wouldhave low expected. why matter? suppose wage bargain strike theassumption inflation 3 per cent, price fact rise 2.5 per cent. real wage willbe high either employer employee expect, employment – demand labour– fall. an unexpected fall inflation low output employment. so bringinginflation expectation towards actual inflation, new monetary policy framework hasprobably lead high output low unemployment might otherwise occurred. wemight call benefit “credibility windfall”. it extremely difficult, impossible, toknow large windfall might been. but even windfall 0.1 percentage point ofgdp sizeable amount. of course, somebody might well point could havereaped “windfall” allow inflation rise match high inflationexpectations. but would inconsistent aim hit inflation target, might wellhave lead ratcheting-up inflation expectations. it would lose u benefitsthat low stable inflation brings.what mpc learn past two years?the first two year mpc learn process concerned, membersof mpc outside observe comment actions. we learn fromexperience make change necessary. for example, minute mpc meet arenow publish two rather six weeks. the additional delay create unnecessaryspeculation issue mind mpc members, make difficult u toexplain action – example, treasury select committee – decision hadmoved describe recent minutes. so decide acceleratepublication.i would like focus two main lesson first two years. the first crucialimportance symmetric inflation target. the second concern manage process inwhich group common objective individual member hold personallyaccountable decisions.symmetry targetthe inflation target chancellor give mpc simple point target rpixinflation 22%. prior may 1997, inflation target 22% less. the mean thosewords “or less” never entirely clear. rarely history economic policy fewwords cause much confusion many economic commentators. move symmetricpoint target remove ambiguity objective mpc. that importantbecause rationale hand operational responsibility set interest rate mpc isthat good qualify make decision elect politicians, whereas electedpoliticians democratic legitimacy choose target.a symmetric inflation target also make easy people understand mpc islikely react different type shock may hit economy time time. in moretechnical language, mpc’s policy reaction function predictable. when anunexpected shock move inflation away target, may always sensible, indeedfeasible, mpc return inflation target level immediately. shock stay thetwelve-month increase rpix index least twelve months. to offset impact ashock rpix inflation le year might imply undesirable volatility output. 5bis review 63/1999hence mpc give “constrained discretion” concern horizon ittries bring inflation back target level. the appropriate horizon depends, general, thetype persistence shock. there simple rule determine appropriate horizon. itdepends nature shocks. that mpc spend much time try unravelrecent economic history. on average, since shock may take several month fulleffect, horizon two year reasonable one bring inflation back itstarget. but shock sufficiently large – either direction – may sensible aim tobring inflation back target level somewhat different horizon. in circumstances,the mpc would make clear minute meet inflation report,and, required, open letter chancellor.common objective versus individual accountabilityduring first two years, mpc develop modus vivendi manage potentialtension operate team common objective, one hand, therequirement individual accountability members, other. the committee wholeneeds explain view economy heading. the inflation report themain vehicle express collective view committee. together minute ofthe monthly meetings, provide

desirable give month. that discus atgreat length appropriate course action member make mind.for system work crucial mpc member give best judgment tryto reach artificial consensus. how, then, balance need give clear view abouthow committee see economic development requirement individualaccountability?there two main criticism mpc respect. first, mpc tooopen difference within it. second, committee open enough. let mestart first criticism. from first meet june 1997 end year, thecommittee unanimous six occasions. output appear trend, labourmarket continue tighten, need slow growth domestic demand inorder reduce pressure supply capacity. interest rate raise meet betweenjune august, november. at point committee accuse act likea “politburo”. but january 1998 first disagreement occurred. the committee vote fivevotes three (the ninth member, john vickers, join mpc june last year) tohold interest rate constant. in february march committee evenly divided, thegovernor use cast vote favour unchanged level interest rates. disagreementscontinued june committee vote 8 1 raise interest rate for, turn out, thelast time interest rate cycle. by now, many commentator disillusion theevidence disagreement within committee. if i single philip stephen thefinancial time description, write july 1998, unhappiness thecommittee vivid articulate most. he wrote: bi review 63/19996“the committee thus far lack leadership predictability. … on evidence theprevious six months, mpc bear close resemblance post-graduate seminar aforum strategic decision-making. …to put [several] economist room invitewhat one commentator call paralysis analysis. a result committee’s conclusionsare entirely unpredictable.”since begin 1998, committee unanimous one sixteenmeetings. that july last year committee vote hold interest rate constantat 7.5%. disagreement become norm, much le remark upon pressthan before. moreover, disagreement widely accept natural. it wouldbe strange uncertainty face committee reflect small difference ofopinion. and view appropriate level rate never differ 0.5percentage points. nor technical disagreement lead “paralysis analysis”. indeed,the committee reduce interest rate 23 percentage point since october last year. itwas precisely analysis lead action.the willingness mpc change interest rate either order meet thesymmetric inflation target alter commentator’s perception committee itself. early inits history, commentator unable resist label member committee either“hawks” “doves”. i argue make sense use description eachmember committee objective. member mpc cannot entertain closetviews desire inflation rate hold personally accountable theirjudgments level interest rate necessary meet inflation target. no matter. agood argument never beat good headline. hawk dive was, though alsoreferences ostriches, fox hedgehogs, headless chickens. no doubt evenless flat comparison make private. still, unlike england football managers, not– yet – compare root vegetables. and make progress. a chart 4 shows,press reference “hawks doves” reach peak mid-1998 decline markedlysince. a i predict speech may last year, “as circumstance change, easy imaginethat ‘hawks’ shall ‘doves’ ‘doves’ shall ‘hawks’”.but also criticise open enough difference view. the earlyminutes think bland conceal expression individual point view.much criticism indeed fair. and try respond make minute amore accurate expression range point view express meeting. but ishould stress discussion mpc focus relative merit different possibleexplanations happen economy, spirit mutual enquiry, rather anexchange fix conflict views. a second criticism, make imf team therecent article iv consultation, that, whereas minute explain detail differencesof view among committee members, inflation report contain single projection forthe inflation outlook. again, justice criticism, respond it.in fact, three past four inflation reports, explicit description ofdifferences view among committee member prospect inflation.what challenge next two years?if monetary stability permanent feature british economic life, mpc toovercome several challenge year ahead. two i would like discus briefly.first, committee deal expectation raise remarkable 7bis review 63/1999stability inflation first two years? second, mpc build constituency forlow inflation?despite openness transparency new

behaviour uk, although study ofthe recent difference productivity growth across country might relate todifferences way information technology affect work practice important. bi review 63/19998if productivity, change might help explain recent benign behaviour ofinflation? a plausible explanation lower-than-expected growth rate earnings, andhence prices, is, view, fall inflation expectations. if case, part theimproved performance last two three year attribute combination the“credibility windfall” result new monetary policy framework benign impacton inflation high exchange rate low

concept.certainly, german concept social market economy root basic core liberal ideas. butthe ordo-liberalism know freiburg school, concept based, itselfgoes beyond classical liberal thinking. in instances, emphasis place key role ofcompetition. however, member freiburg school surround walter eucken alreadystressing late forty free competition also need rules.they call overall market economic system safeguard competition, particular, alasting basis - example, mean fundamental prohibition cartel smash ofunjustified monopolies, believe way competition couldactually perform function safeguard liberty promote economic prosperity.in addition task competitive system, german concept social marketeconomy expressly incorporate element social compromise overall system.one neoliberal university teachers, professor alfred müller-armack, start aclose associate ludwig erhard, rather pointedly express follows:“it momentous error part economic liberalism regard distribution market asalready intrinsically satisfactory social political terms, thus combine questionof appropriate technical form exchange question socially andgovernmentally desirable.”1for me, market economy appropriate

individual freedom, private property, competition, andthe rule law - indeed rely value existence.but also stand tradition christian social ethics, recognise personal freedom andsocial responsibility, well subsidiarity solidarity, core principles.however, indisputably important liberal thinker century, friedrich august von hayek,tended take sceptical view effort create comprehensive economic social

german economics minister post-war years, also regardedas architect german “economic miracle”, stable money sine qua non.as long ago 1950, wrote:“experience history alike teach u sound stable currency

despite unsuccessful effort reform, “prague spring” of1968 - another four decade plan economic system finally collapse here. 2 erhard, l.: marktwirtschaft und gesunde währung, in: industriekurier,

incentive give market player necessary information change condition ofsupply demand change requirements. but prices, wage interest rate reallymeaningful currency stable. only investment, output labour channelledinto area society want therefore promote prosperity.by contrast, inflation lead long term serious disruption economic process, resultingin misallocations expensive avoidance strategies. it mainly economically weak group insociety suffer - unable evade creep erosion money. thosegroups mainly include recipient wages, pension government transfer payments, well asthose hold save accounts. the safeguard stable money thus also, time,enlightened social policy.ludwig erhard make point follows:“the social market economy unthinkable without consistent policy price stability. only apolicy also guarantee individual group society enrich expense ofothers.”3that one major reason price stability play important role post-warwest german history. maintain stability d-mark was, always been, aim ofgerman policy past 50 years.iiiit good reason endure stability also aim yardstick new europeancurrency, euro.for purpose, regulatory framework bind international law lay inthe1992 maastricht

remsperger, member directorate deutschebundesbank, 27th economics conference austrian national bank vienna, austria, on11 june 1999.broadly define topic advantage drawbacks. on one hand, mean thespeaker great room manoeuvre. on hand, spoil choice thedifferent aspect topic. in order minimise complexity topic, i like focuson policy mix euro area. in addition, main thrust remark direct towardsdiscussion role monetary policy.in euro area, monetary policy centralised, field economic policy not. theyremain national responsibilities. hence topic “the policy mix european monetary union” hastwo fundamental dimensions. in first dimension, attention focus one policy area ofthe emu member states. in second dimension, attention concentrate mutualrelationships individual policy areas, i.e. “assignment responsibilities”. the twodimensions frequently combine head “coordination”. then, however, adistinction draw coordination across country give policy area andcoordination across policies.i wish bore flood definitions. even so, i think make sense distinguishbetween explicit implicit coordination.1 any form commitment undertake joint decision byseparate actor call explicit coordination. if coordination move direction asingle policy decide single institution, coordination become relatively strong. but arealso le ambitious form explicit coordination. one form coordination consist set ofjoint rule decision-making body abide. a rather loose form coordinationoccurs decision-makers exchange information kind dialogue. such dialogue can,after all, also result “coordinated” decisions.“implicit coordination” relate assignment individual policy areas. if objective andinstruments clearly assign individual policy areas, overall outcome policymix implicitly coordinate well.my proposition that, term treaty maastricht, policy mix europeanmonetary union amount bottom model implicit coordination, thus division oflabour field economic policy. this give rise number question principle. i shouldlike address two detail today, namely, first: implicit coordination, andespecially monetary policy assignment, justified? and second, implicit coordination ateuropean level necessitate cross-border coordination fiscal wage policy?the role monetary policylet begin assignment monetary policy. the treaty maastricht set clear objectivefor european system central bank (escb): “the primary objective escb shall tomaintain price stability” (article 105.1). a part “stability-oriented monetary policy strategy”,the eurosystem define price stability “rise harmonise consumer price index (hcpi)of le 2%”. in context “price stability must maintain medium term”.2 at thesame time, maastricht treaty provide monetary policy “shall support general economicpolicies community” far possible “without prejudice objective price stability”. 1 see artis winkler (1998).2 europäische zentralbank (1999, p. 51). bi review 70/19992alongside specification objective price stability, formulation announcement ofthe stability-oriented monetary policy strategy eurosystem constitute key element ofimplicit coordination. in strategic terms, though tactical terms, monetary policy calculable.the economic policy maker know ecb’s policy gear two pillars: firstplace, reference value money supply and, secondly, broadly base assessment ofthe prospect future price developments. the second pillar take due account themoney stock also indicators. in context, i would like emphasise euroexchange rate one indicator inflation outlook ecb.the inclusion strategic response function central bank may contribute stance offiscal wage policy consistent stability. implicit coordination bolster anintensive exchange information ecb, european council europeancommission (article 109b treaty).3 moreover, ecb require draw annualreport every year present explain different european bodies. in addition, arenumerous channel information disseminate eurosystem, leastthe press conference hold ecb president. altogether, exchange information onlyensures actor economic policy area ass monetary policy effectively,but eurosystem likewise obtain information plan activity policy areas.the assignment european monetary policy repeatedly criticise past. however, thecritics adopt position. whereas critic object europeanmonetary policy act much tradition allegedly overly stability-orientedbundesbank, others deplore supposedly pronounce orientation towards short-termbusiness activity. only short time launch monetary union, talk “paradigmchange” compare early bundesbank policies.i would like address critic call strong orientation monetary policy towardsbusiness activity. three line argument discernible here:a first group advocate monetary policy gear business activity regard risk theprevailing price stability negligible. that group would like make monetary policyresponsible foster growth employment well.a second group critic argue basis economic shocks. monetary policy respondto demand shocks. they believe objective price stability meet central bankonly medium long term.4 the currently discernible weakness economic activity euroarea serf advocate approach evidence existence demand shock. intheir view, make expansionary monetary policy response imperative.a third group, finally, prefer quite different assignment monetary policy. while price stabilityshould reach primarily mean productivity-oriented wage policy, monetary policy shouldactively encourage growth employment. hence approach reflect strong form oforientation towards economic activity.5 unlike first two approach mentioned, postulate somuch temporary permanent responsibility monetary policy business-cycle policy. 3 article 105.4 maastricht treaty explicitly provide right ecb consult actswithin field competence.4 by stress long-term orientation objective, fischer (1996, pp. 28 29), instance, seesscope pursue short-term, anticyclical monetary policy: “long-run price stability theprimary goal central bank ...” and “... emphasise long-run ... allow ... little leeway short-term countercyclical policy.” bofinger (1999, p. 7 ff.) likewise emphasis active role monetarypolicy event demand shocks.5 the approach base mainly work flassbeck (see, instance, flassbeck (1998, p. 278 ff.);flassbeck et al. (1992, p. 222 ff.); flassbeck spiecker (1998, p. 52 ff.)). 3bis review 70/1999to evaluate alternative assignment monetary policy, one might initially try devise awelfare-theory approach. the best assignment would distinguish maximise social welfare.however, since abstract concept cannot help much practical debate, one might ask,instead, extent monetary policy maker actually able perform role theyhave assigned. at time, essential monetary policy maker incentivefor play role envisage (the criterion incentive compatibility). thus, question bothof “ability” “volition” responsible monetary policy decisions.the decision-makers confront european monetary policy two problem complexes.besides problem beset monetary policy quite generally, are, addition, someproblems due specifically european monetary union. the advent completely newmonetary regime necessarily increase insecurity. furthermore, monetary policy maker areobliged operate monetary area far homogeneous.i convince would overburden monetary policy responsibility business-cycle policyand employment policy assign well. it is, instance, doubt whether monetarypolicy able lastingly raise employment. not monetarist refer context “naturalrate unemployment”, i.e. unemployment rate reflect structural characteristic thegoods labour markets.6 in long run, unemployment tend towards rate. it cannot bereduced durably “flashes pan” kindle monetary policy. besides, would arisk accelerate inflation rates.it course difficult quantify “natural rate unemployment”. but generalconsensus large part unemployment currently prevail europe structural origin.7overall, scope monetary policy exercise impact unemployment therefore verylimited. to reduce unemployment, primarily structural policy decision individual memberstates monetary union needed. they ensure, least, labour marketsbecome flexible.another argument active business-cycle management monetary policy long andvariable time-lags involved. they prevent fine-tune real business activity mean ofmonetary policy. on hand, monetary policy appropriate instrument forinfluencing price movement medium long term. one fact areuncontested among economist perception inflation monetary phenomenon.monetary policy affect price mean money stock aggregate demand butalso via expectation economic agents. a major advantage monetary policy crediblycommitted objective price stability, active monetary policy, central bankcan take advantage transmission channel relatively easily. if monetary policy embody thestability objective credibly, simultaneously foster wage settlement line stability. inthis way, create good basis success.in view, would grave error central bank make responsible employmentpolicy part schematic two-tier approach: first attainment price stability, anorientation towards employment. for one thing, disregard economic management problemsderiving time-lags involve monetary policy. for another, would stand seriously theway accumulation reputation central bank. 6 see friedman (1968, p. 8).7 see e.g. oecd (1998, p. 172 ff.) imf (1997, p. 39 ff.). for germany, see e.g. sachverständigenrat(council economic experts) (1998, para. 422 ff.) dohse et al. (1998, p. 109 ff.). regard thephillips curve trade-off, weber (1994, p. 91 ff.) come conclusion g-7 country (other thanitaly) exhibit long-term vertical phillips curves. bi review 70/19994thus, large part recent theoretical debate problem time inconsistency ofmonetary policy base initial hypothesis central bank pursue (particularlyambitious) output employment objective addition goal price stability. without anorientation towards two objectives, credibility problem le serious. it must therefore thebest interest stability-oriented central bank excessive demand make it. theorientation towards objective price stability meet widespread approval, particularlyamong representative central banks. price stability great deal help monetary policymakers gain high reputation.8 an economic policy strategy disregard incentive patternand, instead, commit monetary policy rapidly effective employment success likely give riseto substantial problems. in order ensure short-termism spread monetary policy, thetreaty maastricht provide independence european central bank nationalcentral banks. this crucial institutional regulation ensure continuous monetary policy, gear theobjective price stability.9yet commitment price stability independence european central bank notimply eurosystem’s monetary policy wholly irrelevant business activity. a medium-term-oriented monetary policy, pursue bundesbank past, beenincorporated, form reference value monetary growth, “two-pillar strategy” theeurosystem, also apt smooth economic activity. a part monetary strategy design toachieve continuity, interest rate movement “breathe” line business activity; sense, theythus act “built-in stabiliser”.central banker may feel gratify increase employment, especially fruit aconsistent stabilisation policy. in process, however, must forget limit set thepotential impact monetary policy. this mervyn king, allude phrase coin alanblinder, write central banker “need soft heart hard heads”.10now i draw attention general problem associate economic management bymeans monetary policy, i like address specific difficulty pose environmentof monetary union.11 in particular, uncertainty consider connect withthe transition stage three monetary union. the change regime may engender severealterations behaviour economic agent participate states. that apply thefinancial sector, monetary union immediate impact, also sectorsof economy.it expect competition intensify good factor market upon thedisappearance currency barrier euro area. consumer investor may well behavedifferently. for instance, foreign trade participate state might increase. or good arebought cheapen owe strong competition. overall, assume thepatterns familiar past change. a monetary policy that, aggressively activeeconomic management, rely old pattern might well enhance, rather mitigate, thecyclical fluctuations. 8 fischer (1996, p. 23 ff.) draw attention opinion poll accord citizen europeancountries, least early mid-nineties, still felt inflation major problem. correspondingly,fighting inflation contribute accumulation reputation.9 it sense alesina gatti (1995, p. 198 ff.) understand justification central bankindependence. in view, independence effectively prevent monetary policy frombeing cause politically induce business cycles.10 king (1999, p. 93).11on difficulty start stage three, see e.g. europäische zentralbank (1999, p. 49 f.). 5bis review 70/1999the uncertainty surround effect single european monetary policy real economywill actually increase possible difference member states’ national transmissionmechanisms. it cannot, however, say sufficient certainty significant difference arefor practical monetary policy. although divergent finance patterns, wage-bargaining systemsand labour goods-market regulation member state provide grind suppose asingle central bank rate differ effects,12 close inspection transpire thedirection scale deviation individual country depend, among things, onthe concrete method empirical analysis used.13moreover, cannot conclusively infer difference statistically significant.if criterion statistical significance take account, difference ascertain may bemodified.14 the extent exist difference diminish near future likewisedisputed. on one hand, high degree specialisation diversification expect euroarea account ongoing economic integration. that would tend result fanning-out ofthe structures. on hand, great convergence economic structure expect owe tothe single monetary policy increase harmonisation economic policies.15altogether, however, uncertainty surround national effect eurosystem’smonetary policy measure persistence difference stand way aggressivelyactive monetary policy, especially one orient towards short term.however, claim monetary policy bundesbank also thepolicy european central bank could explain effectively “taylor rule” byany medium-term-oriented monetary strategy. i share view. the monetary policy strategyof eurosystem base little taylor interest rate former strategy thebundesbank. 12regarding supposition, see e.g. hughes hallett et al. (1999, p. 6 f.). the historical difference infinancing pattern described, instance, borio (1995, p. 77). for example, germany, france andthe netherlands 1993 80% credit extend medium long term. in italy, contrast,51% credit extend short term.13 in literature, difference national transmission mechanism analyse part majormacroeconomic model (especially central banks), structural var model smallmacroeconomic model reduce central estimate equation. regard macroeconomicmodels various central banks, see e.g. bi (1995). hughes hallett et al. (1999) hughes hallettand piscitelli (1999) use, alternative, specific multi-country models. structural var model usedby gerlach smets (1995), ramaswamy sloek (1997), ehrmann (1998) holstein (1999). simple“single-equation systems” use dornbusch et al.

(1999, p. 6 ff.) postulate strongly diverge structure basis thetheorem “comparative advantages”, frankel rise (1998, p. 1009 ff.) advocate opposite view.and seem understandable, particularly regard difference finance patterns. forinstance, course decline inflation italy, above-mentioned 51% share short-termcredit probably decrease past years. a single monetary policy also apply italy, aneven great harmonisation finance pattern expect future. in proportion thepressure monetary union effect consistent structural reform member state increases, wagebargaining market flexibility may also converge additional cause differ transmission ofmonetary policy stimuli. bi review 70/19996the taylor rule make short-term interest rate dependent current inflationary cyclicaldevelopments. orientation taylor interest rate would imply great interest ratemovements bundesbank actually allow basis concept.only long term behaviour day-to-day money market rate behaviour ofthe taylor interest rate quite similar. at first glance, largely parallel movement appear verysurprising since output gap play explicit role bundesbank policy. it le surprising,however, similarity taylor rule monetary target take intoconsideration. the potential-oriented monetary target policy, too, automatic anticyclicalcomponent. furthermore, monetary target likewise react deviation inflation rate from“normative inflation”.in eurosystem, consideration give fact monetary policy environment cannot becharacterised solely current price movement output gap. instead, broadly definedmoney supply, well number monetary, financial real economic indicators, containinformation future trend inflation. ignore would appropriate central bankoriented towards objective price stability.hitherto, i try make clear concentration monetary policy monetary unionon objective price stability appropriate. that objective attain central decision-making body, ecb govern council. no problem coordinate independent nationalmonetary policy arise european monetary union.instead close interlock various policy areas, maastricht treaty envisage unequivocalgoal monetary policy, shape price stability. in sense “implicit coordination” thepolicy mix likewise desirable assign clear field responsibility fiscal wage policy aswell. the main task fiscal policy lie primarily provision service cannot besupplied all, adequately, via market, adjustment income distributionresulting market process.16 correspondingly, key responsibility employment shouldbe assign wage policy. this (neo-classical) assignment consistent practicalpossibilities various policy area national european level, also take due accountof incentive pattern decision-makers. at time, must bear mind thetreaty maastricht envisage cross-border coordination economic policy. the treaty statesthat member state regard economic policy matter common concern.17 but thesingle european monetary policy remain unaffected coordination precept.the object economic policy coordination monitor economic development andeconomic policy member states. that includes, besides surveillance budget policies,especially observation structural policy measure goods, service labour markets, ofcost price movements, promotion tax reforms.if one enquire rather carefully relationship single monetary policy theother policy area european monetary union, must said, begin with, politician areprohibited issue instruction ecb national central banks. similarly, ecband national central bank prohibit request instruction politicians. thus,according maastricht treaty “coordination above” permissible eurosystem. 16 see sachverständigenrat (council economic experts) (1974, para. 397).17 article 102a maastricht treaty provide gear economic policy member state

pan-european wage-cutting race one argument use favour closeinterlinking national wage policies. what fear case level wage beused factor create job domestic market detriment member states, thestyle “beggar thy neighbour” policies. the upshot “disastrous wage-cutting race” couldonly general process deflation.20 to prevent development, party pay settlementsshould commit wage rise orient towards growth productivity.21 wage policywould coordinate mean “joint rule”, i.e. orientation towards growth ofproductivity.however, weighty objection raise ideas. for instance, orientation towardsproductivity growth guideline wage policy appear make little sense time ofheavy unemployment. in first place, reasonable expect that, relative cheapen ofthe production factor labour, substitution process favour high employment triggered.22secondly, event heavy unemployment essential wage rise lag behind growthof productivity, statistically record average productivity labour may increaseas result reduction labour input.the notion distribution give job among emu country – ultimately underlie theargument wage-cutting competition – disregard supply-side potential improvement inmomentum labour good market. emu-wide wage restraint aim make outputprofitable cost side need mean zero-sum game one country losesprecisely number job another gains.23some author believe centralised, corporatist wage-bargaining system likely exertfavourable employment effects. such hope base largely assumption that, context ofcentralised wage negotiations, party wage settlement take due account effect ofwage rise price employment, which, thought, true case industry-specificwage negotiations, account free-rider attitude stabilisation employment policy.24but institutional regulation affect labour market – thus structure wage-bargaining system well – differ considerably individual emu member states. unlikesmall, comparatively homogeneous austria netherlands, often cite example asuccessful corporatist approach, euro area large economic zone pronounce structuraldiversity. in addition, likely particularly difficult implement common european policyin country responsibility wage bargain highly decentralised, e.g. locatedat enterprise level. in macroeconomic terms, however, drawback. 20 see horn et al. (1997, p. 99 ff.) horn zwiener (1998, p. 551 ff.).21 see horn zwiener (1998, p. 554). for concrete nominal wage settlements, follow formulashould used: “nominal wage rise = productivity growth + target inflation rate eurosystem.” thatwould prevent “disastrous wage-cutting race” also protect monetary policy theeurosystem inflationary pressure due wage policy. that would create employment-policy scopefor monetary policy.22 at events, seem case germany (see e.g. lapp lehment (1997, p. 67 ff.) orrottmann ruschinski (1998, p. 10). the fact wage restraint germany unable fulfil theemployment-policy expectation pin may owe something vigorous job-shedding accountof unavoidable consolidation public sector budgets, adjustment economic structure inthe new länder tailing-off

mitigate coordination wage policy that, owe monetary union,monetary policy definitively long function national “shock absorber”. moreover, mostmember state fiscal policy likewise perform function limit extent present.since budget deficit and/or debt level member state still pretty high, relevantprovisions stability growth pact curb fiscal policy’s scope. that another reason adistinctly high degree flexibility labour market needed. otherwise, adverse economicshocks reflect directly high unemployment figures.notwithstanding call great coordination, actual fact competition regionsshould use coordination mechanism. issing formulate find follows: “preciselybecause monetary policy long respond national condition exact opposite greatercentralisation harmonisation may require areas. talk uniform european wage-setting ambitious social union go wrong direction; different productivity realeconomic condition across euro area must take account ever.”26concluding remarksthe single european monetary policy currently accompany fiscal policy whichhas largely remain national responsibility wage policy coordinated, most, atnational level. in view, however, policy mix deplored, anyway littleto say far-reaching coordination across policy european level. any coordinationextending beyond implicit coordination would pose two problems:first, would danger economic policy engender destabilisation, rather economicstability, owe one-sided orientation towards policy short-term stabilisation businessactivity. what i say monetary policy show difficult short-term-oriented policy isin presence long variable time-lags. this problem would certainly mitigate bygoing implicit coordination various policy areas.second, ex ante coordination across policy would also involve risk responsibility becomingblurred incentive pattern destroyed. any attempt orient policy area towards objectivesmay well lead situation ultimately area seriously try reach even one objective. astrategy “relying someone else” may perhaps promise easy life, policy “drawingattention failure someone else” long political survival, without unequivocalobjective, ultimately clear accountability. this moral hazard problem may onlyresult threat price stability, also counterproductive term employment policy.the reservation explicit ex ante coordination european economic policy imply thatthat policy entirely forgo form coordination. element implicit coordination andmacroeconomic dialogue already evident european level.for instance, certain coordination single monetary policy national fiscal policy occursunder stability growth pact. compliance fiscal standard lay pactrelieves eurosystem political pressure facilitate finance massive budget deficit bymeans durably low interest rates. in way, stability growth pact help ensure 25 see e.g. job study oecd.26 issing (1999, p. 10). bi review 70/199910eurosystem always exhibit “staying power” stabilisation policy effort requiredfor successful monetary policy.it mandate monetary policy maintain price stability euro area. this clearly definedobjective take due account opportunity present by, limit set to, monetary policy. interms reputation, time line incentive afford central bankers.finally, clear assignment function facilitate accountability.fiscal policy should, first foremost, perform allocation distribution function; wage policyshould assign primary employment-policy responsibility. instead vague assignment offunctions blur area responsibility associate explicit ex ante coordination,this clear-cut separation responsibility promise effective implicit coordination.if one wonders, conclusion, whether room leave approach stabilisationof demand, i like draw attention, first, automatic stabilisation effect

still largelydecentralised. fiscal policy, particular, must abide rule set maastricht treatyand supplementary stability growth pact.these three characteristic appear straightforward self-evident. but importantimplications: one key implication euro area require last economic convergence —convergence sense single country must able keep others bi review 67/19992permanent basis, without recourse national monetary policy change exchange rate. thatnecessity last convergence see backdrop unrestricted capitalmovements supranational monetary policy. a traditional nation state currency hasseveral option available foster convergence within currency area. there largelyuniform economic taxation policy prevent excessive deviation politically-inducedconditions investment. there national budgetary policy give financial support toregions lag behind general trend. and largely similar similarly fundedsystem welfare. these thing euro area supranational level —or, least, anything like extent.there — mainly continent — regret mean economicconvergence cannot create or, least, actively promote centralise policy. others — isuspect overwhelm majority british people belong camp — believe bea good thing. europe dominant centralise entity, egalitarianpublic-sector system adjustment. it decentralised, organise principle ofsubsidiarity gear competition. your prime minister put nutshell: “integrate wherenecessary. decentralise possible.” i would add i great deal sympathy thatposition.however, one also see side coin. one problem remains: politicallydecentralised monetary union safeguard necessary last convergence member states?ultimately, one way this. safeguard last convergence politicallydecentralised monetary union must rest two pillars: firstly, country’s sustainedcompetitiveness country’s efforts; and, secondly, fundamental willingness toaccept certain bind rule abide permanent basis. that way amonetary union decentralise political structure succeed — economically, alsopolitically: words, without excessive conflict among participate countries.iiithe competitiveness single country obviously initially one economic condition kind ofoptimum currency area. basically, optimum currency area mean that, long term, isno need adjustment nominal exchange rate adjustment mechanism areeffective, say, result internal flexibility high degree labour mobility.that clear theory. in practice, fundamental problem: ability “keep up”be assessed? and possible safeguard ability willingness utilise alasting basis? now, way another, track record basic situation countriesconcerned take account. the maastricht treaty stipulate convergencecriteria purpose. these may final pearl wisdom strict economicsense, make u overlook fundamental pillar convergence criteriarepresent term logic politically decentralise currency union.i aware fact germans, insist strict interpretation criteria, havenot always give good press internationally past. it may also case debatein germany always take best possible course, especially somewhat muchemphasis place decimal place budgetary policy test year, example.but key element — take convergence criterion seriously — — still — correct. thecriteria were,

moreover, isdetermined priori central rate, one define late stage. for reason, thetreaty call — and, opinion, unquestionably call — two-year membership ermwithout tensions.in interpretation convergence — determine german debate — twoideas play key role: idea permanence sufficient convergence idea thepresent past test future ability stay pace last basis. 3bis review 67/1999perhaps feel debate germany different emphasis one here. in unitedkingdom, convergence sometimes understand sense convergence businesscycle. by mean i wish disparage that. naturally enough, i aware current

fact thetie create permanent one. it least reason right britishgovernment, particular, place repeat stress subject internal flexibility.i believe unanimity debate unite kingdom germany thateconomic convergence imply uniformity.firstly: imply uniform structures. it true competition — precisely monetaryunion — exert pressure find efficient solutions, everywhere.even monetary union, still room different economic tradition styles.however, competitiveness participate economy must ensure enduringbasis.secondly: convergence imply uniform policy areas. on contrary: decentralisedmonetary union call national policy exercise responsibility maintain competitiveeconomic structures. in key areas, too, power indeed remain nation states. nevertheless,individual approaches, say area taxes, must lead distortion markets.thirdly: convergence least imply uniform live condition equal prosperity theparticipating country regions. it may well way single market andthe single currency work assist le well-developed region face resolutely competitionin catch quickly sustainably. but must happen basis competition. there canbe priori guarantee that.ivlasting economic convergence base primarily market force one fundamental precondition forum politically decentralise monetary union. the second fundamental precondition theparticipating country agree bind rule certain area prepare abide anenduring basis. there rule kind — addition general rule single market —principally budgetary policy, particular direct relevance financial markets.some rule budgetary policy are: firstly, central bank must finance budgets.secondly, no-bail-out clause. the community liable commitment ofindividual member states. thirdly, government commit avoid excessivedeficits and, exist, reduce immediately. fourthly, normal circumstance thedeficit close balance.these rule undisputed. some ask whether no-bail-out clause sufficient. be thereference inherent responsibility national budgetary policy enough own? in myview, objection put matter simply. firstly, know financial marketconditions financial crisis one emu country might break out. (to honest, i hope issomething shall never learn.) however, tell recent national financial crisis inother region systemic risk easily arise. or, least, argument advance thepossibility systemic risk — would want let come that? of course, market areaware that, too. for reason, always likely certain problem credibility withregard no-bail-out clause. bi review 67/19994secondly, true single currency imply long-term interest rate allissuers. certainly not. the quality borrower liquidity aspect also play role. but,naturally, foreign exchange risk share equally participate countries. for reasonalone, exist interdependence among participate countries. and naturally alsoexists interdependence macroeconomic terms. if budget individual participatingcountries — especially large one — excessive recourse capital markets, willobviously burden countries. an excessive government deficit eat private savings.that factor us internal capital resource and/or impact euro’s externalrelations — quite apart overburden monetary policy result excessivelyexpansionary fiscal policy.for reasons, undoubted justification no-bail-out clause also fordefining limit national budget deficit general government debt ratio. i wish thatthe national budgetary policymakers participate country would perceive rule notmerely constraint also opportunity pursue rational policy sustain basis.one thing clear, course: set rule enough. the rule also accept thecountries involved. and enforce need arises. that easy matter, welearnt last week brussels.vthe second area rule set within framework monetary policy. one keyelements monetary union provide maastricht treaty is, without doubt, theindependence european central bank participate national central banks: otherwords, independence eurosystem. the economic rationale central bank isindependent instruction influence political body root find isgenerally easy central bank keep value currency stable last basis.that high degree monetary stability benefit economy society various ways. itincreases plan certainty economy, foster culture long-termism. it make iteasier enterprise fund investment decision long term. that generally result astronger long-term orientation economic decision-making. incidentally, one keyconsiderations new government give great autonomy bank england two yearsago. a stable currency is, time, element social policy. it often precisely whoare well economic term find difficult — impossible — protect themselvesagainst inflation. finally, money stable value also factor political philosophy.confidence currency is, extent, confidence state institutions. that is, atleast, case germany; partly owe experience gallop inflation first half ofthis century, also partly account idea economist alfred müller-armack andludwig erhard, introduce german economic policy leitmotif social marketeconomy, stable currency one key element. this economic rationale result atrend towards great central bank independence outside europe well. that perhaps also onefactor — among others — help explain high degree price stability prevailsworldwide present.one fundamental objection central bank independence raise question democratic legitimacy.is central bank independent political instruction influence keep ademocracy? i believe two precondition fulfil independentcentral bank unquestionably compatible democratic system.firstly: assign independence mandate arrive democratically: atthe least, virtue implicit consensus explicit foundation provide either law, aconstitution treaty — like maastricht — parliament give theirconsent.secondly: mandate independent central bank must unambiguous. political valuejudgements among various compete aim may make acquire directdemocratic legitimacy result elections. it precisely purpose election give 5bis review 67/1999mandate. the decision-making body independent central bank, elect directly,may make autonomous value judgement among various compete aims. an overridingobjective specify advance. that precisely maastricht treaty does. itspecifies primary objective price stability. hence, independent central bank remainsanchored democratic structure state.in view, limitedness central bank’s mandate thus corollary political,democratic constitutional legitimacy. for reason alone, i believe broaden mandatewould lead problem european system central banks. that applies, example, theidea extend scope central bank’s mandate beyond price stability include growth andfull employment additional objectives. that quite apart fact i perceive anytrade-off aim — least long term. assign task also causedifficulties independent central bank, however. assign sole responsibility bankingsupervision lender-of-last-resort function, instance, may give rise difficulties. such aplurality mandate might give rise situation independent ecb chooseamong different objectives, say objective stable prices, one hand, theconsolidation individual financial institutions, other. fundamentally, would apolitical value judgement. therefore, caution — least — exercise term delegatingadditional task ecb.in addition two basic precondition — democratic assignment task anunambiguous mandate — tie independent central bank democratic system naturallyrequires something more: call transparency accountability. independent monetary policycannot must remote general public.in say that, essential distinguish precisely mean transparency. doe transparencymean full disclosure deliberations, argument motif behind decision: words,transparency situation decision taken? or transparency principally aim atdisclosure process decision made?in term transparency overall situation decision taken, ecb endeavoursto comprehensive disclosure judgement assessment determine itsdecisions. of course, i rule possibility improvement one respect another. it isnot yet even six month ecb bear responsibility monetary policy. we thereforeall still involve learn process. incidentally, i personally would nothing alsoidentifying argument point decision one ultimately take whichhappened reject take argument account.transparency concern internal process consultation decision-making another matter,however. i regard problematic since may ultimately imperil efficiency monetary policydecision-making. why? firstly, put frankness confidentiality discussion risk. itcan, least, lead confidential discussion shift circles. and undermine theunity decision-making body. secondly, may endanger credibility stand ofindividual members, open argument and, account new insights, may alter theirposition discussions. i therefore feel second approach great publictransparency without problems. and i also doubt whether really introduce moreclarity calculability monetary policy markets.i admit reservation also idea decision-making body afeeling collective responsibility. and also include attempt seek internal consensusand demonstrate externally. now, may people find desire seek consensusstuffy old-fashioned. in final analysis, i believe not. allow make remark inthis connection: i come central bank — together predecessor institution, thebank deutscher länder — independent 50 years. during period, wasnecessary fend several attack political field. in say that, bear mindthat simple parliamentary majority would suffice legislative amendment remove thebundesbank’s independence. bi review 67/19996in situation conflict, independent central bank need support broad segment ofpublic opinion possible. that also case ecb, even though independence isanchored maastricht treaty. but give support, central bank need agood record long term. what also important demonstrate minimum degreeof unanimity. that apply anyway event conflict. in situation, central bank givesdisparate signal outside world, general public know actuallysupposed supporting. admittedly, comparatively easy create unanimity event aconflict. but central bank’s stand general public, intend protectionin event conflict — something earn build beforehand.and stand general public aware central bank stand for. if thegeneral public ask bank’s standpoint is, want clear-cut answer responseenumerating various possibility position 1, position 2, position 3, on. a central bankmust identifiable basic stance. that scarcely achieve without minimum ofcollective awareness.i fully understand objection must lead individual responsibility become lose inthe decision-making bodies. there something that. i wish, however, critic neverhad withstand serious attack independence central bank would somewhat morerespect concept consensus unanimity.vifinally, allow indulge reflection fundamental nature. we certainly agreementthat euro success. and permanent challenge. whether euro

safeguard internal purchase power, thereby also support internationalrole euro.”but make reasonable assessment opportunity risk inherent project ofmonetary union, shall maintain longer-term perspective. in eye future generations, theultimate test success monetary union one day consist three questions: ha monetaryunion able safeguard last monetary stability? have participate economy cop withthe condition monetary union? and: euro bring people people europe closertogether?the answer question lot convergence, although economicconvergence narrow sense parallel trend hard data

post-war bottlenecks, averagedjust 2 per cent period 1972, triple next two decades.this pickup inflation uniquely canadian phenomenon. in many countries,monetary policy become expansionary late 1960s.

neither itnarrowed. moreover, growth u.s. productivity seem pick strongly lastyear so.i complete explanation productivity slowdown canada. but i amprepared assert high inflation large fiscal deficit

i certainly appreciate thesharp drop price 1997-98, associate asian financial crisis, anespecially strong impact many canadians’ sense well-being. adjust inflation,commodity price hit new post-war low

situationover past 25 years. but i say beginning, much great sense difficultyand concern canadian felt 1990s after-effects strongmedicine take turn economic performance around. the success havehad far

canadian cometo expect continue low inflation build expectation plans.the federal government provincial government balance budget arerunning surpluses. the total government debt-to-gdp ratio, peak 70

effect inflation distribution ofincome, imperative need develop country keep inflation rate low aspossible. in last year’s economic survey, state “as world inflation rate currentlyof order 0 3

pose dilemma open economy. if domesticinflation rate economy, however low may be, high average inflation rate itstrading partners, put pressure exchange rate. in context, question simultaneousbalance

this illustrate case central bank, monetaryauthority, may require reduce liquidity system raise rate interest. but,such rise rate interest could detrimental interest weak banks. similarly,while tighten prudential norms, central bank take account impact bankingsystems’ capacity intermediate credit.finally, open economy, potential conflict interest rate exchange rateobjectives could arise

theeuro area monetary policy single one therefore indivisible – definition. monetarypolicy decision must base area-wide rather national consideration hence onarea-wide indicators. monetary policy

for unite state estimate measure consumer pricestend slightly overestimate actual inflation. a bias may also exist euro area hicp,although exact magnitude yet unknown need explore further.to maintain price stability, govern council choose stability-oriented monetarypolicy strategy. the choose strategy forward-looking nature also ensure muchcontinuity possible former strategy ncbs. in respect regardto override objective maintain price stability environment flexible exchange 3bis review 60/1999rates, strategy broadly similar sverige riksbank, although importantdifferences. in particular, riksbank follow direct inflation target strategy whichmonetary policy almost exclusively guide inflation forecast two year ahead.in contrast, eurosystem rely two pillars, thereby focus medium term, anddoes give predominant role inflation forecast riksbank.in view, riksbank achieve high standard regard transparency andaccountability, example evidence comprehensive quarterly inflation report. inmore recent years, riksbank enjoy fair measure success gain control overdomestic price developments, support strong performance fight inflation, andin overcome deep recession early 1990s. it track record also demonstrate thatprice stability sweden give high priority long formally recognisedby amendment riksbank act start 1999.the eurosystem’s stability-oriented monetary policy strategy rest two pillars, areboth important govern council discus monetary, financial economicdevelopments biweekly meetings. the first pillar, prominent role money,takes account essentially monetary origin inflation medium long term.it recognise empirical study show stable long-term relationship money andprices euro area. therefore, euro area, monetary development constitute animportant guide conduct monetary policy essential analyse monitorthe development monetary aggregate closely. the ecb announce quantitativereference value broad monetary growth measure m3, first reference value form3 growth set annual rate 4.5%. this reference value consistent themaintenance price stability medium term, allow sustainable outputgrowth assume trend decline velocity circulation m3. in set thereference value monetary growth, govern council emphasise medium-termorientation. substantial prolong deviation current monetary growth thereference value normally signal risk price stability medium term.the ecb intend react deviation monetary growth reference valuein mechanistic way. in first instance, deviation analyse thoroughly inferany signal may give prospect price developments. if deviationpoints threat price stability, monetary policy react manner appropriate tocounter threat.although monetary data contain information important monetary policy decision-making, monetary development alone clearly constitute complete summary theeconomic information necessary appropriate policy decision taken. thus thegoverning council emphasis important, parallel assessment ofmonetary growth, look wide range financial economic indicators,including economic forecasts. the second pillar eurosystem’s strategy thereforeconsists broadly base assessment outlook price development risk toprice stability euro area whole. this broadly base assessment take account,inter alia, information provide wage developments, exchange rates, fiscal indicators,real economic activity, asset commodity prices. forecast economic activity andprices euro area certainly also contribute success appropriately forward-looking monetary policy. thus take account forecast available internationalorganisations imf oecd well internal forecasts. bi review 60/19994we aware forecast interpret great caution. give behavioural,institutional structural uncertainties, forecast price development euroarea inevitably difficult. moreover, forecast cannot encompass indicator variablesthat important monetary policy. nor always incorporate indicator timelymanner. furthermore, time forecast finalised, original assumptionsmay become le realistic, require careful interpretation results. therefore, athorough analysis individual indicator variable play important role monetarypolicy strategy, addition role variable may forecast.within stability-oriented monetary policy strategy, eurosystem also take accountthe external value euro important determinant outlook price stability. ifexchange rate development pose significant threat price stability euro area, allother thing equal, monetary policy respond. of course, factorsthat impart information price development also take account aninterest rate decision taken.monetary policy decision outlook price stabilityin december 1998 govern council announce interest rate mainrefinancing operation would 3%. in first quarter 1999 govern council keptthis rate unchanged. after in-depth

strategy. the decision thus take forward-looking perspective, focus medium-term trend inflation compatibility ofthese trend eurosystem’s definition price stability. by adhere strategy,the eurosystem’s monetary policy contribute create economic condition areessential exploit considerable growth potential euro area reducinguncertainty future economic developments.i like take opportunity explain current assessment, line withthe govern council’s expectation begin april. with regard first pillarof eurosystem’s monetary policy strategy, monetary growth cannot see signallingupcoming inflationary pressure stage. since begin year, three-monthmoving average m3 growth close reference value 4.5%. for periodfrom january march 1999 average growth rate increase somewhat 5.2%. thisobservation may, however, affect special factor prevail start stagethree. therefore, current assessment govern council regard currentmonetary trend constitute signal future inflationary pressures.with regard second pillar eurosystem’s monetary policy strategy, broadlybased outlook price development risk price stability various indicator offuture price development economic activity euro area indicate favourableoutlook price stability. financial indicator low level long-term interestrates point low inflation expectation credibility monetary policy. follow thecut short-term interest rates, long-term

anirrevocable link currency “currency board arrangement” fully implementedmonetary union.in january 1993, riksbank announce inflation target 2 per cent inflation – 1 per cent. thetarget achieve 1995.this second major realignment stabilisation policy. sweden go inflation targetand float exchange rate. this force sweden international development withderegulation capital markets, sweden well, least failure attempt atcorporative co-operation stabilisation policy interventions. the government could look backat 15 year unsuccessful stabilisation policy. the shift new policy take place 1993and 1995. bi review 59/19994however, add regard fail defence krona, experience freecapital movement especially extensive. the government riksbank politicalanalysts sweden experience condition economic policy globalisedworld.the new stabilisation policy regimethe government formulate goal monetary policy january 1993. inflation bemaintained two per cent per year tolerance interval +/- 1 per cent. the goal symmetric.it important bring inflation two per cent actual inflation two per cent itis bring inflation high target.this say lot practical issue remain resolve answer allobvious:1. how inflation measured: cpi, gdp deflator, measure pricemovements?2. shall riksbank objective besides price stability?3. shall policy direct control money supply inflation directly?4. how confidence establish riksbank’s policy expectation low inflation?1. the inflation targetthe riksbank’s objective express follow way legislation:“the objective riksbank’s operation shall maintain price stability.in addition, riksbank shall promote safe efficient payment system.”the first objective therefore make concrete riksbank 2 per cent inflation witha tolerance one per cent upwards downwards.the second objective, stability payment system require monitor “infrastructure” inthe payment system major institution could associate systemic risk thebanking system. the second objective hardly know although important also continue tobe riksbank’s responsibility sweden join monetary union, emu.the riksbank opt measure inflation consumer price index, cpi. this measure hascertain disadvantages, although great advantage know spread among thegeneral public. “inflation” understand general public slow rise cpi.the disadvantage cpi measure affect policy carry theriksbank. if inflation low risk turn deflation, economy need stimulated. theriksbank reduce instrumental rate increase activity capacity utilisation theeconomy.however, first thing happen inflation reduce even become deflation asinterest rate fall house cost become lower. these namely include cpi. only somedelay effect level activity inflation right direction. this lead tomisjudged policies.another example problem cpi follows: if government tighten fiscal policy avat increase, cpi rises, vat direct effect inflation measure way. the effect 5bis review 59/1999such measures, interest rate change tax change temporary. these normally result one-offeffects price level.however, cannot always right tighten monetary policy increase interest rate becauseinflation increase vat increase time dampen demand low thelevel activity capacity utilisation. in time, inflation dampen vat increase,although take place mean increase price – bear mind though depend oninflationary expectation affected. a different situation arise then.this show cpi movement must interpret analyse decide monetary policy.temporary effect price level initiate change monetary policy. the riksbank istherefore study number index weakness cpi aspectstaken here.a harmonise index, hicp, design entire eu area. this use europeancentral bank, ecb, measure include interest rate changes, although includeindirect tax subsidies.another index, undix, measure “underlying” inflation exclude direct effect ofindirect taxes, well interest effects.by study index compare cpi, riksbank obtain view temporaryeffects economic policy lead monetary policy changes.however, mean riksbank able say advance inflation deviatefrom two per cent target due temporary effect i speak about.2. should riksbank objective besides inflation?as regard stabilisation policy, riksbank one task law, namely strive stable pricelevel, riksbank interpret two per cent inflation. the bank aim constant pricesprimarily price especially wage display inertia downward direction. it wouldtherefore difficult change relative price relative wage price level constant onaverage. the riksbank would also force carry deflationary policy repeat occasions,if constant price objective.moreover, know quality improvements, reflect rise prices, measuredin correct way different price indexes. a particular (low) measure inflation factcorrespond price stability, consideration take technical development continually improvingthe quality good services.monetary policy operate considerable lag. the current view monetary policy changehas maximum effect six eight quarter afterwards. this involve considerable difficulty withrespect carry monetary policy well evaluate policy carry out.monetary policy must therefore elaborate take consideration view inflation oneor two year period. therefore, riksbank make inflation forecast time period regularintervals. monetary policy therefore control intermediate goal, namely inflationforecasts.it would unreasonable try immediately bring back inflation two per cent inflation washigher. it would require dramatic reduction capacity utilisation deterioration thesituation labour market. bi review 59/19996the riksbank therefore weigh situation labour market real activity itsassessments. in short run, trade-off stability inflation rate stability inthe real economy. an unremitting stabilisation rate inflation narrowly around two percent would time lead real economic instability.precisely reason, target horizon set one two years, time theriksbank endeavour gradually meet inflation target, steer inflation towards two per cent,guided inflation forecasts, make period.in long run, however, trade-off inflation employment. a low, stableinflation provide prerequisite fast growth high employment, accord experiencesfrom early periods, first two decade war. we see developmentthat seem confirm hypothesis.it therefore say employment capacity utilisation directly affect government’smonetary policy extent compliance inflation target take place graduallywithin period two years. this avoid great fluctuation real economy – inemployment capacity utilisation otherwise.however, unemployment capacity utilisation affect inflation therefore include ascomponents inflation forecasts. these circumstance therefore also play indirect role theriksbank’s monetary policy.the exchange rate objective riksbank policy although also direct indirecteffect inflation.an appreciation exchange rate have, thing equal, immediatelydampening effect import prices. a import price include cpi, inflation reduced.the exchange rate affect inflation indirectly affect demand. a high real exchange ratereduces export thereby reduce level activity time lag. this indirect effect tendsto reduce inflation somewhat long run.supply also affect exchange rate time (initially) affect import export prices,which eventually spread price wages.by direct indirect effect exchange rate inflation, exchange rate play role forthe riksbank’s policy case change exchange rate expect be, provesto durable.the riksbank also study various measure change quantity money well banklending. these quantity also vary degree co-variation inflation, ratherlong time-lag.altogether, say capacity utilisation, inflation expectations, exchange rate themost important determine factor underlie inflation forecasts.what say summarise main content stabilisation policy regime wasestablished 1992. on 1 january 1999, riksbank make formally autonomous politicalinfluence since govern executive board six members. 7bis review 59/19993. shall policy control quantity money inflation directly?some central banks, previously german bundesbank european central bank, ecb,have (unclear) quantity money target policy. these bank endeavour meet theinflation target try control expansion quantity money.in fact, considerable similarity method aim quantity moneyand inflation.the banks’ mean repo rate set affect quantity money inflation.however, case inflation, quantity money cannot either directly control therepo rate. both bank aim quantity money inflation, work so-calledintermediary target, inflation control view inflation forecast diverge actualinflation, growth quantity money diverge inflation.this show difference inconsiderable two approach practice. bank withan inflation target also study change quantity money make inflation forecasts.banks say quantity money target deviate without ceremony itclearly lead wrong direction take consideration inflation forecast bank alsowork with.4. confidencethere great benefit publish inflation forecast. the general public see thebank ass inflation one two years’ time, well found forecast is, policy iscarried relation forecast made.the riksbank’s task lay swedish people riksdag decision, imentioned begin with, namely maintain fix monetary value.to end, riksbank make autonomous, so-called autonomy means.however, riksbank responsible riksdag policy present account itspolicy twice year parliamentary stand committee finance. the riksdag’s possibility ofsanction replace member executive board year, member executiveboard vary period office.the chairman vice-chairman govern council riksbank follow executiveboard’s work right attend speak board meetings.this must democracy. delegation power must accompany possibility ofholding account. by riksbank open objectives, forecast assessmentsthat make executive board, confidence establish riksbank’s policyamong politicians, investor general public. i consider sweden find reasonableand balance approach implementation eu directive.5. be alternatives?we thus note sweden undertake fundamental change policy. from havingdirected stabilisation policy full employment high priority, policy realign tocreate stability. low inflation constitute economic environment full employmentshall restored. bi review 59/19998the objective “price stability” delegate autonomous riksbank instead – previously –fiscal monetary policy coordinate government achieve full employmentand price stability. full employment aim long-term economic growth.i give fairly detail account failure stabilisation policy lead changeof course.sweden alone change approach economic stabilisation policy. a similar change ofcourse take place country country – fact, take place late sweden – inwhich context deregulation financial market nationally internationally play crucialrole.sweden’s economic success century result openness towards thesurrounding world, large foreign trade, growth large multinational companies. it wouldnot possible adopt completely different approach liberalisation foreignexchange legislation capital market without large cost sweden. it therefore besaid alternative new approach economic policy would feasible.however, also say present economic order changes, sweden follow thetide. no economic policy regime last forever. to date distinguish least five distinctregimes/epochs century. history come end.6. conclusionthe principle i outline illustrate riksbank’s policy spring. at thespecial monetary policy meet 2 november, repo rate 3.4 per cent. the riksbanknoted interest rate inflation would le target two per cent one twoyears’ time. the bank consider due temporary factor direct effect ofearlier reduction interest rate house cost adjustment indirect tax andsubsidies. the temporary factor consider correspond 0.5 per cent inflation 1999 1per cent 2000.however, even take consideration temporary transitional factors, inflation expect tobe le two per cent one two years’ time. the interest rate therefore reduce 2.9 percent, bite le european central bank’s repo rate.this illustrate riksbank works. painstaking inflation forecast work out. theadjustment monetary policy reach inflation target take place successively without bankglancing monetary policy countries, except extent policy affect theriksbank’s inflation forecast.by publication forecasts, minute meet take account riksbank’s explicitlydeclared objectives, clients, swedish people, riksdag, evaluate policiescarried out. 1bis review 58/1999bank japan’s may report recent economic financial developments1bank japan,

rental enter cpi typically base onan average outstanding contract price new contract strike -which past year fall much steeply. thus, think ofbusiness decisions, even assume residential rental

criticise construction ofthe cpi, is, far i able judge, absolutely appropriate term arrive anoverall cost-of-living index, i suggest qualification may need tobe use analysis, business decision discuss

fiscal stance (slide 7), asdefined size budget balance relative gdp. this reversal morecommon position hong kong relatively loose monetary tight fiscal policy. the chartconfirms historically, one might expect, generally offset balanceof two policy components. i think, nevertheless, tendency exaggerate tightness monetary policy atthe present time. this happen simplistic approach measure realinterest rate assess influence. i best illustrate reference theillustration slide 8. a april last year, 12-month hibor 8.0%. look back overthe precede 12 month (ie april 1997 april 1998),

4.2% (i base aninterpolation annual figure consensus private sector forecaster thattime), yield somewhat low real rate 3.8%. but forecast inflation turn tobe wildly wrong; actual outturn 12 month april 1998 april 1999 minus2.6%, mean real rate actually realised, thus experience someoneborrowing lend twelve month hibor, was, cpi basis, 10.6%. on top ofthat, marginal/average adjustment rental i refer early would tendedto raise realise real rate even further, price influence business decisionsprobably fell cpi. in sum, start headline real rate 3.3% endedup rate well excess 10½%. business would affect factorsresponsible difference figures, would able toanticipate them. if move april year, position rather different. the backward-looking realrate, tend one people take guide clamour aboutoppressive monetary policy, indeed high 8.9% - take 12-month hibor thebase. but expectation price go move rather down, theforward-looking measure, base consensus forecast (from private sector) thepublished cpi show, yield much less, 5.6%. in addition, marginal/averageadjustment may turn corner, since business decision-takers may facingprices rise record cpi, case real interest rate nowbe perceive low 5.6%. perception may still figure 3-4%range, often regard global norm; perception vary, may somewho visualise low figure. we course yet position observe actualoutcome; may, last year, surprise store. my example base 12-month hibor; may, course, benchmark high low reference pointwhich relevant individual decisions. i hope i succeed demonstrate measurement real interest rate israther complex may appear first sight, dependent also context. if look popular measure real rate - nominal rate deflate bya measure past inflation - recovery asset price hong kong recentmonths would seem inexplicable, real rate would appear high. therecovery asset price would, however, consistent reduction perceive real rates- fact i suggest occurred, fairly significant scale, asexpectations inflation probably become positive headline record inflationremains negative. for see downside implication theconsensus forecast general inflation expect resume, worth note thatthe forecast magnitude modest. i would pretend every piece evidence unequivocally support thesis today. forinstance, continue lethargy bank lend business hong kong might suggest thathigh real interest rate remain deterrent borrow investment. however, i suspectthat, may well case little ago, period wheredecisions influence confidence factor relate broad economicsituation interest rate per se, although interest rate course remain important. bi review 54/19994 i point element present economic conjuncture - namely, competitivenessand interest rate - position may bleak paint some. but i notdeny face tough challenge i note

among financialinstitutions, uniqueness bank decline combine financial institution regulatorsand adoption similar, identical, regulation make sense. add powerful single regulatorto powerful independent central bank would create entity significant authority outsidethe day-to-day direct purview government, government opt combine regulatorsand strip supervisory regulatory power central

stability implications. particularly ina crisis, central bank without knowledge way market actually operate – knowledge cangained experience hands-on contact bank organization – be, willexcuse ex-professor’s metaphor, risk fail final exam. a result, i think separationof central bank supervision regulation dangerous.the supervisory regulatory approach unite states, embody financial modernizationlegislation federal reserve supports, quite different trend abroad. it provide animportant role central bank process umbrella supervisor. it also make importantdistinction insure depository institution bank organization non-bankaffiliates (or perhaps cases, operate subsidiaries). specifically, approach envision ale intense degree supervision regulation non-bank activity

operate effectively respect non-bankfinancial institution and, regulator job right, non-bank activity within bankingorganizations. a non-bank activity grow within bank organizations, regulator must alert tomarket inference non-bank activity within bank organization cover expandedsafety net. regulator must establish appropriate expectation respect limit safetynet, confirm expectation actions, maximize market discipline non-bankactivities minimize level intrusion. the alternative, impose bank-like regulation non-bank activities, exactly wrong direction. we would rather work towards enhance

the baselconsultative paper point direction, federal reserve already move implementsuch approach. recent supervisory guidance stress bank set target capital thatshould appropriately align risk profile

adequacy disclosure believe opportunitiesfor bank – especially large, complex bank organization large share assetsfunded uninsured liability – reveal information. one possibility would anindustry-led task force identify best-practice respect bank disclosure provide bank anincentive move towards best practice frontier. any effort flexible, notnecessarily dictate disclosure bank allow bank choose mosteffective way disclose – qualitative quantitative information.in supervisory practice regulatory standard draw distinction large andmost complex bank organization (what refer lcbos) overwhelm

far away. hence, despite number riskfactors (such steep upturn oil prices) stability euro presumably currently injeopardy. this optimistic conclusion suggest follow factors:(1) low interest-rate level historical standards. the recent rise longer-term interest ratesno doubt mirror favourable expectation business activity; rather beregarded rejection spectre deflation reflection latent inflationexpectations;(2) keen competition factor good market (due globalisation launch ofthe euro) results, one hand, substantial growth productivity but, other,also strong downward price pressure

primary task maintain monetary stability, ecb endowed, treatyof maastricht, high degree independence. notwithstanding number dissent voices,especially english-speaking area, ecb convince monetary

point ecb govern council swiftly grow intoa body common conviction perceptions; process, increasingly generate aeuropean “stability culture” distinct particular national interests.in view auspicious underlie economic institutional conditions, appear completelymisplaced worry stability euro. and yet, long-standing experience thebundesbank inflation often declare dead, never actually died. nothing moredangerous complacency slacken vigilance.where might future risk stability euro lie? well, first place, number ofunavoidable problem arise connection transition large common monetary area.it doubtful, instance, whether demand for, velocity circulation of, money thenew monetary area sufficiently stable outset. what impact of, say,structural change financial sector (catchwords are: trend towards securitisation towardsdisintermediation)? what implication monetary policy ecb differingmonetary policy transmission channel within eurozone?these transitional difficulty make light of, means. even so, diminishin significance – albeit short run – increase experience gain within eurosystem. bi review 100/19992it certainly interest see ecb respond first time feel “head wind”. itis long-standing experience bundesbank acid test monetary policy come arestrictive policy stance pursued. in context, prevail structure eurosystemnaturally raise variety special questions:1.will ecb govern council act quickly resolutely even confrontedwith massive political opposition?2.will general public europe support ecb unreservedly german citizensbacked bundesbank, i.e. ecb enjoy comparable

questions. but hand, itis obvious ecb, new institution, initially earn public confidence (and thus thesame time due scope formulation current monetary policy), even though likely haveinherited certain “advance” confidence bundesbank.but crucial issue affect stability euro relationship betweennational fiscal, economic, structural wage policy, one hand, supranational monetarypolicy, other, evolve euro area.the fundamental problem every country. a central bank control expansion ofthe money stock, least medium term. but depend policy area whether theleeway thus gain exploited• real economic growth stable prices, or• raise prices, accompany stagnate even decline economic performance.thus, preserve monetary stability, central bank always dependent cooperation thegovernment power party wage settlements; mean policy-mix iscompatible stability non-inflationary growth ultimately achieved.in euro area face special problem: single monetary policy eleven memberstates accompany national responsibility wage policy, fiscal policy economic policy.it true close coordination fiscal economic policy envisage article 98, 99 and104 ec treaty, know stability growth pact (i.e. all: decisionson common feature economic policy mutual budget surveillance), coordinationmechanisms still prove worth practice. a great deal depend policymakersbehaving sufficient discipline interest stability single

various member states, since level andmaturity pattern public debt diverge vastly. a naturally also affect compliance rulesof stability growth pact, restrictive monetary policy also involve additional conflictpotential.in context, important question durability internal cohesion euro area mustnot disregarded, either.on one hand, view continue convergence integration eurozone, optimismcertainly seem warranted: suggest increase cyclical synchrony, progressiveintegration financial market (and especially european money market), 3bis review 100/1999completion single european market. on hand, substantial regional difference anddivergences cannot rule (just think, instance, north/south divide italy, theeast/west divide germany due reunification). the range possible cause could wider,for example• asymmetric external shocks,• divergent pay settlements,• differ national policy priorities, or• diverse national structural conditions.generally speaking, true say that, flexible national goods, service labour marketsare, low demand compensatory measure part national fiscal, economicand structural policies. but precisely market flexibility weak link many european member states(and go particularly germany). in many case considerable need reform, e.g.with respect reduce government expenditure ratio, deregulation, restructure socialsecurity system adjust tax legislation.there are, however, good grind hop pressure exert single currency willgreatly foster reform process. yet even major step take towards flexibility, risk ofnational regional special development never rule altogether.whereas use possible, least certain degree, respond special national problem bymodifying interest rate and/or exchange rate, option long available monetaryunion. the consequence demand make political compensatory measures, thewillingness ability national policymakers respond, european coordination processhave definitely risen. national failure, especially part major country, may apronounced impact common interest-rate level and/or external value euro.finally, state affair also give rise question suitability underlyinginstitutional conditions, i.e. ec treaty. considerable doubt exist whether, light ofthe demand describe policy compatible euro, demarcation responsibilitiesbetween european level national level, rule coordinate community decisionsand structure european

counterinflationary policy setting. but acid test still lie ahead. the majoropportunities afford euro accompany correspond risk challenges. the fate ofthe euro year ahead hinge crucially whether

workerswho unemployed long period time likely see technology skill deteriorate.but might regulation design protect job perverse effect? the evidencesuggests new technology often result growth

oecd study, unite state policy effective inpreventing anti-competitive behavior, germany far behind. why competitiveenvironment foster innovation? one hypothesis competition force firm innovate adoptnew technology and, therefore, increase speed diffusion technology. in contrast,monopolists may little incentive innovate already control market.competition also tend result failure unproductive

broad perspective, productivity growth obviously society’s priority –worker health safety, pollution control societal value important well. although ithas argue regulation require mandate approach pollution reduction workersafety tend divert managerial energy pursue cost-reducing innovations, study shownthat regulatory change fact enhance productivity force firm develop new andmore-efficient

environment customer whose ethicalstandards may different own. this put extra strain “know customer”policy upon regulator insistent. business deal russia case point. hereyou situation country make transition communist capitalisteconomy. this naturally create profit opportunity western banks. it could indeed almost beargued bank moral responsibility assist transform russian

view strictly commercialterms. but ethical dimension well. be right bank business russian bi review 98/19992customers handle fund flow russia cannot sure origin thefunds? no doubt many bank ask questions, wake story hugeamounts russian money launder bank new york possibly westernbanks. note suggestion stage bank actively participate moneylaundering. indeed, yet clear money laundering, oppose capital flight, wasgoing on. however, difficult question go asked, least u congress, thebanks concern go cope negative publicity.ethical dilemma also arise bank try innovate, particularly stray outside theirhome territory. take example country, form bank scotland’sproposed joint venture telephone bank american evangelist dr pat robertson. this wasdesigned enable bank expand abroad help new

wing politician controversial view variety ofissues, include gay rights. news bank scotland’s propose business link persondid go well gay activist trade unionist scotland indeed shareholdersand public generally. matter help dr robertson highly critical moralvalues scotland. the bank force pull deal, pay compensation dr robertsonand issue public apology stress “long-standing commitment ethical values”.despite apology, whole episode widely regard public relation disaster.what lesson learn episode? the first, i suppose, bank need carefulabout business relationship controversial politicians, whether right leave wing variety.the second increase power medium social pressure group throw spotlight onwhat regard “unethical” business activities. in case banks, activity might includefinancing arm trade industry damage environment. the third way whichethical value change differ societies: anti-gay attitude doubtacceptable mid-west unite states, clearly felt violate modern notionsof fairness, equality non-discrimination modern-day scotland. the final point small theglobal market place become event one country impinge others. the chairmanof bank comment foresee controversy surround dr robertsonwould cross atlantic scotland political constituency business. this provokedthe comment bank appreciate new technology shrink world.the moral story bank need consider action – anywhere world – willaffect customer perceive them. but customer people bank haveto worry about. they also need take account regulator various jurisdiction theyoperate fact regulatory standard may shift time. the credit suisse group has, forexample, recently run problem japanese regulator one subsidiary injapan accuse engage window-dress transaction japanese banks. thesetransactions deem current regulator “inappropriate”, though wereapparently regard past. this illustrate bank may encounter termed“regulatory risk” simply break law. it also show problem face decidingwhich transaction indeed “appropriate” rule game various market inwhich operate may clearly defined, rule shift line changingstandards right wrong.the global reach many business create practical problem control enforcement ofcompliance regulatory ethical standards, collapse bar bank clearly showed. butthese issue also arise domestic market bank diversify fee-related business asthe sale insurance investment management advice. leave aside possible risk fromrogue fund managers, activity raise conflict interest issue whether particularproducts suitable need customers. the classic case thing go wrong isthe recent pension mis-selling scandal uk. hundred thousand employee werepersuaded pension salesman company represent (including major bank andinsurance companies) switch occupational pension scheme

mandatoryprovident fund scheme. they also alive type ethical conflict mayarise bank environment become increasingly competitive even focus onthe bottom line. the hkma already point result interest rate deregulation thatthere winner loser among bank customers. those small balance relativelylarge volume transaction may find increase fee outweigh benefit increase theinterest pay deposits. a happen elsewhere, bank may also become selective intheir choice customer level customer service may affect number branchesis prune save costs.a move towards user pay approach reduction cross-subsidisation manifestation thegreater efficiency deregulation intend produce. but bank need careful thisprocess handle tact sensitivity. otherwise, may open accusation sectionsof community neglect social responsibility curtail increase costof basic bank service economically disadvantaged. this certainly accusation madeagainst australian bank deregulation there. a aspect possibility higherand extensive charge bank service make important bank todeliver sufficient information customer charges.let clarify point hkma’s attitude ethical matter particularly issue of“fairness” customers. our main responsibility bank ordinance promote thegeneral stability effective work bank system. in common bank regulator inother countries, interpret mean principal concern determine thatindividual bank financially sound prudently managed. the aim reduce risk bankfailure would result depositor lose money threaten stability bank system asa whole. we concentrate therefore check bank adequate capital

ensure authorise institution operate “responsible, honestand business-like manner”;• promote encourage “proper standard conduct sound prudent businesspractices” ;• suppress “illegal, dishonourable improper practices”.these specific function relate general function promote stability thebanking sector. clearly, bank involve illegal improper activity (such fraud moneylaundering) may threaten reputation bank concern also bankingsystem whole. this turn may lead loss public confidence banks.i believe however function also imply broad interest concept “fairness” theprovision bank services. this say hkma act “consumer watchdog”in investigate adjudicate dispute bank customer matter thecost quality bank services. but time indifferent bankstreat customer general. if bank consistently provide bad unfair service, may damagethe reputation bank destroy customer loyalty confidence. take extremes, bi review 98/19994system whole could bring disrepute. this promote code bankingpractice

pennsylvania 8 september 1999.* * *often interest part presentation challenge subject – economicoutlook implication monetary policy – q&a formal remarks. this isespecially case audience well inform

second responsewas, hand – isn’t always “other hand” economist start talk – ialways remind audience end talk i prepare “entertain” theirquestions. they soon learn rather different answer them. this distinction isimportant question i prepare respond.today i try resolve tension proceed directly q&a, but, time,orchestrating q&a first identify question i prepare answer thenanswering them. when i complete exercise, welcome offer answer tomy question or, course, raise additional question entertain.i ask answer two set question – first relate economic outlook secondto strategy monetary policy. in case, i focus implication conduct ofcurrent monetary policy. let also emphasize question answer reflect myown view interpret position fomc board governors.i.outlook q&a1.has upturn productivity growth?what confidently say that, since late 1995, actual productivity growth increase and,indeed, move still high end 1998 early 1999. in addition, improvementcannot fully account normal cyclical improvement productivity growth increasedfurther gdp growth stabilize 4%. this support view anincrease trend productivity growth. in addition, recent improve productivity performance iseven remarkable, give decline unemployment rate almost 30-year low mighthave expect result employment lower-skilled hence less-productive workers.before discuss possible source implication development, let clarify i meanby trend productivity growth. first, i use refer maximum sustainable rate growth inproductivity, economy reach capacity. look backward, measure byde-cycling actual productivity growth compute actual productivity growth period longenough wash effect business cycle. extrapolate trend rate forward, rateof actual productivity growth would expect economy remain full employment.trend productivity growth vary widely post-war period, 3% the1960s close 1% decade precede expansion. because actual productivity highlypro-cyclical considerable noise quarterly observations, easy discernimmediately change underlie trend. this analytical problem complicate inthe current episode unexpectedly weak productivity growth early expansion. recent data bi review 94/19992are consistent increase productivity trend, give evidence upturn inthe productivity trend recent, considerable uncertainty remain underlie trendwill go forward.many forecasters, included, revise upward estimate trend productivitygrowth response recent unexpectedly strong productivity growth. many estimate arenow 2% slightly higher. part increase – ¼ percentage point – earliertrend 1% reflect improve measurement fact acceleration trueproductivity. beyond that, estimate 2% trend imply trend rate productivity growth hasincreased ½ percentage point. i not, however, want put much emphasis thatpoint estimate, give uncertainty i believe surround calculation. but incrementalchange even ½ percentage point really enormous sustain several decades.the source improvement combination capital deepen fast rate oftechnical advance. it appear ratio capital service labor rise appreciably inthe past year result prevail high level net investment. this likely account forsome portion recent improvement labor productivity. in addition, portion thisimprovement may also reflect high rate technical advance, relate rapid pace ofinnovation information communication technology high-tech contribution toproduction.the implication acceleration productivity profound, least increase issustained go forward considerable period. productivity is, course, close relative realincome per capita, widely use measure live standards. high productivity growth thereforemeans fast rate improvement live standards. it also mean increase tax revenue thegovernment enhance ability country meet longer-run spend obligations, includingsocial security.of course, federal reserve, key question is, high productivity growth mean formonetary policy? first, monetary policy never target specific rate growth output butrather adjust change resource utilization rate inflation. this growth itselfdoes cause inflation; excessive utilization rate proximate source inflationpressures. we sometimes try capture say monetary policy foster themaximum sustainable growth economy capable achieving. more precisely, fullemployment, monetary policy accommodate maximum growth push theeconomy beyond point.a monetary policy focus maintain price stability careful avoid stifle unexpectedincreases trend growth, specifically confuse high trend growth above-trend growth. inaddition, monetary policy cannot accept responsibility raise trend growth. the contributionmonetary policy make regard promote price stability thereby reduce theallocative distortion possible bias save investment associate inflation.another reason avoid growth target monetary policy prefer growth rate, atany time, depend prevail utilization rates. if economy full employment thepreferred rate inflation, trend growth indeed prefer outcome. however, theeconomy initially utilization rate high enough result rise inflation time, preferredgrowth outcome trend, allow unwind initial excess demand.therefore, always precise characterize monetary policy response term ofadjustments change prevail project utilization rate rather term responseto prevail project growth. unfortunately, sometimes difficult gauge degree ofexcess demand associate give utilization rate, subject i return later.what implication monetary policy step-up trend productivity growth and, hence,trend real gdp growth? first, development would ultimately call upward revision thetargets money growth, money growth target would remain consistent anunchanged target inflation rate. a practical matter, however, serious policy issuebecause monetary aggregate target play minor role conduct monetary policytoday. at rate, adjustment might premature today, give uncertainty 3bis review 94/1999underlying trend. however, apparent high trend productivity gdp growth persists, somepoint money growth range appropriately adjusted.under prevail operational regime set target federal fund rate, money growthwould automatically adjust accommodate high rate trend growth, unchanged nominalfederal fund rate target. over long run, challenge interest-rate regime align thereal federal fund rate new equilibrium value, likely increase high trendrate productivity growth (due high return capital underlie new equilibrium realinterest rate economy).the principal challenge monetary policy focus utilization rate unexpected shift inproductivity growth, effect low unemployment rate consistent stable inflation (thenairu) while. this allow economy operate high utilization rate withoutinflationary consequences, least high productivity fully anticipate wage bargainingor productivity growth stop accelerating.let explain source decline effective nairu. assume increase inproductivity anticipate therefore immediately raise workers’ real wage demands.with unchanged nominal wage demand high productivity, firm experience decline inunit labor costs. this initially boost profits. but competition quickly force low cost tobe pass consumer low prices, low price inflation relative nominal wagechange. this decline inflation, turn, put downward pressure nominal wage gains.the net result unanticipated increase rate growth productivity another exampleof favorable supply shock, temporarily low inflation. it useful, nevertheless, distinguishprice shock – decline energy non-oil import price – productivity growth shocksthat initial effect cost rather prices.during transitional period follow unexpected increase productivity trend, untilproductivity growth stabilize high rate become anticipate possible operate atresource utilization rate beyond sustainable long run without inflationaryconsequences. it perfectly reasonable take advantage opportunity, long care takento return sustainable utilization rate disinflationary force upward shift inproductivity growth dissipates. of course, policymakers must also weigh option “opportunisticdisinflation” circumstance – possibility reduce inflation toward long-run targetwithout depressing, even temporarily, resource utilization rates. however, inflation already itstarget, option permit temporarily high output employment clearly dominates.the apparent increase productivity trend probably important disinflationary forceover last years. some benefit case take form low inflationand form temporarily high resource utilization rates. an important issue therefore iswhether current utilization rate sustainable, productivity growth stabilizes. this issuemotivated next question answer.2.is economy overheated, threat overheating?an overheat economy one operate beyond point sustainable capacity thereforeexperiencing excess demand labor product markets. the importance concept followsfrom reasonable expectation excess demand labor product market proximatesource high inflation.so, economy overheated? there two way identify condition. the first findsome proxy excess demand labor product markets. we satisfy withproxies excess demand directly measurable. the second look consequencesof overheating, form acceleration wage gain prices.proxies excess demand utilization rate labor product market – theunemployment rate labor market capacity utilization product market. capacityutilization measure “industrial” sector, narrow measure generalize excessdemand product market. nevertheless, remain important proxy balance supply bi review 94/19994and demand product market. at give time, low unemployment rate high capacityutilization rate imply great demand relative supply respective market.but also search absolute concept, point balance supply demand inthe respective market divide excess demand excess supply – effect, origin adiagram relate inflation excess demand supply. that’s difficult part, observeonly absolute unemployment capacity utilization rate estimate respective“natural” rates, level consistent balance supply demand respectivemarkets. bad still, balance point want identify fixed, shift time.obviously, stable natural rate are, useful concept forecast andpolicy analysis. the le stable are, uncertainty point theunderlying degree excess demand.we choice estimate natural rate equation try capture inflationdynamics. that’s phillips curve – equation relate nominal wage change expectedinflation excess demand labor market, proxied unemployment rate relative animplicit estimate nairu, derive directly estimation equation.we encounter several difficulty apply framework recent period. first, basedon equation wage dynamics, evidence suggest decline nairu moreuncertainty current value. second, signal excess demand come labor andproduct market – unemployment capacity utilization rate – diverge anunusual degree, make assessment overall degree excess demand economy stillmore difficult. third, economy subject powerful price shock episode –including significant swing oil price exchange rates. such shock second proximatesource movement inflation, presence complicate identification signalfrom excess demand well assessment utilization rate trigger rise inflation inthe near term. fourth, appear upturn productivity trend, which, asnoted above, act disinflationary force period time, mask underlie excessdemand complicate assessment sustainable utilization rates.so, put u term proxy excess demand? the answer leaf uswith considerable uncertainty. we’re environment reasonable people disagree aboutwhether currently excess demand economy and, give uncertainty, whetheror ought use evidence base estimate excess demand directly conduct ofmonetary policy. it also put priority develop strategy take account possible shift inand uncertainty productivity growth nairu.although appear excess demand labor market, effect diminish bythe combination absence correspond excess demand product markets, residue ofthe long period reinforce favorable price shocks, force unexpected acceleration intrend productivity. a favorable price shock dissipate reverse trend productivitygrowth stabilizes, risk excess demand labor market put economy pathof rise inflation, unless growth slow enough unwind excess demand inflation begin tomove upward.given momentum sale expectation strong pace inventory build secondhalf, consensus growth rebound second half trend above, though havenot yet see effect spend rise bond rate flatten equity price sincethe spring. this help slow growth domestic demand. although risk thatgrowth could remain trend therefore aggravate initial excess demand, major concernremains prevail balance supply demand labor market might put upwardpressure inflation, even growth slow trend ahead.let briefly comment second indicator excess demand. instead try measure thestate balance imbalance supply demand, could focus observe theconsequence excess demand – specifically, increase price – or, give initial inflation rate,increases inflation. unfortunately, supply shocks, cannot always make thisidentification easily. i read recent inflation data least suggest underlie 5bis review 94/1999inflation rate stabilizing, period decline, without evidence broad-based upturn ininflation. nominal wage increase moderate since middle 1998, likely reflect thedecline inflation associate combination favorable supply shocks, include theunexpected increase productivity trend. some recent data suggest growth ofnominal compensation long declining, hint data anecdote thatwage pressure may building.how monetary policy respond increase utilization rates? should real interest rate heldconstant utilization rate increase threshold, example, real interest ratesbe smoothly pro-cyclical, gradually increase response rise utilization rates? that issimply question systematic policy response work best promote dual objective ofmonetary policy: promote price stability damp fluctuation around full employment. myjudgment regime gradual, systematic pro-cyclical response real interestrates one produce best trade-off inflation output variability. this thekind response embody taylor rule, example, though practice, seen,implementation approach complicate uncertainty level nairu itscousin, output gap. i return problem i take question preemptivemonetary policy be.3.are equity overvalued, economy threaten asset market bubble?this perhaps most-asked question i get, i think i would preempt answer onedirectly – though may decide i choose entertain question!equity price increase enormously past four years, level challenge previousvaluation standards. let make clear outset i honestly know whether notequities fairly value overvalued. i nothing share question. what ido want share equity market fit think monetary policy. thoseof u fortunate enough attend year’s jackson hole conference, sponsor federalreserve bank kansa city, plenty opportunity think discus issue.most important, policymakers reflect high value equity forecast foraggregate spend adjust monetary policy necessary remain consistent broadobjectives monetary policy. the key remain focus broad macroeconomicperformance, respond indirectly movement equity price – whether high value ofequities appear drive fundamental otherwise – rather use policy directly influencethe value equities. if policy discipline pursuit broad macroeconomic objectives, willreduce (though eliminate) prospect equity become significantly overvalued.there are, nevertheless, several step policymakers might consider suspicion thatequities might overvalued. they could build assumption market correction theirforecast. that would seem reasonable could mistake. specifically, could discourage themfrom tighten response robust demand drive part past increase market values,counting instead autonomous correction equity values, degree time tobe extremely uncertain.on hand, give suspicions, policymakers alert potential atightening policy could disproportionate effect demand, induce reassessment ofmarket fundamentals. this mean, however, policymakers trap cannot respondto robust demand rise inflation risks. it suggest appreciate willbe uncertainty magnitude effect give policy tighten effectcould disproportionately large.while stock market target monetary policy, policymakers pay attentionto signal market. an aggressive rise equity price sign highly favorablefinancial condition general highly accommodative monetary policy particular. if thisoccurs economy already near potential, policymakers re-evaluate bi review 94/19996appropriateness policy set term promote price stability damp fluctuationsaround full employment.finally, policymakers alert need respond appropriately significant marketcorrection. it important note policymakers target level equity price theway way but, directions, take movement equityprices account forecast hence set monetary policy.ii.monetary policy q&a1.does prevail uncertainty structure economy recent forecasterrors diminish ability monetary policy preemptive?without doubt. but mean cannot preemptive element monetary policy.it mean policy likely le preemptive – hence reactive – otherwisewould be. the critical question preemptive monetary policy today?let begin answer question define i mean reactive preemptive policyapproaches. first, policy reactive respond incoming data preemptive alsoresponds forecast. this distinction backward-looking forward-looking policy.second, respect inflation, policy still preemptive respond incoming data onutilization rates, give link current utilization rate future inflation. of course, thedegree confidence policymakers link (and specifically measure excessdemand) determine preemptive prepare be.the great uncertainty level excess demand should, i believe, diminish theaggressiveness monetary policy respond change utilization rates. the difficulty inforecasting should, addition, encourage emphasis respond incoming data anddiminish (though eliminate) role forecast policy decision. this sensible andprudent. to sever relationship monetary policy either incoming data utilization rate tothe forecast altogether, however, would remove key element preemptive monetary policy withrespect contain inflation leave policy entirely reactive. if uncertainty great enough,this would reasonable response. but i believe extreme position warranted.there are, however, couple constructive policy response light prevail uncertainty aboutthe level excess demand forecast. first, policymakers could update estimate thenairu output gap (assuming, first place, find concept useful, i do)in light realization unemployment, output, inflation variables. this has, fact, beenone response many, include myself, take response recent developments. infollowing approach, policymakers would become le responsive decline unemploymentrate, extent estimate nairu revise downward unemployment inflationdecline together.second, policymakers could attenuate response real federal fund rate decline theunemployment rate region around estimate nairu. but unemployment rategets far enough (or above) estimate nairu confidence return labormarket experience excess demand (or supply), normal response real interest ratesto incremental decline unemployment rate would become appropriate.but careful overdo caution well overdo aggressiveness. if takecare adjust estimate nairu output gap response incoming data, wouldbe unwise ignore revise measure unemployment output gap set policy. 7bis review 94/19992.what mean symmetric asymmetric directives?i think become clear symmetry/asymmetry subtle concept.i believe two interrelate dimension so-called tilt bias monetary policy. thefirst dimension relate balance risk go forward. the second relate probability anear-term policy change.the tilt provide market indication committee’s balance risk relate toemerging excess demand supply inflation go forward hence direction policy ismore likely move. in symmetric directive, risk view evenly balanced, nextrate increase could easily down. in asymmetric directive, risk view tilt inone direction other, is, example, great likelihood increase decreasein rates.a symmetric directive also indicate little prospect near-term move require theeconomic outlook evolve roughly expected. an asymmetric directive, contrast, alert marketto great possibility, though certainty, move particular direction somenear-term policy horizon.at december 1998 meeting, fomc decided, go forward, announce tilt explainthe reason policy change case change committee’s view thebalance risk “significant” announce change public view as“important.” this make announcement tilt, effect, another policy tool anannounced change tilt would move market rates, though less degree change therate itself. this decision understand effort increase transparency monetarypolicy allow committee communicate clearly view balance risk andthe prospect policy action go forward. underlie effort view financialmarkets operate efficiently complete information preference forsignaling market prospective policy action rather surprise markets.the early experience use suggest announce adjustment tilt sometimes haveunexpectedly large effect financial market reaction market subsequent data orstatements fomc members. it also become clear easy communicate thesubtleties complexity monetary policy intention single word. when signal is, aresult, imperfect committee’s intention misperceived, market rate may moveinconsistently fast justify balance risk likely course policy. therecent experience suggest use announcement tilt view “work inprogress,” rather well-tuned final product.3.does response bond market evolve economic development reduce oreliminate importance activist monetary policy?a theme sometimes hear fomc take permanent vacation, leave conduct ofmonetary policy bond market. i hear refer “gyroscope” theory, itportrays bond market gyroscope economy, sensitively respond development soas stabilize economy. be simple!it sometimes say federal reserve look bond market really lookingat mirror. this mean market participant respond data, theirchanging forecast, understand policy reaction function. long-term rate are, afterall, base current expect future short-term rates. expect future short-term rates, turn, arevery much function fed’s policy response.what mean bond rate rise expectation future monetary policy tightening(that is, expectation high short-term rates), choice. we confirm theexpectations tightening, preserve high bond rates. or contradict expectationsby leave policy unchanged, likely result reversal initial movement bond rate bi review 94/19998(as bond market come good understand policy reaction function). there is, however, alsothe possibility failure tighten move widely expect may leave placehigher long-term rate (or raise further), failure act view inconsistent ourcommitment price stability.such preemptive price bond market private sector analogue preemptive move thefederal fund rate. when bond market correct, preemptive price reward theexpected movement federal fund rate. to fail reward would undermine abilityand willingness bond market engage preemptive pricing. on hand, thebond market view inappropriately build expectation high rates, monetary policyought provide anchor, form unchanged fund rate, bond market canreturn incorrect expectation unwound.the bottom line – vacation fed. but preemptive price bond market makemonetary policy effective speed response long-term rate change economicconditions. there potential synergy monetary policy bond market. the moretransparent monetary policy is, effective preemptive price bond market be. themore effective preemptive price bond market is, short lag change monetarypolicy effect aggregate demand, hence effective monetary policy is.iii.conclusionsum up! first, clarify logic recent feed tighten provide insight intothe prospect near-term monetary policy light comment outlook thestrategy monetary policy.in view, current monetary policy problem two dimensions. the first dimension adjustthe federal fund rate appropriate term prevail utilization inflation rates, withappropriate regard uncertainty measurement utilization rates. i call thereassessment issue involve reassessment desirability full amount easingsimplemented last fall. the second dimension involve adjustment fund rate go forward,in response incoming data change forecast.the ease last fall implement time sharp dislocation financial market sharpdownward revision forecast global u.s. growth year. i view recenttightenings partial reversal early easings, response reversal factor thatmotivated them. financial market clearly improved. the global economy look strong theunited state project expand year multiple rate project last fall. indetermining much ease reverse, one also take account decline coreinflation since last fall, well uncertainty translate current utilization rate intomeasures excess demand.what i say monetary policy go forward? i always like point i amprepared quite explicit course policy go forward. the answer question,what policy change i expect go forward, simple: “it depends.” specifically, depend theincoming data evolve forecast. 1bis review 93/1999mr lee examine major theme strengtheningthe global financial system background financial crisis

crisis first break out, many observer blame “asian model”. but thenother emerge markets, even develop world, come fire. it become clear problemwas asia, also weakness structure global financial system.there general agreement key weakness were, yet solutions. verybroadly, i identify five issues:• capital control – help?• exchange rate regime – fix floating?• hedge fund – imply global systemic stability?• global financial supervision – possible?• strengthen domestic institution – prerequisite participation global system.capital controlsthis crisis prompt reconsideration merit capital controls. in ideal world, theglobal capital market one integrate whole, restraint movement capital.then save could channel productive us country could fund theirinvestment need low possible cost.but reality many economy still lack institutional framework deal free capital flows.furthermore, investor prone herd behaviour result large surge capital andout countries. these surge cause bubble crash great harm economies,especially small vulnerable ones.the liberalisation capital account must thus treat caution. it must proceed fast thanthe strength countries’ domestic financial system institutional capability. control “hotmoney” difficult administer subject evasion, help make country lessvulnerable volatile financial markets.for instance indonesia, follow liberalisation bank sector late 1980s,companies make large short-term borrow foreign currencies. they circumvent rule intendedto prevent this. when crisis struck, indonesian government know much thecompanies borrowed. yet total almost us$ 50 billion1, double indonesia’sgross foreign reserves.the effect capital control malaysia impose september 1998 still debated.but even malaysia, implacably oppose speculator make quick profit, stillwelcomes foreign investor include portfolio investor buy malaysian shares. ultimately, allcountries still hope enjoy benefit global capital market foreign investmentsand transfer technology.1external debt non-bank sector total us$ 47 billion fy1997, account 83% total private external debtand 41% indonesia’s total external debt. bi review 93/19994in singapore, currency fully convertible. we abolish exchange control 1978. we norestrictions either inflow outflow funds. because financial centre, flow arelarge relative size economy. hence want careful let overwhelm ordamage real economy.this maintain policy non-internationalisation singapore dollar (s$). thisis form exchange capital control. it monetary policy measure deter speculationagainst s$. it prevent non-residents borrow s$ purpose unrelated economyfor example fund short position s$.we believe s$ exchange rate appropriate prevail economic condition theunderlying state singapore economy. indeed long term, keep currency line withfundamentals best way avoid offer speculator tempt target.exchange rate regimesmassive speculative attack exchange rate common element financial crises. misalignedfixed exchange rate figure prominently financial crisis throughout 1990s, even 1980sand 1970s.in post-crisis era, conventional wisdom emerge market choose either afree-floating fix exchange rate system.but neither panacea. fix exchange rate hard sustain world global capital mobility.furthermore, tend viable support large foreign reserve stronginstitutional arrangements. even then, exchange rate still become misalign vulnerable,as happen argentina.in hong kong, strong foreign reserve well-developed financial authority institution madeits currency board workable credible. but even hong kong dollar come fierce attack inthis crisis. in country fix exchange rate may completely infeasible. thus professor stevehanke’s proposal set currency board system stabilise rupiah view deepscepticism policymakers indonesia well imf world bank.neither free-floating exchange rate always work. even develop country remainimpassive capital flow overwhelm trade flow threaten competitiveness country’sexports. a prime example japan. and despite free-float, exchange rate may spiral downwardsif loss confidence. this happen indonesia brazil abandon theirexchange rate pegs.singapore operate manage float. this policy prevent currency get far ofline render export uncompetitive fix rate might done. a manage float nottotally eliminate speculative pressure s$, circumstance appropriateapproach.the best exchange rate regime depend specific circumstance economy. while isimportant get right, exchange rate exist vacuum. ultimately, strengthof country’s economy, soundness fiscal monetary policy confidence bothforeign investor citizen country determine whether currency isstable. if fundamental kilter, technical fix exchange rate regime avert acrisis.hedge fundsperhaps controversial issue arise crisis hedge funds. theyundoubtedly take position successfully thai baht. the malaysian government certainthat hedge fund behind collapse stock market currency. hong kong australiaare similarly convince hedge fund lead attack currencies. 5bis review 93/1999on hand evidence except thailand hedge fund may beenwrong foot crisis. george soros deny short ringgit, severalmonths crisis2. a spokesman soros fund management say october 1997: “recentvolatility world financial market reflect volatility quantum group’sperformance”, nice cryptic way say incur substantial losses.while fact still hotly disputed, ascertainable. what role hedge fund play indifferent country empirical question matter opinion. a work group hlis hasbeen set financial stability forum. i hope settle fact unambiguously thatthe debate move consider what, anything, done.in decide whether restrict activity hedge funds, three considerations. first, whoare shareholder hedge funds? they represent retail public. typically, hedge fundsinvest behalf wealthy individual institutional investor need consumerprotection. from point view, activity hedge fund private business need besubject strict regulation disclosure demand financial institution collectmonies public.the second prudential concern. be financial institution lend hedge fund beingsufficiently prudent provision enough capital relation lending? hedge fund notrated commercial rat agencies, unlike large bank corporations. they often keep theirportfolios strategy secret hamper proper assessment financial soundness. theexisting regulatory framework tight enough respect. a ltcm showed, creditor oftenlent independently one another set aside sufficient capital cover lend tohighly leverage funds.the third systemic consideration. be hedge fund source instability global financialsystem? while role asian crisis remain controversial, ltcm incident show clearlythat occasion hedge fund destabilising, sheer size leverage.banning hedge fund altogether solution. many institution make similar play thehedge funds. indeed hedge fund play positive role international financial markets. theirsignature contrarian arbitrage strategy help stabilise even enhance efficiency offinancial markets. however, check necessary prevent accumulate excessivepositions, unknown market regulators.directly regulate hedge fund also work. there practical problem regulatoryarbitrage – player easily relocate regulation force them. besides, hedgefund large highly leveraged. there need regulate way.one possible approach indirect regulation, lender counterparties. thismeans bring private sector surveillance picture. we create incentive thesupervisory framework counterparties hedge fund become vigilant prudent.lenders must strengthen credit assessment systems, regulator find way toencourage risky borrower disclose more, voluntarily, creditors. for example, couldintroduce high risk weight borrower large highly leverage notdisclose enough either creditor credit rat agencies. this would spur hedge fund todisclose obtain credit rating.global financial supervisionthe crisis set debate whether global capital market need global regulator. i doubtthis workable, even desirable. a global financial super-regulator require country give upnational sovereignty. this politically unrealistic; witness carefully imf need to2george soros the crisis global capitalism, ch. 7

strong credit culture company need rigorous businessculture.in helter-skelter growth crisis, asian government neglect institutionalunderpinnings. while sole cause crisis, many country weak domesticinstitutions undoubtedly make thing much worse. what indonesian term kkn – corruption,collusion nepotism – generally recognise serious problem combat notjust accept way business done.strengthening domestic institution enable asian country sustain long-term recovery andgrowth. government must restructure financial corporate sectors. insolvent financialinstitutions need close merge strong ones. in corporate sector, unviablecompanies must go weak, viable company must restructure balance sheet andrationalise operations. this call deft handle sensitive political judgement fastand far go trade social political objective one hand andeconomic efficiency other.a sound bank system fundamental. this start adoption high standard financialsupervision regulation support sound legal system. more importantly, regulator andgovernments neglect establishment strong credit culture. this “software” ofgood bank governance. bank must lend discipline way, base commercial viability ratherthan “relationships”. a relationships-based system undermine competition disclosure. it result atbest misallocation resource bad collapse whole financial system.banking governance must complement strong corporate governance. poor corporategovernance practice allow massive unreported loss hide liability develop. 7bis review 93/1999upgrading corporate governance mean raise quality

associate swedish membership.in ensue debate, stabilisation policy argument emu participation come calledthe insurance argument. by retain national monetary policy, sweden could insure againstthe potentially major negative effect macroeconomic shock.at time, report point participation monetary union could confer benefitsfrom stable exchange rate. but author believe benefit would outweighthe advantage retain national monetary policy.the riksbank’s opinionthe riksbank agree report every respect. the govern board considered, forinstance, exaggerate risk external shock hit swedish economy

depend onfuture wage settlements.so all, economic situation sweden stable i least dare hope acouple year ago. this turn reflect in, example, level interest rate onlymarginally different euro area.from might conclude sweden stand two foot – evidentlycope without emu. however, one reason little cautious conclusion that, tosome extent, low interest rate probably many people’s expectation bysweden fact join monetary union. personally, moreover, i never consider thatsweden ought adopt single currency primarily order tackle problem stabilisation policyor reap benefit low interest rate.the question whether join monetary union mainly long-term aspect ofeconomic development sweden view future political role europe. in thisperspective, today’s strong swedish economy argument favour adopt euro nowrather remain outside. some calmfors report’s argument participation havebeen weakened. a decision join – base long-term, strategic consideration – associatedwith small short-term risk would year

moreover, outsider position time would involve additionalcosts various part economy. financial institutions, instance, would operate twinsystems order remain competitive.negative long-term effect remain outsidesuch nature long-term effect assessment unlikely changefundamentally course year two. still, new additional information maycast somewhat different light certain aspects.one major issue concern link emu single market. there empirical evidencethat single market exert downward price pressure european union. some assessmentssuggest, moreover, emu may lead price fall; figure high 10 15% beenmentioned. if effect magnitude, welfare gain would substantial. bi review 92/19994in practice, however, easy distinguish part emu single market playingin price formation. empirical data therefore treat caution. at time, emuand single market link another level; american colleague recently remarked, “ifemu would help secure single market’s survival, it’s worth risks.”another important long-term consideration structure europe’s business sector. i believe weare experience formative phase. european manufacture service company beingrapidly restructured, effect likely considerable. many force contribute thisprocess; globalisation production one another single market. but behardly doubt emu also play part, particularly financial sector. participation inthe euro area would give sweden swedish company access large capital market isexpanding rapidly. assess outside monetary union entail phase easy.personally i believe effect negative. i also think may turn considerable.a relate

participated, great would strength argument.the riksbank agree find argument unduly cautious regard political advantages. wesaw major political benefit participation consider outsider position would clearlyweaken sweden’s voice european debate decision-making process.as i see it, since report present riksbank submit opinion, politicalargument gain appreciable weight. the initial participant

discus international financial stabilityspeech give governor sverige riksbank, mr urban bäckström1, seminar thesouth african reserve bank pretoria 9 august 1999.* * *introductionfinancial stability topical subject light event past decade – year saw financialproblems number european country well mexico asia, devaluation therouble suspend payment russia, considerable turbulence western financial market andfinancial unrest brazil. the crisis international financial system developed, cite presidentclinton, “just small glitch road” “the bad financial crisis fiftyyears”.the problem crisis always intrinsically difficult forecast. recall scale themexican crisis 1994 foresee few. in south-east asia onset, duration scope ofthe recession miss forecast community. in last spring, one anticipatedthe extent turmoil financial market would generate russian devaluation andmoratorium. the way rise credit spread lead loss highly leverage investors,liquidity shortage virtual drying-up market generally foreseen. the trackrecord show many thing understand cannot predict. that conclusion isunderscored look exist attempt build early-warning system various type crisis.either system miss crisis actually occur sound alarm crisis donot occur.nevertheless, give cost difficulty manage successive crisis pastdecade, must continue devote considerable effort avoid future crisis try hard tounderstand kind vulnerability lie behind them. the crisis 1990s revealedserious flaw macroeconomic management also, important, structure andregulation financial system debtor creditor countries. the work carriedout various international forum thorough summarise three headings:• crisis prevention, include development good practice standard transparencycodes, incentive borrower lender act prudently.• crisis containment, include establishment official contingent line possibleforms private sector finance may reduce severity crisis.• crisis resolution, emphasis possible way create orderlyenvironment

settlements. beforebecoming governor riksbank 1994 state secretary ministry finance responsibility forfiscal financial affairs, include responsibility, minister, handle swedishbanking crisis early 1990s. however, work, often hard, implement policy code lie national authorities.these measure contribute improve financial stability country actually adopt andimplement them. a crucial ingredient achieve course involve countries, formally orinformally, development policies, code standards. but even achieved, iknow experience difficult actual implementation sometimes be, least forpolitical reasons. i would also like make point today’s favourable trend worldeconomy lead u conclude danger over. instead, policymakers throughout theworld must continue work forestall new problem evident threat tointernational financial economic stability still remain may well bevulnerabilities evident.the run financial turbulence 1990sduring past twenty years, financial system many country deregulated. for thefirst time since outbreak world war one, capital pas le freely acrossnational borders. moreover, major change communication information technology pavedthe way new instrument method risk management. take whole, lead thefinancial system extensive global today ever before. this hold even thoughcapital flow relative gdp also large end last century.the rapid financial development internationalisation per se logical consequence theproduction good service globalised, massive increase cross-border trade. theyalso grow wealth many part world. this turn increase need fornew financial solution business households. the increase globalisation production andtrade good service generate demand develop internationalise financialsystem opportunity increase prosperity use full. note this, asalways, involve trade-off risk return. it course possible substantially increasestability, sense low risk, measure result low returns. however thesolution turn back le turbulent, also le prosperous past regime capital controls.the transition global financial system certainly free problems. it shouldnot forget extensive capital regulation entail mispricing risks. deregulation leadsto desirable price adjustments. but often transitional correction financialproblems liable occur. change often occur quickly system, include theinstitutional infrastructure, able keep up. in cases, neither bank publicauthorities necessary prerequisite adapt new condition create afreer capital market. the expansion lend free rein many country authoritiesdid properly monitor happen either micro macro level.economic overheat often follow deregulation open domestic financialsystem due rapid expansion credit rapidly. asset price rise sharply imbalance developed.furthermore, country fix exchange rate system, extensive short-term borrow abroadwas stimulated. a large proportion fund often channel domestic bankingsystem render rather vulnerable. when capital flow subsequently reversed, adjustmentwas often violent. production fell, unemployment rise currency bank systemfaced acute crisis.apart actual process financial market deregulation, may factor atwork. the open capital investment so-called emerge market create opportunity forinternational investor achieve high returns. between 1990 1997, annual flow asiaalone equivalent around 25% affect countries’ aggregate gdp. this combinationof bank lend portfolio investments; 60% lend international bank short-term.that capital move one part world another yield see high is, course,positive itself. the problem lay condition productive investment le good 3bis review 88/1999had hoped. later, asian economy run problems, capital flow reverse andserious financial turbulence break out.a way achieve high return take increase risk debt finance complexfinancial instruments. this create start point so-called highly leverage institutions. longterm capital management one extreme example.international bank engage lend directly country return high. at sametime, lend capital hedge fund invest countries. in cases, moreover, thebanks own share directly funds. there grind say risk-taking high inmany cases. the good profit create culture deceptive security stimulate risk-taking.to add false sense security new mathematical model imparted. theywere see function well normal circumstance fail mostneeded, i.e. turbulent times.domestic policies, institution rules, important factor behind crisis …although several factor may play part run-up recent financial crises, itis important bear mind financial crisis almost always originate unsuccessful domesticeconomic policy structure regulation domestic financial system. while moderninternational financial market possibly contribute early appearance crisis theirspreading, deregulate financial system free capital movement basicproblem. it strike several country affect financial turbulence 1990s wererelatively new participant international financial system without first establish asound domestic financial system sound economic policy. that conclusion also hold owncountry, sweden, experience severe crisis early 1990s.one obvious insight is, i quote feed chairman alan greenspan, “that participation theinternational financial system benefit carry obligation maintain level ofstability set strong transparent institution rule economy participate safelyand effectively market become highly sensitive misallocation capital otherpolicy errors”.thus, emerge market economy must reform domestic financial systems, insweden crisis, want enjoy benefit open international financial system.accordingly, progress establish sound legal infrastructure, cover bankruptcyprocedures effective corporate governance, would seem high list priorities.it also important understand danger inherent adjustable peg exchange rate systems. it isstill far early draw firm conclusion viable exchange rate regimes, allcircumstances, free float one hand currency board monetary union other.nevertheless, one common characteristic main crisis recent past – mexico, thailand,indonesia, korea, russia, brazil and, matter, country sweden – theauthorities adopt le rigid exchange rate regime ultimately prove beunsustainable. one clear lesson seem that, many circumstances, weak peg comesunder fire, defend often lose battle, especially exchange rate properly reflectthe development real economy. another drawback fixed, adjustable, peg maystimulate excessive short-term capital inflow thus generate vulnerability thecentral bank seemingly absorb exchange rate risk. against background, key question isthe appropriate exit strategy another exchange rate regime timely adjustment peggedexchange rate need arise.an additional insight simultaneous occurrence foreign exchange rate crisis bankingcrises probably single important reason country suffer much deeperrecessions currency peg collapse come severe speculative attack. thecontractionary shock european country 1992-93 clearly much small forsweden finland early 1990s mexico 1995 asian country 1997-98. thus, authority country receive capital inflow prepare day themovement might reverse. country vulnerable regard carefully consider theadequacy foreign exchange reserves, particularly relation short-term external debt.since large number country cannot build reserve increase trade surplusessimultaneously, would seem argue great use contingent lend facility provide bythe private sector. give arrangements, recourse new imf contingent credit line wouldthen add public sector private sector affirmation domestic policy follow theborrowing country sensible sustainable.… international dimension also recognisedto say key avoid future crisis emerge market must find domestic reform isnot deny part solution may still lie measure change way whichinternational financial market sometimes operate. while financial liberalisation internationalfinancial integration bring unquestionable benefits, also subject episode excessiverisk-taking. in recent years, seem imprudent lending, emergingmarket economy also borrower within industrial world.in part spur competitive forces. that force diminish financialrestructuring accelerate seem unlikely. however, potential public safety net distortincentives breed complacency also discern structure re-evaluated. itis important investor hold accountable decisions. the international communityshould also ensure investor lender play part resolution future financialcrisis and, end, implement, inter alia, change international bond covenant thatwould facilitate debt restructure become necessary.the event past decade make clear great effort need strengthen thefunctioning markets. information asymmetry lie heart

27 july 1999.* * *i.introductionit great privilege invite kisaragi-kai meet make speech front thisdistinguished audience.first, i make use opportunity discus current state japanese economy. then iwill move main theme – structural problem face revitalize theeconomy. i hope view give perspective future.ii.recent development economy outlooklet begin bank japan’s view current state japanese economy theoutlook: japan’s economy, present, stop deteriorating, corporate sentiment improvedslightly, however, clear sign self-sustained recovery private demand observedyet. the follow factor combine keep japanese economy deterioration.first, active fiscal policy stimulate public investment well house investments.second, private firm reduce inventory successfully help extent thedevelopment final demand. third, financial condition improving, result bank ofjapan’s zero interest rate policy injection public fund major commercial banks. thebuoyancy stock market since early spring improvement corporate sector confidenceshown tankan, base increase anticipation good business financialconditions future, well current improvement final demand, output, inventories.it is, however, uncertain stage whether japanese economy, way self-sustainedrecovery anticipate above. the reason summarize follows.to begin with, i address two factor negative effect future economy.first, stimulus effect public investment fade eventually. second, corporaterestructuring effort individual firm expose macro economy downside pressures. this isan example rational strategy viewpoint individual firm may haveundesirable effect economy whole. with corporate restructuring, worker face harshincome conditions, reduce consumption spending, firm save result cash make debtrepayments, instead reinvesting. this “paradox thrift” may drive economy shrinkage.of course, factor work positively economy. the point is, however, whetherthese factor strong enough outweigh negative one mention above.let discus positive factor detail. first, corporate restructure may bring recoveryin corporate profit – may push stock price anticipation recovery. for recentcorporate restructure positive effect, profit recovery boost firms’ spendingsufficiently outweigh workers’ saving.the second positive factor effect government’s various measure ensure thestability financial system bank japan’s monetary policy ease financial conditionsare permeate throughout economy, improve household corporate sector confidencesomewhat. furthermore, possibility improve confidence stimulate thespending attitude consumer firms. in fact, household consumption hold steady even amidthe harsh income conditions. however, corporate expenditure still weak, obvious tankan survey business fix investment plans. while financial institution improve theirskill risk management strive adequate lend margins, bank loan increasedwhile demand fund raise remain weak.the third positive factor recovery overseas economies, especially asia. although china’seconomy decelerate somewhat, korea recovery trend. thailand philippine aswell malaysia singapore bottom gradually. these development facilitatejapanese export production.the argument make obvious follow fact: foreign economic factor considered,the recovery japanese economy depend largely corporate behavior become active.the recent improvement corporate sector confidence good sign economy, othereconomic indicator fix investment plan show significant sign economic recovery. ourjudgment early say japanese economy way self-sustainedrecovery. therefore, downward pressure price remain, although price stablerecently.it view economic condition describe bank japan willmaintain current monetary ease stance continue firmly support economic activity untildeflationary concern subside.iii.contained dynamism japanese economya caveat regard fiscal monetary policy effective manage economy inthe short run, panacea problem japanese economy faces.this last decade 20th century see japanese economy experience low growth sincethe end second world war. despite several economic stimulus measure themonetary fiscal side, response economy generally slow yet toconfirm clear revival economic dynamism lead private demand. take account theweakness private demand past ten years, perhaps natural think might besomething “structural” contain economic dynamism. if case, difficult toexpect long-lasting recovery, any, base solely macroeconomic stimulus measures. hence, torestore vitality japanese economy medium term, painstaking effort must make toresolve structural problem enable nation’s economic potential fully blossom. andsuch effort also necessary monetary fiscal policy full effect.since many structural problem stem supply side economy, resolve requiresthat send appropriate signal give right incentive public. a evidence byreaganomics u.s. thatcherism u.k., supply-side policy would likely beaccompanied various pain require long period reform take root among public andbear real fruit. it indeed reason need reach early consensus nature ofthe structural problem japan thus come right prescriptions.some say structural problem encompass variety issues, economic one alsodemographic, educational, environmental ones. but, today, i focus three economic issueswhich interrelate particularly strong impact japan’s macroeconomic performance:first, delay clean balance sheet firms; second, change economic growthmechanisms globalization; third, imbalance save investment.iv.delay clean up balance sheet firmsthe immediate linger structural problem yet complete disposal ofassets liability balloon bubble period. in wake burst bubble,we first saw collapse firm expand liability base aggressivemanagement plans, accumulation non-performing asset part financialinstitutions. this, turn, reduce risk-taking ability financial institution erode capital position, result impair smooth circulation money economy. in addition, aloss credibility financial system trigger collapse financial institutionsworried depositor financial market alike, seem contribute economicdeterioration witness 1997 1998 worsen household corporate sectorconfidence.the disposal non-performing asset financial institution make considerable progress, atleast account viewpoint, thank effort part financial institution well ascapital injection major bank use public funds. needle say, financial institution must makefurther efforts, include removal non-performing asset balance sheets.it note balance sheet erosion limit firm already go bankruptand financial institution extend loan them. although verge suspendingbusiness, firm misjudge demand bubble period make large fixedinvestments launch new business turn totally unprofitable. these firm haveonly manage repay debt suffer worsen asset efficiency highdebt ratio. the often hear case “excess capacity” “excess debt” partly attribute tothe business cycle, fundamentally interpret context debt overhangfrom bubble period.there little doubt delay clean corporate balance sheet lie behind slowrecovery fix investment despite extremely low interest rates. indeed, case wherefinancial institution oblige cautious extend additional loan firm lag inimproving financial condition, even new project expect beprofitable. it point partly financial technology well develop inseparating risk relate firm relate project firm undertake like inproject finance. it thus seem unlikely japanese economy regain dynamism without animprovement balance sheet corporate sector.v.the u.s. experience – a case “creative destruction”often ask question include: “how corporate sector scrap unprofitable business andobsolete equipment?” “once corporate sector downsize unprofitable sectors, leadto revitalization whole economy?” to answer questions, perhaps instructive look atthe past 20 years’ experience u.s. the u.s. face problem dwindle productivitygrowth 1970s 1980s balance sheet adjustment late 1980s early1990s. in solve problems, u.s. government, particularly since reagan administration,has play support role promote deregulation lead intensify competition andindustrial revitalization. in private sector, u.s. firm review production managementprocesses, make necessary strategic adjustments, label “re-engineering”.therefore, look development u.s. useful consider balance sheetproblem also kind structural adjustment conducive increase productivity andrestoring economic dynamism japanese economy.economic recovery u.s. since march 1991 often label “jobless recovery” becauseit initially accompany significant increase employment private consumption.however, gradually change full-fledged recovery increase fix investmentand employment, result eight year expansion now. there are, admittedly,various view respect future u.s. economy, deserve attention theschumpeterian process “constructive destruction” often cite play importantrole success date.it note slogan “re-engineering” “strengthening core competence,”many u.s. firm sell scrap unprofitable sector concentrate managementresources profitable one take full advantage information technology. such effort havebeen responsible rise stock price lay grind expansion businessareas advantage via method merger acquisitions. at time, many new firm specialize “high technology” grow rapidly spread internetagainst backdrop across-the-board large increase investment information technology toimprove management efficiency. in addition, help economy lose job due tocorporate downsize smoothly reallocate growth area software services,including medical nurse care, highly mobile labor market.with factor combined, industrial structure u.s. dramatically change past10 years. the 50 years’ history u.s. industry since second world war show thecompanies major industry remain le 1950s 1970s, includingthe “big three automobile industry,” big oil steel companies. however, whencomparing 1990s 1970s, number firm specialize “high technology,” werenot even establish 20 year ago, list among major firm represent u.s. industry.this simple fact deem symbolic process “creative destruction”.what situation japan? in 1950s 1960s, textile industry heavyindustries steel chemical develop lead industries. in 1970s, rise theautomobile electronics industry substantially change lineup major firms. however, sincethe 1970s, substantial changes.i hasten add i say japanese economy cannot grow unless new firm arecreated. there doubt many exist major firm actively pursue development ofnew technology. indeed, context, find example major firm u.s. haveundergone dramatic transformation 20 year ago. have say this, recallingshumpeter’s belief function entrepreneur true sense much manage asto create company, i cannot help feel slightly disappoint yet see creationof many new company lead japanese economy. a main drive force behind thebuoyant development u.s. economy revitalization intensify competition,and, i may add another factor, “a culture risk taking”. in japan, exist firm shouldconcentrate management resource business area comparative advantage,new industry group new firm emerge create jobs, thereby achieve growthbalancing old new. what important process capital stock equipmentand technology management resource human resource liquidate reallocate tobe fully utilize grow new business areas.vi. change economic growth mechanism globalizationthe second structural problem japan face globalization progress theshareholdings foreign investor increase, japanese corporate manager come pursue higherrates return rather expansion. at time, rate return industry hadbeen protect regulation force decline. together, development putheavy adjustment pressure exist industrial structure.a.management pursue high rate returna recent survey economic plan agency show japanese corporate manager haveclearly change emphasize high rate return. since economic stagnation continue andhardly increase sale expected, natural corporate manager pursue higherreturn asset (roa) high return equity (roe). in addition, major japanese firm use torely unrealized gain share buff unexpected, able remain profitable onthe whole even substantial loss incur areas. but, stagnant economy andsluggish stock prices, become difficult continue depend unrealized gains, alsoseems partly responsible recent change attitude corporate manager nowemphasize rate return short term. the data show roa japanese firm average 7.8 percent 1980s, butdeclined 5.1 percent 1990s.1 while partly due business cycle factor, truethat profitability japanese firm decline trend.b.changes economic growth mechanismsone factor behind decline profitability japanese firm balance sheet still carry ahuge amount assets, either idle underutilized, negative legacy bubble period.a second factor since japanese firm long adopt management style emphasison maintain employment, labor’s relative share inevitably rise long recession, therebysqueezing capital’s relative share, translate decline profitability. and, third factor isthat economy become globalized, japanese industries, hitherto beenprotected various measure regulations, force accept decline rate return,leading imminent need large-scale adjustment industrial structure.given effort make firms, first two factor may mend time. the third factor,however, seem stem substantial irreversible structural change japaneseeconomy currently experiencing.let elucidate third factor. look japanese economy long-term perspective,we observe follow pattern. there doubt automobile electronics industry havebeen one engine support post-war economic development rapid increase intheir productivity. by expose international competition early stage, theseindustries remain high technological level globally enjoy high profitabilitythrough exports. wage industry raise line increase productivity. and, suchan increase wage permeate domestic industry low productivity, therebyimproving standard live nation whole. if industry low productivity try topay wage high productivity, price product service theseindustries inevitably raised. the existence various regulation traditional businesspractices contribute make price increase possible without much difficulty.as economy become globalize 1990s, traditional pattern undergo atremendous change. what trigger change firm lead industry expandedproduction overseas conduct operation global scale pay close attention thedifference cost home abroad. a result, japanese worker enjoy high wageswhen compare internationally become exposed, directly indirectly, global competition. inaddition, globalize firm focus cost performance pressure domesticsubcontractors service provider reduce prices, thereby threaten profitability ofdomestic industry operate competitive environment. furthermore, theincrease travel overseas, japanese consumer become conscious difference betweendomestic price abroad. these factors, combine progress deregulation, havecreated situation domestic industry use protect competition find itincreasingly difficult secure profit raise price use do. thus, traditionalgrowth mechanism whereby even low productivity industry could maintain certain level ofprofitability apparently become unsustainable.since trend toward globalization irreversible, seem time alone resolve thirdfactor responsible decline profitability. hence, regard one difficultstructural problem face japanese economy. in u.s., factor technological innovationin telecommunication intensify competition stem deregulation say haveplayed important role improve productivity. crucial japan’s economic future toraise productivity industry operate competitive environment. the process1 base “financial statement statistic corporation industry, quarterly” compile ministryof finance. “creative destruction” deem unavoidable certain extent. in regard, need carefullymonitor happen employment process.vii.savings investment imbalance shortage risk capitalas may become already clear, key restore dynamism japanese economy thegrowth new industry firm well simultaneous revitalization investment. in thiscontext, one might well ask country one high per caput gdp figure worldand ample household save total 1,300 trillion yen find difficult revitalize domesticinvestment. this bring u third structural problem: save investment imbalance.a.decline capital productivityit rather ironic economic globalization progress cross-border capital movementsbecome free, japan become increasingly uncomfortable place capital stay itshigh level capital accumulation. with slow growth labor force, japan accumulate capitalthrough aggressive fix investment since high growth period, substantially raise theamount fix asset per unit labor. in fact, incessant pursuit economic developmentsince end second world war, japan become capital rich country, even thanthe u.s.we proud fact that, capital accumulation, japan’s per caput gdp isamong high world. at time, mindful fact amount offixed asset necessary produce gdp increasing, is, productivity capitalhas declining. decline productivity capital mean expect return beendeclining, consistent downward trend roa. from investor’s viewpoint, isthe say capital efficiently employ japan, might make investor bothat home abroad hesitate invest japanese companies. hence, japan increase investmentsonly exist area raise labor productivity, lead deterioration capitalefficiency. therefore, japanese firm currently face difficult challenge expeditiously disposeof negative legacy bubble period time explore new business areaswith high profitability reallocate resource capital labor them.b.high save ratiothe imbalance save investment problem stem exclusively theinvestment side. the household save ratio (on sna basis) 20 percent themid-1970s, decline around 10 15 percent end 1980s. the future prediction atthat time generally base follow life-cycle hypothesis: when japan become agingsociety 1990s, old generation reduce save household save ratio willfurther decline, eventually result disappearance japan’s huge current account surplus.however, reality save ratio stop decline 1990s prediction thattime turn wide mark.it seem plausible argue high save ratio, is, low consumption otherwise,is entirely due national trait japanese regard save virtue. for example, survey bythe prime minister’s office bank japan suggest many old people concern abouttheir future livelihood reduce expenditure rise uncertainty regardingthe pension social welfare system. an increase uncertainty also see among youngergenerations. people, young old alike, seem cut back expenditure andincreasing save self-defense prepare future uncertainty.one could say catch “double savings” situation: in age society decliningbirth rate, old generation save pension preparation future nurse careneeds, young generation actively save fear receive le pension inthe future. thus, household sector consider necessary save domestic investment lose attractiveness, economy inevitably see expansion fiscal deficit currentaccount surplus.to avoid situation, important give public clear image future framework ofthe pension system reduce uncertainty well establish social framework lookingafter elderly. in view fact care age business opportunity u.s.and europe, make good use private sector vitality create business area associal welfare.c.shortage risk capitalin addition high save ratio, another mark characteristic household save behavior injapan high proportion save hold low risk asset bank deposit postalsavings. a comparison composition household asset japan u.s. accordingto flow fund account statistic show that: cash deposit comprise 55 percent total asset injapan, 11 percent u.s.; and, figure stock 7 percent japan, is43 percent u.s. these figure vividly highlight difference risk-taking attitude thehousehold sector japan u.s. it seem u.s. capital markets, tend topromote venture businesses, support household behavior small extent. in japan,despite strong propensity safe assets, cannot deny make firm financialproducts attractive investment purpose warrant study.i state early capital productivity japan low thus attractive either domestic orforeign investors. this refer overall trend economy thus far. if closely examineeach individual firm project, must potentially many investment opportunity anappropriate combination risk return. there much difference japan andabroad even small firm able become big success take advantage oftechnological innovation telecommunication deregulation. in fact, may detect seedsof new business opportunity recent buoyancy stock market. to germinate seeds, itis deem necessary encourage new entry market deregulation lead tointensified competition revitalization industries, create variety financial productsthrough abundant save household sector smoothly channel risk capitalto investment new businesses.viii.concluding remarksthe japanese economy stand crossroad whether move onto self-sustainedrecovery path. needle say, stable macroeconomic environment important smoothprogress structural adjustment. we fully aware monetary policy expect play animportant role circumstances. with consideration mind, maintain currentmonetary ease deflationary worry subside.having say this, three structural problem discuss determine supply-side factors,and cannot deal demand stimulus measure monetary fiscal side. forexample, address corporate balance sheet problem, extent firm tackle allocationof management resource depend critically way corporate governance beingimplemented. regard change growth mechanism globalization, whether new firmsemerge bring innovation productivity exist domestic-oriented industry depend onhow regulation traditional transaction practice change capital market functions. asto save investment imbalance provision risk capital, much may depend thefuture pension, insurance, taxation systems.since supply-side measure work incentive firm households, thus often takestime effect materialize unlike measure work demand side.even take time, i pessimistic future japanese economy. we beproud japan’s high quality labor force, technology, managerial ability enable post- war economic recovery. such economic potential still intact. i believe dynamism berestored japanese economy if, appropriate supply-side prescriptions, industry revitalizethemselves transformation exist firm creation new one competitiveframework conducive increase risk-taking activity.in fact, government examine various measure tackle unemployment industrialrevitalization. and, private sector, observe sign future change theincrease business affiliation merger review business areas. by promote structuralchange, japanese economy undoubtedly exhibit potential transform aneconomy vitality high productivity.in come specific supply-side prescriptions, cooperation private sector thegovernment essential discuss problem guide incentive firm andhouseholds desirable direction minimize moral hazard. i sincerely hope myspeech today contribute discussion important problem structural reform. 1bis review 103/1999mr yam comment hong kong: crisis

banker’s perspectivethe 1999 per jacobsson lecture mr willem f duisenberg, president european centralbank, hold washington dc 26 september 1999.* * *1.introductioni feel honour invite give year’s prestigious per jacobsson lecture adistinguished audience. the euro launch successfully almost nine month ago. this ahistoric moment, 11 country voluntarily relinquish sovereignty monetary policy.technically changeover proceed remarkably smoothly. former national money market wererapidly integrated, small measure due smooth function target, new europeanpayment system which, generally speaking, work well outset. the euro trade allinternational financial markets. moreover, euro introduce climate prevail pricestability euro area. this result process convergence ageneral decrease european inflation rate recent years, – case country –significantly high level previous years.the introduction euro neither isolate purely economic event. it another, yet veryimportant, step process european integration. the process begin half centuryago. the creation euro end process either. today, i like briefly lookback, mainly look ahead. my perspective central banker. the nature perspectivewill become clear course lecture.dealing european integration new european single currency particularlyappropriate context lecture series. per jacobsson spend professional careerpursuing sound money. this challenge face us: make euro sound – isto say stable – currency.2.the history european integrationlet first deal briefly history european integration. this process stronglydriven political motives. the main underlie aim avoid recurrence future thewars devastate 20th century europe. to end, central europe’s large country, germany,should firmly embed european structure. a thomas mann aptly put it: “a europeangermany, rather german europe”. without common european framework, tension couldarise germany countries, france particular. european integration shouldserve objective create peaceful, stable prosperous europe. the unification germanyalmost decade ago, removal iron curtain place germany even further, were,in heart europe. these fundamental change make clear motif europeanintegration le valid today 50 year ago.the main vehicle european integration economic integration, via coal steelindustry, establish custom union, european monetary system, single marketprogramme introduction euro. “trade, fight” perhaps good “trade youwill fight” basic philosophy. give background, strike economist toooften ass cost benefit european integration purely economic term ratherstatic context. this clearly narrow approach.nonetheless, economics european integration important. the political objective bemet economic integration successful place sound economic footing. this also wherethe role central banker come in. he decide step bi review 102/19992taken integration process. that realm politics also market-driven. the centralbanker advise point condition meet certain step take safely.the reverse also true: central banker central bank part influence theintegration process, great level integration monetary field, great impactupon them. the central bank central banker operate environment, affectedby ongoing integration process. this take account. moreover, question arise asto whether single monetary policy ultimately call integration areas.in retrospect, conclude that, thus far, european integration process has, balance, beensuccessful. in part europe experience peace since process initiate wehave see continuous growth earn wealth. the process gradual integration hasnow culminate emergence single currency.there room, however, complacency. look back, let also draw specificconclusions:1. the integration process mark up downs, often step course ofthe business cycle connection major shocks, german unification. the roadhas long winding, sometimes bumpy.2. long ago european integration reach point return. there alternative tocontinue path integration. economic integration generate owndynamics. it long completely dependent political initiative propel forward.3. overall, however, political component european integration process stillessential forgotten.4. politician clarify objective european integration process, explain themto european citizen point step envisage year ahead. the role ofcentral banker critical, yet time constructive. they indicate theeconomic consequence risk certain steps, stipulate conditionscertain step safely taken. it good take step later, successfully, takeit prematurely fail fall back further. such role always make thecentral banker popular. he often perceive step firmly brakes.nonetheless, i convince best service provide further theprogress integration process. it may sound paradoxical, continuouslyemphasising importance fulfil convergence criteria, central banker havecontributed make possible introduction euro. it perhaps already beenforgotten some, event consider likely many observers, evenclose date actually happened.european integration ongoing process. it continue. what future hold store? letme turn issue.3.the future european integration3.1introductioneuropean integration task great magnitude, remain next century. it offersmany opportunities. it face many challenges. i would classify challenge three category andlook perspective central banker:1. how make euro economic monetary union (emu) success.2. how cope accession new country eu euro area.3. how develop role europe, european central bank (ecb) eurosystem(i.e. ecb eleven national central bank eu member state haveadopted euro) world. 3bis review 102/1999i shall discus challenge turn.3.2how make euro emu successin first category, i would make distinction central banker withintheir control, influence one hand, outside world islikely impact central bank world, other.3.2.1the role central bankersthe important task challenge eurosystem build track record actual pricestability euro area. action speak loud words. show practice capable ofproviding stable price really counts. we ensure european citizen confidentthat euro currency, sustain value time, ecb institutionwhich trust. the ecb perceive institution say doeswhat says.the ecb eurosystem develop truly european institutions. they alwaystake decision conduct analysis euro area-wide perspective. although somegood progress make regard, still room improvement. additionalefforts also require finalise process set consolidate ecb theeurosystem. for instance, ecb begin life staff around 400 persons, themeantime grow 700. it likely grow year ahead, berecognised limit pace organisation expanded. it fair saythat moment ecb capable fulfil tasks, pressure work manyareas still simply high. a become clear late lecture, new task betaken year ahead, others need enhanced. while expanding, ensuredthat ecb remain efficient organisation. what more, role ecb, central bankrepresenting second large economic area world population 300 million people,has shape elaborate further. set ecb fascinate process. it like theeuropean integration process itself, micro scale great pressure time. insome

monetary policy neither cause solution theunemployment problem. structural reform need attack it. fortunately, insight gainingbroader support. the challenge translate sustain action. carry structuralreforms politically difficult, since may painful short term bear fruit alonger time scale. however, encourage note country implementedstructural reform indeed effective cop unemployment problem. bi review 102/19994i shall continue focus unemployment problem. unemployment waste resources, leaveshuman potential unused, source frustration ultimately undermine stability oursocieties. in narrow vein, existence high level unemployment may also hamper theconduct monetary policy. it easily lead call expansionary monetary policy asolution problem monetary policy cannot solve. the central bank could become thescapegoat failure take action area action part others factrequired. make market adaptable also necessary make emu work. only flexiblemarkets able cope asymmetric shock sometimes affect monetaryunion. the policy need make emu work are, time, essential reducingunemployment. a single currency call uniform wage development uniform economicor social policy general. on contrary –

european union. we ready learn fromexperience adapt institutional framework need arises. this applies, course,in general sense. emu well prepared, actually play game alwaysdifferent prepare game plan, important may be. a good game plan necessary, butnot sufficient win game. while yet unknown whether stability growth pact willbe last word fiscal policy euro area, certain failure adhere strictly thepact would recipe manner problems.the eurosystem adopt monetary policy strategy tailor unique condition ofintroducing new currency. our two-pillar strategy, emphasis monetary development anda broadly base outlook price stability, take account economic behaviour may change asa result introduction euro itself. in words, take account start emuconstitutes structural break. this already indicate time experience withconducting monetary policy within framework carefully evaluated. over time ourstrategy may evolve, perhaps direction great emphasis one pillars. however, thishas cautious process, since one main function monetary policy strategy toprovide tool clearly communicate monetary policy preparation decisions. thus, cannotchange monetary policy strategy would change suits. continuity must feature anymonetary policy strategy.although primary task ecb eurosystem conduct monetary policy, arealso tasks. it natural much focus primary task, andthere thus ample scope reflection upon implementation tasks. in thiscontext i refer task role ecb maintain financial stability. all moderncentral bank active area. they involve legislative process relate financialsector play role design market structure, survey financial market inmonitoring key player financial sector. the ecb already involve first two areas. ithas advisory role respect legislation concern financial sector. with regard marketstructure, active role play context payment security settlement systems.the two role could develop year come.the european financial markets, especially longer-term instruments, yet fullyintegrated. there not, yet, completely single market financial services. pan-european banksare yet dominant feature european financial landscape. however, situation clearlydynamic. the introduction euro trigger process, certainly give boost. 5bis review 102/1999mergers restructure take place, albeit yet predominantly national level. however,this may, probably will, change. the european commission take many initiative furtherenhance single market financial services. these initiative highly welcome. financial sectorissues tend, more, become european issues. it hard predict pace thisprocess, direction clear. this conclusion underline importance ecb’s furtherstrengthening ability deal matter relate financial stability. bank supervision anational responsibility, although intensive international cooperation exist, inter alia – though notexclusively – european level. give current european financial landscape, decentralisedstructure bank supervision europe defended. however, year come thequestion whether adequacy framework undermine development financialsector closely monitor analysed. it reassure treaty europeanunion contain provision enable council minister enhance role theecb field bank supervision.in relatively near future introduction euro banknote coin agenda.this another important step process introduce euro, albeit much economicreasons. the decisive step course take year irrevocable fix exchangerates, step take early 2002 make euro visible significancethereof underestimated. the introduction banknote coin offer furtheropportunity inform european citizen euro emu general.open communication many party – economics professor member theeuropean parliament ordinary european citizen – high agenda ecb theeurosystem. our wish open, transparent and, far possible, predictable. this basicallythe case three reasons. first, central bank understand effective. second, ina democratic society side coin central bank independence central bankshould accountable action fulfil mandate. third, clear framework externalcommunication structure discipline internal debates. our aim predictable let memake one thing quite clear: ultimately, achieve objective price stability ofoverriding importance. in word – although try avoid situation – shall notrefrain surprise market take unexpected measure firmly believe isnecessary. it keep mind monetary policy different mechanics: alwaysinvolves judgement. if case, good personal computer would good centralbanker ordinary human being.an important starting-point communication policy govern council ecb isa collegiate body decision take euro area-wide perspective. what wish tocommunicate decision body, individuals. this rule alsopresenting argument certain decision. that substance. everymonth vice-president i hold press conference immediately meet thegoverning council. in introductory statement i explain decision basis havetaken them. this follow question answer session large number journalists. boththe introductory statement question answer publish website, almostwithout delay. i believe arrangement unique – perspective – demandingone. in addition, publish monthly bulletin 11 official language european union. wepublish annual report many speeches, interview publications. at quarterlyintervals i appear hear european parliament. nobody doubt intention tobe open transparent. unfortunately, debate issue often focus practice ofnot publish minute govern council meetings. in substance introductory statementsare different central bank would call minutes. and publishedimmediately. a substance publish, two issue remain. first, reveal votingrecords several reasons. a i said, govern council collegiate body. what relevant arethe final decision body underlie arguments, individual positions. publishingindividual position easily distract really important. what paramountimportance european context member govern council represent aparticular country national central bank decision always base euro bi review 102/19996area-wide considerations. this new principle everything do ensure isadhered to. publish vote record could easily lead place monetary policy debate anational context even put pressure individual council members.the second issue that, time being, publish economic forecasts, include ourinflation forecast. again several reason yet so. it crucial monetarypolicy strategy well understood. publish inflation forecast could easily interpret theecb follow strategy direct inflation targeting. this case. inflation forecast noexclusive role monetary policy discussion decisions. they among many otherindicators analyse context second pillar strategy. publish inflationforecasts could make become self-fulfilling prophecies. this may hamper monetary policy whereforecast inflation incompatible maintain price stability. finally, due structural breakwhich introduction euro constitutes, time require obtain estimate whichare sufficiently reliable publication. at time, i would acknowledge that, presentedclearly within context strategy, forecast may also enhance transparency. thus weshould indeed consider publish forecast point future.in external communication aim speak one voice. the collegiate character thegoverning council underpin principle facilitate process ensure monetarypolicy decision transparent. this always easy clearly learn phase.this case general level too. communication art science. we willcertainly try learn experience. verbal discipline transparency contradictions: theyshould two side coin. we aim predictable. this easy predicthow medium interpret publish communications. this yet always case.communication one-way street. the ecb must also take note sensitive itsenvironment order effective policies. let therefore turn issue ourwider environment.3.2.2the environmentmonetary policy cannot conduct isolation. the ecb cannot operate island. it need astrong european foundation. this issue touch upon much frameworkfor monetary policy even emu. in long term single currency mean thatultimately sit boat. it inevitable sometimes single monetary policywill perfectly tailor certain region even certain country. this case allmonetary unions. optimal currency area exist textbooks, practice. thus, amonetary union viable, absence perfectly tailor policy accepted. thismay sometimes require feel belong together – social cohesion like. i believe maybe even fundamental discussion establishment political union, often apoorly define concept. increase political integration create change joint politicalinstitutions may help foster social cohesion but, like ecb, institution cannot operate avacuum. they also require certain amount social cohesion. move solely political frontmay enough may first even important thing accomplished.fostering process enhance social cohesion simple task. it something canor impose above, can, certain extent, guided. it process mustbe evolutionary spontaneous. it pace cannot forced. this would counterproductive. inthe end matter clarify develop element common european culture.this imply articulate emphasise many thing european already common,but also build common experiences. such experience serve cement intra-europeanrelations. have single currency automatically contribute process, ofthe common banknote coins, also mean deal identical issue alleuropean countries. there many area addition politics economics canbe done, sciences, arts, press, television on. we try develop debateon european issue european level. i attach great importance explain monetary policiesat hear european parliament. monetary policy conduct european perspectiveand therefore primarily explain european level. more attention pay 7bis review 102/1999european issues. the objective european integration explain often moreclearly.the fear europe something abstract, remote threaten local culture takenseriously. however, i believe necessarily contradiction betweenpreserving local culture time develop common european culture. on thecontrary, complement enrich one another. it necessary inevitable increasingnumber issue decide european level. quite apart issue relate euro, otherissues relate environment, crime, defence migration long beconsidered purely national issues. in decide discuss aeuropean level, principle subsidiarity continue play guide role. what bedecided low level decide low level.i close eye existence substantial obstacle integration broadsense. perhaps fact european union 11 official language important one. ina sense also pose dilemma communication policy. on one hand, important toreach european citizen language; other, encourage situation inwhich many european possible also speak one common language? could education systemsnot make happen? this cannot, course, accomplish overnight, leasttry make issue le sensitive still is?history respect another barrier. there alternative recognise work toovercome it. i believe lie heart european integration process. european integrationhas been, continue be, step-by-step process. it certainly suffer setback times,but balance contribute peace, stability prosperity.what often strike negative, gloomy attitude many european towards europeanintegration. this project deserve different attitude. we see europe opportunity, apositive challenge, rather threat cost. european integration unique fascinatingprocess i wish strongly reflect attitude many towards it. we alsoneed energy bear attitude deal challenge pose accession ofnew country european union euro area. let turn issue deal itfrom perspective ecb.3.3coping accession new country eu euro areafour country european union yet adopt euro. they may well join themedium term. a great challenge potential accession still country europeanunion ultimately euro area. negotiation currently conduct six countries.negotiations another six candidate may start

highlyleveraged institutions, have, throughout history, periodically fall crisis. where wasno backup, pull economy them. one wonder whether nineteenthcentury unite states, bank also virtually sole intermediary, numerous bankingcrises would periodically disable economy did, alternate mean ofintermediation available.in dire circumstances, modern central bank provide liquidity, fear always assuagedby cash. even increase liquidity, bank lend unstable periods. the japanese bankingsystem today example: bank japan create massive liquidity, yet bank lend hasresponded little.with large

deprive u possibility would run risk land oncemore situation like late 1980s.this account problem kernel, i shall return shortly, deserve betaken seriously. but argument also suffer distinct

behind appreciably even look asthough activity turn upwards.for another thing, argument presuppose problem overheat tackledsuccessfully riksbank. that certainly true sense able raise interestrate ensure inflation come line target. but picture present rosy. ifwage formation fail budget policy become excessively expansionary, restoration abalanced economy would costly: growth would depress employment would presumablyfall interest rate raised, accompany perhaps appreciation krona. in sense,access national monetary policy patent remedy.at time, clear – member monetary union – would lose option ofguaranteeing low inflation even recourse costly cure. for example, labourmarket organisation make unduly high wage settlement fiscal policy get ofhand, riksbank would long position secure low inflation.to me, however, mean clear natural conclusion today begin argue thatsweden ought aim euro area participation soon political support. comparedwith couple year ago, economic situation stable almost every respect. it notonly economy adjust various way low inflation; government finance alsoimproved past year employment rise rapidly. to add supportfrom institutional change budget work legal

journey towards open capital market seemed, times, nightmare.the core problem face number emerge market sharp reversal ofcapital flows. between 1996 1998, reversal capital flow five asian countriesprimarily affect (korea, thailand, indonesia, malaysia philippines) order of$125 billion, equivalent 12% pre-crisis level gdp. these reversal imply equal andopposite swing current account. to turn large current account deficit substantial surpluswithin two year almost certainly require recession. in 1998 real gdp fell 6% korea, 9%in thailand, 14% indonesia, 7% malaysia 1% philippines.moreover, reversal capital flow emerge market mean industrialise countriesmust aggregate run large trade deficit. the distribution increase collective deficithas already lead debate domestic policy, make hard resist ever presentprotectionist pressures, especially election years. so rapid reversal capital flow bringsubstantial economic costs.capital flow also bring real economic benefits. they enable save one country finance moreprofitable investment another. that key feature world economy nineteenthcentury. such flow also facilitate transfer knowledge expertise. and invest overseas,domestic resident able pool risk various kind resident countries. to date,international diversification portfolio remarkably limited. in particular, equity portfoliosof investor industrialise

experience. first, theirintensity scale. second, rapid contagion one emerge market previouslyunaffected countries. both phenomenon product nature capital flow concerned. theproblems arise short-term flow debt finance, long-term equity flow direct investment.equity investment self-stabilising mechanism. when investor wish withdraw theequity market find buyer head exit. the market price adjustsin order attract buyer replace seller. the physical investment finance equity flowsremain place, even value market fallen. the need find buyer replace aseller express equivalent statement maturity liability extremely long,in case indefinite. the real problem stem liability short maturities. these occurwith debt finance, whether term bank deposit payable demand longer-term debt financewhich almost run maturity. in cases, depositor wish withdraw fund nothave find replacement depositors. they simply take fund out. the result that, rush tothe exit sufficiently large scale, bank find receive

one equilibrium another explains, wordsof maurice obstfeld, “why capital market appear impose little discipline crisesarise, harsh discipline afterwards”.3if diagnosis correct, two observation follow. first, capital flow form foreign directinvestment portfolio equity investment encouraged. emerge market greatdeal increase adopt modern account standards, transparent legal framework, astable market-friendly environment foreign investor prepare commit long-terminvestments. second, way must find reduce volatility short-term flow bank finance.the key avoid maturity currency mismatch national balance sheet. that easy saidthan done, similar mismatch balance sheet domestic financial institution causedfinancial collapse regular basis industrialise world.before turn question mismatch might limit prevented, let memention two contributory factor recent crises. the first overvalue real exchange rates,reflecting attempt maintain fix nominal exchange rate beyond economic shelf life. not3obstfeld, m (1998), “the global capital market: benefactor menace?”, nber work paper 6559,mimeo. bi review 95/19994only attempt contribute crisis nominal peg could long sustained, butthey also contribute illusion might profitable borrow low interest rate inforeign currency invest high rate domestically, thus exacerbate balance sheetmismatches. the second capital outflow result solely action overseasresidents. capital flight domestic resident factor increase scale outflowsfrom number emerge markets. it important focus nature capital flow thenationality investor concerned. hence resolution crisis involve simplyrestructuring liability foreign bank overseas investors. the problem create volatilityof short-term debt flow require structural solution.3.purist solutionshow design appropriate infrastructure international capital market prevent, leastlimit frequency of, crises? to return transport analogy, clearly case eliminatingblind spot road lengthen runway. but enough. we also need think abouthow emergency service respond crash.the purist lead naturally consider solution two opposite kinds. one, maintain open freecapital movements, create international lender last resort (ilolr). the second, oppositeend spectrum, reinstate permanent capital controls.consider first merit ilolr. the obvious institution play role would imf, itsfirst deputy manage director, stanley fischer, provide comprehensive cost-benefit analysis anilolr early year.4 although new, concept ilolr has, polite official circles,become facility dare speak name.the principle lender last resort describe thornton bagehot nineteenth centuryas willingness lend freely good collateral penal rate. all three aspect principle– “lending freely”, “good collateral” “penal rate”, problematic international level. aneffective lolr must will lend whatever take prevent liquidity run. the credible isthe lolr, le resource require lend practice. domestic lolrs credibility.but prospective ilolr decision group countries, either jointly via imf, lendlarge sum another country always difficult. in world nation states, unreasonable tosuppose political consideration enter choice recipient largesse. and greaterthe political uncertainty willingness act ilolr, large amount fund thatwill required. in turn, operation appear le credible, authority catch viciouscircle. the current resource imf – $125 billion $150 billion depend theyare measure – wholly inadequate ilolr. nor resource appropriate scale likely tobe forthcoming.moreover, serious moral hazard arise private sector ignore risk lend countrybecause belief country would bail international community event aliquidity crisis. and investor encourage lend emerge market form – short-term debt –which likely bail out. in domestic context, lolr ensure neither themanagers equity holder institution receive support allow benefit. internationally,it easy imf penalise responsible management economy, distinguishbetween citizen responsible excessive risk-taking theinnocent victim consequence financial crisis. it ordinary taxpayer emerge marketcountries bear burden service loan imf.54 fischer, s (1999), “on need international lender last resort”, imf.5 a point stress calomiris (“the imf’s imprudent role lender last resort”, cato journal, vol. 17no. 3 1998) although underestimates, view, possibility liquidity run seen, example, inkorea 1997. 5bis review 95/1999absent world government, difficult see credible ilolr horizon. the reason thesimple maxim: “it’s politics, stupid”.the second purist solution, opposite end spectrum, imposition permanent capitalcontrols. in words, return world bretton wood institution createdhalf century ago. the advantage capital control prevent liquidity run resultfrom currency maturity mismatch financial sector. india experience financialcrisis, korea did. they also enable country maintain fix exchange rate retain someflexibility domestic interest rates. and might limit movement capital low taxedjurisdictions, thus slow inexorable decline capital income taxation result thedevelopment world capital market. but difficult distinguish control capitalflows flow relate trade. the growth trade service highlight difficulty ofseparating currency trade-related flow represent investment. thus, effective,capital control likely impede trade flows. this would heavy price pay countrieshave choose pay it.permanent capital control disadvantages. they forsake economic benefit freecapital market. and control never implement wise, even merely clever, economists. theyattract rent-seeking corrupt behaviour official private sectors. and undermine thecause market liberalisation. there shortage protectionist tendency seek limit tradeand investment. we add them.so neither purist solution likely appeal – one insufficient political financialsupport ilolr, permanent control go grain promote marketreforms good governance.but present system sustainable. the danger bad worlds. the imfmay lend large amounts, create moral hazard so, still able ward threat offinancial crises. and face run currency bank system, country may force totake unilateral action suspend payments. so do?4.the middle waygiven neither purist approach agenda, international community try takesome practical step forward. the aim reduce frequency severity financial crises. somemight describe muddle through. i prefer call “middle way”. the difference themiddle way base principle emergency service slow arrive whicheverform transport care think of, borrow country drive slowly.how encourage enforce careful drive subject innumerable international meetings.initially, discussion take place g10, which, know, comprise eleven countries. then lastyear discussion take g22. by spring year group become g33.can complete sequence guess international forum take lead next year?suffice say original bretton wood conference forty-four country tookplace fifty-five year ago.in term practical step forward, useful distinguish prevention resolution ofcrises. on former, recent experience suggest five lesson emerge markets:(1)create do-it-yourself (diy) lolr, aim provide self-insurance liquiditycrisis. there several way provide insurance. one build large foreigncurrency reserves. this already take heart emerge markets. china hassubstantial foreign exchange reserve ($147 billion end june). and korea, perhaps thebest example country suffer liquidity run bank system term foreigncurrency, raise reserve low point $7.3 billion november 1997 currenthigh $64.8 billion august. it unfortunate absence efficient solution tothe risk crisis mean scarce capital might deploy inefficient way. buildingup net reserve – via current account surplus – reduce world demand time bi review 95/19996us economy unlikely provide large stimulus past five years. an alternativeis create gross reserve borrow abroad invest proceed liquidinternational securities. both method involve costs. a second approach diy lolr foremerging market create contingent credit facility international banks, argentina hasdone contingent repo facility, try set collateralised loan facility along linessuggested martin feldstein.6 a final approach diy lolr, absence aneffective multilateral ilolr, creation regional self-insurance funds. all theseapproaches likely pursued, great less extent, wake recent financialcrises.(2)manage national balance sheet and, far possible, avoid maturity currencymismatches. for country without track record international borrowing, important tomanage external liquidity position, especially foreign currency. the lack foreignexchange control mean difficult observe, let alone manage, balance sheetof entire private sector. but key element relate public bankingsectors. government already information sectors. a important anything theneed self-awareness country concern state national balance sheetand approach impend liquidity difficulties. when government market alike areinformed potential future finance difficulties, side time takepreventive action. of course, use derivative instrument hedge technique makesthe assessment risk exposure difficult. but effort must made. alan greenspan hassuggested consideration give simple rule thumb country without atrack record international borrow maintain unencumbered foreign exchangereserves sufficient meet foreign currency liability follow year, theaverage maturity external liability exceed three years. rudiger dornbusch hasproposed use value risk assessment country balance sheets. idea these,precisely focus national balance sheet, sure centre stage.(3)encourage inflow equity rather debt finance. this extension need managethe national balance sheet. the imperative old adage: borrow long short. a crediblelegal institutional infrastructure private investor would go long way encourageequity inflows. reserve requirement short-term debt inflows, adopt chile, mighthelp modify pace vulnerable capital inflows, little help intimes rapid capital outflow. it also time reconsider incentive provision ofshort-term finance provide basel accord risk weights.(4)promote good design debt contract provide framework negotiation betweencreditors debtor finance difficulty arise. the particular proposal – advancedinitially g10 deputies’ report 1996 subsequently endorse g7 – use ofcollective action clause sovereign debt contract stalled. how far clause wouldhelp unclear. bond issue uk, us, law – currently account under50% stock emerge market eurobonds – generally include clause already. buttheir widespread adoption look unlikely, least reluctance g7 toincorporate clause debt contracts. more productive short run likelyto promotion regular contact debtor country creditor goodtimes, well crisis occurs. state-contingent debt return relate priceof major export another possibility.(5)avoid, costs, defence fix adjustable exchange rate peg nolonger consistent internal external equilibrium. thailand show cost prolongedand ultimately unsuccessful attempt defend exchange rate. brazil show lifeafter fix exchange rate. it much early conclude emerge market

factorscontributing scale short-term debt flow emerge market moral hazardimplied finance bank develop world. it certainly crucial internationalrescue package lead moral hazard provision finance emerge markets.but important lesson g7 moral hazard start home.in resolution crisis le progress made. the imf can, has, providedfinancial assistance without cost recent crisis affect country would havebeen even greater. but stumble block “to involve private sector”.although statement g7 finance minister cologne summit june set both“principles” “tools” involve private sector crisis resolution, much remainsobscure. unilateral debt moratorium damage term future access capital flows.but circumstance debtor country creditor could benefit ajoint resolution temporary payment difficulties, procedure need prevent somecreditors free-riding others. the follow four element crisis resolution merit someconsideration. they particular status, issue need faced. the four are:(i)the provision official finance link involvement othercreditors, include private sector, resolution crises. this beachieved imf set floor minimum level foreign exchangereserves country require maintain;(ii)the aim resolution find cooperative solution negotiate debtorand creditors. no particular class creditor privilege position,unless instrument question explicitly give prefer creditor status;(iii)the use temporary standstill – possibly sanction internationalcommunity – would allow time country negotiate creditors. in theabsence formal mechanism achieve this, imf indicate itsendorsement standstill prepare provide new money countrywhich temporarily suspend payment creditor (often refer asimf lend arrears). by make standstill part furniture – one thebricks – would see ad hoc response, might lead tocontagion emerge markets, part approve process;(iv)measures, include perhaps strictly temporary capital controls, prevent capitalflight domestic resident exceptional circumstances. it would odd tosanction standstill payment foreign creditor allow domesticresidents move asset overseas without restriction.the essence middle way find practical step forward enable emerge market bettermanage liquidity position external liabilities, reduce dependence debt finance.crises still occur. but aim reduce frequency severity. to end onefurther policy fundamental success middle way – transparency.5.transparencytransparency one popular word economic policy today. and good reason. much hasbeen say transparency, and, interestingly, much done. why transparency important?in itself, transparency neither prevent resolve financial crises. but transparency help reducethe frequency crisis – alert market also policymakers problem horizon –and severity – minimise surprise scale liquidity problems. in korea, theforeign currency exposure bank system know crisis hit. and inthailand, true state foreign exchange reserve unknown even finance ministry, bi review 95/19998let alone financial markets. so transparency see “second best” policy purist solution tofinancial crisis unavailable. it context middle way transparency come own.the aim transparency allow good inform decision public private sectors, toreduce risk contagion allow market differentiate among borrower encouragemacroeconomic policy become predictable. transparency simply question makingavailable certain data. it approach economic policy, almost way life. the g22 report theworking group transparency accountability (which i privilege co-chair withandrew sheng hong kong monetary authority) publish october

internationally mobile fund unlikely beworkable. but many commentator remain suspicious, regard fund like child play justout sight tell – “i don’t know you’re doing, but, whatever is, stop it”.the imf become open release information. during eighteen-monthexperiment country able publish article iv reports. and background information,including policy paper programme reviews, available. all improve thetransparency accountability national governments, private sector imf.but one step progress urgently required. in world sovereign states,countries cannot, not, compel disclose information wish so. butcountries able claim transparent fact not. a crucial substitute forthe inability make transparency mandatory need transparency transparency. that iswhy g22 report recommend imf – context article iv

important affect credibility thecentral bank. an inflation target framework successful public convince thatthe central bank serious contain inflation. this mean government centralbank cannot simply

although monetary policy frameworksshould forward looking, inflation target rely heavily forecasts. where inaccurate forecastsare make public obscure central bank’s objective reduce

international expert field. the bank enoughexperience information technology implementation inflation target otherpreconditions generally meet case south africa.the implementation inflation

country practice specify target term consumerprice index, variant thereof. there is, however, consensus inflation bemeasured. preferably index include range product whose price fully describe changesin cost live generally accept public. include price policy hasno control may lead mislead signal price move line. policymakers manyinstances accordingly opt target exclude certain measurable component areeither unpredictable, volatile unresponsive policy.in addition, choice make set single point target range. this choicereflects trade-off – narrow band may interpret indicate strong

disadvantage band tend concentrate expectation towards upper boundary. aband, however, leaf discretion central bank provide flexibility caseof unforeseen price shocks.it also important decide level target set. preferably rather thelow rather high side. high target may give impression central bank notserious combat inflation. it accordingly good lengthen period targetwill reach start high level.the implementation inflation target require authority must able develop asatisfactory forecast framework. although south africa experience major structural changesin recent years, seem position forecast inflation. the reserve bank alreadymakes regular inflation forecast use large macroeconomic model base wide rangeof financial economic equations. in application inflation target prudent

future.but board also emphasise swedish economy yet situation. the trade-offbetween inflation growth uncertain early relationship therefore test thelight new information.i consider conclusion still holds.when riksbank begin talk le expansionary monetary stance, i imagine raise anumber questions. i like take opportunity discuss them.one question could be: why must riksbank spoil party? the swedish economy hasfinally begin period good growth, rise employment decrease unemployment, whileinflation low. so central bank representative talk need raise interestrate situation? may lead renew increase unemployment?another question strongly swedish economy expand without risk inflation. can itbe case even swedish economy display new tendencies, certain observer arguehas happen unite states, is, growth high without inflation take off? if so,why riksbank talk need raise interest rates?let begin first question.why spoil party?history teach growth demand outpace economy’s long-term output trend, thisleads time risk capacity shortage bottleneck result turn rise price andwages. at time, take one two year adjustment instrumental rate toaffect economy, central bank’s monetary policy decision base assessment ofthe future. face risk situation type occurring, therefore good try slow 3bis review 92/1999things small interest rate increase early stage. demand growth broughtinto line growth production capacity result stable path. by act goodtime manner predictable, hopefully possible avoid interest rate adjustment aremore drastic. meanwhile, economic agent continue count stable, low inflation.an example good result achieve forward-looking monetary policy useconomy. with judicious timely tighten monetary stance, federal reserve hascontributed long period sustainable growth. since gradual increase 3% 1993and 1994, feed fund rate fluctuate around 4.5 6%. this accompany anotably good economic development, long postwar period unbroken growth. the latentinflationary pressure hold check without arrest growth. similar reason lay behindlast week’s interest rate increase. the positive trend aid consolidation federalfinances.on hand, inflation already rise high level expect last, central bankmay resort instead large interest rate increase signal determination fulfil theinflation target. that weaken economic activity risk renew increase unemployment.thus far argument – question alternative advantageous – seem fairlysimple. but difficulty begin. how central bank arrive interest rateincrease appropriate time well size? a large, abrupt increase might lead todemand curb early much, along risk inflation fall pricestability target 2%1. that naturally desirable. which bring second question: whatrate gdp growth swedish economy sustain without inflation take off?how strongly swedish economy grow?in situation involve rapid changes, tendency affix label new economy. thelogical implication existence old economy work le well. i find misleading.there period sweden’s economic history economy perform exceedinglywell; one example 1950s 1960s. there also period le successful, forinstance 1970s 1980s.the concept new economy might apposite comparison confine present thepreceding decade. there sign swedish economy function good 1990s itdid 1980s. but concept actually stand for?one many interpretation new economy long-term growth’s trajectory shiftedupwards account good productivity trend. for give input production factor labourand capital, economy able sustain high overall growth. it follow supply side ofthe economy work better, demand side expand rapidly without lead tobottlenecks inflation.one drive force behind new good function u economy sometimes saidto rapid advance data telecommunications. by improve production distributionprocesses, innovation see basis strong productivity growth.some consider that, unite states, potential growth rate raise 2 3%. italso look though potential growth rate sweden become somewhat high – stillcompared 1980s – seem reach annual rate much 3%.1i refer here, consumer price index index underlie core inflation, e.g. undix, statisticssweden publish regularly behalf riksbank. that index exclude house mortgage interest expenditure andindirect taxes. if riksbank raise interest rate prematurely, resultant increase house mortgageexpenditure could cause cpi overshoot target, undix low side. this reverse thesituation recent year interest rate lowered. bi review 92/19994a common, entirely certain estimate today swedish economy sustain annualgrowth rate 2 2.5%. growth level lead decrease unemployment andvice versa. but strength demand growth determine level unemployment.other factors, economic structures, also involve level unemployment theonly result additional growth stimulus bottleneck shortages. wage cost rise away conflict low stable inflation.the gdp growth rate 3.7% first half year accordingly exceed reasonableassessment swedish economy’s long-term potential. for time, however, high growthrate feasible firm able recruit necessary labour, instance economyis recover situation high unemployment. that case sweden’s labourmarket pressure wage price thereby able remain low. neither anydramatic change foresee respect wage near future. but long situation lastin present economic upswing? how far unemployment reduce without firm encounteringrecruitment problem generally?even high unemployment present, is, example, already difficult recruit computerconsultants occupational categories. the situation certain segment thestockholm labour market also tight part sweden. but far, bottleneckproblems seem fairly restricted. a yet indication widespread shortages. itis positive sign match job seeker job vacancy still run comparativelysmoothly, although shortage skilled worker manufacture grown, levelremains relatively low. to date year, moreover, wage drift statistic show increase arelower expected.good credibility promote price stabilityexperience 1990s early period demonstrate relationship arediscernible economic model constantly question reviewed. above all, cannever adopt uncritically forecast future. so much happen different economies,not least regard economic policies, early truth reassess continuously.inflation subdue recent year number reasons. import inflation lowbecause subdue commodity price connection asian crisis. productivity growth insweden good before. another major factor increase confidence monetarypolicy economic policy general. all survey data, well underlie trend marketprices, show one expect inflation somewhat long run anything 2%.the inflation target accordingly seem constitute clear anchor price formation. in 1970sand 1980s, inflation prospect depend level domestic economic activity alone.relatively abrupt shift long-term inflation expectation also play part. today, areno abrupt shift kind. economic player simply count, good reason, riksbankacting sign rise inflation appear. in world, overall price formation centre aboveall level economic activity. the improve credibility thus factor may havecontributed level inflation low despite relatively strong growth.at time, riksbank major responsibility keep close eye morelong-term inflation expectation order maintain credibility build recentyears.demand assessment difficulta question naturally include assessment whether strong growth ofdemand experienced,

favourable trend.functions riksbankever since sweden abandon fix exchange rate regime november 1992, monetary policy hasbeen conduct sight inflation. sweden one first country adopt inflationtargeting strategy. in many respects, period inflation target characterise goodresults swedish economy. interest rate inflation fall level historicallylow and, crisis early 1990s, growth comparatively high stable. thegeneral public’s expectation inflation two year ahead 2%, suggest theinflation target policy achieve credibility – matter crucial monetary policy’sability produce good results.the foundation monetary policy credibility strengthen new legislation inforce begin year create independent central bank. maintain pricestability riksbank’s statutory function.the riksbank define target keep annual inflation, express change theconsumer price index (cpi), 2%. the ambition keep inflation low stem insight aboutinflation’s harmful effect economy – high growth employment cannot generatedin long run mean high inflation. it matters, economy functions,achievements technology educational system, determine factors. the best way formonetary policy contribute high growth employment therefore improve long-termgrowth potential via low inflation.to achieve objective, riksbank us instrumental rate, repo rate. if riksbank’smonetary stance unduly expansionary, is, repo rate low ensure macroeconomicbalance, time economy liable overheat. demand grow rapidly thanproduction capacity generate inflationary pressures. if, instead, riksbank’s monetarystance unduly restrictive, is, repo rate set high, result may decline demand,a weak price trend unsatisfactory growth.the full effect interest rate adjustment take twelve twenty-four month tomaterialise. this mean interest rate set basis riksbank’s assessment ofthe macroeconomic trend inflation prospect period. however, inflation assessment aresubject uncertainty risk spectrum consider too. since december 1997 theriksbank’s inflation forecast include know uncertainty interval. this intervalrepresents riksbank’s assessment uncertainty forecast. bi review 90/19992targeting cpi inflation, however, certain drawbacks. at begin year executiveboard riksbank therefore clarify inflation target respects, state that, undercertain specific circumstances, riksbank may grind interpret cpi target moreflexibly. price formation past three years, example, affect clearlyidentifiable price movement monetary policy neither shall aim counter full. thisapplies mainly decrease indirect tax direct effect riksbank’s interest rateadjustments exert interest expenditure thereby cpi inflation.the economic situation swedenlabour marketas i mention earlier, monetary policy’s primary contribution development employment liesin create condition stable economic trend. a predictable monetary policy, focus clearlydefined inflation target, provide good guidance wage negotiations. one main reason whywage formation function satisfactorily 1980s probably stabilisationpolicy work. inflation exceed official target several occasion period thelabour market organisation difficulty discern rule game. one example isthe government ambition bring inflation mid-1980s: crisis package presentedin 1983, aim inflation rate 4% 1994 3% 1995; inflation exceed targets,the employee organisation consider 5% ceiling wage increase long acceptable.today’s confidence riksbank’s current inflation target facilitate wage negotiations. the 1997wage round, instance, take 2% inflation target start point.the development wage always central factor inflation assessments, difficultiesinvolved forecast wage considerable. the indicator use riksbank include data onwages unit labour costs, shortage figure (bottlenecks) industry level, wage drift andunemployment relative unfilled job vacancies. another factor importance monetary policy isthe equilibrium level unemployment, is, level unemployment compatible withstable inflation. attempt push unemployment equilibrium level aid ofmonetary stimulus liable boost inflation. maintain expansionary monetary stancecannot therefore generate permanently high employment.during past year situation swedish labour market improve appreciably. since thebeginning 1999 number employment rise almost 100,000. a continue improvementcan expected, employer report difficulty recruit qualify labour eventhough unemployment sweden still historically high. there still need measure astructural nature improve work labour market thereby long-term conditionsfor economic growth.consumptionthe demand side swedish economy, private sector demand, pick properly inrecent years. in 1997 private consumption rise 1.6% previous year, follow 2.4% in1998 preliminary rate 3.4% first half 1998 1999. major factor behindthe growth private consumption good labour market situation, rise disposable income andincrements household wealth.the consumption trend particularly dependent future household income. expectation animprovement lead increase spend consumption expense current saving.at present, households’ optimism economy seem stabilise level ishistorically high. the riksbank envisage household expenditure consumption bestimulated future by, example, rise real wages, low interest cost tax relief. moreover,international economic prospect stabilise employment sweden risen. thesedevelopments suggest consumption trend remain favourable. 3bis review 90/1999public sectorthe financial position public sector strengthen appreciably recent years, partly asa result decrease

transitoryfactors, loss global demand connection crisis southeast asia, causedprices fall remain unchanged.in sweden, too, economic growth since mid-1990s comparatively good withoutinflationary pressure give cause concern. the monetary stance adjust accordingly bi review 90/19994the repo rate currently 2.9%. it early, however, say whether sign far-reaching change swedish economy. the riksbank take close look incomingstatistics endeavour arrive conclusion.conclusionthere many sign swedish economy grow rapidly. it arebeginning see growth rate 3%. for riksbank – well economy general

capacity. it important thatstructural measure primarily improve work economy implement goodtime. the good consumption trend meet rise output high growth bemaintained without necessarily lead unduly high inflation.as i already make clear several occasions, i consider tax cuts, tune establishedguidelines budget policy, motivated. the tax-to-gdp ratio rise recent year aconsequence growth private consumption rise wage bills; today ratio 50%.the swedish economy would probably function good low taxes.the reform need tax system – well i consider occur labourmarket – arranged, however, way promote

wouldlessen risk overheat facilitate interaction fiscal monetary policies.there problem, however, evidence good result – national economy inone’s enterprise – tend weaken demand change need

wild swing mood, even offer acomprehensive assessment economic reform last 15 years. that do in15 minutes. but let make observations.first, i believe several aspect reform result measurable andclearly positive. for example, i believe safely conclude monetary policyframework put place part overall reform process hugely successful. and i saythat someone small involvement original design framework. be isaying framework guarantee mistake formulation implementation ofmonetary policy? of course not. no framework that. we make mistake past and,since (or claim have) perfect foresight, certainly make

overall level gdp look pretty flat. it was, small scale, similarto kind trauma former soviet bloc country go recent years, withwhole industry wipe and, case, overall gdp shrink substantially. new

1998? i suspect fact australia grow 4 per cent 1998 wegrew year root lot current gloom. how could bomb sobadly, country similar exposure asian crisis? this isn’t place toprovide comprehensive answer question, indeed i don’t think anybody yet acomprehensive answer question. some blame poor monetary policy decision reservebank difference. i don’t share view see impact new zealand’s severe drought

convince that, right policy right attitudes, even better.where professional economist fit this? have devote first half speech toarguing current mood pessimism fruit last 15 year reform isconsiderably overdone, i want use second half address talk i thinkprofessional economist let side down. i talk colleague course.some do superb job explain world works. but often you, i, haveremained silent face considerable public political confusion uncertainty.take, example, rather limit public comprehension happen newzealand economy last 30 40 years. it seems, least, several decade prior tothe early

economy internationally competitive, take load farm sectorcan long carry, try explain sceptical public erstwhile generosity thestate may able continue. alas, get precious little help professional economistsin explain story public, respect economist actually encouragedthe public’s reluctance change.or take another example. tariffs. to best recollection, i ever meet two economistsin life believe tariff protection desirable long-term feature economic policy (afew accept infant industry argument favour temporary protection). economistsare probably unite tariff import control single issue.and yet allow go unchallenged statement statement, talk-back radio printmedia, suggest new zealand daft reduce tariff ahead trade partners,and reason politicians, treasury officials, drive bysome mad theory. or perhaps desire look holier-than-thou international tradenegotiations. the idea reduce tariff new zealand matter stupid othercountries raise incomprehensible public, yet idea whichwould accept almost economists. of course would good country didnot raise tariff lamb, kiwifruit, butter, cheese, beef, fish.but even raise tariffs, interest reciprocate kind.economists know that, do terribly good job help public understand that.or take third example. health care. i certainly go step political maelstromwhich health care debate, least part i simply know suggest orrecommend. but every economist know day economics 101 offer supplysomething free, demand enormous, don’t use price limit thatdemand, soon unable meet demand – whether devote 6 per cent, 8 per cent, or10 per cent gdp health care – face long queues. in recent years, contrary, isuspect, public perception, government spend health care rise somewhat fast thangdp. (in year march 1984, government spend health care take 5.6 per cent gdp,while june 1999 year government spend health care estimate absorb 6.4 percent gdp.) i simply know proportion gdp new zealand spend onhealth care. but i know that, matter much spend health, always queuesunless price arbitrary political decision part ration process. of course queue maybe optimal way deal situation. a i said, i don’t want enter substance thisdebate. all i say economist would service rational discussion health care ifthey make nature issue clear.at end day, i seek professional colleague great commitment toassist formulation economically sound policy. at moment, politician majorpolitical party hugely constrain fact that, economically literate peoplein many countries, general public good understand crucialissues. how, example, political leader grapple gradually grow fiscal cost ofnational superannuation, encourage rational public discussion issue, news item inone large daily newspaper could say, present government’s decision maintainthe real value national superannuation index cpi rather wages, “up halfthe superannuitants new zealand could push poverty line pension arereduced tomorrow”.33 i suspect true great majority superannuitants today believe thattheir national superannuation payment reduce reduced, yet ofcourse economist know true, either nominal term real terms. it true inrelative term course, reduction relative term assuredly people think of3 “elderly push poverty”, the dominion, 31 march 1999. 5bis review 89/1999when talk reduction benefit. to best knowledge, economist challengedthat newspaper claim, similar statement make electronic media.let make clear i not, here, argue particular “solution” grow fiscal costof national superannuation. there obviously range possible solutions, include increase inincome tax. all i saying, say strongly i know how, improve oureconomic performance, get sound policy decision improve economicperformance depends, without good public understand nature issues. economistscan course achieve own. it require leadership political leaders, businessorganisations, community leader also. but professional understand oftariffs, budgets, monetary policy, taxes, rest, economist surely major responsibilityto help build public understand choice dilemmas.as aside, reserve bank decide sponsor production textbook economic policy forthe journalist train organisation year back. this textbook launch next week. itdoes attempt promote single view economic policy, contain chapter write widerange new zealand economist financial journalists. it bank’s attempt ensure thatjournalists, least, access information important issues.perhaps appropriate end quotation speech give last week mr kerrymcdonald, manage director comalco new

demonstrate it, fuss lack it. many want thefruits; want cargo arrive, hard effort create economic wealth firstplace.”as fifth generation new zealander, i badly want kerry mcdonald wrong. i suspect want tobe wrong himself. i know that, i throw hat political arena 1980, motivatedme fear that, unless could arrest relative economic decline, kid would leave newzealand soon old enough choose, country

issue intoclearer focus.the preparation domestic payment link bolster fact foreign financial servicesfirms generally believe among best prepare respective countries. we knowthat largest, internationally active firm make good progress toward preparedness. theyare force order remain viable home market globally.i also know awareness among financial regulator high. the joint year 2000

these public sector effortsare mirror regional meet hold lead member private sector. survey ofinternational financial regulators, well conversation many them, also havedemonstrated recognition problem increasingly translate concrete plansand actions, many gather momentum last six months.another positive perspective flow large successful test domestic cross-border payment system last month. in test use simulate year 2000 environment, than500 financial market participant 19 country able complete transaction 34 nationaland international payment systems. the test include send receive payment instructions, andpayment settlements. there virtually errors, problem discover remediedquickly.that cross-border test one example broad development. we get increasingly positiveinformation regard preparedness core financial system overseas, importantly includingpayment settlement systems, could, prepared, trigger difficulty world’s financialoperations. these system generally implement extensive internal test testingwith participant well. the large test last month seem confirm year 2000 readiness hasimproved many important financial sector around world.avoiding complacencywe let recent success lead complacency, either domestically internationally.domestically, institution continue make preparation rollover period eventmanagement contingency planning, case remediation work. mostimportantly, include maintain active effort keep customer appropriatelyinformed. because important role public confidence sustain financial stability anevent year 2000 rollover, inevitable uncertainties, persistent andeffective public communication essential.full fact-based information certainly help individual maintain perspective encouragethem avoid take needle risks. on hand, incomplete information misunderstandingmay cause take risk shift deposit banks, withdraw large sum cash,or even make unreasoned decision asset hold. without solid perspective aboutyear 2000 preparations, others may fall victim year 2000-related fraud ask buyyear 2000 product service questionable value.similarly, still work do internationally. first, financial sector worldwide isconsidered ahead sectors, generally think unite state still leadsmost country degree preparedness, although advance are. forexample, test program and, cases, remediation effort still need make insome countries, although activity obviously quite advance major trade partnersand major industrialize economies. second, country hold thehighest standard self-disclosure, financial market make fully inform decisions. thisneed disclosure include industrial countries, well develop countries. similarly, financialmarket participant need seek full information international preparedness, make reasonable,calm consider – hasty – trade-off risk reward. now seem though develop world generally well position deal theyear 2000 problem, focus shift “emerging market countries”. this group describedby great risk failure due technical difficulties. my concern “emergingmarket countries” broad group nations, number well 100. it important thatemerging newly industrialize economy make good progress toward preparedness, thereare many, disclose clearly possible. market participant look make thosedisclosures part decisionmaking.those “emerging market economies” make satisfactory progress disclose theirstatus seek assistance work remediate mission-critical system engage incontingency planning. in particular, financial institution preparedness hamper lack ofpreparedness critical infrastructure – telecommunications, power, water. this cannot takenfor granted. i would, however, note many country may farthest behind alsothose least dependent upon technology. similarly, many country fewestlinks international financial markets, performance century date change isleast likely significant cross-border impact. finally, good contingency planning, includingmanual work-arounds may avoid serious problems. ultimately, however, system fixedor replaced, whether century date change after, sooner process started, thebetter.conclusionto sum up, i believe u bank system largely ready year 2000 majorforeign financial institution generally work diligently ready well 1 january. thus, ibelieve year 2000 financial sector unite state many country isreally le technical issue last year time. moreover, relevant regulatorshere around world know need do next five months, arecommunicating business leader manage world’s financial institutions. the progress wesee global financial sector evidence successful cross-border domestic test arealso positive signs. thus, technical business element generally make good progress,the real issue remain unite state lead country public awareness,understanding and, ultimately, public confidence.we recognize year 2000 event unique know occur, butexactly occur uncertain. in environment, listen reasonable andresponsible sources.part maintain public confidence fact-based disclosure public large marketcounterparties. disclosure still remain issue some, particularly “emerging marketeconomies” seek distinguish make good progress need increase efforts.many emerge market newly industrialize country make good progress. for somecountries, technical challenge may remain, particularly recognize problemrelatively recently.finally, know likely glitches, i would expect small ofshort duration. similarly, i would expect international disturbance limit term thenumber institution country affected. in order achieve outcome, however, somecountries institution focus mission-critical systems, engage incontingency plan key activity now.by remain dedicate next five month ensure work last severalyears fully completed, remain risk

crisis modern term fordescribing use call “banking panics”, “bank runs” “banking collapses”. we use thebroader term financial because, today’s sophisticate financial systems, source thecrisis could capital market non-bank financial institution rather bank, althoughalmost certainly bank would become involved.a well function financial sector critical economy’s well intimatelyconnected every sector economy role provide credit. when large-scalefailures occur among financial institutions, supply credit dry quickly lead tocutbacks industries. additionally, finance sector part economy mostsusceptible crisis public confidence. a problem hit one part finance sector canquickly spread rest sector, economy widely. once becomeswidespread, term systemic financial crisis distinguish one confine asingle institution narrow part financial system.another way approach financial stability look perspective development inthe overall economy. there widespread recognition community normal growth pathof economy smooth. we live number business cycles, although wewish cycle could abolished, u resign fact expansion cannot goon forever, follow recession. provide recession veryfrequent deep, public confidence legitimacy economic system remainsintact. the problem serious bout financial instability systemic crisis – inevitablyinvolving boom asset prices, follow bust – make recession much deep andlonger, even turn depression. bi review 86/19992the best know example depression unite state 1930s, severity ofwhich widely attribute modern scholar collapse u bank system.1australia similar experience depression 1890s, recent examples,which i cover later, contain elements, although fortunately small scale.over past three years, witness asian economic crisis, depth largelydue collapse financial system countries. although well know australia,the nordic country (sweden, norway finland) go similar experience decade ago.2in short, possible normal business cycle financial stability remain intact. theseare usually quite mild cycles. it also possible cycle financial instability play largerole. these usually severe. thus, good reason country canto avoid financial instability.

bernanke (1983) romer (1993).2 see llewellyn (1992). 3bis review 86/1999(ii)central bank financial stabilitythe idea central bank responsibility financial stability root deep thehistory central banking. indeed, many countries, financial stability consideration theoriginal reason formation central bank. perhaps best example unite states.the establishment federal reserve system 1913 direct response bank run andfinancial panic 1907. it late explicit monetary policy role graft onto thefederal reserve’s financial stability responsibility.elsewhere too, financial stability issue play significant role central banking. by end the19th century, bank england well practise act lender last resort. in the1850s 1860s, follow burst speculative bubble u uk railroad sectors, itlent freely institution prevent financial panic, bar crisis 1890s. infrance, unravel speculative position stock market 1882 lead banque de franceto provide secure loan paris bourse. in italy, collapse build boom rome andnaples 1893, result failure one italy’s large banks, prompt creation thecentral bank, banca d’italia.3financial stability consideration also play role development central bank inaustralia, although le explicitly unite states. in early decade century therewere strong advocate central bank along line bank england. progress, however,was hamper ideological debate role private banking, concern centralbank would out-compete private banks. while commonwealth bank take centralbanking function 1920s, include note issue provision settlement accounts, thewatershed 1936 royal commission.it return professor r.c. mills. in establish economics department ofthe university sydney chair university’s professorial board, professor mill play aprominent role member royal commission. a s.j. butlin note biography mills,the structure commission’s report draft owe much mills’ hard work hisability argue persuade. mill advocate strong central bank responsibility forensuring overall stability financial system economy. he, colleague theroyal commission, argue private bank intensify economic fluctuation lendingaggressively boom late 1920s contract lend harshly thedepression. this see repeat, although small scale, situation 1880s and1890s. the commission argue strong central bank might able limit unhealthyexpansion eventually bring crisis.the idea central bank seek restrict development financial system thatthreaten health economy strike strong resonance today. the difference today’sinterpretation advocate mill colleague subtle, important, one. in the1930s, bank dominate financial system, framework regulation bank see thebest way ensure financial stability (and operate monetary policy). today realise heavyregulation stifle competition innovation, ineffective mechanism monetary policy –even though achieve high degree financial stability.we also recognise today that, bank remain core financial system, financialmarkets – i mean money, debt, equity, derivative foreign exchange market – playa much big role 1930s. control bank long thing asensuring financial stability – issue much complicated. indeed, follow therecommendations wallis report 1997, government specifically separate prudential 3 goodhart (1985) give comprehensive review history. bi review 86/19994supervision bank reserve bank vest completely new institution, theaustralian prudential regulation authority (apra).this sound surface different sort world envisage mills, isonly managerial sense, fundamental economic sense. the reserve bank still dualresponsibilities monetary policy financial system stability, something mill wouldhave approved. and, course, two responsibility spell wallis report,and speech treasurer introduce wallis reforms.what different day-to-day face-to-face process bank supervision, settingof standards, monitoring, interpretation data collection, carry separate agency –apra – also responsibility equivalent supervision deposit-takinginstitutions, insurance company superannuation industry. apra’s role extremelyimportant one. recent event asia remind u good supervision financial institutionsis single big contribution government make ensure financial stability, whether isthe central bank another agency carry actual work.while present system managerially different arrangement one replaces, notfundamentally different kind. there still close relation bank supervision andfinancial system stability close connection reserve bank apra (withthe former two board position latter). in addition, council financialregulators, bring together head reserve bank, apra australian securitiesand investment commission (asic). the fact i chair group reinforce point thereserve bank vacate responsibility overall system stability, even long doesthe “hands on” supervision banks.(iii)the reserve bank financial stabilityi would like turn third issue: reserve bank meet financial stabilityresponsibility. here useful think two broad set policies: help preventfinancial disturbance counteract effect disturbance occur. i startwith first set.policies help prevent crises(a)maintaining low inflationwhen list policy help prevent financial crises, first one come maintenanceof low inflation. it stand reason background low inflation le likely underpin rapidlyrising asset values, speculative excess go them, background highinflation. but take much comfort this, event japan remind us. a betterformulation would say low inflation probably necessary, sufficient, conditionfor financial stability. the transition phase high low inflation high low interestrates actually raise asset price good reasons.4 similarly, move lowinflation coincide deregulation financial markets, first observe effect may beincreased instability.5 a often economics, take long time observe change behaviour anew steady state, low inflation; recent observation come transition phasesbetween one regime another. 4 a transition period high inflation period low inflation usually lead reduction inreal, well nominal, interest rate which, thing equal, would cause rise equity prices.also, low nominal interest rates, people’s borrow capacity rises, also lead rise inasset prices. see stevens (1997).5 see macfarlane (1995). for early latin american example, see diaz-alejandro (1985). 5bis review 86/1999(b)ensuring payment system safethe bank also important responsibility payment system. a part last year’s regulatorychanges, new payment system board establish within reserve bank. this board hasexplicit legislative responsibility ensure stability efficiency payment system. inthe stability area much hard work already done. the introduction, last june, ourreal-time gross settlement system high-value payment greatly strengthen paymentssystem infrastructure, passage number technical piece legislation involvingbankruptcy proceed net obligations. australia’s payment system robustas world.(c)maintaining influence regulatory arrangement australiabefore explain this, i must emphasise bank intention duplicate workof apra. we recognise apra policy-making body responsible set prudentialstandards australia. we also recognise responsibility supervise individual institutionslies apra, and, part division, bank take decision receiveconfidential prudential data individual institution ongoing basis. it rely apra tomonitor health institutions, receive aggregate data, occasion attendsapra’s on-site visit observer keep date change nature financialinstitutions.where bank make real contribution regulatory arrangement knowledge of,and day-to-day deal in, financial market broad macro-economic responsibilities.two example help illustrate this. first, deal foreignexchange market become aware high level activity hedge fund australia injune last year. this well ahead collapse long-term capital management (ltcm),which event alert world’s bank supervisor risk associate large hedgefunds. the second example come macro-economic study undertake asiancrisis. these reveal main contributor rapid inflow outflow capital thesecountries short-term bank-to-bank lending. one reason bank europe, japan andthe unite state keen lend short-term bank emerge market baslecapital weight favour short-term lend medium long-term lending. this logical fromthe point view individual bank – le risk associate short-term loan. but isnot helpful international stability bank whole show disproportionate tendency lendshort-term. it flow which, good reason, often term “hot money”. the bank andapra grapple conflict, i one hope basel weight adjust toremove incentive towards short-term international lending.(d)being able participate international forum financial stability issuesas result recent instability international financial markets, renew interest inofficial circle examine causes, see do improve situation.australia take quite prominent role discussions, number arm thegovernment involved. the reserve bank contribute australia’s efforts, particularly byfocussing two area believe incentive structure lead excessive risk-taking andheightened instability. the two area activity hedge funds, arrangement forhandling crisis occur – particular, ensure least loss areborne lenders. an indication success australian effort date australia isone four country add original group seven form new financialstability forum. i represent australia next meet september paris. bi review 86/19996(e)keeping abreast development financial marketsin carry ordinary business, reserve bank trade money, bond, foreign exchangeand future markets. this give u familiarity financial instrument market practice whichcan add value view regulators. i wish suggest put reserve bankin good position, different position. regulator asic much good legalperspective reserve bank, apra knowledgeable prudential standard andinstitutional practices. take together, therefore, broad range skill among themembers council financial regulators.(f)handling “once-off” threat stabilitythese arise time time may difficult predict advance. the clear example ofthis date challenge year 2000. while financial system well prepare newyear, best-laid plan could threaten public over-react year 2000 concerns.for reason, give mandate maintain stability financial system, direct alot resource ensure smooth transition. a lot work technical – make surethat computer system work, financial system sufficient liquidity ample currencynotes printed. but final analysis, ensure continue public confidence thefinancial system, matter public reassurance communication.in policy areas, bank need mindful stability financialsystem, also efficiency. while many cases, policy design improve stability thefinancial system also improve efficiency, always case. a highly regulate systemmight well stable, unlikely competitive innovative. the bank’s broadpolicy responsibility require balance various considerations.handling financial crisisthe situation reserve bank require play important role afinancial disturbance actually occurs. it unrealistic expect financial regulator able toprevent financial disturbances. the bank, therefore, need able respond disturbanceswhen happen.the main way would use balance sheet provide liquidity tothe financial system. the bank’s preference would usual daily operation inthe cash market, provide liquidity market whole, rather individual institutions.nevertheless, highly unusual case fundamentally sound institution experiencingliquidity difficulties, potential failure institution make payment pose threat tooverall stability financial system, bank would able provide lender-of-last-resort loandirectly institution. in principle, lender-of-last-resort loan could make institutionsupervised apra.it important, however, make clear reserve bank’s balance sheet available propup insolvent institutions. put plainly, reserve bank guarantee repayment ofdeposits financial institutions. indeed, recent legislative change remove bankthe responsibility protect depositors. this apra’s responsibility, apra thepower issue directive institutions, revoke licence arrange orderly exit oftroubled institutions. obviously, necessary undertake actions, apra thebank would consult closely order limit flow-on effect rest financial system. 7bis review 86/1999(iv)has financial system become le stable?from purely australian perspective, big financial crisis 1890s. although the1930s comparable economic contraction, lot small financial crisis.6 and forthe first four post-war decade financial instability rarely foreground. one could beexcused think problem financial instability fade away.the event mid-eighties early ninety dispel illusion. a widely base assetprice boom come end, ensue asset price fall bring many highly gearedbusinesses and, importantly present purposes, number financial institutions. two largestate government-owned bank failed, one large build societies, well severalmerchant bank fringe financial institutions. the effect real economy profound,particularly victoria disproportionate share financial failure occurred.7 it asalutary experience, fortunately many lesson learn private-sector participantsand regulators.from international perspective, would easy gain impression financial instability ison rise. the past decade include bank collapse nordic countries, mexicancrisis 1994, asian crisis 1997, russia 1998 japan’s problem stretch much ofthe decade. during period, hear disturb news many individual companiesand markets, celebrate one demise bar near demise ltcm.looking experience home abroad, i think possible say risk ofserious financial instability either increase decrease course past century. theonly reasonable work assumption risk serious financial disturbance thesame always been. an important reason unchanging human propensity togo period extreme optimism push asset price great heights, follow areaction cause price fall precipitously. what change course century,particularly past couple decades, nature risk face.the traditional financial crisis trigger failure one banks, often periodof decline asset prices. the cause usually failure correctly ass credit risk, exampleby lend temporarily inflate asset values. fire sale asset contagion lead run onother bank emergence full-scale financial crisis. such scenario still possible today,particularly economy head recession, long represent stereotype. for astart, bank supervision banks’ control credit risk improve enormously pastdecade. also, financial disturbance likely originate in, transmit through,financial market case past.financial market much large many transaction much complex, make therisks associate hard understand. derivative – big growth area – goodillustration. while enable many business hedge risk formerly accept, theyalso allow others take risk formerly could not. notably, derivative make easy forsome participant engage leverage – old-fashioned activity greatly increase risk.the recent ltcm episode bring clearly near-collapse illustrate market riskscan large enough systemic.recent event also remind u globalise market place, financial instability often comefrom abroad. last year, russian ltcm incidents, risk premia loan bestcredits increase sharply. even unite states, less corporates find sharply high borrow 6 see fisher kent (1999).7 in early 1990s recession, final demand victoria fell 6.5 per cent compare 1.5 per cent forthe rest australia. there similar disparity employment. see macfarlane (1992). bi review 86/19998costs, emerge market even large stable company could roll mature debt atinterest rate would keep solvent. fortunately, situation prevail long, butaction u federal reserve require end it. a aside, i add australia wasonly marginally affect episode, new-found reputation financial stability notquestioned.of course, spread financial problem across national boundary new. a hundred yearsago default argentinian government security underwrite bar brotherstriggered financial turmoil london, lead britain reduce overseas investments. this, inturn, contribute major contraction economic activity australia, south africa unitedstates. in australia, turnaround capital flow dramatic recently experience insome asian countries, effect economy severe. what new today,however, speed event transmit around world, role markets,as oppose institutions, play process.(v)conclusionit important maintain financial stability contribution make toensuring prosperous fully employ economy. it also important receiverecognition country world class financial infrastructure capable maintainingthis stability future. our recent exemplary performance help regard.but task ensure acceptable degree financial stability year decadesahead never-ending one. no-one guarantee financial institution fail,any manufacturer retailer fail. in fact, ideal world would ascattering small disturbance every year two keep everyone toes. unfortunately, thereal world like this: long period calm virtually financial disturbance takeplace rise prosperity take granted, create false sense security eventuallyleading

clearly, thisis closely relate output produce per worker - common measure ofproductivity. but also depend number people employ relative total population.through 1960s, 1970s 1980s, output per caput

perhaps even great importance, bank allowsfinancial market considerable leeway adjust monetary condition light new databetween quarterly projections. the real issue whether bank’s projection wereabsolutely correct; never be. rather issue whether bank allow monetaryconditions evolve appropriately light new information, i believe did.over 10 month since december 1997, ease monetary

sceptical rather hang faith it. but task todayis, speak, try win over.exchange rate policy3. let start hong kong’s exchange rate policy. here one often attract thesimplistic argument hong kong, pride free economy world, bestoperate freely float exchange rate. i obviously subscribe view. hong kong, allknow, highly externally orient economy. almost daily need imported, include forexample water tap home sand construction. and almost manufacture productsare exported. furthermore, much entrepot, handle large volume re-exports1, supportedby large container port world. and service industry also externally oriented,providing financial service region, particular mainland china. the total valueof external trade good service year equivalent well 250% gross domesticproduct (gdp).4. businessmen engage externally orient economic activity would i sure beacutely conscious currency risk arise many international transaction enter into.they would obviously prefer clarity predictability exchange rate domestic currency againstthose currency business exposed. they would, i sure, prefer fix exchange rate overfloating exchange rates, unless foreign exchange business case understandablethat would prefer great volatility come float exchange rates. it course uneasyfeeling profit might eroded, matter enhanced, volatile exchange rates. one simplycannot plan one’s business ahead properly volatility. under circumstances, prudentbusinessmen alternative hedge currency exposure considerable costs. it would clearlybe beneficial conduct externally orient business currency risk could eliminate afixed exchange rate system credibility. i believe europe largely operate withfixed exchange rates, benefit clear shall soon see unification europeancurrencies euro come being. and i would surprise asian economy whichfloated currency recently regret it. indeed, serious discussion try re-establish exchange rate stability fix exchange rates, possibly adoption thecurrency board regime. 1

anyfixed exchange rate system. however, i believe highly credible fix exchange rate system inhong kong. our track record exchange rate stability impressive one. this backgroundof sharp gyration exchange rate major currencies. the dollar/yen rate, example, increasedsharply mid-eighties 263 february 1985 fall equally sharply short period toaround 120 end 1987, meanwhile trigger worldwide stock

currency sensitive period political transition lead resumptionin exercise sovereignty hong kong china 1 july 1997. but hong kong dollar’s linkwith u dollar remain rock solid, exchange rate stay close fix level ofhk$7.80 us$1.6. there good reason exchange rate remain stable sucheventful background. hong kong’s economic fundamental strong2. we pursue sound macroeconomicpolicies. we impressive track record fiscal discipline3. in last 14 year fix exchangerate link, country grapple fiscal deficits, hong kong consistently run budgetsurpluses average 2% gdp per year. our fiscal surplus financial year 1997-98 5.8% ofgdp. a result, year build strong fiscal reserves. these deposit theexchange fund hold foreign reserve hong kong, include back issue ourcurrency. a end 1997, hong kong’s foreign reserve stand us$92.8 billion, thirdlargest world japan mainland china, provide 100% backing, nearly 800%backing currency4.7. moreover, structure hong kong’s economy flexible efficient, encourage bya small

robust financial system also provide important foundation forexchange rate stability. we see many example maintenance stable exchange rate hasbeen undermine fragile financial system. example include mexican peso crisis 1994 therecent currency turmoil asia. in hong kong, however, robust monetary managementmechanism, modern system prudential supervision sophisticate financial infrastructure. ourbanking system, example, strong, capital adequacy ratio locally incorporate banksaveraging around 17% problem debt ratio le 2%. although irrational exuberance hasbeen feature asset market asian

bank also encourage prudent business practicesgenerally. there is, non-bank sector hong kong, much le maturity mismatch borrowingshort-term money make long-term investment currency mismatch borrow foreign currencywithout foreign currency income. these tragic error responsible dire state someof asian economy find in. furthermore, benefit financialliberalization create euphoria regrettably encourage neglect need build robust financialsystem order cope associate volatility financial flows, seem inevitable, least thebenefit hindsight, could tremendous pressure currencies. not hong

certain issues, ahead timerather catch crisis induce situation. yes, still business failure - indeed aninevitable feature free market - little moral hazard public sector. yes, stillcracks show unregulated area require mending, example recently equity marginfinancing, nothing systemic nature threat stability currency.10. these strong economic fundamental hong kong also require hong kong toget involve process competitive devaluation currency recently see asian region. in thesecond half 1997, thai baht depreciate 49%, indonesian rupiah 56%, korean by48%, malaysian ringgit philippine peso 35%. even relatively strong economy oftaiwan singapore allow currency depreciate 15%. notwithstanding this, thehong kong economy still expect grow 1998 3.5% real terms. although somewhatbelow

immediately ahead.the task federal reserve come year importantly shape themagnitude downdraft asian crisis, interact remain cyclicalstrength domestic demand, degree effect import commodity priceshelp keep inflation check. but i return prospect 1998 challenge formonetary policy, i offer retrospective 1997.let emphasize view i present afternoon, outlook andabout monetary policy, view interpret view fomc.retrospective 1997in day forecaster, i find useful discipline begin year criticallyreviewing experience previous year, identify key theme shape outlook,trying learn forecast errors, draw implication outlook. i follow thispractice morning.the dramatic feature 1997 macro experience clearly combinationof faster-than-expected growth lower-than-expected inflation. this “odd couple” spawn asearch explanations. i lead expedition try extend analysis furtherthis afternoon.growth 1997 probably exceed 3½% fourth quarter 1996 throughthe fourth quarter 1997, inflation, measure cpi, 2% sameperiod. this remarkable outcome, particularly relation consensus forecast thebeginning 1997. in february 1997, example, blue chip consensus forecast project just2% growth gdp 1997 3% increase cpi. the fomc consensus forecast myown different expectation.i would characterize pace output growth 1997 unsustainable, meaningthat fast expansion productive capacity would ultimately restrain goingbis review 3/1998 - 2 -forward either physical capacity constraint high utilization rates, high inflation, andpolicy tightening. the unemployment rate decline ¾ percentage point past year,consistent observation growth trend. most estimate would put actualunemployment rate end year perhaps ¾ percentage point nairu. the picturethat emerge economy operate point sustainable capacity grow beyondits sustainable rate.but clearly face usual consequence over-taxing capacityconstraints -- namely, acceleration prices. while wage gain increase, albeit modestly,over year, inflation remain extraordinarily well contained. the core measure cpidecelerated ½ percentage point overall cpi slow 1¼ percentage points.storiesi always think defend forecast rationalize outcome relative theforecast term tell story. by i mean develop theme set theme tietogether project realize outcome bring coherence data. what, then, storythat bring coherence surprise 1997? goldilocks. the talked-about story 1997 goldilocks. this referenceto goldilocks find bowl porridge neither hot cold. the analogy aneconomy growth neither fast slow, allow comfortable peacefulexpansion without inflationary overtones.i like story, right one 1997. in economic terms, goldilocksshould story “soft landing”, situation growth slow trend economyreaches full employment inflation stabilize satisfactory level.but growth 1997 slow trend, and, result, unemployment ratedeclined level overheat would normally evident. yet get increase ininflation. the story 1997 ought one convey spirit surprise, surprise that, leaston surface, appear “break rules” result remarkably favorable unexpectedoutcome.a traditionalist’s story: temporary bliss. my first inclination, model-basedforecaster, would identify source forecast error traditional macro model wasthe basis forecast. the overall forecast error output growth inflation, model,can describe term combination error make model’s equation incorrectassumptions variable impose judgmentally forecast. for example, consumption mighthave strong predict realize path income wealth, determinant ofconsumption model. or, assume path oil food price might turn beincorrect.i call story emerge exercise “temporary bliss”. it story acoincidence favorable surprises, one set yield stronger-than-expected growth another setrestraining inflation. it happy story. but promise continue bliss. and, indeed, maylean forecast 1998 toward slow growth high inflation, one cannot identify anothersequence similarly fortunate shock go forward.my colleague washington university, murray weidenbaum, suggest thatforecast error often offsetting, reflect work saint watch forecasters. hername st. offset. her work often observe forecaster get forecast gdp aparticular quarter almost perfect, miss wide amount nearly every component gdp!bis review 3/1998 - 3 -st. offset take vacation 1997. nearly every major component aggregate demand come instronger fundamental (i.e., model equations) would justified. while i base myjudgment error pattern equation federal reserve’s model, i expect manyother model yield similar results.unexpected demand shock typically amplify commonly refer toas muliplier-accelerator process. that is, unexpected demand shock result high outputand income, which, turn, boost consumption investment, reinforce effect theerrors income output. this also part story faster-than-expected output growth in1997.but unexpected strength aggregate demand usually damp restrictivefinancial conditions, combination monetary tighten movement longer-terminterest rates. while ¼ percentage point increase fund rate implement last march,financial conditions, broadly, become increasingly supportive rather restrictive theyear progressed. real long-term interest rates, measure use survey inflation expectations, weresteady decline year, likely reflect smaller-than-anticipated budget deficit anunwinding expectation tight monetary policy. nominal rate matter, too, especially forhousing, longer-term nominal rate fell, due lower-than-expected inflation. equity pricesunexpectedly soared, reinforce strength consumption investment. so, instead offinancial condition dampen demand shocks, would normally case, supportivefinancial condition actually reinforce them. this another piece puzzle.financial condition remain supportive partly better-than-expectedinflation outcome keep feed raise federal fund rate, except single ¼ percentagepoint move march. the decline inflation, turn, reflect reinforce effect sharp declinein energy prices, significant slow increase food prices, decline coreinflation. overall cpi inflation widely expect slow project reversal thesharp rise oil price 1996. about one percentage point slow overall cpi inflationover 1997 was, fact, due relative movement food energy price 1996 1997.this somewhat sharp effect anticipate begin year account forum small part forecast error inflation. but great surprise decline coreinflation.a major source error unexpected appreciation dollar andthus renew decline import prices. the dollar expect many stabilize 1997.instead, appreciate sharply, 11½% base multi-lateral trade weight index otherg-10 currency even broad index include major trade partners.continuing sharp decline computer price failure medical benefit cost rebound alsocontributed surprisingly favorable inflation outcome.there upward pressure wage change low decliningunemployment rate increase minimum wage. but moderate theeffect wage change low price inflation.there also sharp acceleration productivity 1997, hold unitlabor costs. in view, acceleration productivity cyclical, mean inresponse fast pace output growth. cyclical increase productivity mainly, view,result high profits, rather low prices. but, likely small moderatinginfluence inflation cyclical increase productivity.putting story together, stronger-than-expected growth explain byunexpected strength aggregate demand, reinforce supportive financial conditions. thebis review 3/1998 - 4 -excellent inflation outcome, turn, explain principally coincidence favorable supplyshocks. a new era story: permanent bliss. a second story could also explain 1997pattern faster-than-expected growth lower-than-expected inflation structural change aseries structural change usher new era fast economic growth, perhaps loweraverage unemployment rates, low inflation. i focus specifically possibility anincrease trend productivity growth, allow fast output growth and, least temporarily, slowerinflation time. but potential candidate structural change aresometimes include part story.in story, part fast economic growth 1997 match fastergrowth productive capacity, inflationary consequences. in addition, theincrease productivity trend unexpected, generally result low inflation while,as wage gains, base previous trend productivity, outpace fasterincrease productivity, low unit labor cost hence inflation. this allows, principle, fasterreal growth, low unemployment rates, low inflation. an increase productivity trend, byraising profitability investment, also consistent investment boom, strong corporateprofits, soar equity prices.this advantage simple, unify explanation, meet occam’srazor test. from perspective, however, i see clear evidence break productivitytrend data. a i note earlier, i view acceleration productivity 1997 normalcyclical phenomenon. there surprise low productivity growth 1994through 1996. but level productivity return would expect inlight cyclical rebound output.i keep traditionalist new era story strictly distinct -- either, or. but, thetruth could well blend two.lessons questionswhat lesson linger question arise growth andinflation outcome last year? first, strength consumption year reaffirmed, view,the importance wealth effect.second, excellent price performance 1997, context surprise ahigher dollar result sharper-than-expected decline import prices, suggest wemight underestimate effect import price overall inflation. many models, particular,ignore role fall import price undermine price power producer ofimport-competing goods. this seem clearly important factor price decision inthe domestic auto industry, example, past year. base experience last year, iwould revisit channel.third, pattern wage change inflation definitively reject estimatesof nairu trend growth underpin forecast; neither outcome entirelyreinforce confidence them. the poor forecast inflation principally due, myjudgment, error wage price equations. nevertheless, i would make smallerforecast error i use estimate nairu bite current estimate 5½% andwould make small error forecast inflation i use slightly high estimate trendgrowth. the experience 1997 put rest questions.bis review 3/1998 - 5 -fourth, i wonder whether divergent pattern unemployment capacityutilization rate contribute lower-than-expected inflation last year. i believe issue deservesmore attention.traditionally, two measure excess demand move together cycle. inthe current episode diverged. the capacity utilization rate manufacture barely budgedover 1997, remain slightly point traditionally accompany anincrease inflation. if historical relationship unemployment capacity utilization hadbeen operative expansion, capacity utilization rate would two percentagepoints high today.the failure capacity utilization rate move range typically isassociated upward pressure inflation likely much perception absenceof price power firms. it also may encourage firm alter way operate labormarkets, encourage avoid increase wage go difficultypassing along high prices. the net result may le inflation pressure wouldnormally associate current rate unemployment.prospects 1998economic growth likely slow 1998 inflation may rise somewhat, butremain modest. however, slow growth appear high probability increase ininflation.the economy end 1997 still positive fundamentals, notwithstanding someapparent weakness demand fourth quarter. momentum income growth, high level ofwealth, record level consumer confidence, low mortgage rates, ready availability jobssupport household sector. firm highly profitable finance investment attractiveterms. inflation low. there imbalance u.s. economy would appear threatsto expansion.it base growth expect slow 1998 result thecombined effect spontaneous slowdown spillover asian crisis. theslowdown move growth close sustainable rate, rather threaten recession. a key formonetary policy whether growth slow trend remain trend. this willdetermine whether utilization rates, especially labor market, stabilize, rise further, begin toreverse. this, turn, important consideration inflation outcome next year risksof high inflation thereafter, will, me, important consideration decision aboutmonetary policy.a slowdown growthan important rationale spontaneous slow -- is, one occur withoutfurther feed tighten -- pattern consistent upside surprise across aggregate demandcomponents 1997 unlikely repeated. in case, explanation faster-than-expected growth 1997 provide rationale slowdown 1998.the appreciation dollar 1997, even predate effect theasian turmoil, suggest continue drag net export 1998, another factor suggest someslowing expansion go forward. the mix output fourth quarter may also provide animpetus slowdown production go forward. gdp growth appear likely exceeded3% fourth quarter. the production side data -- employment, hour worked, industrialproduction -- certainly seem point solid growth, available data demand componentsbis review 3/1998 - 6 -have weak side. this tension could reconcile increase inventory investment.a combination slow final sale rise inventory investment fourth quarter would anatural prelude slow pace production immediately ahead.the spillover effect asian turmoil slow growth 1998.the degree slow growth size depreciation exchange rate regionstill affect policy action take authority uncertain time anyimprovement investor confidence. a result, development asia clearly add considerabledegree uncertainty outlook, though around forecast slow growth low inflationthan would otherwise case.at point, i expect, direct effect shock asian development u.s.net export would slow growth gdp roughly ½ percentage point. the multipliereffects, case, would yield overall slow u.s. gdp range ½ ¾ percentagepoint. this estimate, note above, subject considerable margin error, give evolvingnature development region. but suggest spillover asia importantlyshape u.s. outlook 1998. a slowdown magnitude could expect substitute forsome monetary tighten otherwise might justified.cross-currents inflationlooking ahead, powerful crosscurrent still operate inflation. first, iexpect upward pressure wage prevail tightness labor market. second, thedecline inflation last year important moderate force wage change goingforward, partially offset first factor. third, set force restrain inflation overthe last year, factor i refer favorable supply shocks, continue restraininflation.the unemployment rate well estimate nairu. the resultingupward pressure wage change price inflation offset even overwhelm times, itwas last year, influences. nevertheless, role consideration inflation dynamicsshould overlook underestimated. it start bias toward high inflation. thequestion whether enough offset influence 1998 prevent inflation fromrising.one offset virtuous cycle set motion low inflation 1997. thelower inflation last year moderate cyclical pressure high nominal wage 1998.that is, real wage increase produce low inflation substitute nominal wage gainsthat would otherwise require achieve high path real wages.the pattern food, energy, computer, import price benefit cost willagain important factor shape inflation outlook year. the movement price arenot closely tie balance supply demand overall labor product market areoften subject wide swing rapid reversals. forecast price are, result, often wideof mark. it appear energy, import, and, course, computer price decline over1998 food price increase modest. while likely least modestrebound benefit costs, add list factor restrain measure inflation one totwo-tenths decline cpi inflation associate technical revision introduce blsthis month.the restraint likely favorable supply shock year recently beenreinforced decline crude petroleum price project effect asian crisison import prices. on balance, appear force continue restrain inflation overbis review 3/1998 - 7 -1998 perhaps much case 1997. in case, favorable supply shockswould neutral factor inflation year, neither contribute high low inflation.on balance, i expect small increase inflation 1998. the upward pressure oninflation also depend happen utilization rate year, turn willdepend precisely much growth slows. one final influence sharp cyclical slow inproductivity i expect. this raise unit labor cost mainly undermine profit growth. but itcould put upward pressure price well.two scenario challenge face monetary policythere many possible outcomes, particularly give uncertainty degreeof spontaneous slow dimension spillover asian crisis. because upside anddownside risk growth inflation appear balance case earlier, ibelieve monetary policy also need balance position.the course monetary policy will, course, depend much growth slows,what happen utilization rates, movement utilization rate interact othercross-currents affect inflation. a much large spillover asian crisis could encourage aneasing. continue above-trend growth rise utilization rates, hand, couldencourage tightening. but i want focus two intermediate outcomes, i viewthese likely would raise interest question monetary policy.the first scenario i call graceful “reverse soft landing”. this interpretation ofthe private sector consensus forecast. a i note earlier, soft landing, growth slow anabove-trend trend rate output converge full employment level. but ibelieve output already beyond full employment level. a soft land case requiresgrowth run trend period allow productive capacity catch demand toallow utilization rate ease sustainable levels. ordinarily, inflation would rise thetransition, give initial condition output excess sustainable capacity. but, currentepisode, virtuous cycle play renewal force recently restrain inflationwill continue damp inflation 1998, least moderate rise inflation wouldotherwise occur.in scenario, real growth slow around 2% slightly lower, unemploymentrate edge upward, remain nairu 1998, inflation slightly higher. this apath back toward full employment, leave inflation high still modest full employment isreached, perhaps end 1999. how monetary policy respond scenario? shouldpolicy ease response sharp slow growth rise unemployment rate? or shouldpolicy remain hold, allow economy converge slowly back full employment stillmodest inflation rate?given momentum domestic demand, still favorable financial condition andother fundamentals, question degree spontaneous slowing, uncertainty themagnitude spillover asian crisis, equally plausible forecast growth slows,but trend. in case, unemployment rate would remain near current level andinflation would increase slightly first scenario, though would still damp in1998 virtuous cycle force continue favorable supply shocks. this scenario would,however, imply great inflation risk go forward, light prospect favorable supplyshocks eventually abate, prevail high labor utilization rate continue pushwage gain higher.bis review 3/1998 - 8 -how monetary policy respond case? should policy remain hold,given return sustainable rate growth stable utilization rates? or, atightening policy light prospect gradual persistent updrift inflation associatedwith still high utilization rates?the latter scenario valuable highlight risk high inflation arerelated level utilization rates, rate growth output itself. the point evenif growth slow trend, utilization rate could leave unsustainable levels, leave risk risinginflation time.unfortunately, i run time i opportunity answer thesequestions. i leave provide answers. in time, fomc,

democratic process.as usual, i would like make open statement, comprehensive putout semi-annual statement monetary policy early month. it content still verycurrent i refer time time hearing.also follow past practice, i would like start review i say june howwe saw economy developing. there still fair bite uncertainty around stage theextent expect slowdown gdp growth 4½% plus occur 1997 and1998. that relatively wide range project outcome 3% 4%. the top ofthat range would indicate almost slowdown, bottom would probably indicate wereheading still low would represent genuine weakness economic activity.we think position little clear – forecast growth 1999 3½%, andthrough financial year 1999/2000 4%. a through-the-year growth rate 4% imply ayear-on-year growth rate 3½%, treasury forecast mid-year review. thus,these number show modest slowdown australian economy, behind us. itincorporates low june quarter figure reflect weakness business investment, particularlya decline net export first half 1999. because latter unlikely repeated, expectto see growth around 4% year ahead.there reason change view inflation. we think inflation year todecember quarter 1999 would 2%, whether

for quite while, beenforecasting quarterly current account deficit reach 6% gdp, finally junequarter probably remain level financial year. it surprise thatthe current account deteriorate fast further, give disparity growth rateand trade partners. while slowness deterioration pleasingdevelopment, think improvement could time coming.in summary, expect current financial year another good one theeconomy. growth little low recent peak, still good, inflation bewithin average aim for. consider ninth year expansion, resultwould mean major imbalance emerged. the aim, usual, keep expansion

unaffected oil prices, alsorisen 2% past 12 months.thus, period australian economy experience contractionary impact abroadand outlook weak growth sub-2% inflation passed. the monetarypolicy appropriate period long appropriate new circumstance weface. that reason behind tighten monetary policy undertake novemberboard meeting.at risk overly technical, i would like spell aspect flexible inflationtargeting regime little fully stage. in so, i want distinguish two typesof situation: first inflation comfortably average 2 point something per cent forsome time economy perform roughly line potential obviousupward downward pressure inflation rate. the second start point eitherabove range expect inflation average.in first case, inflation want it, monetary policy would set keep there.the economy would type dynamic equilibrium would need policy action.we ask circumstance would wish change monetarypolicy. would forecast inflation rise 2½% 2¾% fell 2¼%? my answeris worry small variation inflation magnitude. to trigger change bi review 130/19993policy would require forecast inflation go clearly 3% 2% likely tostay while. our flexible inflation target framework aim rigorous fine tuning,and require significant variation inflation forecast trigger monetary policy action.this bring second type situation. this start position inflation isabove desire target range. in case, initial situation one dynamicdisequilibrium, prescription little complex. let u look situation define thetwo possible start points.• the first inflation target. in situation, inflation targetingframework would say raise interest rate set would bring inflation back tothe target. but high rate do job, gradually reduce tomore normal levels. this happen 1996. we wait forecast hadinflation fall 2% start ease.• the second inflation target. in case, framework would first callfor set interest rate would, time, allow inflation go back thetarget. once clear set do job, framework call bereplaced one likely keep inflation target. the framework envisagethe low interest rate set maintain something go wrong.it reason lie behind recent tighten monetary policy refer aspre-emptive. to argue grind act inflation

set isrequired, move made. this would virtually guarantee movewould large one.what gst?not everyone convince argument i use above. some people still cannotunderstand would tighten unless economy overheating, assume mustbe hide agenda. others keen play old game try find political dimension tomonetary policy. this lead claim real reason fear inflationary effect thegst, diplomatic say so. i sorry disappoint proponent view, butthat case.• if gst reason tighten monetary policy, fed, bank ofengland, ecb, bank canada, reserve bank new zealand, etc. tightenedmonetary policy? a i say elsewhere, i aware forthcoming introductionof gst countries.• our start point always imposition gst affect level ofprices, ongoing inflation rate. this require business engage inopportunistic price

disposable income wage earner increasein expenditure, evidence fact package involve cost thebudget.• monetary policy base view inflation within target immediatelybefore gst introduce back within target year later. this view,in turn, base assumption second round effect due higherwage outcome opportunistic price behaviour outline above. if start observebehaviour indicate assumption correct,

dialoguebetween policy market therefore important. it must clear, however, policy fulfilits role set rule efficiently function markets. adequate prudential regulation andoversight mechanism essential respect. one crucial question must tackle futureis: far go let market regulate themselves? how far private entity asubstitute public commitment? a saw asian crisis, rat agency get wrong,in instance confirm new direction market already taken. while theprimary responsibility overall soundness financial system lie policy, market forcesshould use indispensible complementary tool exert discipline. this require policymakersto aware mechanism accord market work, sometimes fail work.eventually, behind seemingly anonymous market human be try maximize theirindividual well-being accord incentive

market failuresoccur consequently price mechanism doesn’t work, public policy look theincentives exist financial market participant - need may - adapt framework. toobig appetite risk heart subsequent financial crises. it encourage explicit orimplicit guarantee weaken hard budget constraint ought characterize efficienteconomic system. to avoid moral hazard, public policy dissipate false sense securitywhich might arise financial market feel “too big fail” doctrine “too complex tofail” doctrine apply anyway. constructive ambiguity - base knowledge fact andthe risk - might help make operator cautious. what learn asian crisisis “ambiguity” sometimes appropriate deal possible financial support butalso exchange rate policies. when lack fundamental convergence medium term,exchange rate peg invite short-term speculative capital movement unsustainable investmentand consumption patterns.this bring macroeconomic policy general, second big avenue, importance whichi would like stress. the globalization finance put premium good policies. publicauthorities thus well advise pursue policy lead macroeconomic imbalancesthat threaten price stability long-term growth. furthermore, imbalance arise policy mustadjust quickly. finally, country need transparent additional incentive 3bis review 129/1999identify build-up macroeconomic imbalance early stage take adequate action. thehighly valuable ongoing effort increase function international financial system wouldbe waste cannot build preparedness country world keep housein order. if effort pursue collectively, example regional level, high leverage beachieved. monetary fiscal discipline euro area structural reform make economymore flexible make euro area le prone originate shock also le vulnerable tooutside shocks.the third avenue public policy take give attention legal infrastructure offinancial markets, cover bankruptcy procedure effective corporate governance. thiscould also standard feature international

andefficiently supervise financial systems; otherwise country liberalize prematurelywould suffer potential sudden reversal capital flow ensue exchange rate andeconomic crisis, also world economy whole would hit. let mention - due tothe asian russian crisis - region euro area experience substantially lowergrowth year last year, reason real growth euro area wholedropped around 3% 1998 estimate 2.1% year.to sum up, public policy general financial supervision particular thus important roleto play. they keep long-term stability health financial system mind,correcting - often - rather short-term orientation financial markets. public policiesshould design avoid headache party, moderate exuberance exaggeration.this certainly easily say do probably always popular. but watchdog thereto popular?5.let turn question financial stability issue concern central banks.first, central bank must nowadays even past know go financialmarkets. they need position ass transmission mechanism influence bychanging financial market conditions. moreover, monetary policy must interest smoothfunctioning financial system. a japanese example shows, monetary policy may becomeineffective liquidity trap bank lend restrain need rebuildcapital aftermath financial crisis. a low policy interest rate would - suchconditions - provide stimulus economy.second, one classical function central bank extend emergency liquidity assistance,central bank need adequate information financial market general also onindividual institutions. a monetary stability might affect big player get difficulties,central bank position form view certain institution illiquid insolvent, andif latter case, whether institution systemic importance not. an additionalchallenge institution outside supervisory umbrella - hedge fund - tend togrow significantly. moreover, growth financial market general grow importanceof financial conglomerate particular go hand hand great opaqueness size anddistribution risks. this put additional demand analytical capacity concern withfinancial stability.third, financial liberalization, asset price credit cycle may become prominentand suggestion make monetary authority react cycle, instance byraising interest rate stock market clearly overvalued. central bank may thus aninterest contribute discussion prudential rules, could contribute dampen ofthe asset cycle. prudential rules, interest rate changes, safeguard financial stability.this deny role asset price monetary policy strategy. in context ecb’smonetary strategy monitor draw conclusion future price developments, bi review 129/19994is reaction movement financial market such. a priority within eurosystem areclear risk central bank lose sight primary goal price stability fear anegative reaction stock market.ladies gentlemen,to shield real economy far possible financial instability prevent instability thefirst place, continue adaptation public policy change financial landscape required. tokeep monetary policy effective, smooth function diversify financial system also theinterest central banks. monetary policy contribute financial stability keep expectationsabout future inflation low possible thus reduce inflation risk premia minimum. evenwhen monetary policy cannot eliminate excessive risk-taking speculation least try toavoid fuel it. let conclude say must never lose sight need bothmonetary financial

economy look rather bright, task monetary policyto try prolong period favourable economic development.the “new economy” “long boom”a common view, mainly inspire debate us, favourable development

favourable development last twenty years. there much talk inthe u “long boom”, i.e. period last early-1980s present, hasbeen characterise high rate growth, one rather mild recession 1990-91.there

asset price rise, value collateral thathouseholds enterprise provide borrow consumption investment rise too.higher asset make easy borrow, borrow low cost, result whichaggregate demand increases. large fluctuation asset price substantial effect realeconomy.why central bank worry development asset prices? one obvious reason itis natural central bank declare inflation target follow asset price trend since, i justmentioned, affect aggregate demand economy. and change demand turnultimately affect inflation, know.however, discussion recent year mainly focus another reason central bankmight want keep eye asset price trends, collapse inflate asset marketscan serious impact real economy case eventually threaten stability ofthe financial system. apart protect monetary value, perhaps best-knownfunction, also task central bank promote financial stability, whether directly orindirectly. this even suggest swedish legislation, lay riksbank shallseek “promote secure effective payment system”.dramatic event follow collapse asset market usually assume trigger theconsequences credit market company balance sheets. when asset price rise thaneconomic fundamental justify, fall price inevitable sooner later. such adjustment bevery costly financial institution widely accept asset collateral loan periodof rise asset prices. when sudden sharp fall prices, value collateral diminishes.in process fall asset price cause loss bank financial intermediary and,if bad come worst, full-scale financial crisis. these problem can, moreover, beexacerbated exchange rate fluctuations. in crisis southeast asia, mostspectacular example financial crisis recent memory, real value foreign currencyloans often rise domestic currency depreciate sharply.this kind dramatic event occur asset price rise high level justify byunderlying economic factors. this kind situation asset market know bubble.it might worthwhile point stop reflect moment fundamental relationshipbetween monetary policy asset markets, one hand, product commodity market onthe other. the purpose explicit inflation target policy introduce sweden andmany country last decade address recurrent overheat product labourmarkets. it might say - even strictly speak quite correct - aim avoid the“bubbles” tend appear market time time. generally speaking, inflation targetshave hitherto prove worth respect, inflation target appear today constitute acredible basis - nominal anchor - price wage formation. however, correspond anchorexists asset markets. this mean nothing prevent price various asset rise tolevels high justify economic fundamental owe psychological factors, or“irrational exuberance” like. the fact low inflation sufficient achieve moderateprice trend asset market illustrate development american stock market lastfew years. naturally, represent something dilemma.what central bank do?does mean, then, monetary policy should, great extent hitherto, use takefirm action response rapid price increase asset markets? there easy answer thisquestion, predominant view nowadays answer no. nevertheless, adecision-maker i must keep option open one. situation may arise future wecannot predict today monetary policy might role play. 5bis review 128/1999perhaps main reason normally advisable try influence asset price isextremely difficult, impossible, sure bubble form rise price aredue improvement underlie economic factors. the appropriate monetary policy must bedetermined fundamental cause rise asset prices. let u assume, example, arise share price reflect good prospect high future corporate profit result fasterunderlying growth productivity. in case, rise price result improvement infundamental economic factors, mean base “real”, rather psychological,causes. that so, monetary tighten would good move might fact becounterproductive, since future inflation would probably actually low result higherproductive capacity economy due underlie growth productivity.another reason usually good idea use monetary policy take action rise inasset price even succeed identify bubble, probably hard burst itwith precision damage financial market rest economy theprocess.therefore, general view nowadays central bank try use interest rate policy tocontrol asset price trend seek burst bubble may form. the normal strategy ratherto seek, firmly help great variety instruments, restore stability fewoccasions asset market collapse.inflation target effective instrumentaccording many observers, kind monetary policy regime declare inflation target thatis apply sweden country suitable instrument deal problemsassociated fluctuate asset prices. one reason set inflation target mean thatmonetary policy automatically stabilise effect event instability asset markets. sinceasset prices, i already mentioned, affect aggregate demand economy, interest rate willbe raise asset price rise vice versa. although know experience noguarantees, likely various reason stabilise effect asset markets. for onething, macroeconomic stability stabilise effect financial markets. for another, thereis le likelihood over-reaction, since participant financial market expect central banksto pursue policy dictate inflation targets. thirdly, low interest rate help mitigatethe imbalance may occur result rapid fall asset prices. in addition, credible inflationtarget allow monetary policy room manoeuvre come prevent financialcrisis.however, monetary policy strategy wait market collapse respond tochanges asset price may, least hypothetically, pose dilemma. the fact still notknow much incentive player asset market affect such“asymmetrical” action part central bank, i.e. largely passive asset price arerising act forcefully fall. perhaps devaluation policy pursue insweden 1970s 1980s relevant parallel context. during period expectationsabout rate inflation determine economic policy respond excessive risesin price wage devalue krona. accord one theory, similar mechanism couldemerge response asymmetrical policy vis-à-vis asset prices. if central bank take action tostop asset price fall certain level, player financial market might attach lessimportance rigorous analysis economic fundamentals. the strategy wait bubble toburst might establish climate actually encourage bubbles. this must ofcourse regard unproven interest theory, certainly call great deal morecareful thought.conclusionin speech today i deal issue moment debate particularly inthe usa. this due special interest development usa condition bi review 128/19996under monetary policy pursue usa sweden quite similar. many theproblems issue address also interest here, may future.therefore i feel something learn them.as i see it, one important lesson monetary policy, least today, take great interest inthe “long boom” “new economy”. in words, i think wise basic strategy toconcentrate make sure economy overheat - lead recession - tocount large hypothetical improvement future productivity which, materialise, willinvolve loss credibility drastic slow economy similar sooften witness last couple decades.i also discuss various aspect fluctuation asset prices. one encourage conclusion ithink draw connection present monetary policy framework sweden, withbuilt-in inflation targets, provide reasonable basis tackle problem may arise. 1bis review 128/1999mr welteke examine extent market need guidanceand specific areasstatement give mr ernst welteke, president deutsche bundesbank, frankfurteuropean bank congress, hold frankfurt 19 november 1999.* * *ito address main question panel: yes, financial market need guidance. but asufficient answer itself. in market economy real question extent market needguidance specific areas? the difference may exist three area (accountingstandards, electronic money new basel accord) mainly consequence difference inunderlying financial systems, also result different traditions. the u financialsystem rely much capital market instrument european financial sectors. theissuance bond stock list stock exchange widely use instrument raisingcapital enterprises. market capitalisation outstanding share percentage gdp amount toabout 180% us, compare 53% germany.most european financial market base bank/customer relationship focus traditionalloan business. in germany, example, capital market finance (including shares) amount onlyabout 38% total fund raise enterprise (in u ratio 70%). a consequence,securitisation widespread europe us, depth european capitalmarkets volume financial transaction cannot yet fully compete anglo-saxonmarkets. however, i expect euro gain increase importance live fullpotential transaction, reserve investment currency. this also contribute furthernarrowing national financial markets’ role structures, and, whole, strengthen europeancapital markets.iiwhat mean issue guidance financial market ?let start general principle widely accepted: regulation provide aframework best suit specific market conditions. this mean regulation reflection ofmarket development structure drive force change markets. constraint onmarkets development justify financial stability issue competition,protection depositor investors, function market general sense atstake. a long difference financial market structure exist detail “one size fit all” approachwill fully compatible goal create even improve level play field.however, also clear globalisation financial market increase merger activity exertpressure market adapt, become integrated, similar. firstly, termsof kind financial transaction consider “state art” and, secondly - willtake time - also term market structures. therefore, harmonisation well closecooperation supervisor around world highly desirable. this well understand andalready common practice, demonstrate multilateral cooperation international forums. bi review 128/19992iiilet turn three specific areas, address question.in area accounting, g7 assign international account standard committee (iasc)the task establish worldwide harmonise set core account principles. i strongly supportthis initiative much hope move towards true world standard basis. ias(international account standards) opinion requirement list allmajor stock exchange globe. german legislation already allow bank set theirconsolidated account basis ias.the ia currently review basel committee, iosco (regulators security firms)and iais (regulators insurance firms). some difference opinion still exist, especially theissue “fair value” accounting. the iasc obviously prefer “fair values” (which mean marketvalues) financial instrument include loan portfolio. the majority regulator (includinggermany) favour account instrument trade financial markets. for tradedinstruments easily calculate “fair values” whereas much difficult asset andliabilities bank book. the european commission take issue aim ofarriving common standard ia european account legislation.ivwith regard regulatory framework e-money u europe take different approach. ineurope, issuance e-money probably regulate (although relevant eu directive hasnot yet pass european legislative process). most european country perceive need suchregulation order ensure sound market practices, protect use e-money, takeadequate account systemic monetary policy concerns. the envisage rule allow forenough freedom e-money business evolve, technological progress hindered.the unite state take “wait see” approach issue regulation fore-money. nevertheless, i would concern possible competitive disadvantage europeresulting different speed

such, aspect competition may arise thebanking sector non-banks, especially small medium-sized companies. it important thebasel rule cause competitive disadvantage country specific sector economy.for purpose, common european position formulate wherever possible. withoutprejudging negotiation basel, good prospect competitive distortion beavoided by, example, allow use banks’ internal

namibia’s current exchange ratearrangement implication country’s monetary policyannual speech 1999 give mr tom k alweendo, governor bank namibia, on17 november 1999.* * *introductioni would like welcome first annual speech governor bank namibia.it common many country central bank take opportunity year inform themost important stakeholder economic issue bank consider particular importance.the intention also make annual event namibia.the annual speech shall review economic development namibia abroad; youwill find annual reports. i rather try give central bank’s view outlook onselected topics. today, i mostly deal namibia’s exchange rate arrangement. from outset,i would like stress reason choice, fact isimportant many stakeholder fully understand current exchange rate arrangement. theissues involve many complicated, intention give comprehensive overview ofthe current arrangement implication monetary policy namibia.the cma arrangementas know, namibia member common monetary area (cma). within monetaryarea, exchange rate participate country fix paymentrestrictions. the cma many characteristic monetary union, exchange ratesvis-à-vis member state fix capital flow free. a consequence, interest rate andthe money supply cannot directly influence individual country. monetary policy asystem best subordinate exchange rate policy, domestic credit creation must keep withinlimits order ensure sufficient volume net foreign asset bank system. in monetaryunions usually also high degree policy coordination, opinion could beimproved current cma arrangement. this issue i return later.the formal agreementnamibia’s membership cma formalise accession multilateralagreement lesotho, swaziland republic south africa 1990 separate bilateralagreement republic south africa 1992. two dominant feature arrangement are:(1)a commitment bank namibia exchange domestic currency specifiedamount reserve currency - rand - “without restriction subject normal handlingcharge” fix exchange rate; and(b)an explicit requirement least major proportion monetary liability backedby reserve currency foreign assets. more specifically, article 4, section 1, thebilateral monetary agreement state that, i quote:“against aggregate amount namibia dollar currency issue bank namibia,the bank namibia shall maintain reserve equivalent thereto form rand assetsand freely usable foreign currency proportion bank namibia considersappropriate…”. bi review 127/19992in addition, bilateral agreement also provide either contract party right issue itsown national currency. it also part agreement either party may introduce measure fordomestic resource mobilisation interest development respective countries.i particular draw attention two issue provision cite above. first, underno circumstance room change exchange rate, second, back rule currencymust observe times. these two characteristic remain source strength well asthe limit aspect present monetary arrangement. the fix exchange rate thebacking rule confer degree credibility usually find conventional peggedexchange rate arrangements. however, must also clearly state credibility obtain acost. in monetary policy decisions, aspect life, “no free lunch”!the decision join cma influence long economic relationship south africa,and perceive appropriate arrangement prevail circumstances. the extentto country benefit arrangement depend careful assessment itsmerits constraints.benefits cma arrangementlet start first analyse benefits.price stabilityby far one great benefit fix exchange rate arrangement provide pricestability domestic economy. it widely accept main objective monetaryauthorities country achieve price stability. by peg domestic currency thecurrency low-inflation country, ability maintain price stability enhanced, provide isa strong commitment part authority maintain exchange rate. the arrangementconstrains monetary expansion, restrain excessive government spending, send crediblesignals private agent prospect inflation. this normally achieve money growthin peg currency country approximate anchor currency country. the measure inflationrate may diverge price non-tradable goods, case cointegrated.in namibia, available evidence seem support conclusion. since 1993 domestic inflationrate closely mirror prevail rate south africa.credibilitymany government develop develop country number reason experienceddifficulties make policy generally credible. the credibility problem arise fact thatwhen authority announce monetary policy objective one period, may incentiveto deviate policy subsequent periods. this private agent form theirexpectations enter wage contracts. there may possibility government toengage surprise monetary expansion, even consider best long-termsolution. another credibility problem arise fact even current government ispursuing prudent macroeconomic policies, investor may fear future government thesame preferences. change government bring forward interest groups, whose demand forsubsidies could lead relaxation fiscal policy.acquiring reputation fiscal prudence longer-term perspective lengthy process. therefore,tying government hand either create policy rule delegate control certain policyinstruments independent agent welcome arrangement, especially period thecountry pass learn curve institution put place. under thesecircumstances, membership cma rule-based policies, restriction place ongovernment borrow bank namibia, instrumental raise government’scredibility therefore make policy time consistent. a time consistent policy policy thatwill sustain circumstance change time. time consistency bear advantage 3bis review 127/1999credibility predictability future. it therefore reduce monetary disturbance andeliminates doubt financial real sector markets, thus create healthy attractiveenvironment investment economic growth.exchange rate fluctuationsanother major advantage current arrangement help avoid exchange rate fluctuationsand reduce unfavourable effect exchange rate uncertainty trade investment. a southafrica namibia’s main trade partner, major benefit cma membership namibia theelimination uncertainty associate exchange rate variability. since namibia net importer ofgoods service south africa, benefit derive cma membership may respectbe large.the emphasis exchange rate volatility, short-term nature due theflexibility exchange rate itself. market determine exchange rate prone excess volatilitythat damage real economy. overshoot exchange rate could realnegative economic effects. the elimination fluctuation promote economic stability. this isparticularly important give volume namibian trade south africa. overshoot theexchange rate country little trade may matter much, countriesengaged substantial trade, does. a stable exchange rate ensure stability price oftraded good hence eliminate volatility - exchange rate - also wage andprices hence enhance economic performance.the advantage derive benefit fix exchange rate arrangement thesuitability exchange rate nominal anchor. but go beyond that. at independence in1990, nation gain linkage rand ensure confidence fledge domesticfinancial system economy give historical trade association south africa.reduction transaction costsa relate benefit reduction transaction cost associate fix exchange rate betweenthe namibia dollar south african rand. transaction cost include spread buyand sell price, compute difference rate bank buy foreign currency andthe rate charge sale foreign currency. other cost involve commission charge forengaging foreign exchange transactions. the commission vary size transactions, andthere usually different rate various form foreign currency transfers.the gain elimination transaction cost function trade flow member amonetary union. with high volume trade, gain substantial. furthermore, country’sdirection trade highly diversified, fix exchange rate currency one ofthe trade partner would eliminate transaction costs. elimination exchange rate risksremoves hedge exchange rate argument firm’s decision regard geographicalconcentration activities. it difficult arrive precise estimate magnitude savingsinvolved. for small economy highly dependent international trade investments, thesesavings could substantial.this case namibia. due membership cma, namibia save transactioncosts involve exchange namibia dollar south african rand spread betweenrates charge sale purchase foreign currency. this benefit increase due fact thatthe rand legal tender namibia cost involve convert namibia dollarinto south african rand. an estimate save 3.8% gdp suggest previousstudy. compare estimate save 0.5% gnp common currency eu, themagnitude advantage namibia appear quite sizeable. this understand giventhe fact close 90% namibian import come south africa. bi review 127/19994access financial marketsthough least important, major benefit cma arrangement free flow capitalbetween member countries. this provide wide access financial market thus help insatisfying extraordinary financial requirement infrastructural project country. it achallenge private sector namibia make full use advantage.costsagainst benefit cma arrangement, shall consider cost beassociated present system.loss autonomy monetary policyby far often discuss setback arrangement loss autonomy monetary policy.a major cost cma membership namibia forego use nominal exchange rate orinterest rate policy instrument macroeconomic adjustment. the central bank cannot controlthe supply money money supply determine wholly balance payments.with increase capital mobility, exist limit scope influence interest rate. these twoconditions also apply fix adjustable peg arrangement.the exchange rate key determinant balance payments, serve nominal anchorfor price level. therefore, movement exchange rate response balance payment shocksaffects output price stability. for instance, country may experience fast growth productivity,say agriculture due abundant rainfall compare countries, discovery newmines bring additional export revenue save imports. in cases, real appreciation ofthe exchange rate call for. under present arrangement, country cannot use exchangerate policy tool control increase decrease supply money. this often asource resentment exchange rate arrangement economic management take ofthe hand domestic monetary authorities.related whole issue ability namibian economy absorb external shocks.namibia highly open economy - give membership cma - hardly useexchange rate interest rate mitigate impact external shocks. namibia number ofunfavourable shock past 20 years. the cumulative net loss income due term tradeshocks estimate amount average 2.1% gdp. the export earn andinvestment also negatively affected.from time time country could also suffer shock specific it. the inability countryto embark appropriate timely policies, instance use exchange rate policy, toescape shock create feel frustration. but also trade-off monetarypolicy credibility smooth economic adjustment promote exchange rate. the question iswhether trade-off exist case namibia south africa. flexible exchange rate hasten acountry’s adjustment country specific economic shock facilitate rapid change term oftrade. however, two country experience broadly similar economic shocks, change - - inthe bilateral term trade may significantly aid adjustment specific economic shock anyone country.moreover, factor production, particularly capital, highly mobile, use term tradeas adjustment mechanism may prove inadequate. finally, reserve currency countryis also peg currency country’s major trade partner, case south africa namibia,exchange rate flexibility policy tool become le effective.stability rand reserve currencythe issue choice reserve currency crucial decide peg domestic currency.among factor may determine choice rand reserve currency direction 5bis review 127/1999of trade flows, denomination import exports, deep financial market offer southafrica correlation among cyclical movement economy namibia southafrica. one important consideration, recent time become source deepconcern, stability value rand. south africa recent year experience rapiddeterioration rand: namibia dollar depreciate tandem rand, particularlyduring financial crisis engulf south africa early part 1998. the exit investorsfrom emerge markets, south africa included, lead speculative attack rand. thesubsequent depreciation affect namibia dollar. the response crisis south africanmonetary authority translate high interest rates, lead increase cost ofborrowing.generally, would expect depreciate rand translate increase export namibianeconomy domestic good become competitive international markets. these benefitshave limit namibian export consist mainly commodity whose price determine inthe international commodity markets.the answer question stability rand obvious. first, event since crisisthat shake rand 1998 prove resilience currency witness rapid rateof recovery south african economy present stability rand. internationalexperiences tell u currency undergo period strength weaknesses. it abilityto survive tremor determine relevance. secondly, even namibia dollar notpegged rand, would still occasionally undergo shock could lead itsdepreciation like national currency. the fact depreciation cannot translate towindfall gain economy export structure peg rand.persistence capital outflowsone disadvantage present arrangement persistence capital outflow favour ofsouth africa. inter-country movement labour minimal, market relate net movement ofcapital tend one-sided favour south africa. among cma countries, south africa hasby far sophisticate financial markets, suggest capital flow likely beconcentrated market detriment country periphery, financial marketsare still early stage development.this, turn, could hamper development financial market namibia. for example, namibianpension portfolio fund channel south africa, deprive local economy ofinvestible fund make regional disparity even worse. this, however, balancedagainst advantage pool risk availability investment opportunity create bythe free flow fund within cma, eventually could also give depth financial market innamibia. moreover, significant portion namibia’s foreign direct investment inflow beencoming south africa, thus partly offset outflow long-term funds. further,namibia’s save continue excess country’s present investment demand, imply thatefforts must make create investment opportunity order increase level investment.here, government private sector joint responsibility.loss seignoragejoining cma also involve cost loss seignorage. the issue could viewedfrom two perspectives. in grow economy, need individual business thatparticipate economic activity increase hold financial balance economictransactions. a part balance form currency issue central bank, forwhich central bank pay interest. secondly, government may “tax” exist real balancesby create additional money cause inflation. inflation tax - often call - kind offorced savings, enable government acquire good services. in number countries,inflation tax revenue important part government income. bi review 127/19996as member cma, scope inflationary finance limited. base discussionsearlier, ability increase real balance line grow productivity, hence generateseignorage, could constrain strict back rules. the second aspect seignorage payment hasto payment namibia circulation rand territory. with decline inthe circulation rand introduction namibian national currency, compensationderived namibia use rand also contract significantly. however, secondfactor may contribute overall contraction earn seignorage.nevertheless, crucial question ask whether inflation tax - benefit earningseignorage - significant enough warrant forego advantage stable financial system.inflation tax major source financial instability many country since constitute taxon financial system.lender last resortone principal criticism present arrangement, limit ability bank ofnamibia perform role “lender last resort”. though system guarantee convertibilityof domestic currency fix exchange rate, thus enhance monetary credibility, guarantee ofthe convertibility bank deposit explicitly deal formal agreement. a know,no country fully protect bank crisis could lead substantial macroeconomicshocks. i intend spend much time argument number reasons. there isnothing cma arrangement preclude bank namibia undertake appropriatelender last resort function need arise. all need adjustment foreignreserve coverage beyond current 100% minimum. secondly, bank namibia act specificallyempowers bank undertake lender last resort function need it. third, majorantidote bank failure adequate prudential supervisory arrangement. in past years,the bank supervision department together commercial bank engage standardisingprudential requirements. commercial bank also comply requirements. to us, isa relevant factor prevention bank failures.issues emerge present arrangementlet turn discussion broad economic issue emerge relation presentarrangement.stability expense developmentan important question ask whether relative stability achieve currentexchange rate regime obtain expense development.(a)slower economic growth?it argue arrangement ensure price stability tend constrain domestic growth.the arrangement impose contractionary bias domestic money supply, may expandin step grow domestic production. the question must ask whether price stabilitynecessarily constrain long term economic growth. strong empirical evidence abound show thatthe long-run trade-off price stability growth exist. on contrary, increasingempirical evidence emerge suggest reduction rate inflation beneficial toeconomic growth. if case stable price help generate fast trend rate economicgrowth, whatever short run cost country may initially incur attain objective pricestability, would balance long run benefit economic growth.in recent study, comparison make macroeconomic performance country kindof monetary arrangement le extreme form exchange rate arrangement show inflation isabout 4 percentage point low former. on average, data country arrangementover ten-year period show country grow fast country either peggedor float arrangements. it true exchange rate arrangement alone could 7bis review 127/1999responsible observe differential, time, evidence lend credence tothe assertion exchange rate arrangement lead sluggish growth.(b)impediments trade diversificationthere are, however, aspect potential conflict stability development. in thisregard, i would like draw experience irish currency arrangement, strongsimilarities cma arrangement. the irish pound introduce 1927 one-for-oneparity sterling arrangement last ireland decide participate europeanmonetary arrangement 1979. full convertibility sterling ensure note issue wereto back 100% reserve consist gold sterling balances.one consequence sterling link trade large extent direct towards sterlingarea. it argue reason ireland benefit “post-war dynamism” ineurope follow second world war. have alternative avoid cost currency riskand foreign exchange transaction, irish export enterprise reluctant establish tradingrelationships market continental europe elsewhere. because one-for-one link,trade sterling area involve great financial complexity internal trade.the analogue namibian situation striking. a mentioned, namibia still import close to90% cma countries. the arrangement therefore require vigilance determination todiversify pattern trade commerce.(c)capacity buildinga similar argument make regard financial system. the limit use monetarypolicy instrument currency board arrangement use local bank londonmoney market liquidity needs, conducive development risk managementand trade skill ireland. the acquisition skill largely delay emergence ofa domestic money market early-1970s foreign exchange market even later.again, relevant point analyze namibian situation. one point oftenoverlooked argue adoption independent monetary policy, issue ofpreparedness. the development active interbank market secondary market well localcapacity liquidity forecast management pre-requisite successful implementationof monetary exchange rate policy. this process require active promotion assistance thecentral bank. while progress make direction consolidation ofgovernment bonds, fine-tune reserve requirement introduction call accountfacility bank namibia, need do equip bank intervene domesticmoney market. the capacity bank formulate implement appropriate timely monetarypolicy measure also need build up. the appropriate channel transmission monetarypolicy investigated. there need examine carefully choice intermediate andultimate target monetary policy, operational variable appropriate localeconomy. build adequate capacity undertake aforementioned function bank takestime effort. thus, need caution regard appropriate institutional capacityis put place.(d)regional cooperationthe experience 14 sub-saharan african country belong cfa franc zone providesome interest lesson regard benefit shortcoming regional cooperation thearea exchange rate management. since 1948, country make monetary union afixed exchange rate french franc. the french treasury guarantee convertibility thecfa franc french franc, effectuate establishment regional central banksof operational account french treasury market relate yield charges.initially, arrangement appear work well. follow 30 year strong growth lowinflation compare sub-saharan african countries, growth performance cfafranc zone country begin weaken mid-1980, mainly due sharp deterioration term bi review 127/19998of trade. moreover, fiscal imbalance external public debt increase substantially relation togdp. these country also experience major weaken soundness financial position ofthe bank system.against background, decision make january 1994 devalue cfa franc 50% andto implement restrictive income credit policy range structural institutional reforms.this policy package contribute resumption growth real per caput income areduction inflation fiscal imbalances. despite progress make since 1994, cfa countriesare still struggle heavy external debt burden economy suffer structuralrigidities.a relevant question u country manage take advantage thestability provide fix exchange rate regime. one important limitation until1994, degree economic financial interaction regional cooperation among countriesof cfa franc zone relatively limited. there surely many reason this, partly relate tovarious administrative restrictions, different tax treatment protectionist trade policies. but alsopolitical considerations, influence perceive need maintain special economic politicallinks france, appear dominate expense regional economic considerations. after1994, effort make strengthen regional economic monetary integration. the objectiveis establish common market base custom union harmonization tax system.economic policy coordination regional surveillance also put agenda.one override lesson i draw experience current exchange rate regime canbe basis stability economic growth. however, economic development followautomatically monetary policy arrangement.consequences inflation target south africaas monetary condition namibia closely link south africa, conduct ofmonetary policy country naturally special interest us. the adoption formal inflationtargeting framework monetary policy move monetary authority financialcommunity namibia follow closely.first, important u understand inflation target about. under system, aspecific target inflation medium term publicly announced. inflation target therefore amonetary policy framework explicitly recognize price stability medium-term objective. withinflation targeting, monetary policy decision guide expect future inflation relative theannounced inflation target. this system adopt number country recent years,replacing either formal intermediate monetary target exchange rate target.second, ask whether adoption inflation target system anyconsequences monetary condition cma countries. one important reason give thesouth african authority change explicit inflation target framework moretransparent previous framework. to extent inflation target system monetarypolicy decision-making process perceive market participant transparent, bea positive development cma country namibia. this reduce unwarrantedmarket reactions, time result disruptive movement exchange rate interest rates,with negative consequence trade economic activities.it also important u note adoption inflation target significant waychange practical implementation monetary policy. the main operational instrument willcontinue repo mechanism reserve bank foresee need change theinstruments use today fine-tune liquidity interest rate south africanmarket.there is, however, one possible consequence aware prepare for. in theeconomic literature inflation targeting, concern express direct inflation targetingcould easily lead excessive short-term - even medium-term - fluctuation nominal (and 9bis review 127/1999real) exchange rate. this common experience inflation target countries. there aremany cause observe fluctuation exchange rates. in country strong fiscal andstructural policy adjustment give support changes, well portfolio shifts. in thecase south africa, exchange rate include important element macroeconomicmonetary policy model use reserve bank. exchange rate change come result thepolicy process independent objective.greater nominal exchange rate changes, materialize, concern namibia forreasons i already touch upon. however, consequence likely severe.exchange rate fluctuation nothing new financial commercial community namibia. itshould also emphasize inflation target could promote considerable stabilization ofthe nominal exchange rate. so far, experience inflation target regime indicate largestfluctuations prompt lack credibility regime. a credibility improves, exchangerate variability generally limit normal fluctuation real exchange rate.international trend exchange rate arrangementsas enter new decade, fix exchange rate system seem generally replace withfloating exchange rates. the international foreign exchange market dominate three majorcurrencies - u dollar, yen euro - float other. none thesethree explicit inflation target objective monetary policy, practice theirorientation monetary policy one implicit inflation targeting. in us, example, thefederal reserve make clear assessment inflationary pressure theoutlook inflation major determinant monetary policy adjustments. although theeuropean central bank adopt system monetary targeting, practice monetary policyregime resemble inflation target quite closely. it difficult classify monetary policy injapan, fact inflation bring low levels. the trend amongindustrial country emerge economy appear adoption formal inflation targeting.although hardly characterise trend, country still adopt peg theirexchange rate group country opt cooperation currency area monetary union.alternatives namibianamibia indirectly link appear present norm exchange rate arrangements.this namibia dollar link rand, float fluctuation inthe future influence monetary policy base inflation targeting. if unknownreasons present arrangement terminate time future, relevantalternative would namibia adopt float exchange rate own. it bank ofnamibia’s view benefit present membership cma outweigh costs. a pegarrangement also continue remain optimum country battle attempt reducefiscal deficit. for foreseeable future, therefore, namibia take initiative terminateits membership.but another alternative. the present arrangement - extent possible - managedin way stability utilise promote development national economy. inmy opinion, namibia would benefit evolution cma arrangement toward full monetaryunion. a mention earlier, would require close coordination economic policy thecurrency area. political structure would establish make operational. the group ofcountries comprise cma could extend include country region similareconomic structure development priorities.i fully aware realisation objective achieve long-term perspective.in meanwhile, namibia’s benefit cma arrangement could increase extendedconsultations member countries. for example, adoption inflation targetingframework south africa would good occasion extend discussion framework bi review 127/199910itself and, later, implementation monetary policy response monetary authorities’expectation future inflation. such extend consultation limit monetary matters,but apply area economic policy well.in end, achievement monetary union require country region committhemselves confront process solve conflict national interest fair democraticmanner. in order reach common objective monetary stability economic prosperity, aregional solution may also route take u southern africa.conclusionin conclusion, i hope explanation complex issue raise awareness theproblems involve give basis discussions. it also hope thisexplanation create good understand action bank namibia

international financial architecture, hold new york 17 november 1999.* * *i delight take part afternoon foreign policy association’s conference globalcapital market new international financial architecture. it special pleasure hereamong many old friend colleagues.in remark today, i focus primarily issue relate responsibility chairman thebasel committee bank supervision. first, i’d like give brief update committee’sefforts implement globally agreement reach initially september 1997 core principle foreffective bank supervision. second, i’ll describe committee’s work promote improvementsin risk management, include relate lesson draw ltcm episode. third, i willdiscuss committee’s proposal new capital adequacy framework replace 1988 capitalaccord give idea timetable go forward. many effort wereinitiated prior russian financial collapse summer 1998. there doubt, however,that go significantly high gear thereafter.let turn first update status core principle effective bankingsupervision. this initiative basel committee embark mid-1990s belief thatthere need foster effective bank supervision throughout global financial markets.in develop core principles, committee seek craft document would thelegitimacy, quality, flexibility meet need bank supervisor around world. to thisend, committee make key point consult broadly supervisor throughout thevarious stage project, particularly emerge market countries.the core principle document result process bring together concisely one place allof fundamental element need carry effective bank supervision - remarkableachievement right. equally important, view, document also balance desire toset high standard supervisory practice pragmatic recognition country inthe stage financial market development. a such, core principle document ofparticular importance emerge market country establish clear set standardsagainst country’s current approach progress measured.i convince flexibility embody core principle - combine valuablesubstantive guidance principle provide - right model achieve sustainableimprovements financial market practices. the fact number international group havein recent year also develop “core principles” respective area expertise confirm methe value basel committee’s approach.today, approximately 120 country endorse core principles. just last month, i please toreport, basel committee, cooperation imf world bank, produce follow-upreport call core principle methodology. this follow-up report initiate response torequests number country additional guidance interpret implement thecore principles. what methodology report develop specific criterion evaluate thecore principle implement individual countries. the new methodology provide twosets criterion core principle. one set criterion focus issue deem essential theminimum implementation core principles; focus issue deem torepresent “best practice.” bi review 126/19992the imf world bank currently use new methodology ass bank sector inindividual countries. look ahead, basel committee plan bring together time next yearsupervisors emerge market country representative imf world bank todiscuss lesson learn initiative. the project meet part basel committee’songoing commitment ensure core principle remain point relevant bankingsupervisors worldwide.i must stress, however, important effort implement core principle continue tobe job individual countries. without support back national authority tofollow implementation principles, broad effort simply cannot beeffective.in connection, basel committee long recognize need effective train andseminars participant global bank supervision community. over year sponsorednumerous program beneficial allow supervisor different country toshare experience exchange idea improve practices. build longstandingcommitment outreach efforts, basel committee, together bank internationalsettlements, jointly establish financial stability institute 1998. the institute currentlyconducts leadership train target supervisor emerge market countries, facilitate technicalassistance individual countries, provide train regional basis.the basel committee also play key role financial stability forum establish theg7 finance minister governor early 1999. through forum, basel committee ableto share experience implement core principle organization haveembarked similar initiatives, iosco, international organization securitiescommissions. more broadly, financial stability forum coordinate effort improveawareness accessibility train regulator supervisor worldwide.turning basel committee’s effort promote improvement risk management, let mecomment first work relate highly leverage institutions. a i discuss othersettings, ltcm episode proper supervisory response fundamentally twothings: leverage good judgment. leverage important part financial system ofthe time play positive role enhance market liquidity ensure efficient allocationof resources. at times, however, financial institution go far extend credit. this wherethe critical role good judgment come in. let’s forget banker’s two importantdecisions business far business relationship pursued.one fundamental aim supervisor ensure bank use right tool makethese difficult decisions. these tool include risk measurement method risk managementtechniques appropriate nature risk involved.following ltcm episode, basel committee put together work group focus therelationship bank highly leverage institutions. our goal provide framework foridentifying broad issue raise ltcm, policy response supervisors, key riskmanagement challenge industry go forward.under leadership jan brockmeijer netherlands bank, basel committee’s report wascompleted january 1999. it reveal number deficiency banks’ risk management practices.in particular, observe imbalance among key element credit risk managementprocess, strong emphasis role collateral protect credit loss. this undueemphasis cause many bank neglect critical element effective risk management,including in-depth credit analysis counterparties, effective exposure measurement, use ofstress testing.to make sound credit decisions, bank need obtain sufficient information borrower toprovide comprehensive timely picture risk profile credit quality. this true regardlessof whether extension credit occur via loan counterparty trade relationship. yetthe basel committee’s report find bank obtain sufficient financial information assessthe type extent risk assume large, highly leverage institutions. in particular, bank 3bis review 126/1999obtain information need ass leverage, risk concentration particular markets, theliquidity risk profile individual institutions.the basel committee report also conclude bank develop effective measure ofpotential future exposure, refer possibility credit exposure change time asmarket condition fluctuate. the ability measure potential future exposure critical dealingwith large trade counterparties highly leverage institutions, especially volatile marketconditions. unfortunately, method measure potential future exposure keep pace withthe growth composition trade activity.the basel committee’s report also show bank must develop approach good account forcredit risk distress market conditions. a key lesson ltcm episode credit andmarket risk cannot see completely distinct, liable interact reinforce otherunder highly stressful conditions. the use rigorous stress testing, therefore, could givenbanks good warn type exposure faced.together january 1999 report, basel committee issue sound practice documentsetting forth guidance bank supervisor topics. for example, sound practicescalled upon bank to:• establish clear policy govern involvement highly leverage institutions;• adopt credit standard address specific risk associate institutions;• establish meaningful measure potential future exposure well credit limitsincorporating result stress testing; and• monitor exposure frequent basis.i please report basel committee’s recommendation highly leverage institutionshave reinforce recommendation subsequent efforts, include report thepresident’s work group financial market counterparty risk management policygroup. there clearly widespread agreement among private sector officialcommunity step firm need take address weakness risk managementidentified ltcm episode. the key remain issue strength private sector’s resolveto implement measures.for part, supervisory community carefully monitor effort bank follow throughwith implementation improve risk management practice highly leverage institutions. thebasel committee intend prepare follow-up report progress bank making. in view,the degree improvement signal whether industry truly absorb lesson theltcm episode.the approach basel committee take respect highly leverage institution mirror itsefforts address risk management issues. a primary aim committee describe andpromote prudent risk assessment control practice banks. by set current state theart key areas, committee provide bank supervisor worldwide tool tomeasure industry progress toward goal effective risk management.in recent years, basel committee engage sustain effort develop publicize soundpractices variety areas. these include paper topic as:• management credit risk;• loan account credit risk disclosure;• guidance manage foreign exchange settlement risk;• enhance corporate governance bank organizations;• framework internal control system bank organizations;• operational risk management; bi review 126/19994• risk management electronic bank electronic money activities.for anyone interested, detail report available website bis.before turn capital adequacy issues, i would like highlight key element two recentpapers sound practice. in july, basel committee issue comment report themanagement credit risk. this particularly important topic since major cause seriousbanking problem continue directly relate poor practice regard credit risk management.a key focus report need bank organization develop overall businessstrategy credit risk incorporate tolerance risk level profitability bankexpects achieve incur various credit risks. a strategic approach credit risk provide acoherent framework practice area credit-granting criteria, credit limits, credit riskmonitoring.the basel committee issue second paper september address subject corporategovernance bank organizations. a know, corporate governance, especially role ofboards directors, particular interest country. more intense competition, rapid change,and increase complexity many business activity mean responsible independent oversightby board director play crucial role ensure firm’s business strategy soundand leadership effective.i convince need strong corporate governance equally great emerge marketcountries, bank financial institution face comparable pressures. the baselcommittee’s september paper outline several element critical sound corporategovernance process. these element include installation qualify board director withclearly define responsibilities, importance oversight director senior management, theneed clear line management responsibility accountability, effective use internaland external auditors.both july september report provide flavor basel committee’s effort promotestronger risk management practice within global bank community. although effortssometimes receive le public attention work capital adequacy, i believe playsignificant role help set standard prudent risk-taking use bank theirsupervisors worldwide.lastly, i would like update basel committee’s major effort revise 1988 capitalaccord. in june, committee release consultative paper lay vision new capitaladequacy framework. our propose timetable seek comment supervisor industryparticipants 31 march 2000 publish, hopefully late next year, comprehensiveset proposal responsive comment industry input received.during comment period, committee subgroup work hard refine furtherdevelop number proposal put forth consultative document. the committee alsocontinues consult actively bank industry representative organization holdingseminars, invite presentation work meetings, conduct survey various topics.the consultative paper represent evolution basel committee’s approach capitaladequacy. in addition establish minimum capital requirements, paper place increasedemphasis supervisory review capital adequacy role market discipline. we refer tothese element “three pillars” propose capital adequacy framework, togetherpromote safety soundness. this evolution committee’s think capital follow frommuch recent work risk management survey conduct banks’ disclosurepractices.in view, three pillar ass capital adequacy mutually reinforcing, address thechallenge align capital relative risk bank organization somewhat differently. thecommittee’s belief combine approach three pillars, good achieve ouroverall objective ensure adequate capital cushion across bank system sametime recognize encourage prudent risk management. 5bis review 126/1999let highlight briefly three pillar provide perspective key challengesthat committee face relation each. the first pillar minimum capitalrequirements. the 1988 capital accord allow supervisor g10 country first time touse common yardstick measure capital adequacy banks. while 1988 accord amilestone achievement, simple risk-weighting scheme difficulty incorporate innovationsin way bank today manage mitigate credit risks.more fundamentally, 1988 accord adequately differentiate among degree credit risk.as result, bank incentive take high risk exposure within accord’sbroad risk categories. bank also tend engage transaction low capital requirementswithout reduce economic risk. the effect development erode significanceof basel ratio indicator financial institution’s capital adequacy, particularly thelarge, internationally active institution original target accord.to address shortcoming 1988 accord, basel committee propose two primaryapproaches: (1) standardize approach tie risk weight external credit assessment ascredit ratings, (2) internal ratings-based approach would begin map internal riskratings standardize risk weight might eventually evolve something close fulluse credit risk models. each approach treat trade-off simplicity versus accuracysomewhat differently thus one likely relevant bank different level ofsophistication.importantly, propose approach attempt introduce great risk sensitivity minimumcapital standards. in view, essential move forward fashion order enhancethe responsiveness require capital risk address unfortunate incentive problem thathave evolve 1988 accord.because committee’s desire produce capital adequacy framework great sensitivityto risk, observer may note inevitably introduce dynamic element standards.that is, capital requirement loan trouble borrower tend increase pointwhen trouble become apparent. i see important positive aspect outcome.i would argue global financial system need become good prepare address potentialcredit problem pre-emptively, problem time grow minor disturbance intomajor disruptions. implement capital standard responsive dynamic riskcould help move u direction away mindset wait long address problems.in particular, committee interest hear view think issues.the second pillar propose new capital adequacy framework supervisoryreview capital, critical complement minimum capital requirements. the consultative papercalls supervisor ensure bank sound internal process place ass theadequacy capital base thorough evaluation risk capital structure, thus movingthe accord beyond ratio-driven minimum capital standard comprehensive approach forassessing capital adequacy. in general, supervisor expect continue expect bank holdmore regulatory minimum amount capital. in propose supervisory review capital,the basel committee intend foster active dialogue bank supervisor withrespect actual level capital bank choose hold.i want stress, however, propose approach assess capital adequacy way intendsto replace judgment expertise bank management. nor approach mean shiftultimate responsibility adequacy bank capital supervisors. on contrary, i believethat manager one complete understand risk institutionsface must primary responsibility oversee risks.the task supervisor framework evaluate well bank assess owncapital need relative risks, include whether bank appropriately address therelationship different type risks. to end, basel committee currently developingguidance help supervisor evaluate internal capital assessment conduct banks. in event bi review 126/19996that bank’s internal capital adequacy process lacking, supervisor must knowledge andauthority take corrective action.there doubt implement supervisory review capital require considerableinsight flexibility part supervisor tailor effort theunique risk profile particular institutions. at time, approach allow supervisorsto draw cross-institutional knowledge ass strength weakness bank’srisk management capital allocation process relative peers.the g10 supervisor recognize obvious implication approach supervisoryresources. in order keep pace industry innovation, clear step ourtraining consider effective way make use limit resources. the baselcommittee also recognize importance issue non-g10 country workingtoward provide train type support need allow country theirsupervisors move direction.the third element propose new capital adequacy framework market discipline- another critical component safe stable financial system. more extensive disclosureand great dependence market force complement improvement risk management, bankingsupervision, minimum capital standards. of course, add value minimumcapital standards, improve disclosure must go beyond simple report minimum capital ratios.when bank disclose timely accurate information capital structure risk exposures,market participant good evaluate risk act accordingly. the disclosure timely accurateinformation, turn, incentive bank ensure market perceive aseffectively manage risks, also adequately capitalized. market reaction thepublic disclosure bank also play important signal role supervisor assess theadequacy bank’s capital.a reason encourage disclosure beyond report regulatory capital ratio theseratios become primary focal point investor industry analysts. the result thatbank management incentive focus solely improvement ratios, even whenthe ratio fully reflective risks. more comprehensive disclosure could lessen incentive.with consideration mind, basel committee seek design expand set ofdisclosure guidelines, take account proprietary information need banks. i believe thatfuller disclosure bank take u long way towards effective market discipline. we alsoencourage bank include full disclosure information specific risk profile.the timeliness quality disclosure important. the frequency disclosure reflectthe nature risk involved. moreover, transaction shift risk become common andcomplex, disclose associate residual exposure take add importance. such reporting, inturn, require bank place appropriate system identify measure risk sothat risk document marketplace. finally, move toward improveddisclosure, must keep mind goal useful reliable information - simply largevolume information. more necessarily better.in area disclosure, i also mention colleague, peter fisher, chair amultidisciplinary work group enhance disclosure, comprise representative thebanking, securities, insurance industry pilot effort formulate set public disclosureguidelines make sense increasingly integrate financial market. the work group willassess extent pilot data provide meaningful basis compare riskmanagement practice well level type risk across institution across countries.the basel committee support pilot approach. it limit burden bank industry atthe time make clear private sector key role play improve disclosure andenhancing market discipline. firm participate program opportunity shape theexercise influence interpretation results. through participation, firm besending clear signal willingness improve market discipline. 7bis review 126/1999these easy time banks. a regulator, i cannot help underscore essentialrole bank play global marketplace. by intermediate credit saver investor andproviding liquidity financial sector, bank essential link well-functioning economies.thus, capital level risk management policy without question important, nottake precedence responsibility banker serve purpose schumpeterian world ofcreative destruction. this fundamental responsibility involve use credit judgment. bythis i mean banker must lend excess time seem good lend little whentimes appear difficult. this ongoing obligation bank le approachthe century date change.with roughly six week go year-end, i believe critical bank

equilibrium-seeking adjustment progressively leftto force competition. exchange rate allow float, domestic financial intermediationwas liberalise capital account gradually opened. some label new

fundamental change wayfinancial activity organised, way monitor managed, way loss gainsare shared? many indeed call “new financial architecture”, though concrete proposal ofwhat new construction could look like yet formulated.my view basic component today’s system financial intermediation continue bethe reliable efficient ones, rough edge market-led system need bettermonitoring case repair. in words, architecture design financial system– basic rule decentralised, market-led decision-making – remain sound, internal wiringand plumb – precondition ensure market indeed operate efficiently stably– may require upgrading.* * * bi review 135/19992which area vulnerability failure cause market display excessive instability,and lead severe costs? and financial market particularly prone failures? atthe risk simplification, i propose focus three source market failure beenparticularly prevalent recent episode worldwide financial turbulence. they are: first, lackof relevant information asymmetric distribution across market participants; second, thepresence externality give rise undesired unintended market outcomes; third,the difficulty establish adequate infrastructure financial markets. note i make hardlyany distinction domestic international financial system. with globalisation offinance lift controls, two basically merged. a i argue, however, dealingwith market failure international level may much complex domestic setting.information financial activitylet start first area financial market vulnerability, information deficits. financialactivity particularly information-intensive. more sector perhaps, financial marketshave cope high degree uncertainty. this reflection fact nature finance isan intertemporal activity: service counterparties commit financial contractsare deliver sometimes long period circumstance change unforeseenways. moreover, finance become increasingly borderless, exposure grow tocounterparties market much le familiar home. the global intertemporalcharacter financial intermediation therefore put premium ensure clear andcomprehensive information disposal market participants.yet information often readily available. it may expensive, may distributedunevenly across market players. not participant will bear cost collect thenecessary information, particular easy others free-ride efforts. decisionsmay take basis less-than-complete information set risk may run amore inform environment would avoided.another frequent occurrence financial market participant unequal access toinformation. borrower typically several step ahead lender know probability ofsuccess project gain loss might shared. lender may unaware thefunds provide flow risky investments, waste le productive activities. toprotect information deficit, lender may ration finance even withdrawfrom participation altogether. in economic literature, problems, know adverse selectionand moral hazard, show negative impact financial market efficiency,especially cross-border setting.the recent asian crisis good example lend borrow decision bias bylack uneven distribution information. few investor realise extent massive flow offoreign-currency fund several asian economy divert activity little noprospects generate foreign-currency resources, or, economy turn down, yield anyreturns all. confidence official reserve data greatly shake become clear extentforeign exchange asset mortgage massive short forward position thailand byplacements overseas branch korean bank face problem meet foreigncurrency obligations.moral hazard also problem. give believe liability implicitlyguaranteed, korean chaebol embark largely unfettered investment spree. at time,domestic bank foreign investor south east asian country take unwarranted comfort fromgovernments’ commitment maintain fix exchange rates, expectation theinternational community would help safeguard private investment. these expectation prolong theperiod excessive capital inflow; thus render costly eventual reversal. 3bis review 135/1999market outcomes: sum part somewhat less?a second problem financial market sum individual decision areperfectly rational may always lead stable equilibrium socially desirable outcome. asudden loss confidence one particular bank sometimes lead indiscriminate run theentire bank system. similarly, evidence isolate foreign debt service problem bemagnified generalise “rush exits”. the crisis follow almost always seem topush domestic currency beyond equilibrium level damage social consequences. in bothof examples, attempt individual agent protect financial position generateexternalities precipitate consequence action design guard.many example similar problem aggregation financial market given. herdinstinct often identify one main factor behind surge capital flow theirsudden shift recent years. such herd behaviour may rational context occurs.fear performance run deep highly competitive financial industry induce portfoliomanagers mirror other’s investment strategy stick close benchmarks. often, too,attitudes lenient towards wrong good company, make awrong bet own. whether understandable not, herd behaviour nevertheless add anunacceptable degree volatility financial markets.in east asian case, herd instinct undoubtedly play part over-lending precede thecrisis. western bank fund manager fearful leave behind rush participate inthe asian “miracle”. then, sentiment turned, investor want reduce exposure asrapidly possible, fear currency bank collapse would threaten investments.with limit reserve borrow possibilities, country region saw currenciesovershoot. the succeed interaction bank currency problem impose cost allproportion original policy mistakes.at times, aggregation problem part self-inflicted. if short-term lend enjoy morefavourable risk weight longer-term credit exposures, case 1988 basel capitalaccord, creditor may want shorten maturity cross-border claim even further, inparticular economic climate become gloomy. however, lend become shortterm, vulnerability borrower rise substantially intrinsic liquidity liabilitiesmay much low maturity exposure keep medium term.in sum, instead help build stable equilibrium diversify set profit-maximisingagents, market mechanism may time fall prey one-dimensional view become one-sided,producing highly volatile outcome price overshooting. it would much say thecause asian crisis, may contribute unexpected virulence.inadequate infrastructurea final major area fragility financial market insufficiently develop infrastructure.financial market infrastructure cover broad range elements. it include modern contract lawand efficient law enforcement procedures. it deal account rule valuation standards, withprudential regulations, effective supervision appropriate disclosure requirements. it also cover thecreation well-functioning payment settlement system design safety net provisions.in many respects, infrastructure public good. it benefit all, market participant willnot able will supply fund fully. it therefore leave relevant authority toensure necessary infrastructure put place way find share cost amongparticipants.financial history replete case crisis cause poor supervision, inadequatelegal framework deficient payment settlement arrangements. this show complex andexpensive well-performing infrastructure is, particular international context. it also explainswhy often public good undersupplied market often remain immature. bi review 135/19994moreover, financial infrastructure may propagate bias incentive excessively riskybehaviour long design faulty price inappropriate.in case country affect recent crises, financial supervisory arrangement almostalways deficient respects. account convention apply insufficiently rigorously, andfinancial institution allow become excessively exposed. in countries, bankruptcyarrangements virtually non-existent, existed, often subject todelays. hence process recover value impair financial claim (an essential part awell-functioning financial system) burden major uncertainties. in russia, cost theabsence reliable contract law law enforcement evident.* * *it time move problem solutions. but first, let briefly recapitulate theargument far. open market continue appropriate efficient arrangement forallocating resource bring adjustment. from perspective, real alternativeto present basis financial intermediation, domestic cross-border. however, firmbelief blind u inherent vulnerability characterise financial markets. itherefore propose explore minute approach may take find solution tothese market failures.informationfirst, ensure market participant adequate access information need? animpressive list recent initiative area put together. the effort move threedistinct directions. some aim improve participants’ appreciation risk themacroeconomic environment. the imf’s special data dissemination standard example thiskind initiative, effort improve consistency international reserve data. others havesought increase understand potential implication build-up market positionsand price trend particular markets; example effort timely internationalbanking statistic provide bis. still others aim sharpen awareness thecreditworthiness counterparties; work private sector group lay rigorouscounterparty credit guideline improve disclosure practice area.but rather elaborate specific initiatives, i would prefer make two general observations.first, unlike financial news service would like u believe, main issue confront u isnot much generate information, good information. relevant, clear comprehensiveinformation, efficient disclosure dissemination, call for. from point ofview authorities, challenge task transmit correct guidance financialmarkets participants. blanket guarantee time-inconsistent commitment exchange ratetargets often part message authority convey financialmarkets. the recent crisis much emerge world show counterproductive, notdisastrous, market guidance be.my second point need consider carefully right information is, wealso put place appropriate incentive participant use disclose it. awareness ofthis incentive issue find propose revision basel capital accord. for instance,sovereign risk weight expect low country reach internationallyaccepted standard respect data dissemination. more importantly perhaps, new accord’scall comprehensive qualitative supervision, rather mechanical check ofquantitative ratios, likely induce bank focus risk management monitoringcapabilities, thus ability incorporate information relevant risk control.there little doubt mind encouragement credit culture require lendingofficers realistically appraise credit market risk portfolio investment decisionswill generate many incentive use disclose market-relevant information. 5bis review 135/1999externalitiesi come second area market vulnerability, undesired externality aggregationproblems. this may even complex. in theory course possible consider radicalsolution force financial institution reduce leverage increase degree theirliquidity much run become highly unlikely. similarly, one could consider pushingcountries hold sufficiently large stock international reserve would reduce thelikelihood currency run minimum. however, cost measure term efficiencyand economic growth would large. the financial sector make contribution widereconomy add liquidity intersectoral claims. this depend leverage. to reduce itscapacity would involve economic costs. we therefore need strike balance betweenefficiency stability objectives.much constructive, i feel, would improve understand financial regulationcan give rise aggregation issue generate externalities. great awareness link betweenindividual behaviour market outcome contribute good rule appropriate marketguidance. a result, incidence capital flow volatility would less. more discriminate andcritical behaviour part market participant may promoted, bunch particulartypes lend investment might easily avoided.no doubt, many controversial issue deal area, solution seemadequate one point view may questionable look different angle. forinstance, pressure maintain prescribe capital ratio sometimes argue undesirablemacroeconomic consequences. the need satisfy capital requirement aggravate economicrecessions, bank feel force curtail lend beyond underlie economic situationwould warrant. similarly, comfortable capital cushion economic boom may induce bank toengage lend sprees. to extent pro-cyclical effects, capital requirement maygenerate externality aggregation effects.some accordingly argue institution allow run capital recessionsand rebuild period great economic buoyancy. whatever appeal argument,however, ignore fact capital cushion need precisely economic condition areadverse confidence shaky. a policy appear beneficial macroeconomy could thenbe harmful soundness financial system and, channel, put economic stabilityin even great danger. if, therefore, banks’ capital serve purpose cushion bad times, itfollows bank hold additional capital reserve time good.infrastructure public goodsfinally, could do ensure sufficient public good supply efficientfunctioning financial markets? government generally accept responsibility thedomestic level provide main element infrastructure financial market need.unfortunately, domestic initiative cannot simply transpose internationallevel. insolvency arrangement may effective within national boundaries, remain complicated,even non-existent, insolvency involve sovereign state relate cross-border claims.supervision remain hand national regulatory authorities, create difficulty ofcommunication coordination financial activity become global. the problem furthercompounded fact different type financial institution often supervise separately andaccording differentiate rules. to certain extent, “core principles” effective supervisiondeveloped various regulatory bodies, address

“basel process” hasbecome widely accepted. and increasingly, propagation appropriate incentive cometo dominate committee recommendations.however, financial stability preserve committee institutions. it combinedresponsibility central banks, supervisory agencies, ministry finance, international organisationsand standard-setting body create within various segment financial market.the g7, report han

high levelsof resource utilization. the risk high inflation environment two dimensions.first, risk current utilization rate already high inflation willgradually increase time. second, risk growth output abovetrend go forward, imply utilization rate rise already high level,compounding risk high inflation.some apparently believe speed limits, utilization rate beso elevate threaten high inflation. the reality above-trend growth raisesutilization rate and, point, excessively high utilization rate result high inflation.but also true threshold utilization rate trend growth change, currentthreshold level utilization growth rate uncertain, inflation affectedby factor excess demand, policy infallible. such uncertainty factof life forecaster policymakers. just forecaster stop forecast becausethe job difficult, policymakers adjust uncertainty paralyze it.bis review 48/1997 - 2 -the recent federal reserve policy action clearly preemptive one. thismeans undertake response economy inflation thetime policy change, response economy inflation project tobe future, absent policy change. such policy action necessarily involve forecast andsuch forecast typically ground model relate growth, unemployment, wagechange inflation, among variables. so let specific causal structure ofthe model underpin judgment respect appropriate monetary policy action.i strong unapologetic proponent phillips curve nairuconcept. fundamentally, nairu framework involve two principles. first, proximatesource increase inflation excess demand labor and/or product markets. in labormarket, excess demand gap often express model difference theprevailing unemployment rate nairu, non-accelerating inflation rate unemployment.second, excess demand gap open up, inflation increase indefinitely progressivelyuntil excess demand gap closed, stabilize high level cumulativeexcess supply gap reverse process.there third principle i subscribe to, which, though fundamental asthe first two, also play role forecast judgment appropriate postureof monetary policy today. utilization rate labor market play special role inflationprocess. that is, inflation often initially transmit labor market excess demand wagechange price change. this third principle may especially important today because,in view, important disparity balance supply demand inthe labor product markets, least hint excess demand labor markets, verylittle suggest imbalance product markets.it important understand phillips curve model inflationdynamics, model determine equilibrium inflation rate. for reason, phillipscurve paradigm inconsistent view inflation is, long run,exclusively monetary phenomenon. perhaps easy way appreciate recall thatthe long-run phillips curve widely understand vertical. in words, nairu isconsistent constant rate inflation, include zero. the phillips curve thereforecannot determine inflation long run consistent constant rate ofinflation. what determine rate inflation long run? the rate money growth,of course, though one need assume stable money demand function get stablerelationship money growth inflation. what phillips curve explain, notthe long-run level inflation? the answer explain dynamic inflationprocess, economy evolve one inflation rate another, example, responseto increase rate money growth. the dynamic change inflation operate throughexcess demand labor and/or product markets. thus phillips curve indicate that, theunemployment rate maintain level nairu, inflation increase time,progressively indefinitely.the initial source increase inflation anything producesexcess demand labor output markets. it could also supply shock, i ignoringthis possibility i focus exclusively implication current strength aggregatedemand. under interest rate operate procedure, increase aggregate demand whichincreases output, utilization rates, and, ultimately, inflation generate increase themoney supply support high nominal income. money pin aregime, passively adjust change nominal income.bis review 48/1997 - 3 -despite sharpness force phillips curve/nairu model, bedifficult implement practice. still, relationship stable tool themacroeconomists’ tool kit past 20 years; will depend itwere likely successful forecaster inflation, record speak thisscore. nevertheless, combination 7-year low unemployment rate 30-yearlow inflation surprise use framework. the challenge understandwhy fortunate. but, also note monetary policy respondedappropriately surprise. that is, monetary policy careful tie rigidly aconstant estimate nairu. instead, view, monetary policymakers have, effect,implicitly adjust estimate nairu reflect incoming data; might viewedas follow procedure like time-varying parameter estimation technique apply robertgordon others.in short run, many factors, addition aggregate demand, thatinfluence inflation – include change minimum wage, shock food oil pricesunrelated balance aggregate demand supply u.s., change theexchange rate, exogenous effect health care costs, etc. some havebeen effectively incorporate phillips curve model, factor havegenerally outside model. one explanation good expect performance ofcore inflation relation unemployment rate focuses, example, series favorablesupply shock – include slowdown benefit cost decline import price – thattraditionally incorporate estimate phillips curves.in addition, even adjust factors, nairu constant, butcan change time. for example, evidence suggest change thedemographic composition labor force affect nairu also likely governmentprograms, include unemployment compensation welfare, also affect nairu. further, theevidence suggest that, even account demographics, government programs, supplyshocks, nairu may edge low last couple years. the consensus theprofession nairu may decline around 6 percent decade end theearly 1990s perhaps 5½ percent today, though believe decline even larger,while others believe appearance decline due temporary factor nairuwill ultimately settle back close early estimate. clearly, one challenge ofmonetary policy set policy context uncertainty precise value nairu.the second element analytical framework link output growth tothe level excess demand. the economy capacity grow time limit thesum trend rate growth labor force trend rate growth laborproductivity. while component change time labor force productivitygrowth subject cyclical variation well secular shift, historical recordsuggests trend rate output growth change slowly time. currently, trendrate labor force growth near 1 percent per year (based population growth leaving,for later, interpretation recent rise participation rate) trend rate ofproductivity growth slightly 1 percent per year (though usualuncertainty estimate, part due conflict indication measure productivityderived product income side national accounts), result trend outputgrowth 2-2½ percent range. a key relationship actual growth output equalstrend growth, utilization rate constant; actual growth exceed trend growth,utilization rate increase.bis review 48/1997 - 4 -now put causal structure inflation process together, connectingup growth, unemployment rates, inflation. growth trend raise utilization rates.rising labor force utilization rate raise wage change relative productivity growth. anincrease wage change relative productivity growth raise labor cost increase inlabor cost result high price inflation.quiz time! doe growth cause inflation? not exactly. certainly, high trendgrowth raise inflation. indeed, unexpected increase trend productivity hencetrend growth output would likely result low inflation while; rate moneygrowth hold constant, permanent increase productivity growth would result apermanent decline inflation. although above-trend growth output directly causeinflation, extent result increase utilization rates, point, sustainedabove-trend growth result high inflation.there are, sure, number uncertainty causal structure arehighly relevant current circumstances. first, worry whether mayhave change trend growth, example, due rise trend productivity growth achange trend labor force participation. if trend growth increased, whether becauseof high labor force growth high productivity growth, would observe rapidgrowth raise utilization rates. second, worry whether nairu may bedeclining or, least, may low currently estimated. if nairu low expect,then current unemployment rate le likely associate excess demand thelabor market therefore pose le risk high inflation.checks balance essential here. for example, important confirmthat utilization rate rise continue long tighten policy damp presumedabove-trend growth. this prevent persistent mistake face unexpected shift inthe economy’s trend rate growth. monetary policy usually avoid mistake focus onutilization rate growth. the second check confirm that, follow decline theunemployment rate, wage change move higher, consistent increase excess demand inthe labor market. in addition, take account temporary force relate to, forexample, minimum wage, health care costs, exchange rates. finally, makeallowances dynamic process, include tendency inertia result avery small initial increase inflation excess demand develop tendency ofthe initial rise wage excess productivity temper decline profit marginsbefore lead high prices.the outlook contextnow let summarize key feature recent macroeconomic performance.the economy advance 3.1 percent rate 1996, include 3.8 percent rate fourthquarter. growth first quarter appear least strong pace thefourth quarter, economy seem solid momentum current quarter. in short,the economy appear grow unsustainable above-trend rate.by way, prevail trend rate growth historically low anddisappointing? yes. would desirable, therefore, raise trend rate growth? yes. canmonetary policy accomplish worthy task? no. can congress administration,through judicious combination deficit reduction save investment incentives, raisetrend growth (at least while)? yes. be opportunity monetary policy tobis review 48/1997 - 5 -contribute steady growth? yes. first, extent policy avoid cyclical rise ininflation, avoid subsequent monetary policy response limit reverse risein inflation; result avoid boom avoid bust. discipline monetary policytherefore encourage steady growth, emphasis steady. second, extent thatprice stability encourage save investment efficient allocation resources, asis widely believed, monetary policy promote price stability one bestencourages steady growth, emphasis growth. now back economicoutlook.the unemployment rate fluctuate rather narrow band lastyear half recently inch low equal cyclical 7-year low. isuspect unemployment rate nairu, though steady rise wage changeover last year suggest unemployment rate may somewhat nairufor while.another aside. don’t i like wage growth? yes, extent real;that is, extent yield increase inflation turn prevent thepurchasing power wage advancing. shouldn’t worker share bounty healthyeconomy? of course. but worker best share bounty sustainable growthand pay high price unsustainable growth cyclical instability would surelyfollow excess. let add one complication. it possible wage increase fasterthan productivity allow rebound real wages, example, real wage hadearlier expansion advance rate le allow trend productivity. in case, arebound real wage could unwind temporary increase profit margin couldtherefore accommodate without increase inflation.wage change, i noted, rising. the 12-month increase

quarter eci bearswatching sign rise wage change possibly bottom recentslowing pace increase benefit costs.core inflation remain cyclical 30-year low, 12-month increasein core cpi 2.5 percent. note, however, correctly measure change inflation, acomparison core inflation last couple year adjust account themethodological revision cpi. to date, bls revision low inflation cumulativelyby around

combination temporary coincidence longer-lastingstructural changes.first, labor force grow twice rapidly trend rate basedon population growth. it demand call forth supply. part explanation isa rebound

trendover next several year may well augment upward trend participation rates.the net result output growth must slow recent level prevent increase inutilization rates. second, increase job insecurity appear moderate pace wagechange, relative would expect current level labor force utilization. it isimportant note effect inflation increase worker insecurity may beonly temporary. even high worker

preemptive policy: why now?during period july 1996 february 1997, monetary policyremained unchanged operate asymmetric directive. utilization rate high --high enough suggest risk rise inflation, wage gain -- trend higher,remained modest core inflation remain downward trend, perhaps due decliningimport price slow rise health care costs. the anxiety associate highutilization rate clearly temper excellent performance core inflation, result ina posture “watchful waiting.” the federal reserve remain alert period, onthe sidelines. while growth time well estimate trend, various factor madeit reasonable expect slowdown growth toward trend immediately ahead, suggest thatutilization rate would likely remain within recent ranges.the asymmetric directive reflect view risk environment wereasymmetric, great risk inflation would rise response prevailinghigh utilization rate (and still high utilization rate growth continue above-trend growth)than economy would slow trend growth. the asymmetric policy posture was,therefore, reflection concern forecast might wrong wrong itwas likely underestimate inflation go forward.what different march, compare early period? not utilizationrates. they still within narrow range prevail period, thoughadmittedly close bottom range. not core inflation. if anything, core inflation waslower. no, difference, perspective, data utilization rates,

wind enforcingpro-cyclical movement short-term interest rates. the fourth reflect one way whichmonetary policy might take account uncertainty outlook.a taylor rule perspectivei note number previous speech i view taylor rule ashighlighting couple important requirement prudent monetary policy. first, taylorrule link federal reserve policy long-run inflation target thus ensure that, longrun, policy force actual inflation rate converge long-run target. the taylor rulethus impose powerful nominal anchor monetary policy. second, taylor rule generallyimposes pro-cyclical pattern real short-term interest rates, monetary policy leansagainst cyclical wind thereby stabilize economy, much way thatautomatic stabilizer fiscal institutions, via cyclical swing government budget deficits,damp business cycles.nevertheless, traditional specification taylor rule provide ajustification tighten march, relative early decision hold policy unchanged.according taylor rule, federal fund rate adjust time change inutilization rate (the gap actual potential output unemployment rateand nairu) change inflation. because utilization rate increase (at least hadnot increase outside range last year) core inflation actually low marchcompared earlier, taylor rule dictate tightening. the rule suggest,however, monetary policy would tighten time forecast risingutilization rate high inflation prove correct. but dictate immediate action.there however alternative specification taylor rule doesmotivate immediate tightening. i call forward look version taylor rule. thetraditional specification forward look degree relation inflation, set thefunds rate relation utilization rate (an advance warn future increase ininflation) inflation. but forward-looking specification i mind replace actualbis review

question. doe follow taylor rule base anuncertain forecast outperform taylor rule base actual data? that, course, depend onthe quality forecasts. this interest question, one deserve scrutiny. but isreally question: should policy preemptive reactive? a forecaster, i aminclined believe forward-looking approach therefore preemptive policy. but irecognize work do subject.an is-lm perspective lean windi would interpret recent strength demand, perspective is-lmmodel, shift be curve. such interpretation cyclical swing is, course, thekeynesian tradition: output demand determine short run (reflecting price stickiness)and swing output dominate autonomous change aggregate demand.how monetary policy respond cyclical swing demand? shouldmonetary policy hold short-term interest rate constant, effect impose horizontal lmcurve? in order so, would, general, respond rightward shift be curveby add reserve facilitate fast money growth, prevent interest rate fromrising. this might appropriate early expansion, unemployment rate ishigh inflation declining, not, judgment, prudent mature stage anexpansion, surely imprudent utilization rate increase toward orbeyond capacity levels. the alternative maintain upward slop lm curve. in thestatic model, case money supply fixed; allow trend growth andinflation, would equivalent hold money growth constant, assume stable moneydemand function. in case, shift be curve would raise interest rate be curvemoved along upward slop lm curve. this example monetary policy “leaningagainst wind.” the result pro-cyclical movement interest rate increase stability ofthe economy much way cyclical swing federal budget deficit.some might argue, however, even short-term interest rate rise,long-term interest rates, equity prices, dollar may change

so-called “bondmarket vigilantes,” undoubtedly audience afternoon.when long-term rate rise response cyclical strengthening, reflects, inlarge part, expectation high short-term interest rates. specifically, reflect expectationsabout monetary policy. while monetary policy cannot slave bond market, thecyclical state economy suggest desirability pro-cyclical response interest rates,the federal

short-term interest rate would resultfrom follow money growth rule. for extend period, money demand beeninsufficiently stable allow monetary aggregate play constructive role monetarypolicy process. more recently, relationship m2 determinant stabilized,but period stable relationship relatively brief coincide arelatively stable economy. a result, yet much inclination place increase weighton m2

(perhapsthe good way define unchanged policy), would effect cyclicalstrengthening economy (an increase nominal income growth)? the answer, course, isthat short-term interest rate would rise. this course another way tell is-lmstory. what would take prevent interest rate rising? the answer increase inthe rate money growth would require accommodate fast pace nominal incomegrowth. but would prudent? i think not.policy interest rate regime: importance flexibilitynote money growth strategy, possible operate without achange policy (no change money growth) nevertheless impose important degreeof stability economy result pro-cyclical movement interest rates. aconstant rate money supply always optimal, keep lot ofserious trouble could otherwise get into. the federal reserve virtually centralbanks operate policy regime set short-term interest rate -- case, thefederal fund rate. for variety reasons, generally view best choice ofoperating strategy. in type regime, however, dangerous

especiallywhen economy near potential. indeed, major monetary policy mistake pasthave originate overly aggressive movement interest rates, failure policyto adjust interest rate timely fashion change cyclical developments.bis review 48/1997 - 10 -tightening maximin solutioni note outset uncertainty outlook. a result, possible tomake policy mistakes. another way interpret policy action attempt

with introduction euro, integration europe gain new quality bothfrom economic political perspective.launching euro - historic evolutionthe “short past euro” precede long period preparation discussion closermonetary integration. let briefly recall major milestone process. first step towards theintroduction single european currency take almost 30 year ago six initialmember state european economic community propose plan creation aneconomic monetary union. this culminate so-called werner report name afterthe former prime minister luxembourg chair group charge study.following collapse bretton-woods system quasi-fixed exchange rates, u dollaras “gold-convertible” anchor currency, country europe switch flexible exchange rates.for many observers, world-wide retreat fix exchange rate

float within band 2.25% belowbilaterally fix central exchange rates. symmetric intervention obligation aim stabilise bi review 133/19992exchange rate member within band part exchange rate mechanism. in case ofmisalignments, possibility realign parity foreseen.in june 1988, chairmanship jacques delors, former president europeancommission, report regard introduction single currency initiated. this reportconcluded recommendation achieve economic monetary union three-stageprocess. the first stage already start 1 july 1990 focus mainly increasedco-ordination economic monetary policy member states. with view toincreasing integration financial capital market stage, exist barrier weregradually removed. in november 1993 maastricht treaty ratified, thereby create legalfoundations supranational monetary union europe.in 1994, 5 year ago, second stage emu began. at time european monetaryinstitute (emi) create precursor european central bank. it task carry outpreparatory work contribute realisation condition necessary transition tothe third stage emu. in phase, member state increase effort conduct disciplinedeconomic monetary policy fulfil necessary condition adoption singlecurrency, particular so-called convergence criterion concern inflation rates, budgetdeficits, government debt ratios, exchange rate interest rates. member state expect tomake effort ensure smooth transition stage three. for example, toamend national law make compatible treaty make ncbs fullyindependent start stage three. in 1995, three new member state - austria, finland andsweden - join european union.finally, 1 january 1999, european union reach new unprecedented stage economicintegration. with launch euro, 11 country give monetary sovereignty andtransferred task conduct single monetary policy supranational institution. thishistoric step mark culmination long period successful preparatory work, magnitude ofwhich hardly overestimated. a result efforts, introduction euro take placein environment price stability observer would predict year ago.the start monetary union prove formidable undertaking. in spite huge operationalchallenges, changeover take place without incident affect orderly function themonetary system, least result successful preparatory work emi and, sincemid-1998, eurosystem.the introduction euro important implication international capital markets. this wasdue fact number currency replace euro play importantinternational role past. it also hold true euro become currency aneconomic area roughly equal unite state term economic size external trade,and world’s second large capital market.first experience gain eurolet describe first experience gain euro ecb’s point view. theeurosystem’s monetary policy strategy provide financial market public importantframework basis monetary policy decision explain consistent andpredictable manner. in view, monetary policy strategy pass first test successfully.at core strategy clear primary objective price stability. a clear definition theoverriding objective maintain price stability euro area contribute stabilise marketexpectations. the eurosystem define price stability year-on-year increase 2% theharmonised index consumer price (hicp) euro area. the eurosystem aim maintainprice stability line definition medium term.let briefly outline eurosystem’s monetary policy strategy help ecb governingcouncil fulfil task maintain price stability euro area. the first pillar monetarypolicy strategy assign prominent role money. there broad consensus inflation actually 3bis review 133/1999a monetary phenomenon medium term. therefore, monetary development provide importantbenchmark monetary policy aim safeguard price stability. to emphasise theprominent role assign money, govern council ecb announce quantitativereference value monetary growth term broad definition m3 october 1998. the firstreference value set rate 4½% per annum. at last meeting, govern councilreviewed reference value conclude assumption underlie derivation remainvalid. thus, reason change reference value 4½% m3 growth per annum. thegoverning council decide henceforth review reference value regular annual basis,with next review take place december 2000.i like emphasise connection reference value annual target. first, isbased medium-term assumption serf guide development medium term.second, ecb commit ensure m3 grow line reference value aparticular point time.the ecb focus solely money. the problem look money that, theshort run, relationship money price distort portfolio shift andinstitutional factors. short-term development money therefore need analyse carefully.against background, govern council ecb always communicate publicthat cannot react mechanically deviation actual monetary growth thereference value. in sense, concept underlie eurosystem’s strategy different frommonetary target traditional sense. monetary policy always react informationavailable view maintain price stability medium term. for reason, theeurosystem’s strategy base two pillars.the second pillar monetary policy strategy broadly base assessment outlook forprice development euro area whole. this assessment encompass wide range ofindicator variables, include macroeconomic projection produce within outside theeurosystem.within stability-oriented monetary policy strategy, exchange rate important variable forthe eurosystem one determinant outlook price stability. if exchange ratedevelopments pose threat price stability euro area, threat take accounttogether information price development reveal indicators.the choose strategy forward-looking nature orient medium term. it sufficientlyflexible allow appropriate response specific shocks. the monetary policy strategy eschewsmechanistic reaction single indicator, include monetary aggregate inflation forecasts.there suggestion ecb abandon two-pillar strategy time. iclearly share view. i convince strategy work well continueto appropriate euro area. there broad consensus uncertainty surround thestart stage three unprecedented european history continue require special attention.the eurosystem framework truly reflect complexity economy. it also allowsaccount take possibility regime shift start stage three could impacton stability important economic relationships. it would impossible eurosystem toconduct successful monetary policy mechanistically follow simple rule whereby policydecisions closely link single indicator.the ecb commit open, transparent accountable. for reason, ecbprovides general public detail background information monetary policy thegoverning council’s interest rate decisions. for example, immediately first governingcouncil meet month, introductory statement president released. this practice issimilar publication minutes, advantage present council’s assessment ofthe economic situation almost instantaneously meeting. each month ecb publish abulletin provide additional background information explain current assessment monetary,financial economic development detail. once year, ecb release annualreport activity european community institutions. bi review 133/19994as mention earlier, govern council regularly carry independent assessment themonetary, economic financial condition prevail euro area whole. thesedeliberations govern council provide basis monetary policy decision-making theeuro area level. let briefly recall important factor influence interest ratedecisions take eurosystem course 1999.in first month year, increase indication negative effect thecrises asia russia growth employment euro area might serious hadinitially expected. with apparent cyclical slowdown economic growth euro area, thebalance risk future price stability move significantly downside. this assessment alsoreflected downward revision inflation forecast international organisations. at thatpoint time, growth slightly reference value, several indication - alsoagainst background historically low interest rate - m3 temporarily distortedupwards early 1999 result changeover stage three emu. thus, early 1999, didnot appear m3 growth reveal upside risk price stability, particular non-monetaryindicators point increase downside risk future price developments. all all, forward-looking medium-term orientation single monetary policy make necessary thegoverning council take action. with view maintain price stability euro area themedium term, govern council ecb thus decide begin april 1999 toreduce interest rate main refinance operation 50 basis point 2.5%.at around begin summer, appear prospect economic growth euroarea improved. during summer month pillar eurosystem’s strategy concur inindicating balance risk future price stability gradually move towards theupside. monetary growth increase considerably course 1999. the three-month averagestood 5.9% period july september 1999. even data adjust thesomewhat specific movement m3 january february, could see annualised figurefor m3 growth march september 6.1%. all take place significantly differenteconomic environment april. for reason, govern council react. on4 november govern council decide raise interest rate main refinancingoperations 50 basis point 3.0%.the increase interest rate point time aim help counter upward pressureon future price contribute keep inflation expectation safely 2%. the interestrate decision thus take forward-looking manner focus maintain price stabilityand would thus contribute sustain non-inflationary economic growth euro area themedium term.i think comparison two decision change ecb interest rate april andnovember instructive. it show react mechanistically individual indicators, butalways interpret movement signal indicator evident pillar inconjunction other. a see, reasonable approach rely asimple indicator, give live complex world.after discuss strategy rationale behind monetary policy decision thebackground strategy, i like say word eurosystem’s monetary policyinstruments. the single monetary policy eurosystem base operational framework thatis common euro area countries. this operational framework turn effectiveinstrument steer money market interest rate limit fluctuation overnight rates.the eurosystem influence money market condition mainly regular open marketoperations. the weekly main refinance operation provide bank system short-termliquidity interest rate instrument give indication eurosystem’s monetarypolicy stance. in addition, “standing facilities” effectively limit fluctuation money marketinterest rate. finally, average provision minimum reserve system contributedtowards smooth daily fluctuation money market.the success operational framework demonstrate fact eurosystem notyet find necessary recourse fine-tune operations. moreover, since january, active 5bis review 133/1999market participant typically quickly eliminate cross-country interest rate differential themoney market arbitrage. overall, development short-term money market interest rateshave thus far stable money market rate have, average, close interestrates ecb provide liquidity weekly main refinance operations.for efficient conduct monetary policy operations, essential support powerfulpayment system. since establishment, target become one large real-time grosssettlement payment system world. the system increase use real-time grosssettlement eu roughly 20% since introduction euro. accord available datafor september, system process approximately 3.5 million domestic cross-borderpayments, total value eur 20 trillion, per month. moreover, cross-borderpayments represent 40% value target payments.the long future eurolet try look ahead towards “long future euro” challenge ecband eurosystem address. the experience short past euro justifiesexpectations gradually see advance towards broaden economic andmonetary integration future. with establishment eurosystem, solid foundation astable currency laid. maintain price stability euro area help gain credibility theconfidence european citizen stability euro. this also contribute increaseduse euro outside euro area.expectations long future euro seem warrant light increase confidence ofeuropean citizen international investor single currency. the international interest theeuro indeed evident, example, international new bond issues. accord informationfrom bank

growth euro area. in forthcoming year - i confident - see thecurrent recovery extend become period price stability contribute prolongedemployment output growth. however, important condition meet achieve asubstantial sustain increase output growth low unemployment. first all, decisivemeasures address structural problem europe, particular area labour markets, areneeded. second, consolidation public finances, make considerable progress thepast years, continue and, necessary, strengthened.sound fiscal policy make monetary policy’s task maintain price stability easier. in context,the stability growth pact crucial element. it aim encourage pursuit disciplinedand sustainable fiscal policy participate eu member state prospective members.in doing, contribute significantly establishment favourable condition sustainedeconomic growth high employment medium term.in come years, success emu demand clear distribution responsibilitiesbetween eurosystem government authorities, set maastricht treaty, followed.this clear separation responsibility efficient, transparent conducive accountability. ittakes account substantial empirical evidence practical experience fact monetarypolicy make best possible contribution achievement goal focus theprimary objective maintain price stability medium term, thereby enhance thecredibility monetary economic policy europe.the high degree implicit co-ordination economic policy single monetary policywhich achieve policy-makers focus individually override objective supportsthe view eurosystem engage ex ante policy co-ordination could falselyinterpreted negotiation policy-makers monetary policy stance. by agree tocondition monetary policy action certain fiscal structural policy wage developments, suchco-ordination might hind eurosystem’s prompt response threat price stability arise fromother sources. if market expectation reflect belief effectiveness success bi review 133/19996single monetary policy would constrain kind co-ordination, could threaten themaintenance price stability.in course next decade, also see accession number new member state tothe european union possibly euro area. it clear envisage extension eu toinclude new member and, ultimately, enlargement euro area represent important challengesboth member state eurosystem. any enlargement euro area subject topolitical decisions, automatic. i like recall maastricht treaty provide aclear transparent procedure, lay condition eu member state wish tojoin euro area. the basic prerequisite convergence criterion must comply with. thisshould ensure member state provide evidence sufficient economic convergence euroarea adopt euro.the introduction euro country require compliance convergencecriteria, also preparatory work various areas. for example, new member ensurethat harmonise framework single monetary policy operate fully place prior totheir participation euro area. statistic need adaptation comply theeurosystem’s report

mainfactors may influence international dimension euro future. finally, i turn tothe consequences, term advantage possible challenges, great use euro byinternational agent might bring about, euro area international context. asa general remark, must emphasise eurosystem take neutral stance regard theinternational role currency. this mean neither hind actively promote theinternational use euro, leave future development determine primarily marketforces.1.the euro international currencyby definition, currency acquire international dimension extent private economicagents official institution use

acurrency characterise international used, first, price good service ininternational trade commodity markets; second, vehicle commercial financialtransactions trade good currency foreign exchange

therefore provide scope euro grow rapidly asan international currency.on basis available information, turn euro today second widelyused currency internationally, u dollar ahead japanese yen. this part areflection significant international role already play past euro’s legacycurrencies, primarily deutsche mark. it also relate economic financial weight theeuro area world economy. euro area gdp amount almost eur5,800 billion, representingover 15% world gdp difference price level across country take account. theunited states, gdp eur7,600 billion, account close 21% world gdp. the gdpof japan, third large economy world, much smaller, eur3,400 billion share of7% world gdp. the size financial market reflect relative positions, even though – inthis case – fact must bear mind structure financial

new member state comply requirement setout acquis communautaire relate economic monetary union (emu). therefore,following accession eu, new member state also – second step – becomemembers erm ii – third step, maastricht convergence criterion met– adopt euro. the accession process entail that, time, exchange rate monetarypolicies candidate country become increasingly focus euro implication itsinternational use. bi review 131/19994a second factor relate euro area financial market. the acceptance use euro byforeign agent large extent determine efficiency integration euro areamoney capital markets. in connection, progress made, especially regard thosesectors financial system use primary channel operation andtransmission single monetary policy. thus, thank target system, money market arenow close perfect integration, give spread amongst euro area country extremely lowand reflect different credit stand counterparties rather market segmentation.in clearing, settlement trade system

financial sector ifthis subject sudden substantial drain resources, especially institution withpossibly mismatch positions.the internationalisation euro may also pose challenge eurosystem’s monetary policy. agreater external use euro might affect information content monetary aggregate andother indicators, part so-called second pillar eurosystem’s monetary policystrategy. concern first point,

rationalisation enough; new development equally important.at first, thing still go well. the 1960s fantastic decade growth. in time, however,the strategy prove defensive stagnation set 1970s. there

framework enshrine treaty.there doubt concern override importance attach primary objective pricestability. by safeguard price stability euro area medium term, single monetarypolicy suppose make best possible last contribution achievement othercommunity objectives, high employment sustainable non-inflationary growth.among central banker economists, predominant view long-run trade-off betweeninflation output growth exist. attempt use monetary policy increase realeconomic activity sustainable level will, long run, simply lead high inflation andwill foster economic growth. moreover, theoretical consideration well empirical evidenceover several decade suggest high rate inflation clearly unhelpful - indeed detrimental - togrowth employment long term. a large number economic argument point benefitsof price stability economic growth employment prospects. stable price eliminate reduceeconomic cost arise inflation result uncertainty outcome ofinvestment decisions, distortionary effect tax system, rise risk premia long-terminterest rate reduce allocative efficiency relative price mechanism market systems.monetary policy must take account fact horizon decision economic agent israther long-term nature. by guarantee price stability, monetary policy provide anchor foreconomic decision-making. this clearly support efficient function price mechanism,which conducive best allocation scarce resources. price stability hence mean ofpromoting sustainable economic growth creation employment, improvingproductivity level live standards.this discussion also shed light certainly great economic challenge face euroarea present, namely, need reduce current unacceptably high level unemployment ineurope. in light problem, realise even ideal situation monetarypolicy successful maintain price stability, contribution monetary policy reducingunemployment europe limit one. many empirical study show high bi review 128/19992unemployment rate mostly consequence structural rigidity within european labour andgoods markets. the european unemployment rate has, indeed, high even rise thebusiness cycle past decade. only structural reforms, preferably comprehensive nature, cantherefore tackle underlie impediment employment growth.when decide monetary policy, eurosystem must acknowledge capability limitationsof monetary policy imply general economic principle structure euro areaeconomy. this also reflect formulation eurosystem’s monetary policy strategy,which design maintain price stability euro area.the strategy announce govern council 13 october 1998. it design fulfil twoimportant functions. first, structure monetary policy-making process governingcouncil ecb provide information analysis require take appropriatemonetary policy decisions. second, strategy ensure policy decisions, include economicrationale based, present clear, coherent consistent way thepublic. by provide stable framework make explain monetary policy decisions, thestrategy bolster credibility effectiveness single monetary policy.in design monetary policy strategy eurosystem, govern council also torespect number practical issue difficulty arise uncertainty createdby so-called shift regime associate transition monetary union. where werepreviously 11 open, generally small economies, one large, relatively close singlecurrency area. the challenge imply transformation landscape monetary policy areprofound.for time being, relatively little know detail transmission monetary policymeasures real economy euro area. it possible shift regime change thebehaviour economic agents, hence, structure function euro area economy.consequently, together expert ncbs, ecb embark intensive programmeof analysis research issues.one obvious impediment respect limit availability harmonise statistical data theeuro area. this natural, give euro area exist single currency area beforejanuary 1999. in last couple year european monetary institute (emi) statisticaloffice european commission (eurostat) together central bank statistical officesin eu member state put lot effort develop harmonise statistical concept formonetary economic indicators. by begin year, stage iii emu started, lothad already achieve respect. the quality availability statistic euro area hasincreased significantly past quarters, particularly area money bank andbalance-of-payments statistics, also across wide range economic statistics. this process ofimproving quality availability statistical data cover euro area continue.against background i described, govern council select monetary policystrategy embody new distinct approach, reflect unique circumstance andinstitutional environment face eurosystem. the design clear, credible effectivemonetary policy strategy eurosystem require appreciation environment theeurosystem operates. this environment impose certain constraint monetary policy euroarea, eurosystem’s strategy must acknowledge respect. the stability-oriented monetarypolicy strategy therefore avoid “mechanistic” monetary policy response indicator orforecasts. a environment monetary policy complex interpretation indicatorsdifficult, simple rule monetary policy.the eurosystem’s strategy consist three main element announce year ago.first, primary objective monetary policy quantify publication definitionof price stability, serf guide inflation expectation eurosystemcan hold accountable. price stability hence define annual increase 2% theharmonised index consumer price (hicp) euro area. this definition illustrate bothinflation deflation regard incompatible price stability. it also announce 3bis review 128/1999that price stability maintain medium term, impart forward-looking orientationto strategy whole.second, order maintain price stability accord definition, money accord prominentrole. monetary development closely monitor analysed, particular relation aquantitative reference value monetary growth. in december 1998, reference value set anannual growth rate 4½% broad monetary aggregate m3. in line medium-termorientation strategy, reference value base assumption concern themedium-term development prices, real gdp velocity circulation.third, parallel monetary analysis, broadly base assessment outlook pricedevelopments euro area undertaken. this assessment encompass wide range ofindicator variables, include macroeconomic projection produce within outside theeurosystem.using information obtain analysis, govern council ecb come adecision level short-term interest rate best serve maintenance price stabilityin euro area whole future.the decision 4 november raise ecb interest rate demonstrate forward-lookingcharacter strategy. owe lag transmission mechanism, monetary policy couldnot wait inflation stand 2% above. the eurosystem raise interest rate order counterthe upward trend balance risk future price stability, observe thesummer. this policy move help stabilise inflation expectation safely 2%. bymaintaining favourable outlook price stability, decision also contribute make economicgrowth euro area sustainable medium term. in fact, monetary policy react toolate emerge inflationary pressure run risk force take much strong measure ata late stage. eventually, policy would exacerbate cyclical fluctuation without enhancingthe long-term potential economy.let turn number criticism eurosystem’s monetary policy beenraised since strategy first announced. i like address concern theremaining part presentation.some observer argue strategy “asymmetric” eurosystem moreconcerned inflation deflation. these assertion often base perceivedlack precise low bind definition price stability, contrast clear upperbound 2%. critic point asymmetry impose drag overall performance ofthe euro area economy risks, certain circumstances, trigger deflationary spiral.let put bluntly: i share view. first, i like draw attention fact thatthe use word “increases” definition set floor zero low bound. the absenceof specific numerical value low bind reflects, first place, uncertainty faceconcerning existence magnitude so-called measurement bias hicp. this biasarises mainly change spend pattern quality improvement good servicesthat include basket use define specific price index. such bias cannot always fullycorrected construction price indices. the measurement bias typically cause cpi overstatethe “true” rate inflation. although hicp base concept put considerable emphasison reduce eliminate measurement bias, overstatement cannot excluded. second, weneed keep mind fact ceiling 2% leaf sufficient room small increase theprice index, thereby minimise risk fall price index. i like emphasise factthat govern council ecb already demonstrate would deem neither inflationnor deflation euro area consistent maintenance price stability. the two interestrate decision take basis eurosystem’s strategy april november clearexamples commitment.another criticism strategy sometimes voice concern “prominent role money”,reflected, part, announcement reference value m3 growth. here differentiatebetween two camps. some critic argue m3 growth influence monetary policy bi review 128/19994decisions govern council. however, others criticise eurosystem base monetarypolicy decision almost exclusively deviation m3 growth reference value, areconvinced money best indicator monetary policy.i reject criticism camps. let explain why. first, i disagree view moneyshould play small role ecb’s strategy. empirical study show m3 euroarea stable relationship price level medium term. such stable relationshipwith price development find indicator variable place time.moreover, evidence monetary aggregate contain useful information futuremacroeconomic developments. this reason monetary growth analyse closely bythe govern council.at time, i think ecb focus uniquely money. the problem withdoing short run, relationship money price distort byportfolio shift institutional factors. short-term development money therefore need beanalysed carefully. against background, govern council ecb alwayscommunicated public cannot react mechanically deviation actualmonetary growth reference value. let also point govern council has, fromthe beginning, reject idea hold accountable fail keep monetary growthclose reference value every year. in sense, concept eurosystem’s strategy isdifferent monetary target traditional sense. for reason, eurosystem’s strategy isbased two pillars. monetary policy always react information available viewto maintain price stability medium term.this also answer critic argue ecb disregard high money growth whenit low interest rate april, put much emphasis high money growth raise interestrates november. in fact, situation base decision pillar strategy andalso assess prevail monetary development time light informationavailable. when cut interest rate 8 april, two month monetary data 1999 wereavailable. at point time, three-month move average m3 stand 5.1%. let recallthat always emphasise “substantial prolong deviation reference valueunder normal circumstance signal risk price stability medium term”. however, datashowed m3 growth slightly reference value notevidence yet prolong deviation. by contrast, several indication m3 wastemporarily distort upwards early-1999 result changeover stage three economicand monetary union (emu), also background historically low long-term rates. thus, atthat point time difficult see whether m3 growth early-1999 would reveal upside risk toprice stability. at time, information second pillar strategy show cleardownside risk future price development april. the situation different november. here itwas clear monetary growth increase considerably course 1999. the three-monthaverage stand 5.9% period july september 1999. even correct data inaccordance somewhat specific movement m3 january february, could see thatthe annualised figure m3 growth march september 6.1%. all take place asignificantly different economic environment compare april. i think comparisonbetween two decision change ecb interest rate april november useful. it showsthat react mechanistically individual indicators, always interpret movement andsignals indicator evident pillar conjunction other. a see,this reasonable approach rely simple indicator, give live acomplex world.there another line argument monetary policy eurosystem focus tooclosely cyclical developments. this would inconsistent public commitment amedium-term orientation. this body opinion often refer explanation deliver theoccasion interest rate cut april 1999. these critic claim move mainly intendedto support employment growth prospect short term. 5bis review 128/1999this is, view, unfortunate miscomprehension fact i shall try clear thispoint. our monetary policy had, continue have, forward-looking medium-termorientation, maintenance price stability euro area focus. a mentioned, inapril 1999 thorough review monetary, financial economic development revealeddownward risk price stability stem basically cyclical slowdown occur theaftermath financial turmoil emerge market mid-1998. both forward-looking andmedium-term orientation single monetary policy make necessary govern council totake action: interest rate cut.the focus primary objective price stability drive decision april exclude thefact many case policy action require maintain price stability help stabilise realactivity short term. risk price stability often relate cyclical development andthese policy aim therefore complementary rather conflicting. at time, i liketo point must give false impression short-term impact necessarymonetary policy action real activity always favourable. situation may occur, examplewhen wage settlement jeopardise price stability, short-term trade-off betweenadverse development real activity, one hand, deviation price stability theother. in case, important override priority maintain price stability absolutelyclear. any ambiguity point would simply endanger credibility, therefore theeffectiveness monetary policy.last least, i like make remark regard frequently expressedcriticism, namely eurosystem secretive institution meet requiredstandards transparency clarity.key feature ecb’s communication policy monthly bulletin monthly pressconferences give president ecb myself. the press conference usually directlyfollow first govern council meet month. during press conferences, thepresident make introductory statement summarise govern council’s discussion andconclusions answer question journalists. a statement agree beforehand, insubstance, govern council members, similar central bank callminutes. i convince inform public unite position govern councilis valuable establish credibility reduce uncertainty market publishingdetails govern council discussion, would naturally difficult ass notpresent meeting.moreover, press conference provide prompt information even-handed way, offer theopportunity immediate two-way communication. a far i aware, central bankregularly communicate public prompt open manner immediately itsmonetary policy meetings. we convince contribute transparency thus givesimportant clear guidance.these press conference tangible expression eurosystem’s commitment open,transparent accountable conduct monetary policy. obviously, journalists, financialmarkets public still learn new monetary policy strategy euro area and,over time, eurosystem improve communication.in respect, also argue release sufficient information analysis.more specifically criticism express effect eurosystem currently notpublishing inflation forecasts. may i remind you, therefore, inflation forecast keyelement strategy? an inflation forecast one many piece information weuse. it importance exaggerated. our quantitative definition price stability aninflation target way central banks, target inflationforecast. in view, single forecast sufficient statistic give complexity economicrelationships exist uncertainty future. we live complex environmentin policy decision cannot simply relate even one information variable. there isalso risk chase tail. in fact, monetary policy always aim respect thedefinition price stability. the advantage publish forecast would would make one bi review 128/19996more piece information, play role decision-making process, transparent. that beingsaid, govern council reconsider issue macroeconometric model aredeemed sufficiently reliable. this may still take time. let conclude say thati happy contribute project historical dimension colleague ecband ncbs belong eurosystem. monetary union successful start andthe monetary policy strategy eurosystem, basis govern council hastaken continue take monetary policy decisions, contribute success. at thesame time, recognise fact monetary policy alone cannot tackle economicchallenges face euro area. in particular, cannot reduce euro area’s unacceptably high levelof structural unemployment. the main contribution single monetary policy make thewelfare people euro area maintenance price stability medium term.although monetary policy-making europe easy task, i confident experience ofthe first 11 month eurosystem determine assume task well equip todo so. 1bis review 128/1999mr duisenberg explain think european central bankon issue whether market need guidanceintroductory statement deliver dr willem f duisenberg, president european central bank,at frankfurt european bank congress session i: “do market need guidance?” hold infrankfurt 19 november 1999.* * *thank much give opportunity explain think european centralbank (ecb) important issue.let start summarise answer question: yes, market need guidance theecb. this guidance mainly focus reduce uncertainty markets. this require aboveall clear credible commitment part ecb sound economic analysis. thus,guidance give credible monetary policy strategy transparent ongoingassessment euro area development line strategy. reduce uncertainty also imply thatin communication pretend know really do. obviously, ourknowledge future course euro area economy always subject uncertainty andlimitations. it thus go without say guidance certainly cannot give way theecb indicate path future ecb interest rate far advance.this lead directly second part question. (“is particular mode guidancepreferable?”) how ecb give guidance markets? at heart answer thisquestion eurosystem’s monetary policy strategy.indeed, strategy design make objective monetary policy aim atachieving objective credible, transparent comprehensible, thus make decisionspredictable. however, let clear. be predictable way imply central bankintends follow market. on contrary, causality run direction. marketsshould position anticipate monetary policy decision base credible strategy thecentral bank. this exclude certain monetary policy decision may sometimes surprise themarkets, aim.as argue article recent issue ecb monthly bulletin, stability-orientedmonetary policy contribute reduce certain risk premia interest rate thereby increasingthe efficiency allocation capital, thus enhance overall welfare. this show veryimportant give clear guidance market conduct credible monetary policy focus onprice stability.as know, strategy select govern council ecb comprise quantitativedefinition price stability, contribute anchor long-term inflation expectations, aswell two so-called pillars. the quantification primary objective, combine thetransparency credibility eurosystem, provide important guidance financialmarkets. our monetary policy contribute keep inflation expectation safely 2%.this ensure high degree likelihood future price development consistent thedefinition price stability.the govern council base monetary policy discussion information reveal twopillars strategy.the first pillar prominent role money, imply monetary credit development arethoroughly analyse information content regard future price development risk toprice stability. the prominent role money signal announcement quantitativereference value monetary growth term m3. i like emphasise m3 reference bi review 128/19992value monetary target. monetary policy react mechanistically deviation m3growth reference value.the second pillar broadly base assessment outlook price developments. this comprisesanalysis many individual non-monetary indicators. we also look macroeconomic forecastsprepared externally internally.i know analyst market would prefer eurosystem simple strategy,where interest rate change quasi-automatically response (or even single) observablevariable(s). some would prefer monetary targeting, others favour inflation targeting.i acknowledge strategy complex. however, recognise live rathercomplex economic world additional uncertainty relate changeover thenew regime monetary union euro area. it would therefore impossible eurosystemto conduct successful policy mechanistically follow simple rule whereby policy decision areclosely link indicator variable central inflation projection particular point intime.two key feature ecb’s communication public market monthlybulletins monthly press conferences. the latter usually directly follow first governingcouncil meet month. by mean publicly conduct detail review currentmonetary, financial economic development euro area background thestrategy. this aim illustrate application strategy practice, guide marketexpectations. although strategy complex, generally try end overall assessmentwhich summarise opinion council future situation.the press conference provide prompt information even-handed way, offer theopportunity immediate two-way communication. a far i aware, central bankregularly communicate public prompt open manner immediately itsmonetary policy meetings. we convince contribute reduce uncertainty themarkets thus give important clear guidance, also regard short-term policy moves.in respect, one recognise ecb face completely new environment. we notonly decide single monetary policy new monetary area comprise 11 independentcountries, also communicate public market 11 countries, usedto quite different monetary policy strategy communication policy past.this diversity monetary history, communication culture across euro area obviouslyconstitutes great challenge communicate comprehensible transparent way withthe general public markets.obviously, journalists, financial market public still process learn newstrategy monetary policy euro area and, time, eurosystem improve itscommunication.let finally address third part question: (“does information necessarily meanbetter guidance?”). i convince mislead assume information alwaysmeans good policy clear guidance market. what important informationgiven public clearly structure understandable, avoid add uncertainty providedin even-handed way. the eurosystem’s monetary policy strategy design aimsin mind.moreover, indicated, high degree credibility monetary policy make substantialcontribution reduce uncertainty market thus key aim policy. what clearlymore important amount information give communication policy, part thestrategy, consistent structure internal decision-making process. i assure thatthis indeed case.during monthly press conferences, i make introductory statement summarise governingcouncil’s discussion conclusion answer question journalists. a statementis agreed, substance, council member beforehand, similar others call 3bis review 128/1999minutes. i convince that, purpose establish credibility reduce uncertainty inthe market, inform public agree position part govern council issuperior publish detail council discussion naturally difficult ass thosewho present meeting. moreover, mentioned, pretend know thanwe do. it thus important try give guidance ecb sure. i muchagree give much information always helpful. i convince eurosystemalready provide timely,

beyond reasonable relation underlie economic conditions. the path theamerican stock exchange recent year demonstrate low inflation often sufficient toensure restrain development asset prices. that see something dilemma isunderstandable.does imply monetary policy fact use hitherto actively anddirectly counter sizeable price increase asset markets? there obvious answer thatquestion dominant opinion present answer no. this centralbanks would find difficult identify true bubble development asset price judge 5bis review 127/1999appropriate measure correctly. still, i would like leave door ajar. situation may arise arehard foresee today monetary policy may need play part. if risk new financialcrisis mount distant future, central bank could stand idly by.the type monetary policy regime

theemployment ratio also increase markedly then.difficult balance strike monetary policythe riksbank must strike balance monetary policy growth dampen unnecessarilybut neither become strong inflation accelerates. the difficulty lie foresee growth ofdemand relation inflation period couple year come. a change interestrates actually effect considerable time lag, full impact felt couple ofyears. if change interest rate come late, consequence unnecessarily largefluctuations growth. however, experience show inflation allow rise, greatrisk high inflation persist inflation expectation drive up. theconsequence riksbank’s “wait-and-see” standpoint would therefore imperil credibilitythat laboriously achieve - even lose it. considerably great restraint would berequired inflation stop time. in order avoid this, riksbank may need bi review 126/19992increase interest rate register inflation show sign increasing, confront uswith educational problem. if riksbank wish safeguard growth, employment, high useof resource respects, monetary policy must adapt time.low inflation expectationshowever, said, also important increase interest rate early thus dampengrowth unnecessarily. a difficult question riksbank must take position assessmentof inflationary pressure whether relationship growth inflation change and, inthis case, factor contribute this. a concept frequently discuss duringthe past year “new economy”. discussion centre american economy,which seem end long period high growth. it seem usa skippedan entire business cycle. this fact also case 1980s. there upswing 1982 andno downturn occur 1990-91. however, speculate whether new technology, itinvestments computerisation change transaction costs, management function andproduction process growth productivity durably increase growth hastherefore able increase quickly without lead increase inflationary pressure.the hypothesis new economy also put forward regard swedisheconomy. however, first ten years’ time researcher long many series ofdata analyse make certain pronouncement actual situation.however, talk term radical change swedish economy one important respectwith regard relationship growth inflation. inflation expectation sweden seem tohave stabilise around 2%, indicate target price stability attain highcredibility. during 1970s 1980s, inflation amount 8% average. this mean thatwage-earners, landlords, central local government entrepreneur calculate quitedifferent nominal price increase previously budget price decisions.however, expression new economy rather indicate return conditionsthat exist first two decade second world war.developments korean war clearly show importance low inflation expectation forthe development economy. the well-based expectation make possible restore economyto rate inflation 3% year inflation rise 20%. the return low inflation couldtake place without dramatic restraint without mass unemployment.comparisons year’s wage development wage development previous highinflation period strong illustration high nominal wage increase positivecorrelation real wage increases. while real wage increase year expect total around3%, wage earner periodically experience reduction real wage period 1975 1995and average slightly half per cent increase. this despite fact nominal wageincreases remain 3% year much 8% comparison period. neithershould forget deterioration live standard swedish wage earner swedishpeople experience compare european country years.sustainable improvement productivity due “new economy”?developments it biotechnology take place quickly sweden. telecommunicationsand pharmaceutical hi-tech products, grow quickly swedish exports. export oftelecommunications product double since 1995 pharmaceutical rise by80%. the economy undergo restructure towards area release u extentfrom cyclical dependence pulp, paper, steel engineer product traditionalexport goods.however, important perhaps development industry per se. although aregrowing rapidly, still rather small size. the compute consultancy industry doubledduring 1990s still account 80,000 employees, around 2% employment. the 3bis review 126/1999sector “radio, tv telecommunication products” approximately size. industry awhole recover 18% gdp 1993 22% 1998.no, really important effect new technology probably take place outside hi-tech andknowledge-intensive industries. personal computers, mobile telephones, internet, it canincrease productivity within broad segment swedish economy. this affect trade, officework, distribution storage, manufacture production, etc. however, important realise thatthe introduction new technology take place limit period probably onlyduring year high growth productivity achieved. when change new arecarried out, probable productivity develop slowly again. this compare withthe introduction electricity spread electrical motor industry, spread theinternal combustion motor.i would thus like warn view future rose-tinted spectacles. it true thatproductivity growth high 1994 precede 20-year period. an increase from1.4% 1.9% registered. however, first period include three long downturn thesecond broad upswing. we cannot therefore know whether cyclical difference thatunderlie figure whether technological change also contribute sustainable strongerproductivity growth.to sum up, i would like point good relationship growth andinflation due inflationary expectation push down. it possible technicaldevelopments also produce productivity improvement mean growth period canincrease quickly previously without inflationary pressure created. one factor ihave touch date effect increase competition internationalisation anddomestic deregulation. this process contribute good relationship inflationand

resource economy, growth increase use ofresources inflationary pressure naturally also increase. a said, riksbank mustassess strong growth demand permit without inflationary pressure

causefor concern. wage increase around 3% per year. i doubt parties’ insightinto importance inflation target wage formation general. however, agreementsexpire next year.it prove autumn majority

world live yet fully globally integratedsystem often portray economics textbooks. for example, price tradable good differentcountries express common currency sometimes converge common level rather slowly.asset portfolio tend exhibit “home bias”. thus, fundamental sense, seem is“some” globalisation yet come.nevertheless, internationalisation markets, particular financial sphere, hasimportant implication conduct monetary policy. a international investor thoroughlyscrutinise national economic political developments, unexpected change latter, “news”,may trigger reassessment investment strategies. these, turn, may impact exchangerates, interest rate equity prices.against background understandable sometimes appear convenient blame“foreign speculators” “global markets” kind economic social problems, rather thanacknowledge domestic origin, quite often lie unsustainable domestic economic policiesand lack structural reforms.of course, go without say financial market also wrong

however, difficult policymakers identify misalignmentsand bubbles. moreover, increase volatility financial market perceive misalignment areoften relate fundamental factor policy failure lack

myattention two issue i think relevant discussion today. first, i shall mention someof consequence globalisation policymakers. second, i shall explain i think themonetary policy strategy european

these policy willcontribute improve growth employment perspectives. i believe idea nation gainfrom trade, include trade financial assets. notwithstanding possible imperfection financialmarkets, international capital market integration yield considerable benefits. however, isimportant stress without flexible markets, country able reap full benefit ofglobalisation.moreover, well know national authority would face impossible task toreconcile sustain manner objective call “inconsistent quartet” of(1) free trade, (2) complete international capital mobility, (3) fix manage exchange rate and(4) national autonomy conduct monetary policy. the painful lesson learn fromeconomic theory historical experience four element cannot coexist, leastone give way. this course one major insight robert

monetary policy strategy eurosystem globalisationas regard conduct monetary policy, i think that, particular large economies, central bankscontinue able influence liquidity condition thus short-term market rates, irrespective ofglobalisation whether currency widely use outside currency area concern (ornational boundaries). monetary policy - adjust short-term interest rate - therefore still ina position maintain price stability respective currency area. however, globalisationsometimes make difficult analyse monetary policy indicator investigate andunderstand transmission mechanism.an important precondition monetary policy remain effective globalise environment ahigh degree credibility. if international market lose confidence monetary policy, negativeimplications domestic economy likely significantly large environment ofclosely integrate financial markets. the need remain credible globalise market require aconvincing strategy transparent communication. in respect eurosystem well equipped,as i shall explain.the primary objective eurosystem maintain price stability euro area, lay inthe treaty establish european community. to fulfil mandate, govern council theeuropean

inflation undershoot target seem havecome end. the cpi inflation rate would already bite 2% apart government’sreduction health rebate levy. although result due rise oil prices,measures underlie core inflation, largely unaffected oil prices, also rise byabout 2% past 12 months.thus, period australian economy experience contractionary impact abroadand outlook weak growth sub-2% inflation well truly

(that virtually guarantee move large.) it though policy tooperate set maximum “go”, heavy braking.this read framework share. there range set instrumentbetween “maximum go” “heavy braking”. most time would expect interest rate inthat range.let u look two possible situation monetary policy changed:• the first inflation target. in situation, inflation targetingframework would say raise interest rate set would bring inflation back tothe target. but high rate do job, gradually reduce 3bis review 125/1999more normal levels. this happen 1996. we wait forecast hadinflation fall 2% start ease.• the second inflation target. in case, framework would call asetting interest rate would, time, allow inflation go back target.once clear set do job, framework call replacedby one likely keep inflation target. the framework envisage thepolicy set maintain something go wrong.now may object smack fine tuning. i agree delude ourselvesthat economy precisely control inflation stay within close band, evenwhen external shocks. the point remains, however, even process precise,the instrument remain extreme set long needed. a theoutlook changes, balance risk shifts, appropriate also policy instrument toshift.3.what gst?some people convince argument i use above. some still cannotunderstand would tighten unless economy overheating, assume mustbe hide agenda. others keen play old game try find political dimension tomonetary policy. this lead people say real reason fear inflationaryeffects gst, diplomatic say so. i sorry disappoint proponent ofthis view, case.• if gst reason tighten monetary policy, fed, bank ofengland ecb tighten monetary policy? i aware forthcomingintroduction gst countries.• our start point always imposition gst effecton wage wage earner gain accompany fall income taxrates lose introduction gst. the net effect tax changeswill increase disposable income wage earner increase theirexpenditure, evidence fact package involve cost budget.• monetary policy base view inflation within target immediatelybefore gst introduce back within target year later. this view,in turn, base assumption second round effect due higherwage outcome outline above. if start observe behaviour indicate thisassumption correct, monetary policy would act upon it. we act atpresent expectation assumption violate - act theexpectation hold.4.the need long expansionwe make point say recent monetary policy tighten design increase thelength expansion. again, may universally accepted, many people associatetightenings end expansions.our position may seem wrong way round traditional view monetarypolicy, i want make point clarification:• first, new position part. we wait already run onthe board specify aim long expansion. before i take jobin early september 1996, i ask parliamentary committee wouldtighten expansion, reply follows: bi review 125/19994“in long run, want good performance growth good performanceon employment, best thing pursue policy extend length therecovery. in past, sometimes problem strong expansion abuild-up big inflationary pressure follow sharp contractions. in sharpcontraction unemployment go quickly. the way monetary policy cancontribute good outcome short sharp expansion generatesinflationary pressures, long slow one. to long slow one, mean thatyou occasionally pre-emptive, first sign thing get control youhave squeeze down.”please excuse inelegant phrase - “off cuff” reply question acommittee member. but least show consistent point since atleast mid-1996.• the second point long expansion, seem reasonable itwill include number phase monetary policy. it though, order get theexpansion, continuously ease monetary policy soon tighten it, itbrings expansion end experience recession. it seem far likelynow long expansion include perhaps two three phase tighten easing,as monetary policy seek extend length expansion. and, course, lowinflation expansion, would order long one, tighten andeasings monetary policy may take place relatively small range interest ratesettings.5.concluding remarksi go conclude say thing communicate public, nowknown transparency. but i think this, complicate gets. so onethought i conclude this. sometimes possible reasonably direct talk tothe public, i believe past weeks. that clear viewabout need done. but often not, find grey area isnot strong case something, incoming data evaluate merit andpolicy option weigh up. in situations, cannot give view direction policy- cannot say honestly believe - often disappoint people look aclear guide future action.
