 mark carney: what bank really for? remark mr mark carney, governor bank canada, university alberta school business, edmonton, alberta, 30 march 2009. the original speech, contain various link document mentioned, find u federal reserve system’s website. * * * across world's major economies, address failure bank rank among high policy priorities. in harsh glare current financial turmoil, clear many bank outside canada either job way create enormous risks. it vital learn mistake build robust financial order. the financial system servant real economy. a one international colleague recently remarked, "it time bank stop swanning around like queen england resume traditional role handmaiden industry." it apparent era self-absorbed finance view apex economic activity lead widespread misallocation capital. now, major economies, challenge bank allocate capital all. around world, bank accuse lend enough, charge aggressively lend and, fundamentally, deepen recession rather dampen it. these concern much le valid canada abroad, reflect upon respond accordingly. my remark today address role bank market economy. in recent years, core element financial system become increasingly intertwined, expand traditional role other, reliant health other. this blur bank market lead emergence so-called "shadow banking" sector, whose presence help trigger crisis whose absence complicate recovery. we face important policy question activity bank perform, locate sustainable, continuously-open markets, prohibited. the final answer question require reflection implementation take time, broad direction need now. market overshooting. on current trajectory, virtually financial activity put back onto bank balance sheet potentially tremendous cost term lose output employment. restore stability financial market require broad direction type global financial system emerge current financial mess. important step take week's meet leader g-20 london. canada much offer discussions, participate actively constructively. let stress outset many comment today apply acutely internationally domestically. while commentator quick ascribe global fail local institutions, engage bout perverse envy. our system better. regulation consistent. our bank conservative. credit condition canada remain superior virtually every industrialize country. that suggest access credit challenge, risk lie ahead, system cannot improved. however, many current constraint system reflect impact canada failure international financial system international institutions. the core system many – although – element sustainable global financial system. bi review 39/2009 1 the traditional role bank commercial bank perform several key function economy. to begin with, bank critical part payment system – pipe financial transaction occur. by facilitate decentralize exchange, payment system critical function market economy. like oxygen, payment system pass unnoticed unless disrupted. it one bank canada's job oversee systemic element payment system, well reliability. reflect year investment planning, payment system function smoothly reliably, despite enormous shock financial system past two years. the second important role bank transform maturity asset liabilities. bank take short-term liabilities, usually form deposits, transform long-term assets, mortgage corporate loans. household business therefore reverse, hold short-term asset longer-term liabilities. this help plan future manage risk arise uncertainty cash flows. bank also provide liquidity customer allow rapid access short-term assets. indeed, transact wide range maturities, bank provide arbitrage increase efficiency financial markets. this allow borrower obtain low rate interest appropriate risk characteristics. the social value maturity transformation without question. however, definition, also lead maturity mismatch create fundamental risk banks. bank hold liquid reserve fraction outstanding obligations. what depositor want money back, money commit long-term investment projects? generally, problem, bank maintain sufficient liquidity meet typical demand borrow bank shock large anticipated. but many depositor want money back time? there tip point liquidity problem become self-fulfilling. to manage risk, bank rely two crucial supports. first, deposit insurance give depositor comfort fund need them.1 second, bank canada act lender last resort solvent illiquid institutions.2these support mechanism carefully craft discourage bank take inappropriate risk still provide necessary support. they also accompany robust regulatory framework. banker implicitly accept social contract give access liquidity support time stress return regulation behaviour times. bank perform third essential role credit intermediation, channel fund saver investors. this allow saver diversify risk u smooth consumption time. young family borrow buy house, student pay university. canadian invest low-risk, interest-bearing account retirements, business finance work capital investment. 1 the canada deposit insurance corporation insure eligible deposit maximum $100,000 (principal interest combined) per depositor failure bank financial institution cdic member. canadian charter bank cdic members, federally regulate trust loan company take deposit deposit-taking association govern cooperative credit association act. 2 a detail description bank's role lender last resort find winter 2004-05 issue bank canada review, available http://www.bankofcanada.ca/en/review/winter04-05/daniel.pdf. 2 bi review 39/2009 banks, markets, crisis bank game town. in recent years, market grow point important alternative corporate household finance. from financial system perspective, deepen market generally welcome make system robust increase competition, discipline bank activity. while market expand choice low price available financial consumers, function differently banks. unlike banks, market rely completely confidence liquidity. we see crisis confidence always present. liquidity wax wanes, it, price securities. in recent months, see fundamental repricing virtually every financial asset across world, liquidity many security fall dramatically. bank relationship customers. they follow borrower time monitor payment history reliability. when perform role properly, bank tailor product borrower, impose high low standard appropriate. in contrast, market transaction oriented. they act intermediary saver borrower maintain relationship neither. consequently, market instrument robust underlie product standardized. determine whether activity best finance bank market depend relative benefit activity specialization versus standardization. in response increase competitive pressure markets, bank become direct participant markets. this move help sow seed crisis three channel particular: wholesale funding, securitization, proprietary trading. first, bank become increasingly heavy user market fund activities. in recent years, many international bank borrow short-term market finance asset growth and, process, substantially increase leverage. this make increasingly dependent continuous access liquidity money capital markets. in process, bank conflate reliance market liquidity access central bank liquidity. this exacerbate potential liquidity problem bank magnitude good appreciate. second, bank increasingly use securitization straddle relationship bank transactional market-based finance. under originate-to-distribute business model, bank originate set loans, repackaged securities, sell investors. in essence, bank take specialize loan sell standardize packages. while securitization promise diversify risk banks, transfer risk frequently incomplete. bank often sell security "arms-length" conduit late force reintermediate hold onto aaa tranche structure prove far risk-free. at extreme, business model institution wholly reliant continuous availability market securitized asset (e.g., northern rock). the global financial crisis expose fundamental incentive problem occur securitization. in originate-to-distribute model, incentive originate institution long align risk-holders. once relationship severed, standard new loan ongoing monitor adversely affected. however, price risk management reflect change abruptly adjusted, help trigger onset crisis. third, many retail commercial bank expand investment banking. this allow bank package traditional lend high value-added agency business, market-making activity and, increasingly proprietary trading. banks' push market help spur proliferation over-the-counter derivative products, create counterparty investment risk difficult identify control. incentive problem also plague transition. in many banks, culture reward innovation opacity risk management transparency eventually undermine bi review 39/2009 3 creators. senior manager shareholder bank discover actual risk much great originally thought. by time, junior trader assume risk already paid, largely cash. many large, complex institution learn late principal-agent problem within firms, well firm shareholders. just bank begin market traditionally best, explosion highly specialize product require monitor continuous access fund liquidity. more traditional function bank – include maturity transformation credit intermediation – conduct broad range intermediary investment vehicles, collectively refer "shadow banking" system. shadow bank include investment bank (in countries), mortgage brokers, finance companies, structure investment vehicle (sivs), hedge funds, private asset pools. the scale development remarkable. during decade, bank asset grow enormously, anywhere one half time six time national gdp canada, unite states, unite kingdom, europe. in country besides canada, much growth finance increase leverage.3 in final year boom, complacency access liquidity reach zenith, scale shadow bank system exploded. the value sivs, example, triple three year 2007. the growth financial activity increasingly complex array financial player prompt dramatic increase claim within financial system, oppose financial system real economy, create risk difficult identify evaluate. financial institutions, include many banks, come rely high level liquidity markets. in unite states, total value commercial paper rise 60 per cent abcp market 80 per cent three year crisis. in essence, shadow bank system practice maturity transformation without safety net – is, wholly reliant continuous availability fund markets. the collapse market liquidity begin august 2007 crystallize risks. the regulatory system neither appreciate scale activity adequately adapt new risk create it. the shadow bank system supported, regulated, monitor fashion bank system. with hindsight, shift towards shadow bank system emerge country allow go far long. financial deleveraging the financial crisis reverse decades-long transition bank-based, relationship-oriented finance towards market-based, transaction-oriented finance. bank play large role ongoing extension credit. however, transition carry enormous risks. bank alone cannot support level economic activity entire system before, particularly since many need delever. moreover, financial system whole robust bank market strong, healthy, liquid. financial deleveraging one dominant force global economy. after decade household debt, leverage financial sector, cross-border 3 average asset-to-capital ratio u.s. investment bank rise 25 prior onset crisis, 30 euro area, 40 major global banks. these much high canadian equivalent 20. 4 bi review 39/2009 capital flow rise rapidly, slow falling. the duration orderliness shift help determine severity global recession. financial institution around world must bring leverage sustainable level shrink asset raise capital. considerable, albeit disruptive, progress make shadow bank system, sivs conduit largely wind up. hedge fund asset management cut half us$1 trillion, leverage apply asset substantially reduced. a liquidity many fund market dry up, embed leverage many pension funds. however, le progress regulate bank sector. this large task. we estimate bring leverage ratio canadian level raise capital alone, global bank would need us$1 trillion new capital, additional writedowns assets. the deleveraging process contribute dramatic reversal cross-border capital flows. many large global bank dramatically curtail international activities. hedge fund similarly retreat home country anticipation redemption concern cross-border liquidity. the institute international finance (iif) estimate net flow private creditor emerge markets, top us$630 billion 2007, negative year. once crisis passes, scale cross-border financial transaction unlikely return pre-crisis levels. this reflect re-emergence home bias amongst investor impact measure support domestic institutions. this financial protectionism, checked, could permanently impair cross-border capital flow could serious setback global economy. reform global financial system it clear global financial system need restructured, require clear view objectives. the fundamental objective system efficiently support economic growth provide financial consumer choices. the system must robust shocks, dampen rather amplify effect real economy. it also support sensible innovation. the system need stable bank robust markets, since play central role finance and, properly structured, support other. achieve objective require range measure start short-term initiative keep system function bridge fundamental long-term reforms, help define role bank markets. keep system function extraordinary measure take underpin financial system. all g-20 country explicitly repeatedly confirm systemically important institution allow fail. in countries, direct support bank capital injection use public money. support also take le direct forms, liquidity support help keep open market bank market participant depend. some measure expediency take midst crisis element may need adjust late support permanent solution.4for example bank provide considerable liquidity support reflect scale fund pressures. the broad intent grease wheel financial system. in provide liquidity bank core system, central bank expect 4 the bank canada outline principle provision liquidity follow article http://www.bank-banque-canada.ca/en/fsr/2008/pol0608.pdf. bi review 39/2009 5 key market would resume function liquidity cascade market participant and, ultimately, private credit creation real economy. however, weak start point regulate institution great importance shadow bank sector, long heal process taken. while provision extraordinary liquidity limit damage crisis, long apparent official liquidity, irrespective size, cannot re-open market own. reopen market ultimately require series measure improve infrastructure core fund markets, securitization, credit default swap (cds). build systemic market a robust efficient financial system need core market interbank lending, commercial paper, repos high-quality security continuously open, even period stress. to end, bank canada currently engage wide-ranging discussion market participants, regulators, central bank step may need create continuously open markets. potential measure include improve transparency security (as abcp), standardize term through-the-cycle haircut repos, explore potential use clear house limit counterparty risks. regulation standard could reinforce initiatives. central bank operation could also adapt create market-maker last resort. authority also take important step improve function key market securitization cd create robust infrastructure standardize products. for example, reduce opacity, model data underlie security could publish move securitization black box open source. an extreme would standardize security introduce government "wrap" guarantee, case canada mortgage bonds.5 6 similarly, host measure pursue make cd market sustainable. the u.s. federal reserve improve clear settlement arrangements, encourage move cd onto clear houses. this encourage standardization products, make cd counterparties – often bank – le systemically important margin. the limit bank market these initiative change margin bank market make market much robust. this reduce risk institution rely market reduce extent certain bank "too interconnect fail." nonetheless, even changes, bank expect continue active market participants. for some, progress insufficient. a simple lesson draw crisis bank divorce markets. to think way, bank naturally heavily regulate utility collect deposit make loans. once bank become involve market "casino," overwhelm result risk-management challenge often draw public safety nets. indeed, existence safety net may encourage excess risk take promote financial crises. that advocate restrict banks' activity "core" function deposit take lending. the range activity relate market would keep 5 for example, former deputy chairman unite kingdom financial service authority, sir jam crosby, propose introduction government guarantee newly-issued mortgage-backed bonds. in march, bank england introduce asset purchase program support corporate credit markets. 6 in addition, align incentives, originator could brand product retain part security absorb first loss. 6 bi review 39/2009 outside heavily regulate bank sector. to way thinking, bank could get trouble or, did, demise could safely managed. in midst crisis, seductive viewpoint, practical value may limit three reasons. first, bank perform broad range market-related activity vital existence markets. canadian bank major agents, market makers, underwriters, trader government debt corporate debt. even substantial improvement market infrastructure, difficult see market function effectively absence bank participation. these activity distinguish principal position proprietary investment essential well-functioning markets. effort improve market infrastructure describe make market le risky system whole robust. second, bank major provider cross-border finance product range trade finance, foreign exchange hedging, foreign financing. in world global supply chain corporations, would costly prohibit bank provision service become integral global commerce. moreover, global cross-border flow already pressure, impediment would extremely risky. third, crisis demonstrate many firm deem systemic worthy rescue even though deposit-taking banks. effort build robust market define clear comprehensive resolution scheme may limit case future, unlikely eliminate entirely. in opinion, good approach plan g-20 expand perimeter regulation. a general principle, financial activity pose systemic risk financial stability supervise regulated. this include pool capital material size, leverage, maturity mismatches. in addition, avoid regulatory arbitrage, market regulate accord economic substance, place similar activity regulatory bucket, even undertake different institutions. regulate economic substance limit destabilize impact shadow bank bank themselves. in many respects, relative success canadian bank consolidate supervision office superintendent financial institution demonstrate that, proper regulatory regime professional management, bank much utilities. in spirit, canada contribute international debate financial sector reform. we stress need macroprudential (i.e., comprehensive system-wide) approach take account importance banks, markets, interaction them. conclusion our principal preoccupation weather financial economic storm, respond current tempest, policy-makers must also focus want end calm condition arrive. our destination one bank financial market play critical, complementary, role financial system support long-term economic prosperity. the system whole stable market infrastructure substantially improved, market product standardize transparent, bank fulfill market-making role appropriate liquidity backstops. a g-20 pursue critical agenda financial reform, canada contribute important perspective issues, draw fine example continue set. bi review 39/2009 7 paul tucker: the turner review conference – comment occasion turner review remark mr paul tucker, deputy governor bank england, the turner review conference, london, 27 march 2009. * * * the dreadful crisis affect international economy financial system rightly prompt thorough re-examination principle structures: “rules game” global finance. there many reports. a 1987 stock market crash 1990s’ eme crises, rich analysis, proposal plans. the turner report early distinguish intervention, take place alongside, example, report paul volker’s g30 committee jacques larosière’s european group. we would foolhardy start think shape system want, take quick wins. but might well mistake reach early conclusion truly big issues. before crisis over, could well learn quite lot business model risk management practice work best; effectively current effort stabilise bank system stimulate nominal demand work revive economies. we good position make judgment much need constrain financial activity future interest stability. my work definition “financial stability” long follows. it money. it start monetary policy directed, course, ensure value central bank money term good service stable. but money economy everywhere private money: deposit commercial banks. in significant degree, financial stability safeguard stability private money (deposits bank system) relative central bank money. prosaically, depositor bank confident exchange deposit face value money – notes; switch another bank confident that. at level system, need “exchange rate” unity private money central bank money. and need wholesale funders bank confident too. when secured, demand money low, society reap efficiency benefit private sector bank system. absent confidence, payment system simply would work. and supply credit would imperilled, rediscover global economy’s great cost. these objective – price stability, bank system stability – two key facet stability monetary economy. a recent event show, affect profoundly condition capital market overseas financial systems. focus ultimately stability monetary system therefore clearly require broad view financial market generally. stability elemental sense i describe profoundly threaten last autumn – universal crisis confidence trigger lehmans’ failure tear fabric international commerce. that stability sustain owe everything government step in, effectively prepare borrow future order prop bank system now. in sense, are, course, “beyond financial stability”, insofar as, ordinarily, would regard instability state affair require support. the turner report rehearse analysis get point. it rightly place weight baleful effect persistent cumulative global current capital account imbalances. i dearly wish international authority take board lesson 1990s eme crisis vital importance monitoring, necessary managing, national balance sheet – large country well emes. it striking, however, analysts, include recently imf, start play part play international monetary system. i go along that. there bi review 39/2009 1 surely dispute macroeconomic imbalance matter greatly crisis, contribute build debt and, compression risk-free rate risk premia, appreciation asset prices. but acknowledge that, claim imbalance lead inevitably financial instability. a necessary condition, view, faultlines exist within financial system – deep run, great threat stability. the identification mitigation faultlines require engagement detail system. those argue global imbalance need know leverage via cdos shadow bank system equally wrong. but scale macroeconomic imbalance allow accumulate surely raise bar resilience financial system, probably beyond reasonable. we need quit point finger, alternatively, global macroeconomic financial system causes, accept both. the turner report that. a point micro regulation the report accompany fsa discussion paper’s principal focus is, course, micro regulation. i three point add emphasise morning. effective prudential supervision individual firm rely line supervisor prepare substitute view management good reason believe viability stability bank otherwise may peril. they need confidence, necessary, face management, even boards; also prepare take risk overrule appeal. a respected, self-confident restrain line supervisor, forensic skill get heart things, great deal stability. it terrific adair hector renew emphasis line supervision. (but, way, supervisor job, achievement invisible get thanks.) second, important remember bank failure root large concentrate exposures. this crisis respect exception. it is, therefore, good news future that, ahead crisis, eu already plan extend bar large credit exposure interbank deposits. line supervisor must additionally look concentrate exposure sector instruments; give one many possible examples, large hold super-senior cdo tranche might pointer vulnerability large internationally active banks. and possibility fateful concentration bank fund structure give similar weight. if require report banks, would worth it. third, effective prudential supervision seriously impede complex group structures. that headline lesson failure bcci nearly two decade ago; eu directive amend make unsupervisable structure grind withhold withdraw authorisation, exercise regulatory powers. but complexity convenient shield wickedness. it also make hard management supervisor figure go perfectly honest business. the explosion i refer couple year ago vehicular finance, commit credit line reputational risk constitute umbilical cord back parent sponsor banks, precisely manifestation variety obfuscatory complexity. supervisor around world allow it. and, relate that, turner report rightly says, supervisor get serious work together oversight regulation international groups. the long-standing challenge consolidate supervision unfinished business, thirty year first basel concordat. 2 bi review 39/2009 micro-to-macroprudential those issues, even capital liquidity, shade debate macroprudential oversight regulation. one explanation parlous state industrialise world bank system many bank make many rotten individual-loan underwrite decisions. quite plainly that: example, manifestly u subprime market, commercial property, probably leverage buy outs. it would job authorities’ bank examiners, term elsewhere, detect significant erosion quality individual portfolio underwrite standards, get fix overwhelm system. another, mutually exclusive, explanation virtue hold large “trading” book mark market, bank find make large portfolio write down face sharp rise liquidity premia asset markets. a highly-levered institution – bank unavoidably: deposit debt – mark-downs deplete net worth point imperilling solvency. that cause retrenchment availability credit, help plunge world economy recession, impair traditional loan books, vicious spiral. the point account emphasis role banks’ leverage. combine maturity transformation, unavoidably make bank brittle. and underline predecessor place great weight safety soundness banks. indeed, original reason regulate capital assurance capital adequacy, extreme circumstances, would make run le likely. but hardly mean lead neglect liquidity highlight year ago one predecessors, andrew large, others. liquidity we therefore welcome turner report’s exploration “core funding”. and much support, encouraged, fsa’s plan bank future hold minimum level high-quality government bonds, grind carry reasonable assurance market liquidity stress conditions. i hope approach adopt internationally. further, supervisor vigilant ensure banks’ so-called “treasury” “liquidity” portfolio concentrate fund instruments, frns, issue banks. that turn prevalent. and liquid music stopped. year ago, regulator decide deduct banks’ hold other’s capital-instruments, avoid system whole generate illusory capital. the principle could perhaps apply liquidity regulation. the authority also need clear level stress, and/or proportion short-term liabilities, stock liquidity buff must cover. that must judgment authorities; must, turner report make clear, demand past. but important, must imagine kind model apply to, say, credit risk and, perhaps, type market risk sensibly carry across liquidity risk. liquidity go wrong is, jargon, strategic interaction: i run (or sell) i think etc. liquidity buff need sustain confidence; successful, buff never needed. a time series data show low use liquidity buff compel evidence requirement high. our successor must remember 10-20 year time. of course, liquidity buff proof circumstances. which central bank business provide liquidity insurance system. that insurance need provide term incite imprudent liquidity risks, time consistent, sense avoid need recast regime really difficult time hit. the bank set approach paper issue last autumn launch discount window facility, stand ready lend wide range bi review 39/2009 3 collateral pre-determined fee bank face fundamental problem solvency viability. capital, capital-of-last-resort i talk liquidity partly because, community return think bank supervision term stability well consumer protection, need centre stage again; also think capital regulation broad headings. what count capital; risk protect against; happen system turn enough capital? on definition capital, i agree turner report matter stability common equity (and possibly, subject analysis, also instrument unambiguously convert common equity option bank regulator). that confidence bank go concern crucial stability deposit wholesale fund base. subordinate debt may well help protect depositor event liquidation, cannot absorb loss going-concern basis little avoid incentive run or, therefore, slide resolution. nor subordinate debt alter position retail depositors, look deposit-protection scheme, especially provide 100% cover £50,000. subordinate debt enhance recovery make financial service compensation scheme. but directly stability-enhancing. the composition regulatory capital allow become complicated. include debt instrument effectively allow double leverage. the basel committee return question. a liquidity, i want say much today measure risk capital cover. i applaud turner report’s analysis “trading book” risks; discuss bank’s financial stability review year ago, make value risk bedrock market risk requirement allow capital fall, leverage rise, period unusually low volatility. the basel committee address this. more generally, degree stress capital enable bank withstand, whether default risk market risk, decide authority individual banks, precisely systemic significance bank payment credit system. even individual bank look adequately capitalise take isolation, aggregate position may vulnerable take account common exposure credit, market liquidity risk, cross-system exposures. capital requirement individual firm may, therefore, need depend liquidity mismatch leverage system whole is. even so, liquidity, rare episodes, must strive make rare, capital deficiency individually significant banks, even system whole. and, analogously, therefore need ex ante policy cater that. there two element policies. first, need regime resolve distress bank orderly way, outside insolvency regime apply ordinary companies. the uk take useful step forward introduce special resolution regime banks. we need keep provision active review. large complex financial institution present special challenge. nearly decade ago, joint g10/financial stability group, i served, articulate imponderable scale challenge wind group. the conclusion lay beyond current capability authority internationally; that, nevertheless, work together – provide factbooks firm exchange information – put best possible position. none done, fsf g20 are, thankfully, underline vitally important is. we need particular ensure financial group maintain information asset liability legal entities; legal entity 4 bi review 39/2009 go resolution business divisions. lehmans shout loud clear. we need ensure banks, however grand are, keep information would facilitate rapid payout deposit-protection schemes. we need bank contingency fund plan share regulator central banks. we need, ambitiously, address too big to fail. and need massively good work together internationally. however much do, i fear inescapable conclusion cannot rule rarely bank system end need support ultimate source capital. if right, society need principle policy might call “capital last resort”, sit alongside lender last resort (lolr) principle develop central bank since 19th century. part academic community start think advocate capital-insurance private sector, long term need decide whether policy public sector capital insurance. at high level, face exactly challenge central bank liquidity insurance. it term must incentivise imprudent behaviour; must time consistent. these exactly challenge face bank articulate term discount window facility. but challenge even great area exit strategy capital injection much difficult; potentially deliver control, capital-insurance much closely intertwine issue management; would clarity treatment part capital structure. i think articulate stick policy area one great challenge come year decades. macroprudential: tame credit cycle it would lot easy could tame credit cycle. this debate miss “macroprudential instrument”. what would objective; principle instrument; would work practice world free capital flows? those debate prior question institutional responsibility. and bear parallel debate regulatory boundary, i begin. i start position excessive leverage maturity transformation part non-bank financial sector – funds, conduits, security dealers, – predicate availability plentiful credit too-easy term commercial bank system. up point, go liquidity asset markets. of course, persistently strong demand financial asset – crudely, rise price – create illusion liquidity but, beyond that, willingness term “market-makers” underpin liquidity depend access credit finance inventory. and ultimate private sector provider credit commercial banks. one big question, therefore, far could get dampen credit cycle focus provision liquidity, leverage, bank financial firms. that go whether hedge fund vehicle need bring within net. frankly, hard know whether, internationally, regulatory community try fail control leverage available non-bank financial sector; whether really attempt take account system-wide conditions. either way, information non-banks would probably need make policy workable. but second question, perhaps biggest, whether “dampening credit cycle” goal all; or, alternatively, whether realistic goal. a slightly modest – but, truth, still demand – objective might concentrate make bank resilient economic market shocks, le likely expose bank system fragility amplify economic downturn. a third big question instruments. lot candidate canvassed. dynamic provision bank would, manner previous generations, set aside general provision loan book grew. capital requirement increase rate bi review 39/2009 5 growth balance sheets, measure incipient stress. variable margin requirement term credit provide financial, even real-economy, borrowers. a fourth big question whether choose instrument(s), whatever is, could operate rule would require element top-down judgment. on that, i incline view community unlikely able write suitably robust rule. i two reason that. one draw parallel monetary policy. the history monetary policy, least country, litter fail attempt design optimal rule, give way effort constrain discretion policymakers make judgments. i cannot see would good develop rule financial stability. a structure financial system evolved, would need adapt rule would probably fail spot need so. but also something nature financial stability problem make “rules” implausible me. in upswing credit cycle, often collective-action problem. even though individual bank may perceive risk underpriced, know sure whether party end hesitate step rollercoaster fear damage business franchise. this precisely job authority “take away punchbowl party get going”. i cannot see could calibrate ex ante rule increase capital requirement whatever would need that, would course need somehow find way sensibly constrain discretion core alternative approach. even could resolve issues, fifth big issue far individual national authority would able operate field own, give free flow capital internationally cross-border banking. these big question are, course, inter-related. most obviously, far could get design instrument(s) process deployment affect whether objective ameliorate effect economic shock bank also effect credit-creation process economy. and objective bear whether host home authority need constrain bank’s lend growth. that formidable agenda, underline much do. macroprudential: market infrastructure part transmission mechanism but deliver maintain stability, macroprudential agenda cannot focus countercyclical capital (or margin) requirements. we need focus large shock might transmit financial system. again, analogy monetary policy. effective monetary policy rely upon rich subtle understand structure economy policy decision transmit final goal (the so-called “monetary transmission mechanism”). equivalently, effective delivery financial stability mandate require rich subtle understand structure domestic international financial system, development one part transmit others. that mean range must continue extend beyond bank capital market financial infrastructure. the analogy stop there. in monetary sphere, policymakers 1980s 1990s urge reform make real economy, especially labour markets, flexible, would reduce burden monetary policy smooth cyclical fluctuations. the analogue financial stability sphere authority need help identify and, crucially, remedy faultlines financial system. whereas monetary policy want real-economy flexibility, financial stability want financial system resilience. and monetary policy transmission mechanism evolves, structure financial system changes. the explosion vehicular finance development credit trade two recent example affect current crisis. we therefore need high-quality, continuous assessment emerge vulnerability system whole, would behave stress. 6 bi review 39/2009 internationally official community distinguish front recent years. just three examples; more, i fear. first, many large financial business aaa rat was, fatally, description credit standing; constitute business model. example include fannie freddie; landesbanks; u monoline insurers; sivs; and, think business model, abcps. these institution distort supply credit across global economy. (in case monoline insurers, structure finance effectively business provide “end-of-the-world insurance settlement period t+1”.) an even wide group private-sector aaa institution require collateralise derivatives-related counterparty-credit exposures. the effect system whole introduce extraordinary vulnerability rat downgrade institution structures. there was, effect, potentially systemic cliff. a second serious faultline global capital market – arguably great – firm expectation “no break buck” massive global money market mutual fund industry; c. $3trn us, le size commercial bank deposits. the failure pay par major u money fund lehman collapse help trigger unravel confidence across global markets. constant net-asset value mmmfs perhaps been, globally, important non-bank bank lie outside scope i like call bank social contract: prudential supervision, “deposit” insurance, access discount window, yet nevertheless allow conduct maturity transformation offer payment services. although small europe us, industry exist here; ecb even include money fund definition monetary institution measure broad money. but add twist boom large part asset comprise bank cd conduit abcp. in words, essentially intermediary bank corporate treasurers, insurance company etc, fund bank one remove. a paul volker’s g30 report concludes, need review whether continue allow constant nav mmmfs; alternative would convert either variable nav fund (ie like mutual fund) regulate deposit-takers. a third faultline may extension mark-to-market account (more less) everyone everything without attention dynamic system whole would affected. if liquidity premia fluctuate materially, effect portfolio value material, increase reduce leverage affect risk-seeking shed behaviour. account measure become actor rather purely passive measures. this world away small handful dealer mark market. my point mark market necessarily flawed, rather “rules game” global finance matter. it really good anyone argue that: debate need move and, thank financial stability forum, probably is. the moral story detail structure capital market matter stability. they may matter event low probability shock system. but policymakers must focus contain impact tail events. systemic resilience much part macroprudential approach countercyclical capital requirements. this matter pick feature system dislike. it occasionally, restraint, much want. the current topical issue whether cd contracts, vanilla otc contracts, centrally clear exchange-traded. ideally yes, underline importance integrity central counterparty risk management, systemic oversight authorities. but broad issue authority ready nudge intermediaries, asset manager infrastructure provider market-development initiative clearly desirable interest stability need harm efficiency. bi review 39/2009 7 put another way, “plumbing” matters. we positive reasons, well negative ones, believe that. two examples. fifteen twenty year ago, central bank move wholesale payment system real-time gross settlement basis. cut details, mean settlement bank long expose day payment send other; and, uk countries, central bank deliver without take unsecured intra-day credit exposure itself. without unheralded reforms, i little doubt last autumn’s crisis would calamitous scale massively exceed dreadful near-seizure experience money markets. that example public sector initiative; bank le herd it. but equally important private sector initiative. without collateralisation otc-derivative counterparty credit exposures, credit spillover firm fund failure around world would surely much greater. what two example demonstrate authority practitioner get thing right – focus matter bad state world. summary the turner report make big contribution develop agenda reform global financial system, include macroprudential oversight. if anything, i may add agenda morning. we need undertake serious research analysis whether develop macro instrument tame credit cycle. but, make system resilient, cannot rely solely bank capital loan market requirements. that endeavour – heading-off incipient stress, keep “rules game” date fit purpose – require high-quality surveillance system whole, bring together analysis, experience intelligence markets, macro environment, infrastructure, firms. we identify address faultlines. the system’s strength weak point “morph” time. one era’s solution may today’s tomorrow’s faultline: fannie mae example that. and, effort fail, need clear authority intervene preserve stability, whether construct “capital last resort” policy create perverse incentive “peacetime”. surveillance, build system resilience, crisis management. a macroprudential approach stability rather bring together central bank’s macroeconomist micro regulator’s line supervisors. what lie matter hugely: markets, payment systems, plumbing. i like think that, amongst others, central bank bring something this, draw conjunctural expertise, also operational presence money bond market heart payment settlement system. certainly bank engage actively fsa, hmt, overseas central banks, industry design new “rules game” global financial system. 8 bi

quarter 2008, show gdp fall 1.5%. in last day forecast come out, base recent data, even pessimistic. the difficulty make forecast circumstance derive fact available economic model calibrate take account shock size similar one experiencing, capable understand nature mechanism transmission process. rather elaborate new scenario, risk become obsolete quite rapidly, i would like share reflection current crisis possible developments. in respect, i would like remind that, give govern council meet come thursday, so-called purdah period abstain make comment monetary policy. what i say thus way associate possible monetary policy decisions, i would appreciate medium report event could acknowledge it. the start point reflection start crisis world economy balance position. on contrary, characterize several imbalances, within individual economy across countries. at global level, world economy experience wide grow current account imbalances. on one side, u run continuous deficit since 1980s, exception couple years, grow time, reach 6% gdp 2006. on hand several asian countries, notably china, record grow current account surplus (which case china reach 10% gdp 2007). the finance u deficit take place largely purchase dollar denominate government bond rest world, result accumulation huge liquid reserves, particular china, japan oil export countries. another international imbalance derive grow pressure world demand exercise scarce resource planet, particular primary commodities, oil, generate sharp price rise mid 2008. primary commodity price development put question convenience several durable product high energy intensity, thus reduce demand. imbalance emerge also within countries, generate excessive growth sectors, finance housing, large financial flows, especially household debt. in u imbalance develop time. just give example, five year crisis share profit make financial sector profit rise bi review 39/2009 1 40% overall corporate profits, double respect average previous thirty years. from 2002 2007 world economy grow yearly average 4.3%, pull international trade grow 7.3% per year. this intense period post-war growth. it also fragile, result domestic global imbalances. this suggest won’t possible exit crisis return sustainable growth unless imbalance accumulate couple year ago reabsorbed. it imply particular sector economic activity grow unbalance way past might substantially downsized, short term also medium term, world economy start grow again. one sector likely downsized, least time, finance, give risk aversion likely remain elevate years, reduce scope innovation. financial regulation tend reduce scope non regulate sectors. the whole financial system le leverage, low margin thus le employment so-called “golden years”. another example housing, price unlikely return soon pre-crisis levels, especially countries. also sector profit margin likely low investment employment. excess supply debt might require year absorb again, show early 2000s burst high-tech bubble. other sector could downsize permanent way technology turn pace medium term trend energy prices. another grave side current crisis – also largely unpredicted – collapse international trade, bring process economic integration backwards, sort de-globalization. this hit export import countries, rather brutal way, multiplier effect investment, consumption employment. the sector seriously hit expose international competition, grow strongly recent year thank global integration production processes. those country rely export manufacture production hit hardly crisis originate financial sector. accord estimates, around 90% world trade partially totally support financial instruments, past year also experience rapid process innovation. the crisis confidence burst failure lehman brothers, stop financial flows, especially agent locate different country le acquaint base transaction market-based liquid sophisticate credit instruments, however also riskier. the reflow capital towards major financial centre de-leveraging process, start second half september 2008, induce bank reduce non-core activities. export credit, consist finance export company also foreign importer buy exporter, entail high risk domestic activities. credit line foreign counterparties, require great use capital, tend reduced, especially small medium size enterprise towards emerge markets. we observe recently trade finance go back simple instruments, documentary credit confirm letter credit, substantially reduce risk. the link financial integration trade integration transmission mechanism loss confidence financial system spread real economy, country crisis start rest world. this imply restart trade integration process depend confidence come back component global financial system. the overall solidity global system depend weak part. during last month enormous resource put place, side atlantic, support commitment make policy authority let systemically important financial institution fail. the effect measure start appreciated. 2 bi review 39/2009 once financial system stabilised, time need rebuild financial infrastructure international trade comparable one prevail crisis. this mean pace export import growth recovery could slow crisis. another risk factor rebound world trade, medium term, relate fragment network production, distribute across borders, contribute maximize efficiency. this network hardly hit. for instance, trade euro area intermediate product fell january 2009 20%, compare previous year. the protectionist pressure slowdown foreign direct investment might lead restructure production, might take time turn le flexible efficient. for country open international trade, hit contraction export imports, re-directing idle resource towards domestic demand might slow difficult expected. to sum up, thorough analysis cause crisis suggest due cyclical factor also structural ones, associate downsize sector grow quickly excessively past. this novelty. during al recession sector suffer others. think burst high tech bubble 2000. however, never over-indebtedness spread intertwine real economy. this explain difficult understand intense last downward adjustment economic activity much dynamism through. this reflection suggest cyclical pick-up hardly bring back economic activity level comparable one prevail crisis, rather low level. this mean steady state, economy stabilise go back growth path, production potential likely significantly low crisis. this mean so-called output gap, measure distance level production potential, generally use estimate path economic recovery, could substantially low one estimate traditional statistical methodology. in words, crisis might affect structure “world production function”, result downsize productive sectors, finance, permanent change relative prices. this particularly relevant economic analysis put also conduct macroeconomic policies. these policies, particular fiscal monetary policies, contribute cyclical stabilization bring forward resource low phase cycle delay payment favourable phase. for instance, increase public expenditure finance debt delay payment cyclical upturn. monetary policy also act incentive aim shift consumption save time. the sustainability policy crucially depend pace economic growth income level achieve medium term, crisis over. give uncertainty structural cyclical component current crisis, risk divergent assessment sustainability economic policies, financial market one side policy authority other. the latter might tendency, temptation, calibrate policy response income target high pre-crisis one, crisis entirely cyclical nature rather structural, financial market might consider low level potential income next years, consequence structural effect crisis. such divergence might impair effectiveness macroeconomic policies. it might useful respect recall experience 1970s, first oil crisis, economic policy take account high oil price reduce potential growth advance economy calibrate policy response unrealistic target. bi review 39/2009 3 what draw consideration exit current crisis depend macroeconomic policy only, also structural factors, function good labour markets. a i already mentioned, contraction sector grow excessively crisis likely structural component, last medium term. this mean employment lose sector slowdown might reabsorb recovery. some labour reallocate sectors, avoid weigh growth public finances, social conditions. this raise need accompany short term macroeconomic policy measure aim reallocate idle resources, instance enhance training, human capital, market flexibility income stabilizers. measure aim improve competitiveness also required, especially sector expose international competition country experience poor performance even prior crisis, due low productivity growth. furthermore, global dimension current crisis show need support trade finance, particular traditional instrument risk insurance. experience show measure aim postpone problems, early retirement, avoided, aggravate public finance slow production potential. differently previous crisis, current one take place phase demographic stagnation, life expectancy increase birth rate falling. in situation similar italy, increase overall number retire would dramatically worsen work environment young generation, would pay high contribution finance pension system. under circumstance do maintain high participation rate labour market. the high risk, uncertain environment, limit policy action short term horizon, rely stimulate cycle without address necessary structural reform would foster good allocation resource recovery. we would loose precious time would find road problem even great imagine. it would grave mistake. thank attention. 4 bi review 39/2009 amando m tetangco, jr: financial stability collaboration understand speech mr amando m tetangco, jr, governor central bank philippine (bangko sentral ng pilipinas), insurance congress develop country (icdc) 2009, makati city, 25 march 2009. * * * atty. eduardo malinis, insurance commissioner chairman organize committee insurance congress develop country 2009, distinguish speakers, distinguish delegate insurance congress, lady gentlemen, good morning. to visit delegates, welcome manila! welcome philippines! i hope you’ve chance partake many option help “stimulate” domestic economy. i sure u room hear different financial stability fiscal stimulus packages, pursue economy across globe, help stem impact current global financial economic crisis. i certain organizer icdc manila 2009 also put together “own” version post-meeting stimulus package complement many interest conference breakout sessions. for part, i’d like encourage participate actively endeavor would different session next three days. let begin remark morning thank commissioner ed malinis congress organizer invite speak today. at first blush, keynote message gather insurer deliver governor central bank supervise bank sector, may bite peculiar. but one seriously look situation, indeed quite reflective theme congress, financial stability collaboration understanding. lady gentlemen, time need promote financial stability imperative. a keenly aware, current financial turmoil go beyond border epicenter financial crisis – u major economy – reach shore emerge markets. more importantly, global financial turmoil transcend bind financial realm cross real sector economies, include several represent today. you please know remark morning brief. i two message i wish bring across, light desire financial stability. first that, information efficiency must create maintain among financial regulators. a witness current crisis, line delineate financial institution make financial system become time blurred, make improve collaboration among financial regulator exigent. second, must conscious effort among regulator devote resource regulation conduct business. there often temptation large-scale (global) crisis, one moment, speak systemically important institutions. lady gentlemen, i believe must careful forget public ultimately serve. we must remember financial sophistication invest public may necessarily coincide pace financial innovation. this create gap could result public fully appreciate product new structure invest in, thereby unduly expose risk. i. the need information efficiency in discuss first point, need information efficiency, i’d like highlight two recent development global financial markets. first, convergence among bi review 38/2009 1 different type financial institutions. and second, convergence framework financial regulation supervision. a. convergence among different type financial institution the financial crisis us, understand it, partly explain relatively loose regulation entity heavily involve financial innovation, include oversight sale product wide public. financial market develop recent year financial product sell across different financial sub-sectors – bank insurance companies, security firms, several cross-combinations thereof. in addition, emergence (through common ownership) financial conglomerate encompass different type financial institution erode long-standing barrier keep business line apart. with changes, become important financial regulator clearly understand mechanism pass risk among different sub-sectors. let illustrate. the distress certain insurance company currently face directly trace exposure risk originate bank system, include structure product derivative whose underlie asset sub-prime mortgages. this highlight fact risk financial soundness insurance firm may also arise asset side balance sheets, clear departure traditional insurance firm risk management practice focus exclusively underwrite risk associate insurance liabilities. indeed, barrier use separate analysis risk different line business slowly break down. to give another example, unlike old (standard) business models, bank pay attention adequacy price risk exposure least cover expect losses. in many business models, call probability function loss give default. curiously, central long-standing practice among insurance firms. a able appreciate, product financial structure convergence drive financial liberalization advance information financial technology. development risk management valuation methodology also help heighten convergence. these factor nurture convergence, particularly extend low-interest rate environment – refer the great moderation – market participant seek enhance yield “offload” spread risk. b. convergence framework prudential regulation supervision a second major development financial market, make information efficiency among regulator urgent, convergence framework prudential regulation supervision. just banking, instance, set core principle lay broad prudential framework insurance too. the international association insurance supervisor (iais) release two week ago issue paper group-wide solvency assessment supervision. this set future iais work development comprehensive suite supervisory paper group-wide solvency assessment supervision. one could look international insurance industry’s version capital adequacy framework basel ii banks. it only, however, framework prudential regulation supervision converged. at national level (counting 30 country now), also physical convergence different financial supervisory body – specifically establishment “integrated supervisors” (i.e., supervisor responsible least two (2) type financial institutions). 2 bi review 38/2009 internationally though, convergence really physical intellectual, creation joint forum. the joint forum compose international financial supervisory organizations, namely, basel committee bank supervision (bcbs), international organization security commission (iosco), iais. the forum perform valuable role identify difference prudential arrangement across sector consider ever large set issue common interest across different supervisory communities. c. the philippine case in philippines, integrate supervisor financial system although, i explain later, exist collaborative arrangement among different financial supervisory agency order achieve goal stable financial system. supervision philippine financial system follow “silo” approach, i.e., supervisory agency responsible supervision certain segment system – (1) bangko sentral ng pilipinas (bsp) bank quasi-banks, financial ally subsidiary affiliates; non stock save loan associations, pawnshops; (2) security exchange commission (sec) investment houses, finance companies, security dealers/brokers, investment companies, pre-need companies; (3) insurance commission (ic) insurance reinsurance companies, insurance brokers, mutual benefit associations. while bsp supervise large financial group hold bulk financial system’s resources, instances, exist mandate three supervisory agency result overlap supervisory jurisdictions. these overlap are, however, remedied continuous collaborative efforts. most notable collaborative effort establishment 2004 financial sector forum (fsf), similar joint forum national scale. the fsf comprise three supervisory agency – bsp, sec ic – together philippine deposit insurance corporation (pdic). the member fsf head four member agencies, bsp governor chair. fsf essentially cooperative effort without legal mandate l construe integrate supervisory body. a quick survey among participant congress show clearly identifiable single optimal model supervision. there motivation commonly cite establish consolidate supervision, although standard establish design. these motivation include 1) regulatory consistency coordination harmonize rule standards, 2) difficulty hybrid financial instrument presence financial conglomerate pose separate regulators, 3) value economy scale give limit financial human resources. what evident discussions, however, need share information efficiently, regardless form supervision structure present economy. lady gentlemen, incumbent among financial supervisor order facilitate strengthen financial stability time, create maintain information share structure allow react swiftly preemptively change operate environment. this certainly help prevent occurrence crisis magnitude breadth we’re see today. ii. conduct business supervision let move second message which, i believe issue particular interest develop countries. one characteristic develop country relatively weak financial sophistication consumers, make customer quite vulnerable financial scams, include relatively simple ones. i believe therefore financial supervision develop country bi review 38/2009 3 focus set prudential standards, also strengthen conduct business oversight financial institution (i.e., supervision business practices, include deal customers). the increase globalization financial industry present complication globalization improve availability access complex financial product across develop countries, without necessarily discriminate among level sophistication target markets. ensure financial institution conduct business proper transparent manner therefore primary concern financial supervisor develop countries. failure ensure proper business conduct financial institution would adverse implication market confidence, which, turn, could threaten viability financial market source fund could support productive capacity economy. this point could apparent development global financial market witness right now. the fallout global financial crisis leave many investor financial product substantial losses, expose investment scheme economically unsound totally fraudulent. the immediate impact weaken confidence financial markets, play key role stoke crisis. restore market confidence conduct business supervision therefore essential order restore smooth function financial markets. in philippines, financial supervisors, independently collaboration financial sector forum, already undertake initiative issue rule improve conduct business financial institutions, especially relate complex product services. the bsp, instance, come circular require bank trust entity take pro-active responsibility market derivative trust product conduct client suitability tests. under rules, bank/trustee shall perform client profile process general principle client suitability assessment guide client choose investment outlet best suit objectives, risk tolerance, preference experience. in addition, bsp tighten disclosure requirement cover interest structure credit cards, fee pay loan deposits, management custody fee trust funds. the fsf, part, also intensify release advisory fraudulent unsound corporate financial practices. conclude remark lady gentlemen, allow conclude remark morning recap two points. the increase convergence different type financial institution financial product call close collaboration among different financial supervisory agency unit order ensure financial stability. for develop countries, however, another important issue refocus financial supervision include oversight role supervisor safety soundness financial institutions, also oversight role supervisor conduct business institutions. i trust would food think among you, consider many different issue surround financial stability difficult challenge times. i wish productive meaningful congress. thank much attention, good day. 4 bi review 38/2009 hirohide yamaguchi: recent economic financial development conduct monetary policy speech mr hirohide yamaguchi, deputy governor bank japan, meet business leaders, otaru, 25 march 2009. * * * introduction i would like thank financial business community otaru give opportunity speak today. i would also like thank close cooperation sapporo branch provide information economic financial situation region. the information valuable enable u accurately grasp current economic financial condition japan formulate conduct monetary policy. i visit otaru previously number time connection close bank japan's otaru branch 2002 remodel bank japan otaru museum. closure branch easy local community accept, i glad hear museum become well know welcome 500 thousandth visitor may 2008, five year opening. this successful transition owe great deal understand cooperation local community. before exchange views, i speak recent economic financial development japan abroad also policy response major countries. in particular, i describe view current substantial economic downturn economic outlook, authority worldwide, include bank, acted, well think behind actions. i. global financial market economic development a. the background turmoil global financial market economic downturn i start development global financial market world economy. the turmoil global financial market begin summer 2007, situation worsen suddenly market hit failure lehman brother hold inc. september last year. market participants' investors' concern creditworthiness trade partners, counterparty risk, intensified, result volume market transaction drop sharply market liquidity dry up. these development subsequently cause widen credit spread corporate bond chain reaction financial institutions' failure deteriorate performance many countries, price financial product – especially securitized one – drop product eventually become nonperforming asset financial institution hold them. a know, turmoil global financial market subsequent global economic downturn trigger u.s. subprime mortgage problem, surface summer 2007. this problem, however, merely prominent example correction various financial economic imbalance accumulated. look back, world economy enjoy favorable condition couple year ago, unprecedentedly high growth rate around 5 percent continue 2004 2007. notwithstanding high growth, price generally stable due mainly expansion global supply capacity result entry emerge economy market economy. amid high economic growth low inflation, interest rate worldwide remain low prolong period. bi review 38/2009 1 in continue benign environment high growth, low inflation, low interest rate grow optimism prospects, financial economic activity overheat imbalance accumulated. this overheat cause number thing happen. for example, rapid growth emerge economy significantly increase demand resource crude oil, lead surge commodity prices. investor financial institution ease credit standards, global credit bubble emerged, see u.s. subprime mortgage problem. look development final demand global basis, industrialize economy north america europe also emerge commodity-exporting economy experience robust private consumption, particularly durable consumer goods, also strong business fix investment. these indication overheat financial economic activity. the current global financial crisis large economic downturn therefore view part process correct imbalance accumulated. these development suggest current financial crisis economic downturn essentially cause cycle generation burst global credit bubble, cycle overheat correction financial economic activity, similar cycle occur repeatedly past. look back previous two decades, see many boom-and-bust cycles: japan's asset price bubble late 1980s, asian currency crisis late 1990s, global it bubble early 2000s. but recent cycle bring worldwide economic downturn much large recent history, distinctive feature "simultaneity" "rapidity." i describe background simultaneous rapid downturn world economy term three features: progress globalization financial activity; progress globalization economic activity; it innovations. take progress globalization financial activity first, financial institution investor around world carry large volume cross-border financial transaction invest variety financial assets. the u.s. subprime mortgage problem immediate repercussion also western european financial institution make large investment securitized product back u.s. subprime mortgages. financial institution investor unite state western europe important role channel fund emerge economy region central eastern europe latin america. since financial institution suddenly scale back exposure emerge economies, financial crisis unite state western europe spread rest world. the second feature background progress globalization economic activity. since 1990s, emerge economy – nies, brics, asean countries, former centrally plan economy – become full-fledged member market economy. although economy continue enjoy level growth high industrialize economy recently, decelerate significantly due outbreak turmoil global financial market drop export cause downturn u.s. european economies. emerge economy increase presence global marketplace production base durable consumer good part industrialize economy also huge market latter's products. consequently, decrease industrialize economies' export emerge economy aggravate economic deterioration industrialize economies. it clear interregional adverse feedback loop trade partner – process import export individual country decline, result economic stagnation country involve – operate around globe, irrespective level economic development. the third feature background it innovations, support progress globalization financial economic activity. the widespread use popularization it system support globalization increase speed transactions, reduction 2 bi review 38/2009 interregional information gap, global network transactions. the breakthrough information process capacity enable formation massive financial trade system well payment settlement systems, process enormous amount trade information second. ironically, sophisticate system perform equally well time contraction financial transaction economic activity. in current environment, accelerate speed contraction may cause sudden unwind imbalances, lead rapid economic downturn. b. the current state outlook world economy with abrupt contraction credit drop commercial trade around globe, many economy inevitably face either recession slowdown. u.s. economic condition deteriorate significantly. the house market undergo adjustments, business consumer spend behavior become cautious reflect tight fund condition great uncertainty economic prospects. in european economies, addition decrease exports, domestic demand also decline partly due financial institutions' tighten lend standards. emerge economy commodity-exporting economies, i describe earlier, slow export decrease reflect u.s. european economic deterioration also financial condition worsen reflect increase capital outflow. thus, many economy adverse feedback loop operate – process production, income, expenditure spiral downward decrease in, example, export start point. simultaneously operate worldwide yet another adverse feedback loop, financial economic activity – process worsen economic condition due financial institutions' tighten lend standard squeeze institutions' profits, turn tighten lend standards. we often ask whether current global economic downturn might evolve become serious great depression 1930s. the difference great depression current economic downturn relatively clear one look policy response relevant authority worldwide. unlike time great depression, authority could take effective measure response failure financial institutions, authority many country today already form framework protect depositor expeditiously inject public fund financial institution distress. other difference currently government central bank major country promptly take fiscal monetary policy action system free trade nation basically maintained. however, follow question continue keep mind: (1) whether action take date secure financial system stability sufficient adverse feedback loop financial economic activity still operating; (2) specific mean employ compensate weakness effective demand; (3) whether current financial condition sufficiently accommodative relative severity deterioration economic conditions; (4) whether protectionism reemerge, much support give domestic industry. i think important continue analyze current difficult situation coolly contemporary perspective, neither overstate understate developments, refer lesson learn past rather try make imperfect comparison past. look ahead, since current financial crisis economic downturn process correction various imbalance accumulate past several years, present severe situation likely continue time. for world economy return recovery path, follow condition need fulfilled: (1) u.s. european financial system regain stability, reduce downward pressure world economy financial side; (2) time, adjustment asset prices, production, excessive capital stock make progress, pave way recovery aggregate demand. however, linger concern u.s. bi review 38/2009 3 european financial systems, drastic disposal nonperforming asset begun. there clear sign improvement indicator major economy point, time fiscal monetary policy action economy fully take effect. the bank expect that, latter half fiscal 2009, global financial market regain stability overseas economy move deceleration phase. however, give current state global economy, inevitable uncertainty outlook great. ii. economic financial development japan a. the current state outlook japan's economy now i discus economic financial development japan. japan's economy start decelerate spring last year, since autumn export production experience one sharp drop ever. in january year, export industrial production fell 15.8 percent 10.2 percent respectively, month-on-month basis, show decline comparable sharp fall history. in addition, domestic demand become weak background decline corporate profit worsen employment income situation household sector. against background, bank's assessment japan's economic condition deteriorate significantly likely continue deteriorate time being. real gdp contract october-december quarter last year 12.1 percent annualized quarter-on-quarter basis, sharp decline since period immediately first oil crisis, figure support bank's assessment. the rate real gdp growth unite state euro area quarter minus 6.2 percent minus 5.7 percent, respectively, fact japan's economy contract sharply underscore severity country's current economic conditions. the fact downturn severe japan u.s. western european economies, global economic turbulence stemmed, seem due mainly growth mechanism japan's economy operate years. japan's economy continue grow early 2002 recently, moderately perhaps, uninterruptedly. the background long period growth provide – addition japanese firms' effort reduce excessive debt capital stock – favorable environment rapidly grow world economy. in situation, japan establish economic growth mechanism primarily base production export durable consumer good capital goods, especially automobiles, electrical machinery, general machinery. i believe may due partly follow facts: (1) due decline birthrate age population, rapid growth domestic demand could expected; (2) yen depreciate trend middle 2007. in fact, industry manufacture three type product i mention account half industrial production japan, share counterpart unite state 20 percent. about 65 percent domestically produce automobile export 2008, great increase 55 percent 2002. with regard general machinery, external orders, lead strong demand member country european union (eu) commodity-exporting emerge economies, grow steadily 2002 2007, increase slightly 50 percent period. the ongoing global economic downturn deliver blow growth mechanism japan's economy. a large drop real gdp october-december quarter also observe south korea, taiwan, germany – economy high share manufacture industry sensitive change exports, produce durable consumer goods, capital goods, part both. in addition, case japan, seem rapid appreciation yen summer last year amplify 4 bi review 38/2009 downward pressure export already exist due drop final demand overseas. furthermore, japan share domestically produce part material high country unite states, therefore decrease export tend adversely affect even industry export-oriented. these industry cut production sharply reduce excessive inventories, therefore production likely continue decrease time being. business fix investment, particularly expand production capacity, also likely decrease time being, firm increasingly regard capital stock excessive. labor market condition slackening, development warrant careful monitor adjustment labor market, term wage number employees, might spread manufacturer nonmanufacturing firms. japanese households, whose save ratio high, large amount financial assets, pressure make large-scale balance sheet adjustments, unlike u.s. counterparts, suffer fall land home prices. however, worsen employment income situation gradually take toll, may exert additional downward pressure private consumption. furthermore, attention pay possibility recent unstable stock price deteriorate employment situation may weaken consumer confidence further. price downward trend. in summer last year, cpi inflation, term year-on-year rate change, rise 2.4 percent, high level since first half 1990s. thereafter, however, moderate reflect decline price petroleum products, fall 0 percent january year. it project become negative soon increase slackness evident supply demand condition due severe economic situation. a outlook economy, bank's baseline scenario project start recover latter half fiscal 2009, price decline abate global financial market regain stability overseas economy move deceleration phase. however, high level uncertainty surround scenario, involve risks. japan's production likely continue decrease time being, also likely pace decrease slow gradually inventory adjustment pressure diminish. in situation, whether final demand start recover rapidly adjustment complete key recovery japan's production economy whole. a i mentioned, highly uncertain world economy begin recovering, therefore also unclear extent recovery export bring economic recovery japan. if recovery final demand – include export – long delayed, degree recovery small, may cause decline firms' medium long-term growth expectation consequent increase adjustment pressure capital stock employment, eventually depress domestic private demand further. with regard prices, downside risk economy materialize rate change price continue negative long period time, firms' households' medium- long-term inflation expectation may decline. the bank continue carefully examine development well various downside risks. b. the financial environment japan next, i would like talk current financial environment. financial condition japan remain tight since failure lehman brothers. i would like focus recent development corporate financing, relevant today's audience. the first issue level interest rate apply borrow firms. they decline due mainly effect reduction policy interest rate since autumn last year improvement cp market. cp issuance rates, surge end bi review 38/2009 5 last year, decline since turn year, banks' lend rate also decline slightly, partly reflect reduction short-term prime lend rates. on hand, credit spread increase remain elevated, counteract effect policy interest rate reductions. the second issue amount borrow firms. firm incline compensate decline cash flow borrow also increase cash hand view uncertainty future. in situation, improvement issue environment cp bonds, issuance instrument whole previous year's level. by contrast, bank lending, especially large firms, continue increase rapidly. on lender banks' side, however, become increasingly conscious capital constraint background expand securities-related loss high credit cost cause deterioration business performance borrower firms. in situation, increase number firm report financial position weak lend attitude financial institution severe. various research result show small firms, lend remain previous year's level, see financial position deteriorate financial institutions' lend attitude tighten much 1998 2002, bank need pay due attention developments. the financial condition japanese financial institution relatively stable even emergence u.s. subprime mortgage problem, generally make progress disposal nonperforming asset since burst economic bubble also investment overseas securitized product limited. in fact, unlike unite state europe, failure financial institution rescue injection public fund occur japan. notwithstanding this, give economic downturn likely continue time being, attention need pay possibility financial health japanese financial institution may worsen risk-taking ability may decline gradually, turn reduce lend capacity. the bank continue carefully examine whether financial intermediation function japanese financial institution financial system japan maintain adverse feedback loop financial economic activity intensify. iii. policy response have explain economic financial development home abroad, i would like move recent policy response major country developments. major country take policy measure cope problem financial systems. increase strain global financial market heighten concern financial system prompt take various measure since autumn last year. the u.s. european authorities, government particular, take wide range measures: injection public fund financial institution distress; expansion deposit insurance coverage; purchase nonperforming asset financial institutions. the increase capital constraint i mention early make strengthen financial institutions' capital base important also japan, even though financial system remain stable compare unite state europe. against background, revise act special measure strengthen financial function pass diet december improve framework utilize public funds. many measure take unite state europe present similar adopt japan fight financial crisis second half 1990s. in sense, i believe japan's experience reflect measure take foreign country today. lesson learn japan's experience 6 bi review 38/2009 include fact that, adverse feedback loop work financial economic activity, policy response ensure stability financial system might resolve problem completely. the key launch comprehensive policy package prevent intensification loop. in policy package, measure different area need implement simultaneously: measure strengthen financial institutions' capital bases, also measure resolve excess corporate sector well support revitalization, others underpin overall economic activity. in regard, bank continue find opportunity explain country lesson japan learned. major country take decisive measure well fiscal policy. in unite states, new obama administration launch large-scale fiscal stimulus package equivalent 75 trillion yen. the chinese government announce measure equivalent 60 trillion yen boost economy. the japanese government also intend implement 12 trillion yen fiscal measure 63 trillion yen financial measures. in conduct fiscal policy, generally speaking, important examine way create demand short run also, example, improve infrastructure, enhance productivity, eventually increase growth potential economy long run. moreover, indicate statement late g-7 g-20 meet finance minister central bank governors, also important measure consistent medium- long-term fiscal sustainability. a monetary policy, major central bank take appropriate measure timely manner, vary accordance economic financial situation country. the bank conduct monetary policy three main areas: reduction interest rates; provision ample liquidity stabilize financial markets; facilitation corporate finance influence individual financial markets. take area turn, i would like explain measure bank implement since autumn last year. with regard reduction interest rates, first area, bank reduce target uncollateralized overnight call rate – policy interest rate – 0.1 percent, 0.5 percent. it also work interest rate term instrument devise method liquidity provision, result slightly low begin year, even though demand fund tend increase fiscal year-end approaches. the second area ensure stability financial market provide ample liquidity. the bank conduct u.s. dollar funds-supplying operation coordinate action central banks, also provide ample fund yen by, example, purchase japanese government bond (jgbs) outright. follow december's decision increase outright purchase jgbs 14.4 trillion yen per year 16.8 trillion yen, bank decided, monetary policy meet hold last week, increase amount 4.8 trillion yen 21.6 trillion yen per year. last week's decision make because, give likelihood market remain stress new fiscal year, bank judge continue provision substantial liquidity require ensure stability financial markets. with decision, bank would make great use long-term funds-supplying operations, thereby facilitate smooth money market operations. regard third area, measure facilitate corporate financing, bank conduct since january 2009 new operation call "special funds-supplying operation facilitate corporate financing." these enable financial institution obtain fund maturity three month explicit ceiling total quantity fund available, although maximum amount borrow individual financial institution may exceed value corporate debt pledge collateral. the interest rate fund set 0.1 percent, low market rate fund correspond maturities. in addition, bank expand operation february by, example, increase frequency operation week twice month standardize bi review 38/2009 7 duration loan three month instead one three months; change aim encourage decline longer-term interest rates, rate actually apply firms' borrowing, relieve firms' fund concerns. furthermore, january bank decide conduct outright purchase cp total 3 trillion yen financial institutions. last month, also decide purchase outright 1 trillion yen corporate bond residual maturity one year. the bank take measure base recognition decline function cp corporate bond market cause tighten overall corporate finance conditions. these measure expect encourage financial institution sell cp corporate bond hold thus expand lend capacity. the bank's outright purchase corporate debt, however, involve relatively high probability impose cost taxpayer incur losses, deepen involvement bank microeconomic resource allocation among individual firms. in addition, involve high risks, compare policy measures, damage financial health bank cause incur loss ultimately undermine confidence currency monetary policy. since exceptional measure central bank, bank purchase cp corporate bond outright base certain necessary condition implementation purchases. the u.s. federal reserve bank england (boe) also purchase corporate finance instruments, do bank japan, although size range corporate finance instrument purchase vary accord difference degree decline market function structure financial intermediation. furthermore, feed boe announce introduction large-scale outright purchase government bond month, although difference policy objective think behind introduction. i would exaggerate greatly i say that, address present economic downturn, major central bank go beyond boundary conventional monetary policy step new sphere policy conduct. in addition measure three main areas, bank take decisive measure ensure stability japanese financial system, view recognition persist strain global financial market deterioration economic condition home abroad adversely affect financial institutions' business performance financial intermediation function. specifically, last month bank resume purchase stock hold banks. base recognition reduce market risk associate stockholding remain extremely important issue financial institutions' management, bank aim support future endeavor reduce risk. moreover, last week decide explore new framework provide bank subordinate loans, constitute part capital bases. the aim measure provide bank way maintain adequate capital base – along capital-raising bank market base act special measure strengthen financial function – ultimately ensure stability financial system. in view aim, bank draw scheme implementation early possible. a i explained, bank implement various measure rapid succession since autumn last year. the end fiscal year day away, financial market japan far remain relatively stable, firm financial institution strive secure liquidity plan manner early stage bank provide large amount liquidity fast pace ordinary years. however, i explain previously, japan's economic financial condition likely continue severe. in situation, bank's policy priority placed, time being, secure market stability facilitate corporate finance – second third main area bank's conduct monetary policy. in event, bank continue 8 bi review 38/2009 examine carefully development financial market corporate finance take necessary measure decisive manner without predetermine view. close remark today i explain economic financial development home abroad policy response authority around world, include bank japan. a i say begin speech, current economic downturn process correct various imbalance accumulate past several years, severe situation therefore likely continue time. i believe otaru also significantly affect global economic downturn, sharp drop export russia decrease number domestic foreign tourists. it also true, however, domestic overseas financial markets, especially money markets, start gradually regain stability. furthermore, effect major countries' fiscal monetary policies, well measure implement secure stability financial systems, expect felt gradually. however, must bear mind important fact policy measure temporarily mitigate financial economic shock reduce degree economic downturn – words, merely measure buy time. resolution various excess private sector subsequent establishment new business model indispensable realize sustainable economic growth medium long term. fiscal monetary policy support facilitate adjustment positive effort private sector. japan's economy expose many severe downturn decades, every time enhance capability create new product service add value base experience, strengthen foundation future growth. good example effort make recession 1980s cause strong yen 1990s burst bubble economy. i hear reassure remark corporate managers, example, report make meet general manager bank's branches, determine continue investment research development, human resource training, merger acquisitions, prepare future despite, also of, economic downturn. in addition, japanese firm continue work assiduously research development energy-saving eco-friendly technologies, field competitive, believe field growth potential. otaru history pioneer city, support development financial economic activity hokkaido prefecture. it great potential, city large number tourist attraction function distribution center trade northeast asia whole hokkaido prefecture. i much hope you, corporate managers, determine continue develop creativity meet current economic downturn well severe competition, that, overcome difficulties, japan's economy, include otaru, transform flexible, strong economy fully cope global economic swing may occur repeatedly future. the bank support firms' proactive activity financial side, time utmost central bank realize early return japan's economy sustainable growth path price stability. thank much kind attention. bi review 38/2009 9 nout wellink: basel committee initiative response financial crisis remark dr nout wellink, president netherlands bank chairman basel committee bank supervision, committee economic monetary affair european parliament (econ), brussels, 30 march 2009. * * * thank you, madame chairwoman member econ committee, opportunity share basel committee’s strategy initiative respond present financial crisis relate regulation, supervision risk management bank sector. the work basel committee consistent support initiative financial stability forum leader g20. in formulate response financial crisis, necessary address near term challenge relate weaken economic financial situation long term regulatory structure issues. the two link need manage carefully transition current measure sustainable long term framework. with regard near term situation, clear bank sector heart adverse feedback loop financial real side. we move i would call mark-to-market illiquidity phase crisis relate legacy asset fundamental credit cycle part crisis. this associate large write down corporate retail lend books, i believe phase continue play medium term. it critical supervisor comprehensive strategy deal phase crisis associate impact banks. that essential restore stability financial system economies. when come long term, need establish clear target future regulatory system substantially reduce probability severity crisis like one currently work though. by provide clarity future regulatory framework, help re-establish near term confidence, reduce risk competitive distortion limit degree uncertainty public private sector. also, emphasise reform phase appropriate horizon, reduce risk action contribute procyclicality system. in regard plan closely align view express de larosière group’s report. this group’s report strongly appreciate basel committee. let say word step basel committee undertake produce robust supervisory regulatory framework bank sector. such framework need four key components: 1. strong regulatory capital, 2. robust standard bank liquidity, 3. enhance risk management, governance supervision, 4. good transparency i would like say word components. regulatory capital the basel committee, press release issue march 12th follow recent quarterly meeting, underscore importance strong capital base necessary condition strong bank sector. it state level capital bank system need strengthen raise resilience future episode economic financial stress. the bi review 38/2009 1 committee combination initiatives, i describe momentarily. our press release also note committee review regulatory minimum level capital, take account initiatives. our objective arrive total level quality capital high current basel i basel ii framework appropriate promote stability bank sector long run. this effort phase time frame aggravate current stress. build three pillar basel ii framework, need develop resilient capital framework multiple safeguard build it. first, need improve risk coverage. one procyclical dynamic failure risk management capital framework capture key exposure advance crisis. for example, risk arise securitisation activity – especially so-called resecuritisations – well certain trade book exposure sufficiently captured. i could also point exposure complex financial instrument experience severe decline value impair liquidity. the basel committee’s response therefore enhance basel ii framework risk comprehensively accurately covered. second, need solid capital base back risks. we achieve strengthen quality, consistency, transparency high form tier 1 capital. it must base clear definition capital need transparent must global ensure competitive equality. the basel committee already strong foundation definition, namely common equity reserves. we need deal many difference relate definitional issues, deduction capital treatment prudential filters. third, need address procyclicality. procyclicality complex issue product many factors. at basic level, result animal spirits, produce exuberant behaviour upswing cycle, fear downturn. we cannot change behaviour, seek dampen channel manifest itself. these include account capital frameworks, liquidity regimes, risk management compensation, margining, basic infrastructure, transparency, way supervision carry out. in case regulatory capital regime, need address excess cyclicality minimum requirement credit cycle maintain appropriate risk coverage sensitivity. the basel committee put place process systematically ass quantitative impact basel ii level cyclicality capital. we take appropriate step result capital monitor suggest capital framework unduly procyclical. but even importantly, need build countercyclical buff capital framework provision practices. this help ensure reserve capital build period earn growth, draw period stress. the committee work translate important principle concrete proposal. the approach need robust standard apply global level translate national contexts. finally, capital framework need underpin non-risk base supplementary measure. this particularly important basel i-based floor phase out. just like expect bank manage variety measure ass risk (such net gross exposures, var stress tests), supervisor also must constrain evaluate risk lens single, risk base measure. we need risk base measure interact simple metric act floor help contain build excessive leverage bank system, one key source current crisis. the basel committee work develop year end specific proposal area. key principle guide work measure must simple 2 bi review 38/2009 transparent, must address issue relate account difference off-balance sheet exposures, among others. finally, need interact risk base measure prudent sensible manner. once different stream work advanced, take together form basis committee’s assessment appropriate level minimum capital put place long term. but whatever – get back link near long term – must raise global capital requirement middle crisis. capital buff use must provide clear road map headed. liquidity let say word work liquidity. capital necessary condition bank system soundness sufficient. of equal importance strong liquidity base. many bank adequate capital level get trouble manage liquidity prudent manner. in response shortcomings, basel committee last september issue principle sound liquidity risk management supervision. this significant step toward set new global soundness standard constitute robust liquidity risk measurement, management supervision. but first step. the next step monitor implementation principle put place process that. we also develop benchmarks, tool metric supervisor use promote consistent liquidity standard cross-border banks. good risk management supervision i discuss importance strong global standard capital liquidity, enough. if firm poor governance risk management culture supervision weak, could find type problem facing. we propose build basel ii’s supervisory review process – pillar 2 – raise bar risk management supervision practices. this past january, basel committee publish comment supplemental pillar 2 guidance. the purpose guidance address flaw risk management practice reveal crisis, many case symptom fundamental shortcoming governance structure financial institutions. the committee strengthen supervisory guidance link pillar 2 review process. it focus firm-wide governance risk management; capture risk off-balance sheet exposure securitisation activities; effectively manage risk concentrations; provide incentive good manage risk return long-term, include compensation practices. moreover, need move towards macroprudential approach supervision. what mean? in discussion basel committee, emphasise need focus supervision soundness individual bank broad financial stability objectives. this inform focus limit supervisory resource develop supervisory regulatory tools. transparency one main amplifier crisis lack transparency regard risk profile institution structure products. moreover, process product value often lack rigour. lack transparency risk profile product financial bi review 38/2009 3 institution cause massive retrenchment investor counterparties amplify deleveraging process. to help mitigate behaviour, third pillar basel ii framework – market discipline – set series require disclosure intend complement two pillar basel ii framework. this allow market participant ass capital adequacy bank key piece information scope application, capital, risk exposure risk assessment process. the committee’s january proposal enhance pillar 3 focus disclosure relate securitisation, off-balance-sheet exposure trade activities. we believe propose enhance disclosure requirement help avoid recurrence market uncertainty strength banks' balance sheet relate capital market activities. conclusion take together, recent plan initiative basel committee promote robust bank sector limit risk weakness bank amplify shock financial real sectors. because measure far reach ambitious, need phase reasonable timeframe. i also note invitation join basel committee extend recently bric country – brazil, russia, india china – well australia, korea mexico. the expansion membership help enhance global reach acceptance standards. the effort basel committee need occur broad context achieve right balance scope depth regulation. failure produce adequate regulation "bank like" activity mean bank sector “pushing string”, activity simply migrate elsewhere. i therefore strongly welcome activity body like g20, financial stability forum joint forum ensure sector subject appropriate degree regulation, oversight transparency commensurate systemic significance. the committee actively contribute effort finally, madame chairwoman, i would like thank econ committee hold important meeting. the official sector critical juncture action take response far-reaching long-lasting effect. 4 bi review 38/2009 zhou xiaochuan: on save ratio keynote address dr zhou xiaochuan, governor people’s bank china, high level conference host central bank malaysia, kuala lumpur, 10 february 2009. * * * there commonly accept explanation save consumption behavior economics statistic community. with transmission current financial crisis, discussion cause crisis intensified. some believe high save ratio east asia oil-producing country one major cause global imbalance crisis. this paper attempt explore factor affect save ratio, examine reason behind high save ratio east asian oil-producing country low save ratio u.s. it also provide brief description save ratio china correspond adjustment approaches, well set option adjust ratio. major view paper discuss high level conference host bank negara malaysia february 10, 2009. i. factor affect save ratio the term “savings” paper include domestic savings, current account surplus foreign reserve. a now, see sufficient solid academic study illustrate linkage save ratio determinant factors, level wealth measure per caput gdp, foreign exchange rate, development financial intermediation capital market, tradition, demographic structure social security system. while exchange rate statistically correlate save ratio degree, coefficient generally low correlation usually insignificant. it therefore seem save ratio can’t adjust simply adjust exchange rate. identify factor determine save ratio major policy challenge countries. we come effective policy tool kit identify determine factor impact save ratio. ii. cause high save ratio east asia oil-producing country tradition, cultural, family structure, demographic structure stage economic development major reason high save ratio east asia. first, east asia country influence confucianism, value thrift, self-discipline, zhong yong middle grind (low-key), anti-extravagancy. second, may able trace cultural difference large number textbook literature different countries. for instance, latin american country similar level national wealth east asian country low save ratios. this attribute cultural difference region, people high propensity consumption tend quickly use salaries. third, family tie strong east asian countries, family shoulder social responsibility provide elderly bring children. fourth, accord life cycle hypothesis franco modigliani, money save meet future pension healthcare need share work age population increases. when study phase economic growth, time exceptionally high economic growth, incremental income saved, result unusually high save ratio. china fit above-mentioned two condition high save ratio. japan u.s. also demonstrate contribution factor determine save ratio. similar u.s., japan develop country high per caput income. the social security system two country respective weaknesses. however, japan’s bi review 37/2009 1 save ratio much high u.s. this largely ascribe cultural, family value demographic feature japan, fairly similar east asian countries. some argue inadequate social security system lead high save ratio. though logically sound, argument lack adequate empirical support. moreover, base assumption human behavior rational people increase save future healthcare pension needs. in fact, assumption necessarily stand. high save ratio oil-producing country different reasons. endow rich oil resource far exceed normal demand, country naturally accumulate wealth form savings. the elementary textbook economics always start “supply, demand prices”, lead reader believe certain price (e.g., exchange rate interest rate) determine behavior save consumption. however, fact level save ratio influence wide range factors, can’t adjust simply change nominal exchange rate. factor national tradition, culture, family structures, demographic social security system can’t change short term. a result, may take long time policy yield intend impacts. iii. implication asian financial crisis save ratio east asia save gdp compose resident, corporate government savings. if total save exceed domestic investment, surplus take form foreign reserves. to analyze drastic increase imbalance save trade east asian country emerge 1997, need examine impact asian financial crisis save ratio countries. the high save ratio large foreign reserve east asian country result defensive reaction predatory speculation. during asian financial crisis, rampant speculation hedge fund cause large capital inflow subsequent reversal countries, exacerbate economic woes. people country shocked, disgust speculative attacks. afterwards, many suggest unregulated predatory speculation cause crisis, appropriate international regulation needed. however, various considerations, country regulations, fail see need adjust regulatory frameworks. international organization also fail perform regulatory responsibility abnormal capital flows, force east asian country amass foreign reserve fend themselves. the increase save ratio current account surplus east asian country also result rescue plan design international organizations. the rescue plan silent regulate cross-border speculative capital flows, otherwise put scrutiny. instead, excessive stringent conditionality imposed, demand crisis-stricken country adopt tight fiscal monetary policies, raise interest rates, cut fiscal deficit increase foreign reserves. in decade thereafter, east asian country learn lessons, increase foreign reserve domestic save order beef defense financial crisis. of course, also vulnerability economic development models, foreign debt management well institutional arrangement east asian countries. sweep structural reform corporate financial sector launch wake crisis, social security system improved, education healthcare system reformed. however, take time effort take effect. 2 bi review 37/2009 iv. can china adjust save ratio effectively? during asian financial crisis, china, responsible large economy, devalue currency pay price – fairly slow recovery. the endeavor chinese authority maintain stability rmb odds contribute stem spread financial crisis. after crisis, china intensify effort revamp corporate government sector deepen market-oriented reforms. profitability enterprises, especially soes, increased; fiscal position improve residents’ income improve steadily. start 2002, save ratio begin surge, steadily rise resident save remarkable increase corporate savings. china’s save ratio increase 37.5% 1998 49.9% 2007. during period, ratio corporate sector disposable income national disposable income increase 13% 22.5%, share government disposable income total increase 2 percentage points. the rate corporate save gdp china high compare country world. this closely relate unsolved distortion cost/profit enterprise china’s economic transition. under plan economy, housing, healthcare, pension provide enterprise government, weren’t account wages. this dampen people’s incentive save. save even consider “involuntary” people regularly line queue shop consumer good short supply. after reform 1990s, “iron bowl” (lifelong secure job welfare) system smash enterprise stop provide pension house free. however, effective social security system place either. these significantly increase incentive precautionary savings. nevertheless, real cost labor take time reflect cost enterprises. a result, extraordinary profit cost distortion find way liability account pension, healthcare house employees, should, lead significant surge corporate savings. this broadly explain increase household corporate savings. this also people suggest part state-owned share list company transfer national social security fund. the chinese authority clear policy intention reduce save ratio. since 2005, boost domestic demand encourage consumption important component national economic policies. these policy would eventually bring save ratio. yet, in-depth study need identify factor influence save ratio, elasticity respect factors, specific adjustment measure take. besides, incomplete reform area affect adjustment save ratio. although private enterprise china already market-driven free cost distortion, reform public sector incomplete despite considerable achievement reform soes. the lack clearly-defined fully monetize cost structure hamper adjustment save ratio. it therefore important expedite reform public sector transformation government functions. v. observation low household save ratio u.s. the u.s. household save ratio recent year go two phases: mid-1990s, range 7-10%; 1997, decline remarkably pronounce “twin deficits”, especially trade deficit. some attribute low save so-called “euphoria” u.s. economic performance since mid-1990s. specifically, late 1980s early 1990s, collapse central plan system former soviet union eastern europe, growth region steadily slipped. in 1990s, japanese economy also trap prolong stagnation, eu’s economic performance lackluster due structural problem include rigid labor market. the u.s., large economy, boast optimal economic system seemingly unparalleled bi review 37/2009 3 world. the remain challenge, term economic system, come asia; 1997, asian economy suffer heavy blows. in contrast, u economy demonstrate strong flexibility resilience, recover rapidly 9/11 attack burst it bubble recent years. all augment euphoria sentiment market, turn influence save behavior u.s. residents. however, unprecedented magnitude current financial crisis expect dramatically dampen euphoria sentiments. the time series show round low save high consumption u commence mid-1990s. in contrast, save ratio east asian country surge asian financial crisis china's save ratio begin increase 2002. the difference time distribution indicate significant causal relationship two. vi. option adjust save ratio global save imbalance exist many reasons. it seem inappropriate link save ratio exchange rate, also unrealistic resolve long-term issue short run. one should, instead, adopt broad comprehensive mindset examine imbalance savings. first, comprehensive set prescription needed. although u.s. can’t sustain growth pattern high consumption low savings, right time raise save ratio moment. it need strike balance stimulate consumption facilitate economic recovery. on hand, east asian nation attend economic growth model, economic structure, price system like, order bring save ratio. of course, reform exchange rate mechanism part prescription. the chinese government focus boost domestic demand sustain economic growth effort tackle ongoing financial crisis conduct economic adjustment. the rmb 4-trillion yuan stimulus package, one large world, mainly expenditure program. the program underscore public welfare, job creation, income growth rural area underprivileged groups. second, country international organization strengthen cooperation intensify regulation international speculative capital flows. the current financial crisis underscore necessity reinforce regulation international capital flow enhance transparency. international organization country concern help develop country establish robust early-warning system guard attack predatory speculation. international cooperation strengthen improve aid mechanism. in case emerge market experience temporary bop difficulties, international aid swift, conditionality attach reduced. this would encourage country low save include foreign reserve expand domestic demand. third, appropriate measure take channel save develop country emerge markets. save flow emerge market advance economy neither rational consistent intention advance economy increase domestic savings. however, adjustment save ratio east asian country see immediate effects. meanwhile, save oil-producing country may remain high level long oil price don’t plunge further. therefore, global save imbalance remain time future. the top priority present facilitate rational flow save improve allocation efficiency. one option redirect surplus save develop country emerge markets, abundant resources, low labor cost, lack capital. these economy future growth engine global economy. 4 bi review 37/2009 finally, reform international monetary system advanced. currently, u.s. dollar use international trade financial transactions, also important reserve currency. the imf data show u.s. dollar account 63.9% total foreign reserve end 2007. when country increase save save form dollar denominate foreign reserves, capital inevitably flow u.s.. in short run, u.s. may need capital inflow deal financial crisis; long run, large capital inflow best interest make adjustment economic growth model. moreover, over-concentration foreign asset one particular currency may bring undesired consequences. therefore, addition upgrade regulatory cooperation rationalize save allocation, international community move forward reform international monetary system. effort make strengthen surveillance economic financial policy major reserve currency country enhance status sdr, advance international monetary system towards diversification long run. bi review 37/2009 5 ardian fullani: recent development global albanian economy speech mr ardian fullani, governor bank albania, regional meeting, korça, 13 february 2009. * * * i feel privilege among again, marvellous audience intellectual value professionalism. it second time i visit korca capacity governor bank albania i observe pleasure city make admirable progress. allow emphasise korça, charm hospitable city, give always give pleasure. usually favourite topic governor monetary policy, financial stability, bank money, structural reform economic-financial policies. however, current situation make inevitable communication recent development global economy general albanian economy particular face with. global economy confront numerous challenges. 2008 year-end january 2009 definitely confirm recession usa, germany, britain japan, let alone many european emerge economies, ukraine, hungary, byelorussia, serbia country. while risk financial stability shock overcome develop economies, economic situation deteriorate more, unemployment increase rapidly, along output reduction. in meantime, emerge economy experience deterioration financial conditions, tighten lending, pressure exchange rate time significant reduce demand important branch economy. i make introduction make understand global economy experience great contraction, concern shock intensity extension, never experience modern history second world war. many taboo fall continue fall. the grave financial crisis ignite erupt heart capitalism, usa spread quickly world. though may sound paradoxical, economy resistant tsunami. accord available official data judge upon number indirect indicators, conclude economic activity 2008 perform line early 2008 projections. generally economic activity home sustain domestic financial resources, albanian bank system dynamic effective channel save towards fund corporate production household consumption this process also facilitate macroeconomic stability, enable fall risk perception economy. dwell briefly fulfilment legal obligation bank albania, i would like highlight inflation return within 2-4 percent target bank albania second half year. the relaxation supply-side shock appropriate monetary condition key factor enable balance demand supply-side factors. during 2008 key interest rate hold unchanged, 6.25 percent, aim materialize anchor economic agents’ inflation expectation close 3 percent target bank albania. money market activity condition performance monetary indicator real economy. in response developments, bank albania intervene money market inject liquidity different maturity terms. also, bi review 37/2009 1 order good satisfy banks’ needs, bank albania change november repo auction form auction undetermined amounts. in end january 2009 bank albania’s supervisory council decide reduce key interest rate 0.50 percentage point, record turn point monetary policy stance term ease it. however, i underline development 2008 year-end early 2009 enable objective real assessment overall economic-financial situation country present future. let mention two three them, bring insight attention. 1. during january 2009 logical reluctance individual towards bank, reflect mainly form deposit withdrawal period october-december 2008, come end. naturally good news indicate albanian bank system pass difficult exam, many “colleagues” region beyond could pass. the liquidity situation ameliorated. symmetric distribution among bank promote increase volume interbank market transactions, turn back normal trade levels. in response bank albania’s reaction, associate reduce interest rate instrument maturities. be accidental? be merely destiny? no, neither destiny, turn back slogan centralise economy era. accord late data, bank system appear profitable. return equity 11.35 percent 2008. in meantime, bank extend investment also increase equity. capital adequacy rate 17.23 percent total asset risk-rated off-balance sheet items, loan portfolio quality satisfactory levels. year 2008 coincide increase prudential policy bank albania term adopt conservatory approach. the pass new bank law, 2007 development credit bubble explode usa high lend rate 3-4 last year assess prudence bank albania. therefore, early 2008 bank albania organise first open forum bank system, submit open communication, new packet prudential regulation discuss there, aim consolidate financial stability country. the bank albania’s supervisory council give way approval whole propose packet, thus create effective vaccine, produce appropriate antibody provide immunity i mention early speech. which modification increase resistance much? • in compliance new law, approve new criterion calculating, supervise report large exposure bank parent bank connect subjects, aim manage risk derive concentrate exposure them. • in order achieve effective management, new regulation drafted, strengthen internal audit bank branch foreign banks. it regard internal audit part general governance banks. it ensure platform create efficient internal audit system, main factor management administration bank branch foreign banks. 2 bi review 37/2009 • a special importance give transparency bank financial product services. this another aspect intervene 2008. the new requirement standardise way form supply customer information bank product services. special emphasis lay obligatory publication effective interest rate deposit loans. through information bank customer may get acquaint calculation loan effective interest rate, element credit deposit contract, market product services, maintain customer data confidentiality, deal customer complaint establishment specific structure relate complaints. • part new package also standardization obligatory information bank branch foreign bank disclose main business banks, organisation management, financial performance position, risk management account policies. • take consideration international situation aim good diversification risk derive concentration bank investment international financial markets, bank albania’s supervisory council make amendment regulation risk management, consist mainly put prudential benchmark large exposure indicator technique collateral calculation recognition. after present work do 2008, naturally right claim act appropriately, take many prevent actions, help absorb negative effect recent developments. 2. initial data december 2008 indicate contraction credit economy, particularly credit foreign currency. allow explain one grave symptom accompany late financial crisis internationally. this real develop economies, credit economy interbank channel almost stop function operate minimum levels. though peripherally, development materialise even economy. however, i believe that, really matter future. of specific contact bank operate albania, draw conclusion share concern drastic stoppage credit economy would gravely damage economic activity country financial system’s position. therefore, constantly communicate banks, guarantee 2009 albanian economy receive deserve financial support bank system. i confident presence senior representative bank system hall testify awareness understand concern. the decision make day ago bank albania, also state press release supervisory council’s meeting, create “more breath economic activity country”. i feel well observe bank system already reacted. treasury-bill interbank market interest rate reduction evidenced. 3. interbank money market development, necessary bridge enhance effectiveness monetary policy transmission, always bank albania’s focus. a interbank market development subject discussion many meet conduct bank albania. in meet bank highlight credit risk one main obstacle development market. to minimise risk, bank albania draft law repurchase agreement sample contracts. bi review 37/2009 3 the pass law finalise bank albania’s endeavour set appropriate legal infrastructure market repurchase agreement among commercial banks. follow passing, bank albania hold number meetings, aim clarify core elements. the main purpose meet speed conclude relevant contract among banks, order materialise practical implementation law. the period leave behind regard sufficient finalize process draft sign individual contract repurchase agreements. therefore, i draw attention bank system proceed quickly, spar time sign respective contracts. the process finalization necessarily follow daily quotation bank term interbank borrow lending. the late decision bank albania’s supervisory council serf spirit transparency increase customer protection, make compulsory quotation mortgage loan rate basis bank albania’s key interest rate. distinguish participants, recently bank albania constantly state year 2009 carry numerous challenges, context sharp global issues, make task difficult. however, i would highlight assess objectively current situation near future expression prudence. we bank albania remain commit monitor cautiously economic-financial developments, will take proper action consolidate macroeconomic financial balances. in way accomplish constitutional service country’s sustainable growth development. in difficult task, i avail opportunity invite stakeholder broad public become part dialogue find way optimal solutions, order minimize negative effect international economy transmit country. 4 bi review 37/2009 axel a weber: the role forecast central bank keynote address professor axel a weber, president deutsche bundesbank, conference “forecasting monetary policy”, organise deutsche bundesbank, freie universität berlin viessmann european research centre, berlin, 23 march 2009. * * * lady gentlemen, it great pleasure participate conference able share view contribution forecast make monetary policy. 1 the role forecast eurosystem the reason central banker strong interest forecast straightforward: substantial variable lag monetary policy transmission mechanism, central bank cannot influence current inflation output. give time lags, widely recognise monetary policy forward-looking take medium-term perspective. furthermore, publication forecast help anchor expectation firm households, thereby make central bank effective fulfil objective. a consequence, forecast inflation, output macroeconomic variable essential input monetary policy decision-making process. forecast also important role play eurosystem, albeit le prominent one central bank pursue inflation-targeting strategy. the eurosystem’s govern council base comprehensive assessment risk price stability policy decision broad spectrum information provide two analytical tools: economic analysis monetary analysis. the monetary analysis ass medium long-term development inflation base well-established relationship money price long horizons. monetary analysis take account development wide range monetary indicator include m3, component counterparts, notably credit, measure excess liquidity. the economic analysis identify short medium-term risk price stability. it include regular monitor broad set non-monetary economic financial variables, development overall output, labour market development financial market indicators. projection key macroeconomic variable carry eurosystem staff also integral part economic analysis.. of course, difference strategy mean forecast play somewhat different role eurosystem central bank pursue inflation target strategy: for example, important note forecast carry sole responsibility eurosystem staff, govern council. in contrast decision-making body inflation-targeting central banks, bank england’s mpc, ecb govern council exert influence forecast assumptions. in two-pillar strategy, forecast represent all-encompassing tool – would case pure inflation targeters. instead, projection merely one input factor economic analysis, which, together monetary analysis, support robustness govern council’s assessment risk price stability. despite difference monetary policy strategy, eurosystem publish projection inflation output four time year. this do reason transparency, and, least, good guide expectation future monetary policy actions. in addition, many national central bank (ncbs) euro area, include bundesbank, start publish national gdp inflation projection part communication strategy. these projection useful by-product eurosystem’s bi review 36/2009 1 regular staff projections, carry jointly ecb ncbs central bank therefore natural interest apply best forecast method available. economic research department central bank aim incorporate late academic development forecast method forecast practice – provide turn improvement exist procedures. against backdrop, i would like discus development lately interest eurosystem bundesbank. first, i touch recent development short-term forecast elaborate uncertainty risk macroeconomic forecasts. 2 recent progress short-term forecast to enhance policy effectiveness, eurosystem spend lot resource develop forecast method model and, result, see substantial progress recent years. let start say yet unique best approach forecast central banks; general, however, central bank try pursue full-information strategies. in many cases, forecast procedure may best describe model-based forecast complement valuable information experts. with respect model-based forecasting, central bank adopt so-called “suite-of-models” approach. instead rely one model, employ large variety different econometric model broad set monitor time series. the suite-of-models approach advantage take account model uncertainty extent neglect potentially important information. a individual design central bank’s forecast model, may differ respect variable coverage, econometric rigour economic theory incorporates. basically, however, macroeconomic variable predict two different ways: structural macroeconometric models, include traditional multi-equation model dsge models, short-term forecast models, usually base time-series analysis. although structural macroeconometric model remain workhorse use forecast policy simulations, short-term forecast model receive increase attention eurosystem recent years. why short-term horizon important? for reason i already mentioned, monetary policy decision require timely information current state economy. such information always available, however. gdp important indicator macroeconomic activity is, instance, release considerable time delay quarter. in germany, gdp release five six week end reference quarter. for example, expect federal statistical office release first-quarter gdp data 15 may 2009. to allow assessment development real activity current quarter, central bank’s economist must therefore provide so-called “nowcast”. hundred variable include high-frequency indicator are, principle, available purpose. think, instance, financial survey data. but policy-makers pursue full-information strategy, central banker would like sum (at time conflicting) information content variable single measure. the workhorse model (structural multiple-equation model dsge models) base quarterly data therefore ill-suited evaluate vast amount high-frequency data available. by contrast, modern short-term forecast model well able process large datasets. what more, also deal datasets unbalance data sample different frequency (monthly – quarterly) subject different publication lags, lead miss observation end sample (the “ragged edge” multivariate data). 2 bi review 36/2009 the prominent recent example short-term model are: large factor models, mixed-frequency state-space models, bridge equations, mixed-data sample (midas) regressions. unlike structural macro model dsge models, model base economic theory, modern time-series econometrics. research eurosystem bundesbank show exploit mixed-frequency data indeed useful forecasting, balance data time aggregation quarterly frequency would lead loss information end sample.1 furthermore, show model work particularly well short horizons, whereas structural macroeconometric model dsge model tend perform well medium long term.2 this highlight short-term model substitute traditional macroeconometric dsge models. however, add another piece valuable information entire forecast process. to mind, short-term model therefore regard complementary tool large “suite models” use within central banks. 3 uncertainty risk macroeconomic forecast while central tendency forecast, point forecast, generally receive public attention, forecast uncertainty forecast risk two important feature forecast exercises. uncertainty risk two different things. i therefore go cover separately. point forecast surround uncertainty, knowledge degree forecast uncertainty essential decision-makers. basically, identify five source forecast uncertainty: • uncertainty future shock endogenous variable (eg shock consumption labour demand), • uncertainty assumption concern exogenous variable (eg assumption oil price exchange rates), • uncertainty model parameter (eg marginal propensity consume), • uncertainty data (eg revision gdp) • uncertainty model (eg linear non-linear effect oil price gdp). rank source forecast uncertainty accord importance difficult task, since impact depend variable forecast horizon studied. moreover, effect source forecast uncertainty independent other. finally, extremely large variety model would need evaluate effect model uncertainty. however, give model, uncertainty future shock assumption concern exogenous variable often turn great contributor aggregate uncertainty uncertainty parameter data. although source forecast uncertainty known, forecast uncertainty course uncertain, must therefore estimated. many forecast institution convey information forecast uncertainty use projection range publish forecasts. in practice, variety measure uncertainty use compute projection ranges: 1 see schumacher c j breitung (2008), real-time forecast german gdp base large factor model monthly quarterly data, international journal forecasting, 24, 368-398; marcellino m c schumacher (2007), factor-midas now- forecast ragged-edge data: a model comparison german gdp, deutsche bundesbank discussion paper no 34/07. 2 see wang, mc (2009), compare dsge model factor model: out-of-sample forecast experiment, journal forecast 28, 167-182. bi review 36/2009 3 • dispersion board members’ point forecast (eg federal reserve), • confidence interval base past forecast error judgement board member (eg bank england) • dispersion measure derive past forecast errors, mean absolute past forecast error (eg bundesbank and, recently, eurosystem staff projections). the computation eurosystem staff projection range change autumn last year. instead derive past forecast errors, range base bayesian vector autoregressions (bvars) account shock estimation uncertainty. the range conditional assumption several exogenous variable oil prices, exchange rate foreign demand. in general, model-based projection range two possible advantage calculate uncertainty base past errors. if sample forecast error small, uncertainty past forecast uncertainty large. moreover, case structural change, past forecast uncertainty mislead measure future forecast uncertainty. but structural change incorporate model uncertainty derived. however, model-based projection range also two major disadvantages. first, effect model uncertainty ignored. second, information contain model variables, typically incorporate forecast mean subjective adjustment forecaster, ignored. how best represent forecast uncertainty still subject intensive discussion eurosystem, final decision yet taken. furthermore, take account forecast uncertainty may vary markedly time, neither past forecast uncertainty forecast uncertainty derive model always good basis assess current forecast uncertainty. this one reason forecast uncertainty convey range eurosystem staff projection may supplement qualitative assessment ecb govern council. (for example, december 2008, year-end uncertainty rising, govern council conclude “view …, economic outlook remain surround exceptionally high degree uncertainty.”). in addition uncertainty, forecast might subject upward downward risks. that is, realise data might le likely come point forecast point forecast. information risk great relevance decision-makers. if risk price stability lie upside, could, example, call restrictive policy response risk downside. a case forecast uncertainty, risk forecast are, course, difficult quantify estimated. to begin with, estimation often rely subjective assessment risks. these assessment start input variable (eg risk oil prices, exchange rate output gap), aggregate determine risk relevant variable (such inflation output). however, risk might also reflect asymmetry view decision-making body. for example, view hold minority within body could represent risk. forecast institution convey information forecast risk different ways: quantitative manner, communicate shape density forecast (eg bank england) qualitative manner, communicate verbally (eg ecb govern council). while quantitative risk statement appear precise first glance, forget that, general, extremely difficult forecast risk forecast. it either require correct assumption make risk input variable correct aggregation, words, correct model. or require asymmetry view 4 bi review 36/2009 decision-making body correctly reflect true asymmetry forecast density. doubt express whether requirement fulfil satisfactory manner.3 i therefore rather sceptical ability forecast macroeconomic risk precise, quantitative manner. to mind, assess risk qualitative, verbal manner strike good balance express view degree uncertainty relate forecast and, time, show awareness general limitation risk assessments. 4 current assessment economic development forecast risk uncertainty currently particular interest central bankers, forecast uncertainty reach comparatively high level. because scale speed current economic downturn unlike anything see last decades, forecast uncertainty present incorporate econometric analysis limit extent only. conversely, “judgement-based risk management” become extremely important. however, despite active exchange modeller macroeconomic experts, economic forecast 2009 2010 repeatedly revise downward since last autumn downside risk realise euro area globally. yet onwards, substantial macroeconomic stimulus way extensive financial system rescue scheme place, risk economic outlook euro area become balanced. on one hand, confidence growth effect may strong anticipate result enormous scale expansionary monetary fiscal policy worldwide. on hand, remains, course, risk economic downturn euro area might become severe staff projection indicate, instance negative feedback effect financial system. nevertheless, degree uncertainty surround outlook economy inflation remain substantial. in order fulfil mandate contribute financial stability sustainable economic growth, eurosystem provide unlimited liquidity support euro-area bank system since october last year. the govern council decide continue non-standard liquidity support beyond end 2009 case. a direct consequence ample supply liquidity, eurosystem augment balance sheet 600 billion euro since start financial crisis august 2007. at time, monetary policy operation visible effect overnight money market rate euro area. furthermore, ecb govern council cut interest rate sharply unprecedented levels. and still room cut interest rate further. but essential bear mind expansionary monetary policy come price create breed grind future risk price stability. it might therefore prove useful keep hand instrument enable u reverse monetary policy stance first sign recovery

day, organize university colombo, colombo, 26 march 2009. * * * consciously unconsciously, use statistic everything day day life. when say rain yesterday, simply pronounce fact observe happened. when say rain now, mention something observe happening. when say rain tomorrow, predict future event. our life full statements: fact experience u past, fact happen experience present fact feel would happen future. what happen happen personal experiences. what happen learn judgement base experiences. if keep experience learn judgment ourselves, then, would form subject matter statistics. it become statistic share others. hence, statistic basically, observing, analysing, learn share fact real world. that share fact need necessarily quantitative measurable form. they simple expression verbal form others could form opinion happen real world. statistic heart religion when express personal experiences, step dangerous territory. our personal experience guide emotional subjective feelings. when share others, invite accept emotional subjective feel experience same. this run problems. unless others emotional subjective feelings, reason accept experience experiences. hence, statistic share everyone necessarily base objective considerations. in words, statistic heart. it religion pure objectivity. it convey fact observe individual free personal bias prejudices. only impersonal statistical framework capability serve people intend use make judgment real world. how economic development occurs? an economy play specific role towards members. it produce supply good service demand consideration timeliness, quantity quality. when economy produce good service large large volume year year, new wealth created, raise well-being members. the continuous creation wealth people manner raise overall welfare level bring call “economic development”. that become prime objective society today demonstrate choice theme stat day event. wealth create society people make choice consumption production, decide appropriate production method take risk do. a vital input use process “information”. statistic nothing another name information present sophisticate analytical form. hence, society desire attain high level economic development cannot disregard importance statistics. bi review 36/2009 1 the use statistic input if statistic input, like input, demand them. if statistic help people create wealth, prepare pay price acquire them. when price statistics, supply statistic well. it, therefore, connote market statistics, like market inputs. this mean people information trade market package sell it. the package do way user would able consume statistic instant product without process in-house. this big challenge statistician face today: sell product would-be user readily consumable product help create wealth. the market information statistic there market base statistics-producers develop countries. the market agent ready pay price order acquire statistics. the producer statistic conduct frequent market surveys, analyse results, supply line price help market agent create wealth. unfortunately, sri lanka, market base statistics-producers. the collection analysis vital data useful market agent do governmental organisations. like product supply government, data also supply public good free charge. even governmental agency could sell statistic price, venture so, guide principle “doing utmost benefit” people social service. the country too, therefore, expect free good governmental organisations. but create problem know “the agent-principal problem”

papademos, vice president european central bank, conference “after the storm: the future face europe’s financial system”, organise bruegel, national bank belgium international monetary fund, brussels, 24 march 2009. * * * i. introduction this conference provide excellent forum enrich stimulate debate “the future face europe’s financial system”, subject topical highly policy relevant. in remarks, i focus two issues: • first, key lesson ongoing financial crisis eu financial supervisory policy; • second, objective responsibility macro-prudential supervision, instrument institutional requirement effective performance macro-prudential tasks. ii. the lesson crisis financial supervisory policy a first lesson financial crisis consequence factor process affect overall macro-financial environment well behaviour individual institution function specific market segments. it joint influence macro micro factor result market excess emergence systemic risk unprecedented magnitude complexity. at macroeconomic level, large persist global imbalances, rapid credit expansion protract period time, benign environment low inflation high growth, foster huge increase leverage, significant underprice risk consequent divergence asset price fundamental values. at micro-economic level, financial innovations, notably securitisation process, although principle help good diversify distribute risk, implement manner foster improper incentive result loosen bank lend standards, creation complex opaque product whose real value embed risk difficult assess, establishment off-balance sheet investment vehicle lead concentration (credit market) risk maturity mismatch contribute severity duration crisis. a second lesson crisis nature magnitude systemic risk financial sector relate potential illiquidity insolvency large bank big regulate financial institutions, also depend degree “interdependence” “interconnectedness” financial institution markets. this “interconnectedness” reflect variety direct indirect linkage financial system involve institution market regulate well subject sufficient, any, regulatory oversight. this second category include hedge fund also off-balance sheet financial entities, structure investment vehicles, well securitisation market, market credit default swap (cds). in respect, two point relevant design regulatory policies. first, size non-bank financial institution overall magnitude activity “non-bank, non regulate sector” become significant pose systemic risks. second, consequence first, “interconnectedness” bi review 35/2009 1 institution market imply “collective” behaviour determine endogenously systemic risk potential impact real economy. a third lesson increase financial integration europe globally important implication cross-border distribution propagation systemic risk appropriate institutional set prevention management crisis. more specifically, regulatory framework supervisory arrangement europe must broadly compatible large economic areas, notably unite state vice versa. and within eu, grow presence significance cross-border financial institution (the large 43 cross-border bank group eu account 76 % total eu bank asset end 20071 require strengthen pan-european character supervision. a fourth final lesson i want stress effective crisis prevention management call close cooperation efficient information exchange supervisory authority various jurisdiction well central banks, whose task include safeguard financial system stability, supervisor individual institutions. the effectiveness cooperation, relevant within countries, across borders, crucially hinge exchange relevant information timely manner. what broad conclusion draw lessons, generally recent experience, supervisory policy? although severity ensue problem differ across institution countries, overall crisis reveal micro-prudential supervision many case prove inadequate identify, timely manner, nature size accumulate risk impose appropriate remedial action. moreover, although build-up financial imbalances, underprice risk rise degree leverage financial system identify source potential instability international institution central banks, include ecb, warn signals, become progressively loud time, trigger appropriate response either market participant authority responsible oversight individual financial institution specific market segments. there is, therefore, manifest need strengthen macro-prudential micro-prudential supervision financial system way achieve valuable synergy mutually reinforce impact stability financial system. in particular, role macro-financial factors, interconnectedness market institution cross-border financial integration determine size, nature propagation systemic risk call strengthen macro-prudential supervision europe globally. this help prevent recurrence similar episode market excess correction future, disruptive effect real economy, help ensure financial system dynamically stable resilient shocks. iii. the framework macro-prudential supervision eu what implication lesson crisis broad policy conclusion appropriate design effective function eu supervisory framework? i address question take “frame reference” pertinent recommendation report de larosière group broadly welcome european commission. the report comprehensive valuable contribution deal wide range issue concern financial regulation, supervision global cooperation. i focus envisage framework macro-prudential supervision, outline two 1 in euro area, large 30 cross-border bank group account 73% euro area total bank asset end 2007. 2 bi review 35/2009 recommendations, 16 19, importance establish framework – since yet exist urgently need – central role ecb european system central bank propose play. the report recommend new body – call european systemic risk council (esrc) – set up, chair ecb president, function auspex logistical support ecb. the new body pool analyse information, relevant financial stability, pertain macro-economic condition macro-prudential development financial sectors. the general task body “form judgement make recommendation macro-prudential policy, issue risk warnings, compare observation macro-economic prudential development give direction issues”. let elaborate two set issues: (1) function macro-prudential framework; (2) number necessary condition pertain instruments, institutional requirement procedure effective performance macro-prudential policies. the main function macro-prudential framework include: • identification assessment risk vulnerability eu financial system (including markets, institution infrastructures); • issuance risk warnings; • adoption relate recommendation macro-prudential policies. these function could complement relevant tasks: • definition specific macro-prudential report requirement financial institution fill significant information gaps; • advisory role eu regulatory measure relevant macro-prudential supervision. this role could also include identification possible regulatory gap stem financial innovation could pose systemic risks. the performance task require support appropriate analysis comprehensive information base. the interconnectedness financial institution market within eu also globally imply monitor assessment potential systemic risk base broad set relevant macro-economic macro-financial data indicators, well information provide micro-prudential supervisor information obtain market intelligence. the development appropriate structure procedure bring together type pertinent information, also manner ensure strict confidentiality use micro data, represent major challenge, require analytical sophistication, market knowledge supervisory expertise. moreover, monitor risk exposure across institutions, market border rely close cooperation relevant supervisory authority (banking, insurance security supervisors) within eu globally. the analysis necessary carry macro-prudential task partly base economic monetary analysis undertake central bank formulation monetary policy. but complement development use model macro-stress test financial stability indicators. these analytical tool help monitor, ass implication systemic stability, risk exposure across institution markets, instance, common credit exposure interconnect financial institution firms, sector regions; market risk exposure hold security common position interconnect institution relevant market (i.e. potentially lead so-called “crowded trades”). macro-prudential analysis supervision focus, definition, monitor assessment systemic risk whole financial sector. this risk, emerge upswing downswing economic financial cycle, reflect bi review 35/2009 3 effect macroeconomic force collective behaviour institution market participants. central banks, whose primary objective preservation price stability –a necessary though sufficient condition stability financial system– maintain close link money financial market order perform monetary policy tasks, well suit authority mainly responsible macro-prudential supervision. in eu, ecb european system central bank stand ready carry analytical statistical work necessary new eu body responsible macro-prudential supervision perform function effectively. at time, involvement cooperation supervisory authority also essential. in addition propose participation chairperson cebs, ceiops cesr, well one representative european commission, head national supervisor could invite join national central bank governor require subject discussed. appropriate link also establish escb propose european system financial supervision. these link contribute, inter alia, effective information-sharing well provide additional channel “output” deliberation new eu macro-prudential supervisory body communicate micro-prudential supervisor help trigger appropriate policy measures. this could include change capital requirement liquidity buff order respond identify emerge systemic risk. and observation bring last two points. the de larosière group emphasise macro-prudential risk warn issue “it must clear everyone act accord timetable”. it therefore essential suitable mechanism place ensure require supervisory regulatory action implement effective timely manner. no reflection appropriate macro-prudential framework europe would complete without due consideration international dimension. this global financial crisis underscore importance concert policy response globally. the early identification assessment risk vulnerabilities, issuance risk warnings, adoption relate macro-prudential policy key responsibility reform global framework financial oversight, imf fsf play key role, relevant parties, include new eu macro-prudential supervisory body, closely involved. our european framework fit in, compatible global approach adopted. iv. conclusion in conclusion, let emphasise establishment propose eu body responsible macro-prudential supervision, effective performance tasks, efficient translation risk assessment macro-prudential policy recommendation appropriate policy measure require address number legal, institutional organisational issues. one issue institutional relationship fruitful collaboration european systemic risk council envisage european system financial supervision. we contribute address issue constructive timely manner, strengthen macro-prudential supervision europe important urgent policy objective. thank much attention. 4 bi review 35/2009 ben s bernanke: the financial crisis community bank speech mr ben s bernanke, chairman board governor u federal reserve system, independent community banker america's national convention techworld, phoenix, arizona, 20 march 2009. the original speech, contain various link document mentioned, find u federal reserve system’s website. * * * when i address convention three year ago, five week belt chairman federal reserve board, i open remark three observations: community bank play critical role u.s. economy, community bank generally well, community bank face change business environment pose important challenges. i strike three observations, least degree, still hold true today. community bank continue play critical role economy and, many cases, opportunity step make sound profitable loans, competitor pull back. relatively speak least, community bank good group segment financial system, time far immune current conditions. and, surely, still true business environment pose important challenge community banks. in fact, i think safe say u convention hall three year ago envision financial economic environment confront. envision condition face three year equally difficult, hope expectation condition significantly brighter. this morning, i'd like spend time review federal reserve's response financial crisis past 18 months, well current challenge – opportunity – face community banks. in addition, i'll discus two important step policymakers take improve financial regulatory system likely particular interest you. the first step need address real problem cause institution big – interconnect – fail disorderly manner. the second involve way make system le procyclical, financial system le susceptible exuberant boom disastrous busts. in discuss road back financial stability economic prosperity, i want leave idea that, yes, indeed time challenge community bankers, americans, also time opportunity. federal reserve action address financial crisis the depth complexity strain grip financial market institution since summer 2007 lead federal reserve take innovative extraordinary action aim restore stability market support flow credit business households. most directly, federal open market committee (fomc) ease monetary policy aggressively. from second half 2007 spring 2008, committee reduce target federal fund rate 5-1/4 percent 2 percent. and, financial turbulence intensify last fall economic outlook deteriorated, committee respond cut target federal fund rate near zero end last year. a result, number interest rates, especially shorter-term rates, decline significantly, offsetting, least degree, effect financial turmoil cost credit. however, community banker doubt aware, offset incomplete. widen credit spreads, more-restrictive lend standards, credit market dysfunction work monetary ease lead tight financial bi review 34/2009 1 condition overall. to address problems, federal reserve employ range additional tools. these tool divide three sets. the first set closely tie central bank's traditional role provider short-term liquidity sound financial institutions. over course crisis, feed seek ensure financial institution – include bank size well primary dealer – adequate access short-term credit.1 we substantially reduce spread primary credit rate target federal fund rate increase maximum maturity primary credit loan 90 days; also conduct regular auction discount window credit term 84 days. in fulfil traditional lend function, help ease condition interbank fund markets, thus increase willingness bank extend loan thereby ease credit condition household business depend banks. despite provision liquidity bank broker-dealers, number critical nonbank financial market – commercial paper market market asset-backed security – deteriorate significantly. under normal circumstances, market important source credit american business customers. thus, develop second set policy tool provide liquidity directly borrower investor key credit markets. notably, introduce facility purchase highly rat commercial paper term three month provide backup liquidity money market mutual funds. in addition, federal reserve treasury jointly establish facility – term asset-backed security loan facility, talf – lend aaa-rated asset-backed security collateralize recently originate student loans, auto loans, credit card loans, loan guarantee small business administration. this program get way; first subscription fund program complete yesterday, fund disburse next week. over time, expect expand facility include loan type newly issue aaa-rated asset-backed securities, commercial mortgage-backed security private-label residential mortgage-backed securities. if program work planned, make new consumer, business, mortgage loan available, low cost. the federal reserve's third set tool support credit market involve purchase longer-term security fed's portfolio. a announce week, purchase $300 billion treasury debt, $200 billion debt government-sponsored enterprise (gses), $1.25 trillion mortgage-backed security guarantee g federal agency year. these purchase intend improve condition private credit markets. in particular, help reduce interest rate g require mortgage purchase securitize, thereby low rate lenders, include community banks, fund new mortgages. the federal reserve continuously ass effectiveness credit-related tools. so far, generally encourage market responses, include decline mortgage interest rate i mentioned. in addition, commercial paper facility help american business finance payroll operational obligation significantly low rate paper open access finance term long days. our action stabilize money market mutual fund industry, together government programs, also show success – sharp withdrawal fund september balance give way modest inflows. 1 primary dealer broker-dealer trade u.s. government security federal reserve bank new york. the new york fed's open market desk engage trade

recovery. however, although low interest rate ongoing fiscal stimulus help, cannot vigorous economic recovery unless succeed restore reasonable degree financial stability. condition outlook community bank a well know, community bank adversely affect turmoil financial system. a group, community bank – i define include commercial bank asset $1 billion le – see financial performance condition deteriorate substantially since middle 2007. nevertheless, i discuss, longer-term outlook community bank positive light unique competitive advantages. look first current conditions, high loan loss provision significant realize loss investment security – relate many case impairment fannie mae freddie mac equity hold – substantially erode profitability community bank 2008. community bank report net income $4.6 billion, le one-half level 2007. in fourth quarter, almost one every three community bank report loss, overall report small net loss $150 million. community bank enter crisis strong capital, and, despite weaken earnings, vast majority – well 95 percent – remain well capitalize year-end 2008 prompt corrective action standards. nevertheless, ratio nonperforming asset total asset rise high level since 1992 residential mortgage construction loan continue deteriorate. and give near-term economic outlook, loan quality many community bank may decline further. i know banker – include community banker – express concern "mixed messages" perceive come federal bank agency current environment – particularly admonition continue lend time institution urge maintain adequate capital prudent lend standards. we sensitive issue, last november agency jointly issue "interagency statement meet need creditworthy borrowers."2 in statement, note continue lend environment inconsistent maintain good risk management high underwrite standards. for example, emphasize that, rectify past shortcoming underwrite standard aspect risk management, bank continue provide loan creditworthy customers. we direct examiner mindful procyclical effect excessive credit tighten encourage bank make economically viable loans, provide lend base realistic asset valuation balance assessment borrowers' repayment capacities. across federal reserve system, implement train outreach underscore direction. in recent years, i others federal reserve underscore importance community bank u.s. financial system economy. i continue believe firmly. community bank serve business consumer throughout country, rural urban areas. they lead provider credit small businesses, key source job creation country. in decade lead current crisis, nature lend change dramatically, great industry consolidation, increase economy scale scope, 2 board governor federal reserve system, federal deposit insurance corporation, office comptroller currency, office thrift supervision (2008), "interagency statement meet need creditworthy borrowers," joint press release, november 12. bi review 34/2009 3 large portion credit supply nonbanks. while change challenge community bankers, institution remain vitally important. indeed, current crisis, data show recent increase loan deposit balance community banks, balance generally flat even decrease large banks. the various effort federal reserve take provide backup liquidity financial firm improve function financial market have, i believe, help segment financial system, include community bank sector, economy generally. help community bank also help local community serve. one important way community bank may assist community work at-risk homeowner avoid preventable foreclosures. foreclosure result cluster vacant properties, turn foster crime, stretch municipal resource time weaken revenue, lead low house price throughout neighborhood. these reason federal reserve, along u.s. bank agencies, encourage bank participate make home affordable loan modification program establish treasury. while continue challenge remain, opportunity also exist community banks. in instances, community bank able step crucial moment local business consumer unable find credit elsewhere. indeed, bank choose cut back lend conserve capital liquidity, community bank strong financial condition may find gain creditworthy customer even today's economic environment. such community bank also may find opportunity reclaim customer business nonbank lender draw back securitization market encounter difficulties. community bank able respond promptly case in-depth knowledge markets, locally focus management team boards, commitment tailor unique credit product individual borrower businesses. address "too big fail" problem many likely frustrated, rightfully so, impact financial crisis economic downturn banks, well reputation banker generally. you may well build reputation institution responsible lend community-focused operations, nonetheless, find face high deposit insurance assessment increase public skepticism behavior banker – outcome perceive largely cause action large financial institutions. many manage business prudently shun exotic instrument activities. and many customer – household business – avoid excess able meet financial commitment timely basis. no doubt frustration heighten problem cause financial firm big interconnect fail. indeed, too-big-to-fail issue emerge enormous problem, policymakers financial institution generally. creditor firm perceive big fail le incentive monitor restrict firm's risk-taking adjustment price lend money firm. if leave unaddressed, weaken market discipline create unlevel play field small institutions, may able raise fund cheaply, even individual risk profile better, least worse, large competitors. the erosion market discipline distort market behavior give firm incentive grow – either internally acquisition – order perceive big fail. government rescue prevent failure major financial institution also require large amount public resources. these action involve extremely unpleasant difficult choices, give interconnect nature financial system potentially devastate effect confidence, financial markets, broad economy would likely arise disorderly failure major financial firm current 4 bi review 34/2009 environment, i think realistic alternative prevent failures. that said, episode show clearly problem too-big-to-fail extremely serious. to address issue, top priority financial reform, policymakers need act several fronts. first, supervisor – already – must vigorously address weakness major financial institution regard capital adequacy, liquidity management, risk management. firm whose failure would pose systemic risk must receive especially close supervisory oversight hold high prudential standards. aside direct benefit safety soundness large institutions, approach also would help offset financial firms' incentive grow perceive big fail. second, supervisor must pay close attention compensation practice create mismatch reward risk bear institution managers. a federal reserve bank agency noted, poorly design compensation policy create perverse incentive ultimately jeopardize health bank organization. management compensation policy align long-term prudential interest institution, tie risk bear organization, provide appropriate incentive safe sound behavior, avoid short-term payment transaction long-term horizons.3 third, recent financial crisis highlighted, risk financial system may arise bank sector, also financial firm traditionally outside regulatory supervisory framework apply bank organizations. under federal law, bank organization – regardless size – subject consolidate supervision safety soundness purposes. at minimum, policymakers must ensure similar statutory framework put place systemically important financial firm organize hold companies. the agency responsible implement framework also must vigorously exercise authority help ensure safety soundness nonbank firm whose failure could threaten stability financial system. broad-based application principle consolidate supervision would also serve eliminate gap oversight would otherwise allow risk-taking migrate more-regulated less-regulated sectors. fourth, continue strong concert effort need improve financial infrastructure – "plumbing" – support trading, payments, clearing, settlement activity critical function financial system. i describe elsewhere various step federal reserve take coordination supervisor market participant improve resiliency over-the-counter derivative market market triparty repurchase agreements.4 improvement area reduce likelihood failure individual institution would substantial spillover effect financial institution broad markets, thereby make le likely government would need intervene. finally, important element address too-big-to-fail problem development improve resolution regime unite state permit orderly resolution systemically important nonbank financial firm. we regime insure depository institutions, clear need something similar systemically important nonbank financial entities. improve resolution procedure firm would help reduce too-big-to-fail problem give government option safely wind systemically important firm rather keep operating. 3 see "interagency statement," note 2. 4 ben s. bernanke (2009), "financial reform address systemic risk," speech deliver council foreign relations, washington, d.c., march 10. bi review 34/2009 5 reduce procyclicality financial system in current environment, financial institution size try meet need creditworthy borrower time maintain sufficient capital resource weather ongoing crisis. capital rules, account policies, regulatory standard make job even difficult encourage excessively procyclical behavior financial institution – is, behavior cause financial institution tighten credit downturn ease credit boom justify change creditworthiness borrowers. no one question underlie objective capital rule account standards, ensure safety soundness financial institution accurately transparently disclose institution's financial condition, respectively. however, aspect exist capital rule account standard may unduly magnify up down financial system economy. for example, capital rule require bank maintain capital ratio meet exceed fix minimum standards. because bank typically find raise capital difficult economic downturn period financial stress, best mean boost regulatory capital ratio difficult period may reduce new lending, perhaps justify credit environment. moreover, many institution auditor attest, determine appropriate valuation illiquid idiosyncratic asset challenging, especially highly strain market conditions. the economic downturn also renew debate concern appropriate level loan loss reserve cycle. institution often try offset potential procyclicality capital level maintain strong capital buff absorb swing regulatory capital requirements. this type action line supervisory expectation call bank organization able ass overall capital need hold capital commensurate individual risk profile – beyond comply minimum regulatory capital requirements. most community banker understand point. your institution generally hold capital excess minimum regulatory requirement – sometimes well excess. nonetheless, issue surround procyclicality easy, consideration require careful balance important public policy interests. policymakers review exist capital rule account standard determine whether rule standard could modify reduce potential unduly procyclical effect without weaken ability achieve fundamental objectives. i'm please note basel committee financial stability forum already work way address excessive procyclicality capital regulations, financial account standard board issue new guidance relate market-to-market account inactive market other-than-temporary impairments. conclusion i want conclude encourage community banker operate prudently current environment, let fear drive decisions. you continue exercise good risk management – include strong underwrite individual exposure proper management credit concentration portfolios. you also certain deterioration asset quality borrowers' condition accurately identified, measured, managed. and take step maintain strong financial condition sufficient capital liquidity level preparation future economic financial uncertainty. by so, ensure institution continue provide steady consistent source credit business borrower year come. if community bank prudent opportunistic extend credit strong borrowers, help economy recover benefit recovery themselves. 6 bi review 34/2009 caleb m fundanga: access improve financial service zambia remark dr caleb m fundanga, governor bank zambia, standard charter bank m-banking medium launch,

mumbai, 21 november 2008. the view express author institution associated. * * * i heartily welcome senior management conference 2008. a time last senior management conference, 14-month old, still ongoing, global financial market convulsion, hint even cataclysmic denouement, recent direct outcome, widespread global economic slowdown, provide, again, perfect backdrop, contextual topicality, year's conference theme "financial sector development india: agenda rbi next 5 years". while address last year, i identify broad spectrum generic failure inertial regulatory supervisory system genesis crisis, year, i propose briefly review evolution since, make modest attempt prognosis of, lesson from, crisis. a aware, since onset global financial crisis, bad since great depression, typical stock policy response dramatically aggressively cut interest rate inject ever increase do liquidity, give impression crisis diagnose liquidity-genic when, fact, fundamentally, asset toxicity-genic. the late data indicate fed, ecb, bank england, bank japan swiss national bank together inject usd 2.74 trillion outstanding amount liquidity. it may entirely fortuitous/coincidental estimate total potential write-down loss range usd 1.5 2.5 trillion also roughly match amount central bank liquidity outstanding ! in context, popular refrain bank continue “hoard” liquidity borrow central banks, 3 month libor–ois spread continue remain elevated, myth bank ever countenance negative spread burn big hole capital/balance sheet. perhaps, logical reason even write whop usd 965 bn. assets, raise usd 825 bn. new capital, bank still continue finance huge amount illiquid/toxic asset balance sheets. in words, ever aggressive long-term rollover liquidity injection central bank do enable bank substitute abcps worth usd 1.6 trillion usd 2 trillion expensive liability thus effectively substitute fund shareholders! thus, full recapitalization capital-haemorrhaged bank behind us, credit money market normalize transmit monetary policy broad real economy way resumption lend business households. there significant risk current monetary policy environment low interest rate unprecedented deluge liquidity may yet engender another bubble distant future! indeed, almost commodity bubble which, intent purposes, cause huge deluge liquidity burst due envelop global economic downturn. perhaps, swamp liquidity monetary ease unwind appropriately, orderly timely manner, next crisis might well veritable "financial economic nuclear winter"! the forego inevitably lead u seek answer question lesson go forward pre-empt apocalyptic event. in context, must emphasize even global imbalance accommodative monetary policy provide enable environment excessive leverage risk taking, still responsibility regulator supervisor take appropriate macro-prudential measures, pre-emptively proactively, rather reactively. significantly, greenspan, congressional bi review 34/2009 1 hear october, admit find flaw free market philosophy shun financial regulation express “shocked disbelief” financial firm fail self regulate exercise sufficient surveillance trade counterparties prevent losses. in contrast, i observe address last year, reserve bank pre-emptively proactively deliver counter-cyclical prudential measure like increase risk weight exposure commercial real estate, capital market systemically important non-deposit accept nbfcs also high provision certain risky category standard asset recently roll back counter-cyclically cushion impact tight liquidity slow economic growth. this counter-cyclicality aspect prudential regulation supervision, require systemic capital charge base overall asset growth good times, rundown bad times, gain international acceptance recognition represent significant improvement basel ii. the spanish model regard noteworthy worth emulating. besides, another basel ii – incongruent prudential capital measure compel attention international regulator supervisor call “leverage ratio” much swiss regulator require big bank introduce measure capital allow risk-weighting assets. indeed, american lobbyist fail campaign absolute leverage ratio crisis. in particular, case maximum leverage ratio become incontrovertibly compel fatal consequence suffer three big 5 broke dealer usa. it significant combine gross leverage ratio exceed 30 time (incidentally fannie freddie exceed 60 times) although well capitalize risk-weighted basis per basel ii inspire rule change sec 2004 permit compute capital risk-weighted basis. indeed, high leverage, risk perception prime brokerage deteriorate point hedge fund client come eclectically decide investment bank deal rather way round! this hedge fund leverage much low 10 15 time comparison. equally, accord late report the economist, risk-weighted asset two big european bank viz., barclays deutsche bank 25% total asset underscore high level absolute leverage. the report cite high absolute leverage deutsche bank explain high net amount outstanding credit default swap write debt corporate borrower. that suggest plenty people think spite well-capitalized risk-weighted basis, bank risk get trouble. therefore, india might contemplate stipulate maximum leverage ratio addition current crar prescription. besides, recent change international account rule mean many bank reclassify asset subject mark-to-market accounting. supporter new rule argue mark-to-market account force bank vicious spiral force sale losses. but, avoid write-down little restore trust financial system sorely lack it. but spite this, bank like france's société générale refuse use new rule. the trouble new rule pretend problem cannot see anymore give today's sophisticate efficient financial markets, investor take call incorporate risk perception price equity credit default swap anyway. the credit crisis also throw sharp relief “strong connect” “liquidity risk” “opaque off-balance sheet exposures” whatever description. the appropriate supervisory regulatory response risk would, therefore, insist full disclosure transparency off-balance sheet commitments/ exposure supervisory insistence appropriate mix “stored” “purchased” liquidity appropriate capital charge liquidity risk; high “purchased liquidity” component, high capital charge high “stored liquidity” component, low capital charge. thus, bank supervisor regulator need hands-on pro-active focus supervisory attention critical risk category case far. (in fact, india committee financial sector assessment almost presciently focus 2 bi review 34/2009 critical risk month may itself, much liquidity credit crunch august 2007). give serious question mark credibility rat agencies, basel committee need revisit primacy role assign rat agencies. in fact, credit appraisal measurement basic function intermediation perform bank traditionally. in light this,

credit risk banks. indeed, anything, give tremendous volume liquidity credit derivative general cd (both single-names indices-based), would market-price discovery-driven bank supervisor rely price back these. indeed, cd price credit risk almost real-time basis much u treasury, foreign exchange, stock commodities, market do. credit rat agencies, comparison, much lagged. significantly, redeem lose credibility reputation, three rat agency viz., fitch, standard & poor's moody's, start new service provide imply credit rat back out/derived cd spreads! in view foregoing, strong case kick start full fledge cd market india. the popular refrain recent global financial crisis cause exacerbate cd myth cd simple plain-vanilla off-balance-sheet/non-fund base derivatives, confuse cdos

4 bi review 34/2009 tarisa watanagase: rethink monetary policy globalize world – cop current challenge beyond remark dr tarisa watanagase, governor bank thailand, central bank malaysia high level conference 2009, kuala lumpur, 10 february 2009. * * * 1. introduction i would like congratulate bank negara malaysia 50th anniversary, magnificent job bank do domestic international arenas. i wish bank continue success next 50 year beyond. thank opportunity address distinguish audience topic current concern central banker turbulent times. i would like raise number issue challenge traditional think behind monetary policy consequence globalization current turmoil. in others i hope propose solution – new, old. in many case i address challenge blind spot face monetary policy makers, raise question i yet know answer. the development globalization bring test limit conventional monetary policy, term current think monetary policy conducted, well effectiveness current approach monetary policy. i discus point detail moment. but first all, let briefly outline exactly challenge recent decade require u rethink way conduct policy. globalization long draw process. country jump opportunity reap benefit globalization, advance country lead pack. jump technology recent decades, particularly information communications, ensure service – particularly financial service – become truly borderless advance develop country alike, much short period time. 2. challenge traditional monetary policy globalization we familiar benefit globalization, past decade see cheap export emerge market fuel global trade growth, albeit hiccup along way. china’s accession wto subsequent flux chinese export rest world, well oil export middle-east, help create environment prolong low global price low global inflation. we familiar episode give names: great moderation, goldilocks’ economy – warm cold, stable disequilibrium. this episode history variability growth real output decline along variability inflation. along way, imbalance global economy begin build up. the imbalance manifest huge trade surplus accumulation foreign exchange reserve country rely export-oriented growth – include asian region. they reflect dollar revenue subsequently reinvested u financial market – turn help finance u save deficit, permit imbalance remain uncorrected prolong period time. and result, asset price bubble also allow persist prolong period well. bi review 33/2009 1 all well long everyone continue grow. however, emerge market open up, global demand, particularly demand grow economy like china india, drive price oil global commodities. many economist begin predict structural shift global demand change dynamic global inflation would effect domestic price make inflation high persistent. 3. cop global financial crisis at time, problem brew financial side advance economies. i lay cause financial crisis here, discuss widely elsewhere. in nutshell, slowdown u house market, couple mix trouble bank practices, regulatory blind spots, absolute faith market mechanism, among things, lead financial crisis advance economies. but important point financial innovations, couple technological advance communications, help link financial market across globe. this globalization financial service allow collapse major financial center spread rest globe efficiently. in fact, financial instrument early use diversify risk turn mean spread contagion. the spread impact financial crisis onto global real economy trade channel change world’s economic outlook rapidly dramatically. this drastic impact inflation outlook, threat inflation rapidly shift one possible deflation. at time, central bank run traditional monetary policy ammunition fight slowdown growth potential deflation – namely cut interest rates. give increase influence external factor global inflation dynamics, traditional monetary policy focus domestic dynamic inflation need reconsidered. a result globalization, price important commodity good tend move together, make external price shock important determinant domestic inflation. fluctuation oil price commodity prices, even sustain period cheap dear exports, change global inflation dynamics. the spike oil commodity price last year, initially appear supply shock individual country level, fact represent economic overheat global scale, domestic monetary policy tighten may effective way deal situation global context. in addition, present juncture, unprecedented contagious slowdown country’s economy result global linkage mean monetary policy need respond monetary policy stance countries. this add extra international dimension policy making, addition previous consideration impact via capital flow trade partners’ economies. 4. test limit monetary policy globalization but exactly change globalization bring traditional monetary policy? and particular, change affect central banks? the first aspect challenge basis traditional monetary policy decision-making process. traditional conduct monetary policy would rely accuracy forecast economy, inflation dynamics, understand economy works. with globalization, make accurate economic forecast become difficult. the recent economic cycle demonstrate shock economy price level rapid frequent. this clearly demonstrate volatility 2 bi review 33/2009 inflation past year. in case thailand, headline inflation peak 9.2% july last year, fall dramatically -0.4% january. while natural forecast revise light new development information, concern arise globalization likely change various relationship economy. this particularly timely now, fear uncertainty take rational behaviour. and model still base assumption incorporate change relationships, likely make systematic error forecasts. a result volatility inflation mark slowdown global output, many central bank reverse tighten cycle – originally conduct tackle inflationary pressures, others pursue aggressive ease monetary policy shore growth fight prospect deflation. many countries, include thailand, both. this turn, also become concern central bank frequent revision abrupt reversal central bank’s monetary policy stance affect public’s perception central bank’s credibility. a result speed magnitude deterioration economic conditions, central bank across globe pursue extremely aggressive monetary policy easing, intent actively support domestic economy global slowdown. this situation lead u second challenge monetary policy – namely challenge effectiveness. give current economic conditions, usual transmission channel clog up. what happen interest rate cannot low further? this challenge already face u uk, challenge may need address country near future. the u uk begin explore “unconventional measures” traditional ammunition low interest rate exhausted. this include tackle spread commercial government rate directly. the “unconventional” approach take japan early decade – namely purchase medium- longer-term government bonds, also option, although japanese experience show lead increase base money little stimulate lending, commercial bank increase short-term liability many illiquid undervalue long-term asset balance sheets. on hand, recent easing, case us, result targeted, direct lend business purchase commercial paper, indirectly household purchase mortgage-backed securities. 5. lesson current crisis: go here? so go forward issue monetary policy globalize world? i believe issue need immediate attention amid unprecedented crisis in. first, recent monetary policy action around globe include aggressive, many case unprecedented ease policy interest rates, well measure extend improve banks’ access long-term liquidity, limit systemic risk, increase banks’ willingness lend. but use unconventional measure remain unchartered territory, country actual experience use, identify one effective. therefore, need significantly improve understand measure might might work, condition indicator aim achieve, pickup growth inflation, narrow short- long-term bond spreads, instance. bi review 33/2009 3 second, give measure relatively new unconventional, communication public investor important understand unconventional measure mean term monetary policy stance expect exit condition indicator met. clear understand improve confidence, need restore soon possible. third, feasibility unconventional measure credit ease may limit emerge markets, stock asset purchase limited. what then, alternative emerge economy run interest rate ammunition, option traditional ammunition run out? fourth, take long term perspective, beyond current crisis, need continue improve understand monetary policy globalize world. what important ingredient need consider implement monetary policy forecast growth inflation ahead? the role external shock likely become important need consider carefully. we need find way anticipate shock include future financial architecture improve upon limitation foresight forecast ability models. fifth, role policy maker country add external shock open room great policy coordination cooperation international level. like previous crises, current crisis likely follow discussion intensive reform international level. we grab opportunity highlight need international cooperation monetary policy maintain global financial stability. i don’t need point international cooperation area supervision far ahead, normal time time crisis. in order secure international cooperation monetary policy, need research dialogue make early warn surveillance really work global level. in addition, coordination may enough; redesign global financial architecture may necessary, need work area well. one last point i end, i believe u agree central bank need maintain financial stability addition price stability. therefore, also need improve understand implication globalization financial stability, well tool conduct monetary policy addition interest rate tool stability purposes. 4 bi review 33/2009 thomas jordan: the swiss national bank’s monetary policy turbulent time summary speech mr thomas jordan, member govern board swiss national bank, geldmarkt-apéro swiss national bank, zurich, 19 march 2009. the complete speech find german swiss national bank’s website (www.snb.ch). * * * the financial market crisis widen global economic recession, swiss economy feel full impact. the snb take prompt decisive action response, substantially relax monetary policy. in mid-march, result sharp economic downturn since december 2008, major expansion monetary policy become necessary. however, snb already operate de facto zero interest rate policy (zirp), natural limit conventional monetary policy reached. the snb therefore take three unconventional measures: increase number transaction repos long terms, purchase swiss franc bond issue private sector borrowers, buy foreign currency open market. in implement unconventional steps, snb demonstrate that, even environment zero interest rates, still number tool disposal allow react flexibly undesired tighten monetary conditions. in context, important misinterpret foreign currency measure start “beggar thy neighbour” policy. in period zero interest rates, purchase help counter risk deflation. the swiss economy face exceptionally difficult year 2009. economic activity set pick gradually course 2010, thank extremely expansive monetary policy. this is, however, conditional upon economic recovery main trade partners, well return stability financial markets. the snb measure also aim reduce risk deflation switzerland. despite creation massive amount liquidity, snb remain commit ensure price stability future. we use mean disposal reduce liquidity good time, prevent upsurge inflation switzerland crisis ended. bi review 33/2009 1 mervyn king: finance – return risk speech mr mervyn king, governor bank england, worshipful company international bankers, london, 17 march 2009. * * * master, sheriff, my lords, alderman, lady gentlemen, introduction the financial turmoil begin august 2007 lead financial panic september 2008 severe worldwide economic downturn. it fair describe event follow failure lehman brother panic 2008 almost complete collapse confidence financial institution flight fund ensued. perhaps forget panic bank crisis occur depress regularity financial system market economies. but history city large part history bank crises. the measure central bank took, continue take, restore confidence bank system extreme extraordinary scale – bank england lend hundred billion pound bank system. but unprecedented – happen many time crisis years. so i want tonight reflect seem find difficult learn experience. but even set historical background, extraordinarily sudden, severe simultaneous downturn activity trade every corner world economy last autumn remarkable. a collapse confidence coffee house lombard street one thing; collapse confidence world economy quite another. an examination parallel will, i hope, help throw light three questions. first, nature financial risk explain frequency crisis imply design bank regulation? second, lesson crisis central bank pursuit monetary financial stability? and, third urgently, find way present crisis? the nature financial risk implication regulation bank there shortage proposal reform bank regulation official groups, financial stability forum, unofficial groups, g 30, chair paul volcker geneva forum. since excessive risk-taking recent year give way extraordinary degree risk aversion, hurry choose among them. whatever exuberance – rational irrational – exist destroy crisis. so time reflect decide shape new regulatory system. another reason reflection recent year see natural experiment. some regulatory system light touch, others heavy touch, yet others place ownership regulation bank public sector. yet fail degree prevent accumulation risk finally produce crisis. so unlikely simple answer. any plan reform take account nature financial risk. why many people mislead long? and inherent weakness structure modern banking? bank dangerous institutions. they borrow short lend long. they create liability promise liquid hold liquid asset themselves. that though hugely bi review 32/2009 1 valuable rest economy. household save channel finance illiquid investment project provide access liquidity saver may need it. but give risky bank are, surprise time time get trouble. and do regularly since bank began. confidence bank disappear quickly make vulnerable destructive bank run. if large number depositor want liquidity time, bank force early liquidation asset – low value. and, course, bank make sufficient unwise loan borrower repay, threaten solvency well. bank course take action ensure investor confidence maintained. for example, visible source liquidity helps. in panic 1906, founder bank america display gold reserve street offer convert deposit gold, create confidence bank time many others failed. forty year ago, clear bank london hold around 30% asset short-term liquid instruments. today liquid asset ratio 1%. for major uk banks, almost 25% customer loan fund short-term borrow wholesale markets. at turn new century close zero. this distinctive feature contemporary british model banking. distinctive may been; sensible not. hbos rb pay price availability fund dry up, one build society de-mutualised 1980s 1990s order expand beyond constraint deposit base survive independent entity. bank changed. they encourage expansion proprietary trading, fund long-term asset short-term wholesale markets, rapid expansion balance sheet mark rise leverage. commercial bank follow path investment banks. balance sheet size high leverage see key obtain fund low cost. the total asset hold world’s large bank roughly double five year end 2008, leverage uk bank rise average two-thirds. the bulk credit growth economy whole take place within financial sector. and complexity product create make hard evaluate underlie risks. why bank change much take risk eventually lead spectacular downfalls? ultimately, main factor inability perceive true nature risk involved. in alone. john maynard keynes take pain distinguish risk, probability frequency could calculated, uncertainty, scientific basis form probability estimates. keynes go on, article publish 1937, spell exactly tend behave face ignorance. it explain great deal recent behaviour financial markets. keynes argue uncertainty affect behaviour three ways: “(1) we assume present much serviceable guide future candid examination past experience would show hitherto. in word largely ignore prospect future change actual character know nothing. (2) we assume exist state opinion express price character exist output base correct sum future prospects, accept unless something new relevant come picture. (3) know individual judgement worthless, endeavour fall back judgement rest world perhaps good informed. that is, endeavour conform behaviour majority average. the psychology society individual endeavour copy others lead may strictly term conventional judgement”. this suggest hard take truly independent view – especially contrarian one recognise possibility improbable conceivable event could result 2 bi review 32/2009 large losses. in words, sheer difficulty forecast future make hard contrarian investor without substantial net worth survive market. a result market vulnerable “sudden violent changes”. a keynes put it, “the force disillusion may suddenly impose new conventional basis valuation. … at time vague panic fear equally vague unreasoned hope really lulled, lie little way surface”. so conventional wisdom lead speculative mania, quickly collapse sentiment turn head. but speculative mania product solely creative imagination financial engineers. it require will collaboration gullible investors, may fully appreciate risk taking. take simple example investment provide long, regular stream profit intersperse occasional large losses, average would expect return safe investment – unreasonable characterisation would appear many investment strategy recent years. over short time periods, unlikely disaster strike, likely investor come ahead, high return. but long periods, risk disaster strike point higher, likely overall return bad safe investment. and, charge often structure investment manager receive upside risky behaviour share downside, incentive promote risky investment strategy. that, ally massive increase complexity financial product instrument recent years, mean investor have, perhaps unwittingly, aid enormous increase risk run financial system. give problems, seem regulation aim simple robust. overly complex measure risk capital adequacy rarely robust development easy neither anticipate calibrate. and robust rule regulation necessity need simple supervisor lose morass unnecessary detail. for reason expect much regulation. conventional judgment safe banker regulator alike. it easy persuade people, especially earn vast sum result, look successful short run actually highly risky long run. a monetary policy, unlikely prudential supervision implement set rule apply mechanically. nevertheless, rely solely discretionary judgment individual banker regulator ask much human capabilities. this suggest principle constrain discretion, apply successfully monetary policy, need apply bank regulation. that say similar institutional apparatus would appropriate, need build system simple robust impediment excessive risk-taking monitored. and must ensure institutional memory maintain lesson crisis forget impediment excessive risk-taking sweep away memory crisis recede. the design impediment base explicit identification market failure regulation hope correct. such market failure seem relate two dimension bank – “cross-section” “time-series” aspect behaviour. the former reflect extreme interconnectedness banks. each individual institution appear relatively safe link mean system whole vulnerable. any shock could lead bank fail domino effect. the superstructure complex transaction within financial sector (in derivative example) greatly increase interconnectedness. the time-series aspect pro-cyclical behaviour risk-taking financial system i describe earlier. optimism fee occasional setback change mood one pessimism. and individual reluctant accept success may bi review 32/2009 3 result superior wisdom, naturally reflect compensation, short-run outcome risky strategy. to deal “cross-section” problem need reduce exposure system domino effects. for some, especially over-the-counter, market could achieve increase role central counterparty clear houses. much good work go on, lead federal reserve bank new york. but clear house excuse allow flaw financial instruments, many mortgage-backed securities, treat high quality assets. we also need improve regulation liquidity banks. after crisis began, strike feature regulatory system, embody basel arrangement implement uk, absence effective regulation liquidity. the fsa act remedy situation, bank active discussion fsa regulation best implemented. more attention pay “time-series” dimension clear international consensus among member financial stability forum basel committee form counter-cyclical prudential supervision required. the principle established. to correct type market failure require system regulation effectively marry “top down” assessment risk system whole “bottom up” supervision individual institutions. the present system deliver that. a lot detail work need do convert general principle concrete implementation. how would interaction “cross-section” “time-series” risk take account? would framework take form addition capital requirement function degree maturity mismatch, leverage rate balance sheet expanding? or would limit leverage ratios? how would leverage maturity mismatch embed asset side balance sheet take account? and would framework implement bank whose asset liability span jurisdictions? can define group institution systemically significant? in present crisis institution deem potentially systemic impact failure creditor confidence. if bank appear systemic crisis won’t country want require foreign bank subsidiary branches? and, fundamentally, glass-steagall type provision prevent retail deposit use fund investment bank activities? there good argument favour – separate utility function retail bank take household deposit run payment system casino trade investment bank, good argument – difficulty maintain credible boundary institution eligible receive government support not. we need public inform debate merit arguments. we also reflect fact belief authority step risk materialise encourage risk take mean risk-adjusted return financial activity high. the experience unsustainably high return normal time intersperse regular crisis repeat across country time. so bank bear true cost risk take, change need make environment bank operate. all important issues. while commit international level broad principle regulatory reform, extend net highly leverage institution make capital requirement counter-cyclical, time think carefully best way implement them, important take it. many question future regulatory structure discuss turner review launch tomorrow. the bank await review interest. it wish take time reflect carefully report express view. 4 bi review 32/2009 give happen international support develop counter-cyclical toolkit prudential supervision banks. but let u clear tool would entail operate past. they would impose constraint growth profitability bank balance sheets. they would see tax success investment bank community city london generally. and would take place time virtually entire weight opinion, country also abroad, favour expansion financial services. indeed, financial turmoil break summer 2007, debate new york need follow london’s example unfettered market lose ground. what lesson central banks? with passage new bank act last month, bank england two objective enshrine statute: monetary stability financial stability. event past six month show limit achieve respect either objective. no policy framework can, expect to, stabilise output demand rest world suddenly simultaneously “falls cliff”, use expression hear often recent months. even safety valve float exchange rate cannot insulate economy trade partners. world trade fell around 5% final quarter 2008. 54 56 nation data available fourth quarter register fall industrial output. 7 suffer double digit declines. for many year trade route fast growth. now trade lead world economy adversely affect current downturn dependent exports, japan asian economies, bad bank problems. sharp change sentiment, confidence, animal spirit – whatever word care use – capable wreak havoc world economy. i shall turn late immediate response crisis. i want first, however, ask whether central bank right instrument right policy framework deal world big risk type i discuss earlier, namely event occur infrequently large adverse effects; event living. in words, framework suitable world stability inadequate prevent respond large adverse shocks? in particular, central bank continue use single monetary policy instrument – case bank rate, supplement necessary unconventional operation – aim solely price stability, aim also wide financial stability objectives, suggested? for fifteen year bank rate set meet inflation target. and successful achieve objective commodity price push inflation 2007. since monetary policy committee established, average inflation rate 0.1 percentage point away target. the strategy inflation target ensure mpc maintain balance overall demand supply economy. we could, course, pursue different policy. we could set interest rate consistently high level order low growth domestic demand rate inflation stable close target. in word predecessor, could reject approach accept “unbalanced growth rather growth”. but argue bank rate set achieve price stability objective would mean accept rise unemployment fall inflation. and would alter long-term interest rate world capital market “irrational exuberance” financial market u elsewhere. if want slow growth financial sector balance sheet, expansion credit recent year within financial sector, surely good raise bank rate level undermine real economy commitment inflation target. bi review 32/2009 5 a chairman bernanke rightly emphasise last week, one cause crisis impact grow current account imbalance financial intermediation main deficit countries, u uk. the large persistent inflow capital low market interest rate extremely low level encourage “search yield”. in response, financial service industry rediscover time-honoured way raise rate return – increase leverage take risk find way make degree risk le transparent. the crisis result interaction “micro” behaviour bank institution create new financial asset “macro” economic strategy pursue world’s major countries. if make crisis le likely future need concentrate policy cover interactions. the size current account imbalance allow grow reflect fact international monetary system, is, place pressure surplus country main debtor country issue world’s reserve currency. year year international meet express surprise, indeed concern, imbalance continue accumulate, absence correction theme become wear groove discussion interest waned. the forcefully warn expressed, ignored, precisely country appear able achieve price stability steady growth despite continue build-up imbalances. the consequence evident: severe global downturn affect virtually every country world. in world imbalance dangerous rely heavily foreign demand good service rely excessively foreign borrowing. surely country indifferent objective improve consistency macroeconomic strategies. so i hope debate need symmetric obligation surplus debtor country alike move previous unsuccessful dialogue stretch back bretton wood conference 1944. turn “micro” cause crisis, root cause degree optimism financial markets. history, whether run 1929 stock market crash recently dotcom mania, suggest substantial rise short-term interest rate bring end excessive speculation, rise bring recession policy design avert. what need additional instrument, possibly set instruments, provide authority ability control growth financial sector interaction wide economy. a set counter-cyclical policy instrument right response dilemma try use bank rate control inflation excessive expansion financial sector. it provide “top-down” judgement prudential supervision i describe earlier, detail work need flesh general principle. how deal present crisis? i speak far long-term lesson crisis structure bank regulation. but immediate need deal extraordinarily steep simultaneous downturn many economy around world, stabilise bank system country failed. that main priority forthcoming g20 summit. there three part require policy response. first, urgent need collective commitment country g20 restore confidence. second, country bank system failed, must credible promise bank restructure recapitalised resume normal function support flow credit economies. third, need identify explain coherent exit strategy unprecedented official policy action unwind provide bridge back stability. 6 bi review 32/2009 a joint commitment macroeconomic stimulus – division monetary fiscal measure matter individual country determine – require ensure growth nominal demand sufficient reverse extraordinarily steep simultaneous downturn output around world. much already done. but measure need add collective determination support adequate level money spending, need include action help poor country borrow either imf world capital markets. without collective commitment, country may neglect beneficial effect policy action countries, result excessively cautious approach. the g20 summit london two week time offer opportunity challenge. the occasion word action policy-makers really matter probably few many u care admit. but one them. and i encourage unusual sense determination g20 ministerial meet weekend show collective commitment deal problems. in uk already take unprecedented action boost nominal spending. the government announce temporary fiscal stimulus pre-budget report november. bank rate reduce 4½ percentage point past six months. and month bank begin series asset purchase aim boost supply money economy directly. in due course, act expand money spending. in entire 300 year history, bank england never act swiftly extensively response economic downturn. the second aspect require policy response effective stabilisation bank system. the experience country successfully resolve bank problems, sweden early 1990s, suggest require uncertainty value opaque asset bank balance sheet dispelled. it take many month audit forensically true state balance sheet underlie macroeconomic uncertainty dissipate. in meantime government stabilise bank system reassure creditor order prevent risk either retail wholesale run kind saw panic 2008. they subscribe sufficient equity capital – plain ordinary equity – order underpin capital position bank event future losses. although different way (splitting banks, insure pool assets), common commitment provide contingent capital bank core equity capital fall minimum ratio creditor protected. it follow government must prepare hold whatever proportion equity capital turn necessary. the final part policy response relate long term. there need clear exit route extraordinary level official financial support unwind condition return normal. and need credible commitment implement long term reforms. for monetary policy, inflation target provide natural guide when, much, extraordinary degree policy stimulus withdrawn. in particular, outlook inflation determine much asset purchase due course reverse time return interest rate normal levels. for fiscal policy, need credible plan consolidation deficit debt future contingent state economy. and term support bank sector, government signal commitment return bank private sector balance sheet restructured. in uk underpin ukfi formulate explicit mechanism government’s share due course sell back private sector. there also, eventually, need way scale back extraordinary level liquidity support provide central bank crisis. the bank england lent, continue lend, £300 billion pound repo operation special liquidity scheme. and backstop liquidity support still available system bi review 32/2009 7 require discount window. the federal reserve lend $900 billion dollars, ecb around €700bn. relative gdp, balance sheet three central bank broadly double crisis. but provide support, central bank cannot offer long-term fund offer support asset unlikely viable future absence official intervention. at point central bank balance sheet need contract. finally, although i stress need take time think carefully long run reform required, need commit now, political exists, process decision long-term reform key area bank regulation, reform international monetary system governance international financial institutions. conclusion why one see crisis coming? in fact, underlie cause crisis attract attention economists, central banks, international financial institution regulators. but difficulty overcome coordination collective action problem mean nothing done. bank felt keep dance music playing. regulator could never prove risk identify would crystallize, “top down” “bottom up” dimension prudential supervision married. central bank imf discuss imbalance long come believe cry wolf. and one country could prevent world wide increase asset prices. christopher fildes’ law financial cycle say “disasters happen last man remember happen last time retired”. period euphoria panic financial system inherent feature market economy. they cost pay benefit market economy – long-run increase standard live system fail deliver. after another twenty year so, memory panic 2008 faded, regulation put place wake doubt see old-fashioned, inhibit potential city, ripe sweep away glass-steagall separation commercial investment bank unite state year ago. a lesson history generation able avoid repetition early bank crises. the essential problem bind successor predecessor able bind us. rare events, even dramatic time, lose power shape policy memory recedes. the role institution retain collective memory resist temptation present. that one important role central bank. it accept domain monetary policy. and equivalent role financial stability. the introduction simple robust policy tool regulatory regime base exercise constrain discretion would make easy resist overly rapid expansion financial institutions. in particular, authority maintain clear focus issue matter bad occur – liquidity leverage. it intrusive, sense know go on, bureaucratic. a system easy large bank expand destroy balance sheet individual open bank account lose focus. that fault regulators, reflection pressure incentive face – us. a kennedy scholar harvard, i always treasure harold macmillan’s word tribute john f kennedy. he was, say macmillan, man “whose eye horizon whose foot ground". in re-designing regulatory framework certainly need keep foot ground, also keep eye horizon, ahead behind us. more urgent, however, immediate task generate economic recovery. most u come generation grow believe mass unemployment world 8 bi review 32/2009 recession thing past, relevant history book textbooks. that assumption threat. we must rise challenge. bi review 32/2009 9 tarisa watanagase: aspect optimal supervisory arrangement remark dr tarisa watanagase, governor bank thailand, seacen governors’ conference, kuala lumpur, 6 february 2009. * * * bank negara malaysia’s background paper provide good summary issue relate choice optimal supervisory arrangements. it generally accept integrate model supervision may inherent synergies, economy scale scope, little regulatory arbitrage ability identify problem sooner. however, possible weakness blur focus tendency compromise multiple objectives. on hand, separate supervisor credit focus mandates, course big concern supervisory coordination, lack lead regulatory arbitrage, make supervision ineffective. it also generally accept one model good optimal other. it depend context country, include supervisory capacity resources, detail operational arrangements. thailand certainly agree conclusion. in case, bank thailand (bot) supervise bank sector, core financial sector. the security exchange commission (sec) supervise market conduct, insurance commission supervise insurance companies. this model work well far. by law, bot chair financial institution policy committee, whose member include secretary general sec insurance commissioner, meet monthly basis. the forum provide opportunity policy dialogues, exchange view concerns, information updates, among things. this major operational arrangement put place make separate authority model work us. no doubt operational arrangement put place make integrate model work well. have say that, let add another dimension issue supervisory arrangement – one relate central bank’s key function, namely, monetary policy. i believe supervisory policy monetary policy arrange way complementary supportive other. i also believe often-cited conflict interest two roles, perform institution, may overstate somewhat. if policy conflicts, conflict resolve regardless charge supervision. then, would efficient conflict could internalize resolve within institution? in fact, many possible mechanism exist help ensure full accountability role, thereby minimize potential conflict get synergy two role one roof. the arrangement use in thailand, i allude earlier, establishment two separate policy board include outside experts. the link pin membership policy board central bank’s senior management, make possible information knowledge one area usefully employ perform other, without compromise mandate policy board. for example, detail supervisory information banks’ change risk appetite exposure different economic sector market – well risk manage – provide useful early warn health economy potential systemic problem road. this important input monetary policy board. on hand, central bank’s oversight monetary policy economic stability strengthen provide context supervisory responsibilities, example, identify potential macro factor may affect health financial institutions. decision stance time prudential supervisory policy general bi review 32/2009 1 also appropriately make full knowledge macroeconomic condition monetary policy. a seen, two policy essential hence useful even desirable, opinion, central bank supervise least core financial sector, whether separate integrate supervision model. this evident time systemic crisis central banks’ last-resort lend likely call upon prompt decision vital. central bank also supervise core financial institution would clear benefit immediate access vital information expert assessment supervisory staff health individual institution systemic implications. this could greatly help reduce likelihood unnecessary delay even misinform decision might hamper effort stem financial crisis. for emerge market economies, case central bank supervise core financial institution may even stronger. this because, financial market country typically well develop enough serve efficient channel transmission monetary policy. market interest rate even commercial banks’ prime rate react sluggishly change central bank’s policy rate, often long time lag. in circumstances, traditional tool monetary policy alone unlikely enough maintain economic financial stability. since emerge market economies, commercial bank far dominant player financial system, central bank supervisory responsibility could make use target prudential policy tackle financial imbalance excessive asset price movements, lie heart financial crises. this 2003 successfully contain incipient speculative bubble property sector impose ceiling banks’ loan-to-value ratio high-end house loans. in vein, order contain household debt prudent level prevent financial imbalances, maximum credit-to-income ratio impose credit card personal loans. let turn current financial crisis discus lesson relevant issue supervisory arrangement. if look wide range county afflict current turmoil, immediately notice financial sector problem happen country either supervisory model. notably, u well-known multiple agencies, whereas uk integrate one. yet country currently face similar financial sector problems. one cannot help think must certain common supervisory weakness lead crisis, regardless supervisory arrangements. so perhaps key question institutional form rather strength regulatory framework ensure financial stability. of course, easy task, give scale complexity problem right now. several committee work group various organizations, include bis, work number issue identify contribute crisis, procyclical nature supervisory account rule inadequate focus liquidity risk. i know whether effort try identify common weakness different institutional setup supervision. but doubt area work needed. to me, type institutional setup may one important common weakness, is, seem notion lead supervisor either model. allow elaborate point. in case separate authorities, would normal authority assume every authority job accord mandate. therefore, one would tend focus mandate. this problem authority fail proper job, others may able take note. bad still, supervisory gaps, chance one authority identify potential adverse impact area outside one’s mandate even smaller. take u example, authority investor 2 bi review 32/2009 realize credit rat agency adequate job rat complex structure products. if lead supervisor, would whistle blow earlier? i believe would good chance lead supervisor clear mandate take lead responsibility risk focused. there would dialogue weakness may identify corrected. the idea lead supervisor gain widespread support area cross-border supervision, contribute good coordination, turn could help prevent identify problem early stage. by token, benefit could gain domestic set lead supervisor separate authority model. of course, case integrate model, notion become lead department agency, rather outside lead supervisor. the next question is: lead supervisor? the obvious answer one supervise core financial institution country. and follow previous argument central bank supervise core financial sector, central bank lead supervisor. the financial landscape, role, systemic importance financial institution evolve overtime, must scope oversight focus lead supervisor. the lead supervisor must closely monitor evolution ensure regulatory gap emerges. it expand scope supervision either directly indirectly relevant agency build coordination ensure perform lead role properly. bi review 32/2009 3 duvvuri subbarao: india – manage impact global financial crisis speech dr duvvuri subbarao, governor reserve bank india, confederation indian industry's national conference annual session 2009, new delhi, 26 march 2009. * * * introduction le year ago, much happen indian economy since last october would hard anticipate. i recall, around time last year, frequently ask question (faqs) were, factor put india high growth trajectory remain there? today, faq is, get back high growth trajectory? the sharp turn around faq summarize nutshell impact global financial crisis india. global outlook the global economic outlook deteriorate sharply last quarter. in sign ferocity turn, imf mark down, yet again, estimate global growth 2009 range (-)1.0 (-)0.5 per cent, first global contraction 60 years. with advance economy – unite states, europe japan – firmly go recession, contagion crisis financial sector real sector unforgiving total. recent evidence suggest contractionary force strong: demand slumped, production plunging, job loss rise credit market remain seizure. most worryingly, world trade – main channel downturn get transmit way forward – project contract 2.8 per cent 2009, fast pace shrinkage last 80 years. policy make around world clearly uncharted territory. government central bank across country respond crisis big, aggressive unconventional measures. there contentious debate whether measure adequate appropriate, when, all, start show results. there also separate debate abandon rule book, drive tyranny short-term, compromise medium-term sustainability. what clearly beyond debate though great recession 2008/09 go deep recovery long early thought. decouple hypothesis emerge economy contrary “decoupling hypothesis”, emerge economy hit crisis. the decouple hypothesis, intellectually fashionable even late year ago, hold even advance economy go downturn, emerge economy remain unscathed substantial foreign exchange reserves, improve policy framework, robust corporate balance sheet relatively healthy bank sector. in rapidly globalize world, “decoupling hypothesis” never totally persuasive. give evidence last month – capital flow reversals, sharp widen spread sovereign corporate debt abrupt currency depreciation – “decoupling hypothesis” stand invalidated. reinforce notion globalize world country island, growth prospect emerge economy undermine cascade financial crisis with, course, considerable variation across countries. bi review 39/2009 1 question address india impact crisis, much early thought. against background, i propose address follow questions: (i) why india hit crisis? (ii) how india hit crisis? (iii) how respond challenge? the answer three question form basis fourth, perhaps important question. (iv) what outlook india? why india hit crisis? the ferocity global crisis hit india dismay many. and dismay stem two analytical strands. the first analytic go something like this. the indian bank system direct exposure sub-prime mortgage asset fail institutions. it limit off-balance sheet activity securitized assets. in fact, bank continue remain sound healthy. so, enigma india catch crisis nothing much malady core crisis. the second reason dismay india's recent growth drive predominantly domestic consumption domestic investment. external demand, measure merchandize exports, account le 15 per cent gdp. the question is, even global downturn, india affect reliance external demand limited? the answer cause dismay lie globalization. let explain. first, india's integration world economy last decade remarkably rapid. integration world imply exports. go common measure globalization, india's two-way trade (merchandize export plus imports), proportion gdp, increase 21.2 per cent 1997-98, year asian crisis, 34.7 per cent 2007-08. second, india's financial integration world deep india's trade globalization, deeper. if take expand measure globalization, ratio total external transaction (gross current account flow plus gross capital flows) gdp, ratio double 46.8 per cent 1997-98 117.4 per cent 2007-08. importantly, indian corporate sector's access external fund markedly increase last five years. some number help illustrate point. in five-year period 2003-08, share corporate investment india's gdp rise 9 percentage points. corporate save finance little half this, significant portion balance finance come external sources. while fund available domestically, foreign fund perceive le expensive domestic financing. on hand, global market awash liquidity promise india's growth potential, foreign investor lender will take risk finance investment india. last year (2007/08), example, india receive capital inflow amount 9 per cent gdp current account deficit balance payment 1.5 per cent gdp. these capital flows, excess current account deficit, evidence importance external finance corporates depth india's financial integration. so, reason india hit crisis, despite mitigate factors, clearly india's rapid grow integration global economy. 2 bi review 39/2009 how india hit crisis? the contagion crisis spread india channel – financial channel, real channel, importantly, happen financial crises, confidence channel. let u first look financial channel. india's financial market – equity market, money market, forex market credit market – come pressure number directions. first, consequence global liquidity squeeze, indian corporates find overseas finance dry up, force corporates shift credit demand domestic bank sector. also, search substitute financing, corporates withdraw investment domestic money market mutual fund (mfs); consequently, non-banking financial company (nbfcs) mf invest significant portion fund come redemption pressure. this substitution overseas finance domestic finance bring money market credit market pressure. second, forex market come pressure reversal capital flow part global deleveraging process. simultaneously, corporates convert fund raise locally foreign currency meet external obligations. both factor put downward pressure rupee. third, reserve bank's intervention forex market manage volatility rupee add liquidity tightening. now let turn real channel. here, transmission global cue domestic economy quite straight forward – slump demand exports. the unite states, european union middle east, account three quarter india's good service trade, synchronize turn. service export growth also likely slow near term recession deepen financial service firm – traditionally large user outsource service – restructured. remittance migrant worker likely slow middle east adjust low crude price advance economy go recession. beyond financial real channel transmission above, crisis also spread confidence channel. in sharp contrast global financial markets, go seizure account crisis confidence, indian financial market continue function orderly manner. furthermore, bank continue lend. however, tighten global liquidity situation period immediately follow lehman failure mid-september 2008, come top turn credit cycle, increase risk aversion financial system make bank cautious lending. the purport explanation show how, despite part global financial sector problem, india affect crisis adverse feedback loop external shock domestic vulnerabilities. how respond challenge? let turn respond crisis. the failure lehman brother mid-september 2008 follow quick succession several large financial institution come severe stress. this make financial market around world uncertain unsettled. this contagion, i explain above, spread emerge economies, india too. both government reserve bank india respond challenge close coordination consultation. the main plank government response fiscal stimulus reserve bank's action comprise monetary accommodation counter cyclical regulatory measures. monetary policy response the reserve bank's policy response aim contain contagion outside – keep domestic money credit market function normally see bi review 39/2009 3 liquidity stress trigger solvency cascades. in particular, target three objectives: first, maintain comfortable rupee liquidity position; second, augment foreign exchange liquidity; third, maintain policy framework would keep credit delivery track arrest moderation growth. this mark reversal reserve bank's policy stance monetary tighten response heighten inflationary pressure previous period monetary ease response ease inflationary pressure moderation growth current cycle. our measure meet objective come several policy package start mid-september 2008, occasion response unanticipated global developments, time anticipation impact potential global development indian markets. our policy package included, like case central banks, conventional unconventional measures. on conventional side, reduce policy interest rate aggressively rapidly, reduce quantum bank reserve impound central bank expand liberalize refinance facility export credit. measure aim manage forex liquidity include upward adjustment interest rate ceiling foreign currency deposit non-resident indians, substantially relax external commercial borrow (ecb) regime corporates, allow non-banking financial company house finance company access foreign borrowing. the important among many unconventional measure take reserve bank india rupee-dollar swap facility indian bank give comfort manage short-term foreign fund requirements, exclusive refinance window also special purpose vehicle support non-banking financial companies, expand lendable resource available apex finance institution refinance credit extend small industries, house exports. reflect rapid turn event could impair asset line, reverse counter – cyclical regulatory measure introduce 2006. government's fiscal stimulus over last five years, central state government india make serious effort reverse fiscal excess past. at heart effort fiscal responsibility budget management (frbm) act mandate calibrate road map towards fiscal sustainability. the depth extraordinary impact crisis, however, clearly indicate need counter cyclical public spending. accordingly, central government invoke emergency provision frbm act seek relaxation fiscal target launch two fiscal stimulus package december 2008 january 2009. these fiscal stimulus packages, together amount 3 per cent gdp, include additional public spending, government guarantee fund infrastructure spending, cut indirect taxes, expand guarantee cover credit micro small enterprises, additional support exporters. these stimulus package come top already announce expand safety-net rural poor, farm loan waiver package salary increase government staff, stimulate demand. impact monetary measure take together, measure put place since mid-september 2008 ensure indian financial market continue function orderly manner. the cumulative amount primary liquidity potentially available financial system measure rs.390,000 crore 7 per cent gdp. this sizeable ease ensure comfortable liquidity position start mid-november 2008 evidence number indicator include weight average call money rate, overnight money market rate yield 10-year benchmark government security. take signal policy rate cut, many big bank reduce benchmark prime lend rates. bank credit 4 bi review 39/2009 expand too, slow last year. however, reserve bank’s rough calculation show overall flow resource commercial sector le last year. this because, even though bank credit expanded, fully offset decline non-bank flow resource commercial sector. evaluate response in evaluate response crisis, important remember although origin crisis common around world, crisis impact different economy differently. importantly, advance economy originated, crisis spread financial sector real sector. in emerge economies, transmission external shock domestic vulnerability typically real sector financial sector. country accordingly respond crisis depend specific country circumstances. thus, even policy response across country broadly similar, precise design, quantum, sequence time varied. in particular, policy response advance economy contend unfold financial crisis deepen recession, india, response predominantly drive need arrest moderation economic growth. what outlook india? the outlook india go forward mixed. there clear evidence economic activity slow down. real gdp growth moderate modestly first second quarter 2008/09, sharply third quarter. the service sector, prime growth engine last five years, slowing, mainly construction, transport communication, trade, hotel restaurant sub-sectors. for first time seven years, export decline absolute term four month row october 2008 – january 2009. recent data indicate demand bank credit slacken despite comfortable liquidity system. dampen demand dent corporate margin uncertainty surround crisis affect business confidence. the index industrial production show negative growth two recent month investment demand decelerating. all factor suggest growth moderate early thought. in address fall crisis, india several advantages. some recent developments. most notably, headline inflation, measure wholesale price index, fall sharply though consumer price inflation yet moderate. clearly, fall commodity price key driver behind disinflation; however, contribution also come slow domestic demand. the decline inflation revive support consumption demand reduce input cost corporates. furthermore, decline global crude price naphtha prices, sustained, reduce size subsidy oil fertilizer companies, open fiscal space infrastructure spending. from external sector perspective, project import shrink export keep current account deficit modest. there also several structural factor come india's aid. first, notwithstanding severity multiplicity adverse shocks, india's financial market show admirable resilience. this large part india's bank system remain sound, healthy, well capitalize prudently regulated. second, comfortable reserve position provide confidence overseas investors. third, since large majority indian participate equity asset markets, negative impact wealth loss effect plague advance economy quite muted. consequently, consumption demand hold well. fourth, india's mandate priority sector lending, institutional credit agriculture remain unaffected. the farm loan waiver package bi review 39/2009 5 implement government insulate agriculture sector crisis. finally, years, india build extensive network social safety-net programmes, include flagship rural employment guarantee programme. these uniquely indian version automatic stabilizer protect poor extreme impact global crisis. rbi's policy stance go forward, reserve bank's policy stance continue maintain comfortable rupee forex liquidity positions. there indication pressure mutual fund ease nbfcs make necessary adjustment balance asset liabilities. despite contraction export demand, able manage balance payments. it reserve bank's expectation commercial bank take signal policy rate reduction adjust deposit lend rate order keep credit flow productive sectors. in particular, special refinance window open reserve bank msme (micro, small medium enterprises) sector, house sector export sector see credit flow sectors. also spv set extend assistance nbfcs ease finance constraint nbfcs. the government's fiscal stimulus able supplement effort supply demand sides. when turn around come over last five years, india clock unprecedented nine per cent growth, drive largely domestic consumption investment even share net export rising. this accident happenstance. true, benign global environment, easy liquidity low interest rate helped, heart india's growth grow entrepreneurial spirit, rise productivity increase savings. these fundamental strength continue place. nevertheless, global crisis dent india's growth trajectory investment export slow. clearly, period painful adjustment ahead us. however, global economy begin recover, india's turn around sharp swifter, back strong fundamental untapped growth potential. meanwhile, challenge government rbi manage adjustment little pain possible. 6 bi review 39/2009 ric battellino: an update economy financial development address mr ric battellino, deputy governor reserve bank australia, urban development institute australia, national congress 2009, brisbane, 31 march 2009. * * * introduction the past six month certainly prove live globalise world. last september, u investment bank, lehman brothers, collapse several major u financial institution come immense stress. these event transform difficult manageable situation global market full-blown financial crisis. the consequence global economy severe. up events, forecaster predict major economy would relatively mild slowdown 2009, asia would largely unaffected. those prediction since replace forecast major global downturn, significant country affected. australia enter difficult period much good shape many countries. discipline monetary fiscal policy early years, sound regulation prudent approach lend bank mean country largely free major problems. it surprise therefore that, far, weather global downturn good most. we scope others move policy expansionary direction banks, largely free problem assets, position keep supply credit economy. have say that, amount good economic management totally shield u happen global economy. in talk today i would like review global economy evolving; update see domestic economy; say word household sector finance house market. the global economy we know global economy go recession. in itself, unusual; world economy tend experience downturn every 7-10 years. the current global downturn is, however, severe experience long time. this important country bank sector crisis overlay regular economic cycle. this add severity downturn because: • undermine confidence community; • lead sharp slowdown availability credit. this cycle also highly synchronised, every significant country world affected. household business confidence collapse simultaneously every country late last year, react way dramatic news transmit around world. the event past six month result big change forecast global economy. mid last year, official international body generally forecast world economy would grow around 4 per cent 2009, little average. now forecast global gdp fall around 1 per cent 2009, weak outcome post-war period. it widely accept precondition economic recovery restoration financial stability. market time frustrate long take country bi review 39/2009 1 bank problem implement measure restore health financial institutions. but complex problem take time consensus build solution. another complication that, surprisingly, common initial reaction want retribution financial institution see cause problem. while understandable, make difficult political process support make public fund available stabilise financial system. these issue new and, standard past bank crises, us, country heart current crisis, make reasonable progress. the u authority last week announce plan restore health financial sector. these follow solid rise share prices, particularly bank stocks, though market sentiment clearly still fragile. on real economy, start notice odd positive economic indicator run u monthly data, contrast universally negative outcome month ago. let’s hope continues. from australia’s perspective, discussion global economy complete without reference china. like countries, china experience sharp slowdown second half last year, couple year extraordinary boom output growth increase around 12 per cent per year. the downturn china great significance australia, give china large trade partner. my guess chinese authorities, like everybody else, catch surprise suddenness downturn. but since react great speed vigour implement monetary fiscal measure stimulate economy. there sign measure start work. while china go return 12 per cent growth rate time soon, quite possible past six month turn period maximum weakness chinese economy. of course, know one way another. the australian economy like economies, australian economy much affect extraordinary event last september. a countries, confidence severely erode spectacle large u financial institution either collapse come immense financial strain. concern begin arise safety financial institutions, even though strong position. the australian government therefore elected, government countries, guarantee debt banks. in addition adverse confidence effects, australian economy also affect collapse commodity prices. mid last year, commodity price boom levels; six month later, many broadly halved. this result large loss real income economy. the fall commodity price also cause business revise sharply investment plan year ahead. household also become much cautious, cut back spend increase saving. all mean sharp change outlook economy close month last year. the reserve bank respond substantial low interest rates: september last year february year cash rate reduce 7¼ per cent 3¼ per cent. other central bank also cut official interest rate sharply, many cases, problem bank sectors, flow great extent interest rate face household businesses. in essence, monetary policy transmission mechanism many country become severely impaired, central bank resort non-traditional monetary measures. 2 bi review 39/2009 this problem arise australia. the monetary policy transmission process effective remain scope ease policy circumstance require. the 400 basis point reduction cash rate since last september reduce overall cost fund bank 340 basis points, take account movement interest rate global capital markets. on average bank cut interest rate loan amount – i.e. average fully pass fall cost fund borrowers. interest rate house loan fall more, interest rate consumer business loan fall less. a result reduction occurred, house interest rate business lend rate historically low levels. in case housing, produce quick response term pick loan demand. house loan approval 20 per cent since low point july. this concentrate almost entirely among owner occupiers. it hard understand demand house loan respond quickly. with interest rate house loan around 5½ per cent, cash payment involve service house loan much involve renting. combine first home owner grant, attract lot first home buyer market. government also support economy increase spending. perhaps best single measure change fiscal position. across level australian governments, last financial year fiscal surplus 1½ per cent gdp. this year, estimate deficit 2½ per cent gdp. this turnaround – 4 per cent gdp – large post war period. these measure go long way offset negative influence economy come abroad, reality cannot fully insulate happen elsewhere world. a such, gdp likely fall 2009. even so, australia remain one good perform economy develop world well place benefit renew global expansion comes. household finance house a i sure acutely aware, household experience large reduction wealth past year so. mainly result fall share market. a income grown, accumulate financial asset increase proportion hold market-linked investment equity unit trusts. this natural outcome financial development generally beneficial. it mean, however, variability return investments. many people regard fall share market aberration reality share market produce negative return every years. this factor return expectations. if don’t, over-estimating long-run rate return achieve savings. it important realistic expectation return achieve financial goals. assumption investment return big impact decision much need save income, long need work, order accumulate give amount money. a rule thumb, every one percentage point reduction long-run average return savings, household would need increase proportion income save work life 3 per cent order accumulate give amount assets. alternatively would need work additional 3 years. it interest that, past year, share market fallen, household save rate increase substantially old worker either remain in, return to, workforce. bi review 39/2009 3 even large fall wealth past year, household sector still relatively sound position. if look household balance sheets, see that, liability side, household average debt equal one half year’s income. on asset side, property value 4 years’ income financial asset equal 2½ years’ income. let end word house market. this market fairly subdue 2008, price fall average 3 per cent across australia. some state – western australia late boom – experience large fall average. price top end market also soft segments, doubt reflect deleveraging take place among high income household follow global financial crisis. overall, however, house market australia hold pretty well compare country u uk, price fall order 20 per cent. we continue believe market hold good overseas. there number reason likely so, perhaps important deterioration lend standard occur elsewhere. by large, great bulk australian take house loan able afford repayments. notwithstanding rise past year, 90 day arrears rate house loan 0.5 per cent, broadly line long run average well country u uk. in period ahead, force pull arrears rate opposite directions. on one hand, unemployment rises, household difficulty continue service house loans. on hand, large reduction interest rate greatly reduce debt service burden households. on average-sized mortgage, loan repayment $7,000 year le six month ago. this large reduction, equal 8 per cent average household income. the majority household choose spend money free up. rather, maintain high repayment therefore move ahead schedule repay loans. this give breathe space subsequently find circumstance repayment interrupted. conclusion let sum say past six month difficult time world economy. there tentative sign improvement, reality go take quite time world recover financial shock occurred. while australian economy also weakened, hold good difficult period, help early discipline policy prudent financial behaviour. however, limit much insulate happen abroad, therefore probably still difficult time ahead. nonetheless, underpinnings australian economy sound well place benefit global economic recovery comes. 4 bi review 39/2009 mario draghi:

regard loan house purchases, constitute 68 per cent credit consumer households, fourth quarter 2008 new loan 20 per cent year earlier. consumer credit purchase good service – account 6 per cent bank lend household – slow sharply. new mortgage loan fix rate amount €36 billion 2008 64 per cent total grant households, compare €32 billion (51 per cent) 2007. the wide gap italy euro-area average cost new fixed-rate mortgage (one percentage point june 2007) narrow nearly nil. in last month share new fixed-rate loan fall slightly, though remain high past (55 per cent january). one factor reduction fall interest rate variable-rate mortgages, make attractive households; supply side, difficulty encounter bank recent month obtain long-term fund may induce limit supply fixed-rate mortgages. the stagnation lend also due banks’ adopt cautious policy lend household businesses. the italian bank participate bank lend survey report fourth quarter 2008 lend condition tighten somewhat, firms’ demand

government parliament, technical support bank italy, adopt set measure protect depositors, support banks’ liquidity capital, reinforce ability bi review 38/2009 5 finance economic activity. the provisions, adopt emergency decree procedure, ratify law 190/2008 2/2009. i believe useful recall main points. in first measure (decree law 155/2008, ratify law 190/2008), retail bank deposit grant state guarantee. the guarantee supplement insurance provide previously exist interbank funds. the measure important reassure saver market anxiety level acute. a second set measures, contain decree law

the government shareholding take form non-voting preference shares; public intervention subject presentation restructure plan assess bank italy. lastly, decree law 185/2008 (ratified law 2/2009) authorize financial intervention state increase capital fundamentally sound banks. in case question rescue operations, measure strengthen system and, macroeconomic environment deteriorate sharply, avert perverse spiral loan default credit restriction. the state intervene take financial instrument issue banks. these count prudential purpose core tier 1 capital, remuneration value depend issuer’s

particularly household small medium-sized enterprises. this commitment appropriately defined, take account level demand loan need maintain standard prudent credit allocation. the measure make operational decree minister economy finance. the bank italy give bank necessary technical guidance. the economic term issue must comply guideline establish european union; several alternative scheme defined, partly request bank italy, make adherence plan advantageous bank intend redeem instrument within relatively short time. the term italian instrument line offer european countries. i expect bank make use suitable amounts. the recapitalization law also provide monitor transaction effect economy institute special observatory prefectures, participation interest parties. the bank italy supply ministry economy finance data analysis evolution credit borrow cost regional basis, additional supplement ample geographically disaggregated data already release publications. the statistical information allow specific situation tension identified. 6 bi review 38/2009 it essential analysis credit condition local level stray role pressure banks, prompt relax standard sound prudent management selection borrowers. in opinion, political administrative interference assessment individual case creditworthiness must avoided. lend must remain entrepreneurial activity, base prudent, professional evaluation validity companies’ plans. sooner later, imprudent bank end distress also cease lending. but test pose crisis severe require ability good banker even economy badly. the inevitable deterioration loan quality due recession call far-sighted choices: keep account straight enough. firm support creditworthy customer prevent excessive credit squeeze, would aggravate recession, thereby worsen position banks’ customers. a i already said, every opportunity must take strengthen capital banks, choose appropriate form case: recourse market, retain earnings, instrument offer state. the restoration confidence bank system global, national question. in view, four condition essential. first, uncertainty still surround value trouble asset banks’ balance sheet must dispelled; must become integral part public intervention support financial system. it indispensable, especially europe, similar measure base common principles, order avert competitive disparity intermediary different country bank expose differ degree problem impair assets. second, determine recapitalization objectives, vital definition bank capital international level. third, authority make clear intend protect systemically important institutions, endow capital need face stress conditions, protect depositor shareholder alone bear losses. to intent purpose banks’ creditor protect losses. this must explain absolute clarity; way drastically reduce risk premium market still demand bank liabilities. fourth, time go beyond deal problem inherit past consider ensure availability credit on. recapitalizing bank necessary end, sufficient; need think new, even unconventional instruments. this last point especially pertinent italy, neutralize complex financial instrument whose value plunge limit relevance find instrument directly affect availability loan firm household important. one possibility would issue public guarantee senior tranche pool new loans, view revive important channel financing, loan securitization, completely dry today. if bank able sell part loan active liquid secondary market, use liquidity obtain reactivate supply credit. a scheme kind would carefully design order ensure effectiveness term new lending, give bank correct structure incentive minimize cost taxpayers. the originator bank retain risk, thereby still incentive select creditworthy borrowers; pay suitable fee issue guarantee, commensurate quality underlie loans. limit public guarantee least risky portion pool securitized loan keep state assign inappropriate role assessment creditworthiness. objective criterion could establish select loan good quality (for example, mortgage loan-to-value ratio give limit loan small medium-sized firm back guarantee fund small medium-sized enterprises), encourage subscription entire pool securitized loan market limit possible cost taxpayers. bi review 38/2009 7 some feature tax treatment bank intermediary italy lack clear economic logic produce competitive disadvantage respect country reconsidered. value adjustment loan deductible taxable income year 0.3 per cent bank’s total outstanding loans; writedowns exceed amount deduct period eighteen years. the limit rule writedown period tighten repeatedly recent years. it difficult see economic justification find comparable provision major european countries. in france, germany unite kingdom, value adjustment tax-deductible loan-by-loan basis, line state accounts; france germany, flat-rate allocation provision also allowed. the penalization italian bank pro-cyclical, burden great cyclical downturns, loan loss increase; present, mechanism exert disproportionate impact credit system. in bank accounts, limit deductibility value adjustment result advance payment taxes, essence tax credit. at end 2007 credit amount €4 billion; 2008 come €1.4 billion. writedowns also non-deductible regional tax productive activity (irap) thus diminish profit. the total impact deduction limit bank profit amount €400 million yearly. a loss always become fully deductible realize – debtor bankruptcy proceedings; otherwise, revenue agency object loss “certain precise,” risk ensue tax dispute. this risk affect cost availability credit. in present phase, loan loss presumably increase, would advisable diminish, much possible, cause regulatory uncertainty hence tax risk system. start 2008, portion banks’ interest expenditure (currently 4 per cent) long deductible corporate income tax regional tax productive activities. the ceiling also apply transaction interbank market, thus constitute drag operations. for bank, interest expenditure cost raw material business. neither unite state main european country equivalent rule. also start last year, administrative expense depreciation 90 per cent

good service make italy’s lack “group vat” regime, many european country avoid application vat intra-group transactions. it desirable italy institute “group vat” regime envisage community directive, thus come line main eu member states. consider government estimate put additional cost non-deductibility vat €400 million year, overall reduction banks’ net profit due specific direct indirect tax measure nearly €2 billion year. high tax mean le self-financing, le capital, le lend capacity. a bank’s good name, basis solid relationship customers, always precious asset, time crisis. safeguard enhance bank system’s reputation require irreproachable conduct practice, le strict rules. transparent correct relation customer protect consumers. they spur competition, ensure full comparability

settlement dispute bank customers; new provisions, design part discussion association banks, intermediary consumers, make protection correctness deal customer effective. with new rule intend make document customer clearer, concise comparable. the instrument govern common products, mortgage loan current accounts, especially incisive. for time intensify controls. a far within power, direct

monetary policy achieve? speech m barbro wickman-parak, deputy governor sverige riksbank, meeting, karlstad, 27 march 2009. * * * economic policy divide two areas: fiscal policy monetary policy. in sweden country independent central banks, know distinct difference two policy areas. the government responsible fiscal policy central bank monetary policy. the central bank allow receive instruction party carry monetary policy task – conduct monetary policy independent manner. so range policy area delegate independent central bank; is, expect central bank able achieve? this question theme speech today. economic policy ultimately concern create best possible condition long-term growth thereby high level welfare population. the give limit growth set development labour force productivity. to attain long-term growth policy must aim at, instance, educate labour force, create incentive structure stimulate people work, create good innovation climate promote technological development on. this common knowledge, may worth say sometimes. and reason i may good start point distinguish monetary policy may achieve short long run. we note already policy area i recently mention concern politics broad sense monetary policy. it thus monetary policy affect fundamental condition long-term growth. one illustration monetary policy’s limit potential affect employment long term disparate regional development one country. in sweden, instance, large regional difference employment levels, despite monetary policy regions. these difference appear lasting, might indicate due underlying, structural factor beyond control monetary policy. however, monetary policy affect condition long-term growth one essential point, namely keep inflation close target inflation expectation anchor around target. if inflation deviate target riksbank’s aim normally bring back target within couple years. depend large deviation cause, time horizon may extended. this flexibility make possible riksbank take account development real economy monetary policy considerations. in short term, monetary policy contribute reduce fluctuation production employment arise economic cycle. a i discus today, however, possibility achieve type stabilisation also dependent inflation expectation reasonably stabile. if inflation expectation stable, change policy rate direct effect real interest rate, correspond nominal interest rate minus expect inflation. a real interest rate determine aggregate demand, monetary policy may short term impact real economy. today i shall take question monetary policy affect short long run. i shall use example illustrate balance must attain inflation target development real economy. function financial market vital significance function whole economy. the riksbank’s main task, beside monetary policy, safeguard financial stability. during current financial crisis riksbank take number measure safeguard financial stability. this parallel take monetary policy measures. bi review 38/2009 1 monetary policy financial stability closely linked. the possibility conduct efficient monetary policy depend transmission mechanism functioning. i shall return question late speech. finally, i shall make conclude comments. the influence monetary policy short long run – research at end 1950s economist a. w. phillips find negative relationship unemployment inflation study data uk period 1861-19571, relationship usually refer phillips curve. this show high employment achieve cost high inflation. it thus long believe one could "buy” long-term low unemployment push inflation. however relationship empirically prove hold long run. in 1970s, instance, period high unemployment high inflation, know stagflation. the relationship also tackle theoretical angle. in famous article late 1960s milton friedman discuss monetary policy cannot achieve.2 his view long run monetary policy unable affect real economic variable unemployment gdp. however, affect nominal variable exchange rate price level. in long run "natural” level unemployment dependent function labour market. if monetary policy try push unemployment "natural" level, result high inflation. monetary policy therefore risk become disturb factor economy. accord friedman, therefore best monetary policy create right condition stable price level focus variable central bank control, money supply. in 1970s 1980s number country apply monetary policy regime base steer money supply. however, research show stable relationship money supply inflation. the rapid financial development use new, alternative method payment contribute money supply function well target variable monetary policy present society. nor rate circulation money constant; vary substantially. it therefore natural focus try directly steer inflation allow money supply remain one indicator among many. the past decades’ research point importance inflation expectations. although relationship short run unemployment inflation, central bank cannot make use long run, company individual realise policy conduct adapt expectation accordingly. for example, wage-earners may demand high wage compensation come inflation. this turn negative effect employment. monetary policy thus cannot last influence real economic variables. but stabilise effect short run, particularly inflation expectation well-anchored temporary change inflation perceive permanent. however, mean conflict may arise short run long run. a central bank prefer inflation expectation stable low, best long run. the central bank may prefer conduct policy perceive sufficiently tight inflation remain low, create low inflation expectations. but inflation expectation low, may tempt allow market ”surprised” 1 phillips actually study relationship wage unemployment, late study indicate similar relationship inflation unemployment, phillips, a. w, (1958) “the relationship unemployment rate change money wage unite kingdom, 1861-1957”, economica, 25, s. 283-299. 2 friedman, m, (1968). “the role monetary policy”, american economic review, p. 58, 1–17. 2 bi review 38/2009 expansionary policy lead low unemployment, take time individual company adapt behaviour. in way central bank risk find vicious circle period inflation allow soar, follow period inflation expectation bring large cost real economy. independent central bank, inflation target openness this time inconsistency problem affect economic policy first note finn kydland edward prescott late 1970s.3 one proposal put forward address problem introduce independent central bank build credibility succeed maintain low inflation realistic ambition regard stabilise resource utilisation. to this, central bank must able take quick sometimes unpopular decisions. if central bank succeed attain credibility inflation expectation stable, scope also take account development real economy.4 it thus also important stability perspective find mean attain credibility stable inflation expectations. a one step achieve many central banks, include riksbank, introduce explicit inflation target 1990s. in practice, central bank conduct flexible inflation target attain inflation target also stabilise resource utilisation. this mean central bank prepare attain inflation target short run cost. the riksbank’s aim inflation deviate target shall normally bring back target within couple years. in case large deviation may take long target attain effect real economy excessive. because monetary policy work lag, decision must base forecasts. it therefore important publish forecast inflation real economy, riksbank does. we never

(1977). ”rules rather discretion: the inconsistency optimal plans”. journal political economy, 85, pp. 473-492. 4 for detail discussion this, see woodford, m, (2007).”the case forecast target monetary strategy”, journal economic perspectives, 21:4. pp. 3-24. bi review 38/2009 3 this bring point central bank must prepare make unpopular decisions. we recently cut repo rate unusually large amount unusually short time. cut interest rate popular decision welcome most. but condition decision clash inflation target. on contrary, need make decision inflation would low relation target long period time. we count repo rate remain low level whole year. but sooner late need begin raise repo rate again. in situation possible unemployment still high, change employment often occur somewhat late economic cycle change variables, growth. this illustrate forecast repo rate unemployment present february monetary policy report. it important remember situation monetary policy forward-looking primary task create good long-term condition economy maintain price stability. let illustrate mean two monetary policy episodes. ”too low” versus "too high” inflation the last time repo rate low, low point 1.5 per cent, 2005. inflation target riksbank receive criticism various party cut repo rate further. sweden way economic upturn, labour market nevertheless relatively weak. there lot talk "jobless growth”, is, growth create employment. some say reason job create monetary policy tight. the riksbank make different assessment. the view executive board underlie factor supply side, productivity, increase competition food sector low-price import emerge economy decisive low inflation employment. none factor would affect repo rate cut. the executive board’s assessment monetary policy sufficiently expansionary give demand situation point fact credit volume house price increase rate sustainable long run. they therefore begin raise interest rate january 2006, little sooner merely give consideration inflation target. the riksbank target either credit volume house prices. but variable might expect affect inflation real economy. if credit volume house price continue rise rapidly would risk trigger large adjustment ahead. one reflection make interest rate cut even 2005, suggest several outside bank, current situation might worse. there would probably large credit expansion high house price would need adjust later. this could put economy much vulnerable position thereby worsen current economic downturn. another experience autumn 2007, energy food price increase considerably, contribute push inflation. it also example supply side shock, price set world market. swedish monetary policy cannot affect them. but time, domestic cost pressure relatively high. productivity growth slow down, wage cost rising. we experience long period growth labour market begin tighten. growth still good, saw slowdown coming, although appear might fairly mild. we face situation risk high energy food price increase would spread price must weigh risk weak real economy. there much talk risk stagflation, is, combination economic slowdown rise inflation. we face situation reach decision become ever difficult. this become clear executive board member make slightly different assessment summer early autumn 2008 kind interest rate policy required. however, 4 bi review 38/2009 economic downturn much quick deep expected, partly result financial crisis come affect u tangibly autumn. this unfortunate economy, simplify decision-making. we could see ahead u inflation would far target period time, want avoid period long one. we able cut repo rate 3.75 percentage point le six months, mean repo rate historically low level. our forecast show substantial fall demand low interest rate policy intend contribute soften fall. when circumstance suddenly changed, monetary policy rapidly adapt new situation. the two case i take show flexibility inherent monetary policy make good use of. what drive force behind inflation? a fundamental question a monetary policy’s ability influence inflation ultimately economic development depend type shock economy subjected, must analyse drive force behind inflation.5 when inflation govern supply factor push inflation, 2007-2008 instance energy price rose, initial effect cannot prevent monetary policy. when inflation become low relation target around 2005, largely productivity rise expected. this essentially positive development neither prevent monetary policy. however, provide possibility hold interest rate low level allow high level demand would otherwise case. but effect employment limit underlie productivity growth. however, riksbank might need cut repo rate one time observe deterioration demand long-term inflation expectation far target. this case; inflation expectation slightly long term fairly well anchor around 2 per cent. at time, riksbank’s forecast show economic activity would remain strong. this period illustrate important monetary policy analyse drive force behind inflation policy forward-looking. when inflation rise last year, also largely due supply factors, price oil commodities, could check even short term monetary policy. however, background long period high growth increase tightness labour market. at time, productivity growth decline wage rising. this entail increase cost pressures, justify high interest rate. monetary policy continue tighten even sign weaken economic activity begin appear. when look ahead see price measure term cpi fall year inflation thus deviate substantially target. the primary cause mortgage rate energy price fall rapidly calculate annual percentage change. if exclude effect interest rate cut effect fall energy prices, price expect fall.6 i shall go this, merely wish point important analyse drive force behind inflation able explain monetary policy conducted. this mean time time highlight different measure inflation. in current stage thus important distinguish effect measure implement alleviate effect financial crisis international growth thus growth sweden. 5 for detail discussion this, see “should monetary policy stabilise resource utilisation?” economic commentary no. 1 2008, sverige riksbank. 6 inflation measure term cpif, disregard change mortgage rates, around 1.6 per cent average 2009. if one also exclude energy costs, average 2009 2.2 per cent. bi review 38/2009 5 monetary policy dependent function transmission mechanism inflation affect riksbank’s change repo rate usually know transmission mechanism. this influence go several different channels, short long real interest rates, exchange rate supply credit. the impact occur different degree delay. the repo rate interest rate bank pay borrow deposit money riksbank one week collateral. under normal circumstance relatively stable relationship level repo rate level rate company household face, well interest rate access loans. the financial crisis affect relationships. when, example, riksbank cut interest rate begin october short market rate fall. the risk premium increase result uncertainty turmoil follow wake financial crisis, difference repo rate short market rate expanded. this mean interest rate cut full impact interest rate pay household companies. market rate thus become high would normally justify level repo rate. since financial crisis worsen last autumn, riksbank, like many central banks, implement number measure safeguard financial stability. these measure largely concern provision liquidity bank system. this improve function short term market risk premium fallen. the interest rate channel transmission mechanism thus begin function normally. the primary purpose riksbank’s measure safeguard financial stability, also lead monetary policy function efficiently. the riksbank’s two main tasks, manage monetary policy safeguard financial stability, thus closely link one another. this clearly illustrate financial crisis. there concern measures, also lead expansion central banks' balance sheets, entail increase risk inflation future high. the question thus whether economy surplus liquidity situation begin normalise, whether could lead increase inflationary pressures. the answer question no. the measure take central bank regard response tighten market. one simplify say central bank try counteract neutralise markets' tighten transmission channel begin function normally. these measure continue long market cannot function own. once financial crisis waned, riksbank renew special measure require crisis. our loan relatively short-term, maturity 3 12 months. the loan therefore mature gradually special lend facility phase out. when economy recovers, monetary policy adjust accord circumstance prevail time. the policy rate raise large step prove necessary. in recent monetary policy report see expect relatively rapid increase repo rate towards end forecast period. conclude comment we historically low repo rate moment. give gloomy economic prospects, i executive board member consider february substantial repo rate cut needed. we expect rapid deterioration labour market situation, together rapidly fall energy price mean inflationary pressure declined. in situation thus nothing prevent monetary policy use forceful manner alleviate effect fall demand come wake financial crisis. on contrary, interest rate cut necessary attain inflation 6 bi review 38/2009 target long run. if situation deteriorate, first measure would cut interest rate further. if repo rate cut zero, close zero, still sufficient, type measure would necessary. we prepare implement measure necessary. if inflationary pressure instead increase, may necessary raise repo rate quickly assumed. a year ago riksbank criticise give sufficient consideration variable inflation, unemployment, instance. economic theory experience show, however, monetary policy limit ability lastingly affect real economic variables. on hand, riksbank try achieve reasonable balance attain inflation target stabilise real economy. but normally take upturn economic activity impact employment, possible riksbank need raise repo rate situation unemployment still high. this also something assume recent forecast. there risk unreasonable requirement make monetary policy. it important bear mind primary objective monetary policy create good long-term condition participant economy. it important active discussion riksbank’s policy. but discussion fruitful must base realistic expectation monetary policy cannot achieve. sweden small, export-dependent economy economic activity abroad suddenly falls, monetary policy cannot prevent negative effect economy. but alleviate effects. a financial market integrated, cannot prevent international financial crisis effect here, too. then must use tools, parallel interest rate policy, make financial system function best possible way give circumstances. this do throughout autumn continue long necessary. bi review 38/2009 7 lucas papademos: how deal global financial crisis promote economy’s recovery sustain growth speech mr lucas papademos, vice president european central bank, 7th european business summit organise european business forum, brussels, 26 march 2009. * * * i. introduction the european global economy experience severe prolong financial crisis since 1930s. a fact figure highlight magnitude nature challenge face. since begin financial turbulence 2007, total report write-down loss bank globally exceed 888 billion dollars. some estimate overall expect loss bank financial institution range 2.2 trillion dollars.1 asset price plummet worldwide, though extent differ across country market segments. in eu, value equity fall 6 trillion euro,2 decline 50% peak reach summer 2007. economic activity decelerate sharply 2008, especially last quarter; project contract significantly eu year recover moderately gradually course 2010. importantly, economic outlook surround exceptionally high uncertainty reflecting, among factors, low level consumer business confidence well ongoing deleveraging bank financial institutions. the economic financial situation prospect characterise two features: first, synchronise decline deceleration economic activity economy associate collapse world trade; and, second, grow sign adverse feedback loop real economy financial sector. although sharp drop value toxic asset weaken many banks’ balance sheets, weaken economic activity impair quality bank loans, adversely affect capital position willingness extend credit private sector. this, turn, constrain pace economic activity ability private sector service debts, entail risk vicious circle. ii. policy economic recovery sustain growth these observation two general implication economic policy. first, economy’s recovery require simultaneous implementation macroeconomic policy stimulate aggregate demand measure help repair banks’ balance sheet encourage provision credit economy. in way, potential vicious circle prevented. second, concert policy effort economies, especially large ones, necessary world trade revitalise financial capital flow stabilised. this help support emerge market economy global growth. the policy strategy pursue need identical across country region require size economic stimulus nature measure take need – – same, structural conjunctural condition differ. nevertheless, similar orientation consistency warranted. 1 see international monetary fund, global financial stability report market update, 28 january 2009, p.2. 2 base data available january 2009. bi review 38/2009 1 since intensification financial crisis september 2008, central bank government globally act decisive concert manner contain adverse effect financial crisis real economy promote recovery. in euro area, action take ecb eurosystem unprecedented size scope. government support financial institution form recapitalisations, guarantee bank debt and, recently, asset relief schemes, significant pertinent measure progressively implemented. and fiscal stimulus package euro area government substantial, amount total 2% euro area gdp year next. the immediate priority macroeconomic policy bank support scheme promote economy’s recovery preserve price financial stability. yet, fundamental policy objective recovery activity repair financial system achieve manner ensure sustain growth performance prevent recurrence episode financial imbalance market excess threaten financial stability economic welfare. put differently, important policy reform pursue today lay foundation sustain growth. let elaborate issue focus role contribution central bank policy financial system reform. central bank policy the ecb’s monetary policy provision liquidity play key role contain downside risk price stability, support economic activity stabilise financial system. the extent monetary policy ease since last october unprecedented, key ecb policy interest rate reduce 275 basis points. at time, money market rate decline even peak reach october 2008 result reduction policy rate provision unlimited liquidity bank fix interest rate (against expand range eligible collateral) since last october. at present, euribor rate maturity three month close main refinance rate (mro) ecb historically low level – range 0.93% (overnight) 1.56% (3 months).3 and level comparable correspond libor rate u dollar pound sterling money markets.4 thus, past six months, condition euro area money market significantly improve effectively similar – even good – major money markets. in addition, provision liquidity ecb euro area bank system extraordinary size scope. the size eurosystem’s balance sheet mid-february reach 1.53 trillion euro (or 1.96 trillion u dollars), compare 0.91 trillion euro eruption crisis. the expansion eurosystem’s balance sheet 70% period reflect various non-standard measure implement ecb, include provision unlimited fund euro fix interest rate period six month well supply liquidity currencies, notably u dollars, basis swap agreement federal reserve. the reduction policy rate increase supply reserve fully line ecb’s primary objective preserve price stability medium term, inflation pressure ease inflation risk diminished, help alleviate pressure credit market mitigate financial stability risks. 3 euribor rate long maturity (on 25 january 2009) following: 6 months: 1.71%; 9 months: 1.78%; 1 year: 1.86%. 4 u dollar 3-months libor 25 january 2009 1.48%; sterling 3-months libor 1.79%. 2 bi review 38/2009 nevertheless, although bank lend rate gradually falling, bank credit standard new loan tighten credit growth private sector decelerating. this partly reflect impact decline economic activity demand bank loans, also consequence ongoing deleveraging process bank system continue stress fund markets. government support bank system since last autumn, government support bank system various measures: inject new capital, provide guarantee new bank debt issuance and, recently, asset relief scheme (involving removal impair asset banks’ balance sheet provision guarantee limit valuation loss assets). these measure succeed stabilise bank system, reduce systemic risk strengthen confidence. the support provide substantial, example bank euro area receive 115 billion euro capital injection government (of 75 billion euro provide major bank groups) 217 billion euro fund guarantees. however, bank support measure take time implement. so far, one third commitment capital injection use small fraction – 12% – commitment guarantee new bank debt call upon. the participation bank debt guarantee scheme voluntary, limit use guarantee may reflect decline demand credit and/or desire bank continue deleveraging balance sheets. it is, however, important ensure constrain factor addressed, example disincentive associate provision price debt guarantee promptly addressed, help bank finance additional lend private sector. possible measure a relevant question whether tight finance condition continue stress bank system require measure government central bank order help revive extension bank credit economy. the answer regard need nature potential measure depend cause determinant prevail finance condition structure financial system. to extent (i) financial market stresses, (ii) deleveraging process, (iii) uncertainty economic outlook potential bank losses, (iv) low confidence impair function credit bank fund market transmission effect monetary policy, “non-standard” measure aim reduce fund uncertainty enhance function credit market and, consequently, monetary policy transmission mechanism, may represent possible course action. in euro area, bank system dominant role finance private sector capital market, compare economies, implementation measure would focus bank system. potential measure could include extension maturity central bank liquidity provide bank purchase private debt security secondary market order improve liquidity reduce cost fund real economy, thus help recovery. could ease monetary policy contribute contain potential disinflation risk provide support economic activity? i would like make two general remark concern role monetary policy foster economy’s recovery sustain growth juncture generally. first, emphasise past, ecb’s monetary policy ensure inflation expectation medium long term remain firmly anchor line govern council’s aim keep inflation below, close to, 2%. this anchor inflation expectation support sustainable growth, employment creation contribute financial stability. second, monetary policy stance determine also contribute smooth exit strategy current exceptional circumstance historically low rate unlimited provision central bi review 38/2009 3 bank money bank system. consequently, monetary policy aim address potential disinflation risk maintain medium-term price stability must implement manner also ensure preservation price stability long term. financial system reform and bring two final point concern two essential condition sustainable growth: financial system reform sound fiscal policy. it generally agree great urgent need introduce reform prevent recurrence episode financial market excess correction make global financial system resilient shocks. an extensive impressive amount work undertake national authority international bodies, auspex financial stability forum and, recently, g20 process. concrete proposal formulate – others currently elaborate – reduce cyclicality financial system various measure reforms, include enhancement scope effectiveness financial regulation supervision. in eu, report de larosière group valuable contribution end. the forthcoming summit meet group 20 london mark important step effective pursuit reform agenda globally. the prompt implementation propose financial reform foster sustainable growth financial stability long run, also contribute boost confidence financial system short run, thus promote economic recovery. fiscal policy last, definitely least, also essential sustainable growth prosperity confidence long-term soundness public finance maintained. government deficit public debt rise substantially country result economic downturn, discretionary measure stimulate economy, fund bank support schemes. this partly inevitable – due downturn – partly necessary – help stabilise economy financial system – short run. but also imperative fiscal policy design implement manner strike right balance need support economy’s recovery need preserve confidence soundness sustainability public finance key long-term performance economy. iii. conclusion i use word “confidence” several times. the severity duration current economic financial crisis partly consequence reduce confidence prospect economy soundness financial system. the recovery economy also hinge restoration consumer business confidence contribute revival spend investment, return normality financial market bank system. the rebuild trust depend ability appropriately combine policy action need address immediate challenge necessary reform establish economic, financial institutional environment conducive sustainable long-term growth. thank much attention. 4 bi review 38/2009 masaaki shirakawa: provision subordinate loan excerpt address mr masaaki shirakawa, governor bank japan, meet banks’ top management, tokyo, 24 march 2009. * * * at policy board meet hold march 17, bank japan decide explore new framework provide subordinate loan banks. we invite today representative bank subject international capital standard explain background bank japan’s view decision. the fund condition firm deteriorate rapidly since last autumn due increase strain global financial market collapse lehman brothers. while financial institution retain financial intermediation function accordingly increase lending, environment surround financial institution become increasingly severe due stock price plunge domestic economic downturn. fund raise financial market fund fiscal year-end mostly completed, firm continue face difficult fund conditions. while cp market start restore function, fund capital market limit firm high ratings. look ahead, demand fund secure liquidity year-end fiscal year-end demand work capital due rise raw material price last summer decline, demand fund continue restructure business expect gain momentum. there might case financial intermediation function carry smoothly macro perspective, strain global financial market increase financial institution become conscious possible capital constraint future. if financial institution become conscious take credit risk financial institution take action simultaneously, adverse feedback loop finance economy may intensify financial institutions’ restrain accumulate assets, lead fallacy composition, although action judge rational individual institution. a result, might weaken capital strength financial institution. from point view, concern influence possible decline stock prices. while amount stock currently hold financial institution significantly reduce compare early 2000s, remain unchanged hold substantial market risk associate stockholdings. although stock price recently somewhat rebounded, financial system u.s. europe remain unstable. it avoid financial institution's consciousness possible decline stock price trigger aforementioned fallacy composition. against backdrop, bank decide begin explore specifically provision subordinate loan bank subject international capital standards. this measure aim ensure smooth function financial intermediation stability japan’s financial system, enable japan’s bank maintain sufficient capital base even severe financial economic environments. by measure take bank, financial institution provide three channel raise capital; (1) capital raise financial institution markets, (2) capital raise base act special measure strengthen financial functions, (3) borrow subordinate loan bank. subordinate loan bank work effectively conjunction two measure raise capital. in addition, provide safety-net measure would enhance robustness japan’s financial system function financial intermediation even stress conditions. bi review 37/2009 1 for central bank, kind direct provision quasi-capital fund extremely extraordinary measure. however, consider future stress scenario financial system, bank judge that, standpoint central bank, necessary best maintain smooth function financial intermediation ensure stability financial system even conduct extraordinary measure. the bank expect financial institution grasp think behind measure strive maintain smooth function financial intermediation effort boost capital bases. needle say, risk management extremely important financial institutions, cannot emphasize much. however, current circumstances, i mention above, surface risk stem fallacy composition avoided. to end, important management financial institutions, conduct sound business operations, boost capital base envision consequence japan's economy. the bank also expect financial institution pay due concern smooth communication client company convey business policy lend stances. it basic premise stability financial system ensure order return sustainable economic growth path price stability. from standpoint central bank, bank determine make best effort secure stability financial system. we would appreciate continue support cooperation. thank you. 2 bi review 37/2009 svein gjedrem: the outlook norwegian economy monetary policy assessment

government fiscal measures, analysis indicate growth economy positive second half year. growth drive rise private consumption result low key policy rate, growth real wage high government transfers.

situation perception function economy monetary policy. if economic development broadly line projections, 5 see staff memo 2008/3 norge bank. bi review 37/2009 13 economic agent expect interest rate path also approximately line projected. on hand, interest rate path may shift economic prospect change, effect interest rate change inflation, output employment differ assumed. in monetary policy report, present two alternative scenario demand high low present baseline scenario. the yellow line chart illustrate scenario growth private consumption strong expect turnaround occur rapidly. in scenario, interest rate may decrease less extent move quickly. the red line chart illustrate scenario global downturn deep prolonged, pronounce effect assumed. it appropriate set low interest rate order stimulate economy thereby prevent inflation become low. the primary effect key rate close zero probably come via weak krone. it appropriate consider instrument interest rate. monetary policy normally operate low key rate reduce real interest rate expect inflation market risk premium stable short term. when key rate move close low bound, real interest rate still influence key rate expectations, influence risk premium anchor inflation expectations. the expectation channel particularly important current key rate cannot reduced. for norge bank, expectation channel establish part monetary policy provide forecast key policy rate. to sum up, useful decompose factor behind change interest rate path since 17 december 2008. the interest rate forecast monetary policy report low forecast publish december last year. the outlook global growth deteriorate further. the slowdown norwegian economy appear pronounce expect december. low global domestic demand would suggest low key policy rate project december. our inflation forecast, along strong krone low key rate expectation abroad also suggest low key policy rate project time. 14 bi review 37/2009 let conclude. monetary policy cannot fine-tune development economy, mitigate large effect economy expose shocks. overall, outlook balance risk suggest key rate gradually reduce further. the key policy rate interval 1-2 per cent period publication next monetary policy report 17 june 2009, unless norwegian economy expose new major shocks. thank attention. bi review 37/2009 15 jean-pierre landau: bubble macro prudential

2009. * * * look future financial regulation specially challenge current juncture. right midst crisis, cannot sure fully understand ultimate causes, roots, dynamics. furthermore, want fight last war. we need vision financial system evolve future, something difficult figure right now. and yet, strong political demand orientation measure fix problem make sure never happen again. this demand fully legitimate, consider social cost crisis impose societies, specifically, financial burden take tax payers. i choose present remark bubble macro prudential supervision. they see work program full-fledged answer many question raise future. i deal three issues: try achieve? what main challenges? which proper instruments? what try achieve? here, two certainties, many questions. first, know sure macro prudential supervision preemptive nature. it aim avoid crisis crisis costly. second, macro approach financial supervision must encompass whole financial system oppose specific individual institution. beyond that, thing become complicated. macrosupervision often assimilate prevent systemic risk. these closely related, identical concepts. systemic risk refer internal dynamic financial system; whereas, macroprudential supervision mainly concern interaction real economy. occurrence systemic risk harm financial system; always, necessarily, real economy. on hand, case (temporarily) healthy system, obvious systemic problems, may behave way long run, detrimental real economy: typical example expansion balance sheet credit which, itself, threaten short term resilience system potentially damaging. conversely, deleveraging excessive level debt may good systemic point view, but, do abrupt manner, could create enormous pressure real side. so, healthy resilient system may necessary condition, clear sufficient one achieve appropriate macroprudential objectives. should macroprudential supervision aim avoid dampen volatility financial system? financial stability end itself. it help conducive good macroeconomic performance. volatility may drive fundamentals. sharp movement asset price may help financial system serve cushion, "absorber" exogenous economic shocks. this welfare improve since avoids, mitigates, adjustment rigid good labor markets. 1 i indebted benoit mojon many useful suggestion remarks. all remain mistake mine. opinion express purely personal necessarily reflect position banque de france. bi review 37/2009 1 by token, procyclicality bad. it depend causal link: financial system origin amplifier destabilize dynamics? or simply react cyclical evolution real economy? we concern "intrinsic procyclicality", create inside financial system. finally, cyclicality real economy beneficial long term growth one mechanism "creative destruction" take place productive system. real significant damage occur financial imbalance allow build long time two consequences: first asset price significantly deviate fundamental value, create distortion allocation resources; second, imbalance unwind suddenly abruptly, trigger major disruption growth economic cycle. this happen right now. and closely resemble definition bubble. this clearly point one possible mandate macroprudential supervision that, feasible, would pragmatic legitimate: avoid bubbles. bubble always trigger within financial system. they may root productivity shocks, instance. but cannot develop unless permissive financial condition prevail. there good reason prevent bubbles. they impose significant cost real economy. they may place undue burden monetary policy. they raise important question fairness distribution income. such simple definition objective macroprudential supervision quite attractive. however, simplicity come price. avoid bubble present enormous challenges, i turn now. the challenge macroprudential supervision analytical challenge the first – important – challenge analytical. bubble difficult detect. asset price boom-bust cycle become clearly apparent event. moreover little regularity business cycle, make difficult identify certainty long last deviation asset price fundamentals. look path asset prices, know ex ante confront inflexion trend, one-step adjustment equilibrium levels, start bubble? there simple mechanical answer question. this one reason "early warning" mechanism really worked. while bubble hard detect, nevertheless know repetition financial crisis history – include current crisis – economy always subject risk new bubble. give risk, ought reflect feature financial system may create bubble allow develop proportion threaten economic welfare. we know thing procyclical characteristic financial system. our account prudential regime may increase procyclicality recent years. in mark market environment, asset price movement quickly translate change capital base financial institutions. this, turn, trigger additional demand asset increase prices. this kind "inverted demand curve"; demand increase prices, may create condition bubble. but to. strictly speaking, procyclicality refer big amplitude fluctuation around trend. but bubble may induce deviation long last start wonder trend itself. whether wide fluctuation price lead last deviation uncertain. we good insight dynamic bubble, develops. but know much actually start bubble, crucial point. 2 bi review 37/2009 so need rule guide macroprudential decision know live uncertainty. actually, rule may exist, implicitly. the prudential apparatus work past presumption movement asset price base fundamentals. the burden proof think something go wrong. and, course, impossible prove existence bubble late. and, least initial phase bubble, lack rational explanation observe movement asset prices. it may useful, macroprudential perspective, consider rebalancing burden proof. significant last departure past level trend key asset prices, risk premia credit aggregate systematically trigger macroprudential review, implicit assumption bubble may occur unless prove otherwise. this seem justify look current social cost previous hesitation. this also rational course action. bubble develop investor incentive ignore "tail risk" bubble may burst. where incentive come from? bubble mostly finance credit, make possible investor shift risk lenders, keep profit (especially profit booked, distributed, real time). this asymmetry incentive extremely difficult eliminate ex ante. to make sure bubble never happen, one may need impose permanently significant constraint development credit leverage, would prove penalize normal times. a good – le costly – approach would be, supervisors, closely monitor financial system preserve possibility intervene establish kind presumption i mentioned. two approach macroprudential supervision a many matter public policy, choice rule discretion implement macrofinancial supervision. there basically two possibilities, necessarily mutually exclusive. first, (the rule base approach), macrosupervision build automatic stabilizer would constrain institution behaviour, regardless individual situations. example would include contra cyclical capital requirements, instance, well dynamic provisioning. a i develop later, stabilizer construct act directly incentive take risk reward provide risk taking. a second approach would consist discretionary, "top down" intervention macroauthorities. prudential authority would step impose (or relax) constraint whenever come conclusion dangerous imbalance build (or unwinding). we probably cannot dispense second approach. the difficulty date cycle make dangerous rely purely automatic mechanisms, cannot precisely calibrated. financial cycles, particular, drive change risk appetite impossible predict. actually, one essential objective macroprudential supervision may "regulate" (not legal sense, economically) aggregate level risk appetite inside financial system. this unavoidably involve degree discretionary judgement intervention. combine two component macrosupervision (systemic macroeconomic) two approach (automatic discretionary) produce interest classification, present table below: bi review 37/2009 3 mechanism systemic risk adjustment macroconditions purpose automatic • buff (capital and/or liquidity) • loan value ratio • account framework • time vary capital ratio • dynamic provision discretionary • stress test • discretionary adjustment capital ratios, provision margin requirement • pillar ii basel 2 institutional challenge the discretionary approach macrosupervision raise important institutional issues. first, make judgment? and body independent not? there good case put central bank charge. if one take historical perspective, strike mandate mission central bank take major turn follow financial crises. central bank informational advantage (or least disadvantage) judge cyclical position. they incentive act, macroprudential supervision alleviate burden monetary policy, need monetary transmission mechanism work. so clearly pivotal role process. but alone care financial stability. and experience show price stability – primary mandate – always coincide financial stability avoidance bubbles. furthermore, integrate financial system, judgment make worldwide basis. another alternative imf. but imf mostly control government decision make accord vote shares. implement macrosupervision involve delicate decision (like strengthen lend standard good times) government may spontaneously agree. a fully independent body would certainly necessary. second, judgment pass regulator supervisor translate supervisory decisions. this totally unchartered territory. i would mention matter future research governance financial system. the instrument the important instrument current toolkit capital requirement put financial intermediaries. those capital requirement perform dual function. they act compulsory buff impose bank shareholders. they also incentive function: prevent 4 bi review 37/2009 shareholder take much risk deposits. it prove difficult reconcile two objectives. in theory could done, tax use raise revenue allocate resources. but, practice, may lose increasingly complex system. in addition, capital requirement may bind need to. if asset market boom perceive return high, bank always find necessary capital. conversely, capital dry downturns, necessary. introduce counter cyclical capital requirement certainly help. but may look enough interrelate dynamic stock credit markets; or, put differently, capital flow financial sector different phase economic cycle consequence credit flows. finally, tailor capital requirement definition economic capital bank strengthen incentive function. but from, macroprudential perspective, replicate closely private risk management method metrics, encourage uniformity behaviour, which, itself, source instability. it become increasingly clear, seem me, want prudential supervision effectively pre-empt build imbalances, act directly individual collective incentives. this push u look closely "accounting-compensation" nexus. when look revenue draw financial investment, generally impossible distinguish excess return additional risk taking. ignorance tail risk fit perfectly framework. this point possible solution: regulatory system force price risk dimensions, include liquidity risk. again, clear analogy tax theory: "internalizing" risk eliminate market failures. the conceptual challenge quantifying, instance, liquidity risk, enormous. but live world second best, even approximate measure would good nothing all. i stop here, knowing, again, i raise question i provide answers. but look happen moment, economies, necessary think "out box" look possibilities. those charge macroeconomic policy that. those responsible financial regulation hesitate emulate them, least partially. thank attention. reference aglietta m. b. mojon (2008), central banking, a. berger, ph. molyneux j. wilson (eds), the

governor reserve bank australia, third annual ian little memorial lecture, melbourne, 25 march 2009. * * * introduction it great pleasure melbourne deliver ian little memorial lecture. i work ian young recruit research department reserve bank early 1980s. i remember easygoing young man cheerful disposition, mop curly dark hair. even then, ian clear thinker strong commitment good public policy. so really surprise that, leave reserve bank late 1980s succeed private sector, return public service victorian department treasury. in role, many know good i do, shone. i would occasionally run ian conference would always impress me, macroeconomist work central bank, need acknowledge importance microeconomic policy reform good economic performance. it simple, important, point. while macroeconomic policy fore right around world, government central bank seek foster recovery recession, long term live standard depend innovation productivity, le manipulation interest rate aggregate spend decision governments, common discussion often admits. real prosperity depend critically supply side economy – realm microeconomic policies. it spirit i wish speak today something i address public before, namely, payment system. although reserve bank best know macroeconomic policy responsibilities, has, fact, important microeconomic responsibility, namely, competitiveness efficiency payment system, include retail level. this obligation give payment system board reserve bank, result wallis committee process mid 1990s – hence, topic evening. motivation we might begin asking: efficient payment system important? the answer payment system facilitate economic financial activity, whether day-to-day payment i make, payment business transaction financial assets. there around 18 million transaction australia every day, value around $230 billion. with many payments, even relatively small inefficiency potentially significant implication cost payment system. part reserve bank’s job, therefore, promote efficient arrangement payment system interest broad economy. early reform high-value payment system improve efficiency safety, retail payment area, progress slower. in fulfil responsibility past 10 years, reserve bank fairly high-profile instance ultimately resort regulation. this strong predilection regulatory solutions. on contrary, reserve bank usually first seek achieve improvement competition efficiency without direct regulation. in particular, seek encourage player payment space identify potential improvement undertake reform achieve these. but bi review 36/2009 1 industry-led reform sometimes difficult achieve, reserve bank ultimately require take strong role, include regulating. i want examine case, general level reference recent example. these observation frame particular challenge reserve bank face promote competition efficiency payment system, conclusion apply number area regulator work spur improvement efficiency productivity. co-operation competition network in payment systems, networks, certain amount co-operation participant need ensure system provide benefit users. for example, i purchase something retailer, matter retailer banks, i bank. we expect able rely bank system transfer money u retailer. we expect that, pull debit credit card pay, works. that require detail set co-operative arrangement financial institution accommodate payment other’s customers. these institution also compete other, however, attract customers. a common way compete offer product feature offer one’s competitors. but ability offer new product rely competitor make change systems, innovation may stymied. why would bank will incur cost develop relevant system order help customer competitors? the tension two separate dynamic – need co-operation impulse competition – mean industry may difficulty take decision interest system whole, community broadly. in circumstances, someone – industry group regulator – may need play co ordinate role, encourage improvement common infrastructure benefit all, still allow competitive force bank ensure new product price competitively package meet customers’ needs. of course, issue neither new unique payment industry. it well accept economic literature industry rely network infrastructure (so-called “network industries”) incentive co-operate order gain efficiencies, socially optimal level co-operation might achieved. one illustration point cite network literature development rail network unite state 19th century.1the early u railway system consist large number individual link pair destinations, often different track gauge designs. there clear public (and private) benefit link “networks” allow good passenger cross efficiently one railway another. but, nonetheless, railway often design incompatible, prevent competitor siphon traffic. eventually, commercial logic degree co-operation sufficient ensure standardisation occur bring large productivity gains. for instance, space decade, time shipment good rail philadelphia chicago reduce nine week three days.2 despite pay offs, standardisation 1 carlton dw jm klamer (1983), “the need coordination among firms, special reference network industries”, the university chicago law review, 50(2), pp 446-465. 2 see carlton klamer (1983), p 455. 2 bi review 36/2009 still complete. in fact, way railway could reach optimal level standardisation horizontal integration – merge compete railways. while sound million mile away australia’s payment system 21st century, parallel quite strong. for example, like link railways, realisation single, interconnect eftpos system valuable number individual eftpos system could talk one another drive co operation standardisation quite early development system. but despite benefit brought, co operation, standardisation innovation australia’s eftpos system progress far desirable. the eftpos system essentially remain unchanged since establishment 1980s. the fact system build bilateral link major participant mean one standardise communication protocol participants. furthermore, co operative effort innovate upgrade system complicate require bilateral relationship renegotiated. this is, fact, difficulty many australia’s payment system – base bilateral links, establish mechanism foster improvement expansion network. so leave devices, network may stop short efficient level co-operation. incomplete standardisation may result, innovation movement one standard superior one may difficult co-ordination problems, even benefit society outweigh costs. the literature point several reason potential outcome, evident example i already given. the first classic economic externality. firm within network may concern agree common standard competitor, competitor may able capture benefit move standard. why would i pay cost convert railway line gauge connect another railway, competitor gain much rail traffic i his? the implication competitor network might individually make decision optimal network whole. the second ineffectiveness voluntary strategy achieve co-operation network industry own compete firms. establishment industry body agree standard common approach, success body mixed. agreement tend delay vest interest and, cases, non standardisation use barrier entry competitors.3 third, often tendency towards “excess inertia” standards.4 problem coordinate movement old standard superior standard (such movement new system architecture payment system) may mean movement occur, occur slowly, even benefit society outweigh cost switching. these co ordination problem may cause uneven distribution cost benefit switch standards, uncertainty regard movement rival firm new standard.5 3 for example, see david p s greenstein (1990), “the economics compatibility standards: an introduction recent research”, economics innovation new technology, 1(1), pp 3-41; farrel j p klemperer (2007), “co-ordination lock-in: competition switch cost network effects”, m armstrong r porter (eds), handbook industrial organization, elsevier, amsterdam, pp 1967-2072; australian context, lowe p (2005), “innovation governance payment systems”, address banktech.05 conference, sydney, 16 september. 4 for example, see farrel klemperer (2007). 5 there also be, cases, tendency towards overly rapid change standard (so call “excess momentum”), lead premature adoption new standard le efficient old standard. further, benefit disproportionately change new standard fail consider bi review 36/2009 3 a recent australian example from first principles, therefore, might expect achieve agreement among australian financial institution development payment system might easy. so proved. there number example this, recent one effort industry reform atm system. a may aware, recently change way atm transaction machine own bank price pay for. instead pay relatively obscure “foreign atm fee”, charge bank account end month, people present cost transaction real time. these change will, view, allow competitive force come play way previously impossible. but process achieve reforms, likely benefits, i want focus evening. in particular, require change bilateral link major player system. in sense, problem akin u railway system – get competitor agree change bilateral link standardise way? work industry reform start long ago 2001. while progress make next years, participant ultimately could agree ask payment system board guidance way forward. finally, much cajole reserve bank, new arrangement implement early month – eight year discussion issue commenced. ironically, package implement differ little proposal put forward industry group 2004, subsequently abandon owe irreconcilable difference parties. moreover, despite firm desire industry implement new arrangement without reserve bank intervention, industry ultimately ask reserve bank use power help finalise process. this unique example. reform australia’s payment system include cheques, direct entry eftpos face similar challenges. a seen, altogether surprise give network nature payment system number player must co-operate, also compete. the bilateral architecture i already mention also difficulty. every large bank agreement every large bank handle payment one another’s customers. the bank are, agreement necessary complicate system becomes. to use railway line analogy, customise track built, difficult task ultimately convert track standard gauge. this two implications. first, bilateral agreement helpful get system start initially, may subsequently work well already system, potential new entrant face prospect negotiate numerous different connections. this act barrier entry, inhibit competition. second, upgrade network require participant agree, since must make changes, participant therefore effectively veto, least delay, decision affect network. because different participant different technology cycle different strategic interests, high probability participant unwilling proceed give point time. if participant think particular change may provide another participant potential competitive advantage, probably attempt delay. indeed, one participant see potential competitive advantage loss network benefit reluctant late change, participant may end remain old standard reduce network. see farrel klemperer (2007). 4 bi review 36/2009 change, almost guarantee another see disadvantage and, therefore, seek block change. this result significant co ordination problem industry. the result that, underlie architecture australian payment system, little change past 20 30 years, even though technology evolve quarter century since technology underlie atm eftpos system first established. so payment system infrastructure serve australia well, pressure change building. the network structure need update service customer start fall behind available countries. in past, reserve bank identify real-time internet payments, business-to-business payment online payment mechanism example progress make overseas not, date, australia. the result co-ordination challenge evident process reform atm system. with party different objectives, consensus hard achieve. for example, small institution would consider system allow form fee-free network among – otherwise would competitive disadvantage big bank large atm networks. but large institution saw opportunity obtain competitive advantage small institution could form large fee-free networks. there also reluctance liberalise access system. while improve access would serve increase benefit system whole therefore participant collectively, bank tend focus cost would bear individually well competition would face. in short, problem participant system think benefit system whole power effect change. now many countries, role handle single private sector entity manage system systems. for example, credit card scheme central body responsible governance, innovation promotion. their incentive thing expand network, make use easy attractive increase number participants. they have, effect, internalise externality inherent network. while credit card system element unduly limit competition respects, centralise approach arguably superior network innovation growth. that central body determine standard coordinate change. these arrangement also access-friendly new entrant need establish one, standardise connection system. some private payment system country entity – example, link manage atm system unite kingdom, interac manage equivalent eftpos atm system canada, paymark manage new zealand’s eftpos network. but entity miss australian payment systems. what role public policy? these consideration suggest important potential role public policy promote change payment system. while academic literature divide generally role regulation network industries, seem support careful regulatory intervention industry compete network component sufficient standardisation move standard cannot achieve timely manner. there also seem considerable sense entity responsibility consider interest system (and society) whole power achieve reform end. indeed, need body responsible promote public interest competition efficiency payment system recognise wallis committee decade ago. it lead directly establishment payment system board reserve bank grant current statutory goal powers. the fact central bank fulfil oversight role australia unusual internationally – many countries, issue competition in, efficiency of, payment system fall competition authorities. but nevertheless common find structure place network bi review 36/2009 5 industry assist promote access efficient set standard – whether body merely assist co-ordination one power enforce perhaps set standards. we see network industry australia, telecommunications, electricity ports, frequently sort public body oversight network, perhaps operate conjunction industry body bodies. of course, body take decision regulate hastily. in cases, graduate approach regulation area pursued, reflect reluctance assume regulatory solution necessarily superior, government would necessarily able choose best standard, particularly highly technical rapidly change field. the typical approach network regulator prefer co operative industry approach standard setting, provide suasion process unsuccessful, ultimately set standard necessary. where intervention required, academic literature suggest might look first ensure compatibility compete standard – instance, rule govern access interconnection compete network – set detail standard themselves. so presumption black-letter regulatory solution adopted. in fact, time current regulatory arrangement australia’s payment system established, expectation co-regulatory model would followed. in view, industry would progress reform part reserve bank’s power would use occasionally, last resort, reform could otherwise achieved. a turn out, however, reserve bank’s power use often i suspect initially imagined. the reserve bank always explore way statutory goal competition efficiency payment system achieve without resort direct regulatory powers. but history atm reform demonstrate difficult pure industry-based reform move ahead without least push public policy body. possible approach reflect experience then, look future, question best strike balance facilitate reform effectively. there possible approach – one interventionist previous one. first, reserve bank could agree target timeline industry, without explicit regulation penalty failure meet targets. this approach similar approach exist industry payment body, australian payment clear association (apca), take many projects. provide agreement need change reach (no small achievement), apca play coordinate role organise project plan, provide resource set timeline targets, though past project tend focus technical issue rather strategic directions. in absence agreement need change, however, industry-based project – which, all, rely mutual agreement – tend proceed sufficiently quickly. that observation lead second option – possibility reserve bank use overt regulation may enough forge agreement among industry participants. this path predominantly follow progress reform atm system, number reform payment system. where industry agreement issue forthcoming, reserve bank engage various side seek solution clear possibility might regulate agreement could reached. this approach essentially behind establishment payment council unite kingdom, 6 bi review 36/2009 development uk’s “faster payments”6 – initiative undertake knowledge that, something done, would official intervention. while work, emphasis co ordination role reserve bank play industry, experience atm system suggest still may drawn-out process. individual participant preference status quo incentive push plan along rely reserve bank set timetable agreement implementation – timetable invariably argue “challenging”. a third, intrusive, option reserve bank set explicit standard – may view traditional regulation. this approach take deal credit card schemes, reserve bank set number standard deal level interchange fee imposition surcharges. this approach could, however, also use achieve industry co-ordination around technical issues. for example, reserve bank could set technical standard industry unable agree common standard itself. such approach may yet become relevant australia’s electronic payment system, especially co-ordination problem inhibit innovation. a example, suggest reserve bank could play role development eftpos system. the system design originally transfer money consumer account merchant accounts. these transfer initiate eftpos card swipe merchant’s terminal impact customer’s account immediate. in recent years, however, demand use system different way, send payment consumers’ account real time. these demand flow initially government look ensure benefit payment reach recipient quickly possible – example, provide emergency fund natural disaster. the eftpos system present accommodate sort payment limit way. while participant industry see benefit expand eftpos message format enable transactions, limit progress. a requirement reserve bank participant industry able accept instruction conform common message standard would facilitate access new entrants, thus competition. if reserve bank choose require use international standard, could also facilitate competition overseas provider payment relate services. a mandate reserve bank eftpos message format must able support credit transaction might likewise lay foundation innovation eftpos system base transaction quickly industry might able achieve itself. notwithstanding regulation respect card payment systems, reserve bank past prefer first two options. this particularly case respect issue relate technical standard system architecture, reserve bank occasion raise issue leave industry drive reforms. we remain conscious risk public intervention may impediment innovation. a say number times, hope industry deal issue itself. but also know industry fail push ahead improvement system, australian deny full benefit modern retail payment system. to large extent, future approach payment system board depend behaviour industry participants. if industry agreement reform reach relatively quickly, need reserve bank’s coordinate role interventionist limited. on hand, if, past occasions, industry unable carry forward reform innovation itself, reserve bank would consider make extensive use tool disposal. 6 “faster payments” system allow internet bank payment make close real time. bi review 36/2009 7 conclusion the economics network complex, role public policy delicate one. the aim ensure, far can, correct balance strike need co-operation benefit competition. co-operation require order ensure benefit extensive, reasonably standardised, network enjoy public, raise economic welfare. competition vital long run make sure cost minimise incentive respond change consumer preference maximised. policy recognise fulfil role deal externality inherent set decision make private market participants, also respect maintain competitive dynamic. we recognise role industry participant regulator mutually interdependent. we trust industry too. the payment system board content confine encourage industry solution occasional catalyst agreement among parties, achieve goal board given. but must also prepared, needed, use regulatory power forcefully. in judge approach preferred, respond industry’s behaviour, respond ours. the approach adopt instance tailor circumstance occasion need innovate. what constant set statutory goal give payment system board – control risk, promote competition efficiency payment system. the payment system board commit objective pragmatic, determined, pursue them. we look forward effective engagement industry process. 8 bi review 36/2009 željko rohatinski: recent economic financial development croatia address dr željko rohatinski, governor croation national bank, press conference, zagreb, 18 february 2009. * * * i glad respond invitation. at similar gather le two month ago, inform cnb's view current economic situation preliminary expectation regard trend 2009. in interim, assumption prove correct cnb taken, continue take, appropriate measures. now i would first like inform measure taken, put context wide international domestic developments. the slowdown economic growth, evident second third quarter 2008, fourth quarter virtually turn stagnation annual level, – despite annual growth rate 2.3 percent 2008 whole – slowdown economic activity obviously continue 2009. the two key problem croatian economy, deteriorate years, seriously aggravate circumstances: problem current account deficit, estimate eur 4.5bn 11 percent gdp 2008, external debt, stand eur 39bn end 2008 account 94 percent gdp. these two major problem determine general economic trend 2009 represent main challenge overall economic policy. this policy address issue prevent escalation negative consequence background global financial economic crisis, is, aspects, affect croatia well. this policy face several serious limitations. the first relate drop export demand, estimate 3 percent good service sector. the second involve sharp decrease foreign direct investments, due fact much leave sell follow privatisation share ina. the third limitation relate halt growth foreign borrow enterprises, cause capital market contraction, exacerbate concern extent possible refinance exist debt 2009. the fourth limitation pose high repayment total external debt fall due year, approximately amount eur 12.8bn principal eur 1bn interest, one third gdp. this amount include approximate eur 6bn outstanding principal enterprise government debt. in consequence external limitations, import finance impossible keep present level. accordingly, estimate decrease 8 percent imports, 5 percent import exclude oil, would also result current account deficit narrow 11 percent gdp 2008 6-6.5 percent gdp 2009. such situation leaf little room maneuver come decide economic policy implement year, probably follow year. this policy aim halt growth domestic consumption, change structure create save levels. the previously-mentioned external limitation economic policy inevitably produce negative impact economic growth society whole. the main concern regard whether gdp rate reduce 1 2 3 percent, maintain healthy core economy ensure finance operation aggravate conditions. it need emphasise financial sector stability play major role process. there two parallel objective need achieve order stability sustained: one maintain country's external liquidity maintain stability exchange rate. these two objective interrelate inseparable. a bi review 36/2009 1 failure achieve would result activation type risks: currency risk, credit risk, risk rat drop, risk relate price increase halt inflow foreign currency funds, short, risk lead collapse financial system. there doubt normal function financial system would undermine participant directly indirectly constitute system, major impact functioning, especially banks, would affected. it well-known fact bank croatia good financial result end 2008 even outperform parent banks. their rate return capital exceed 10 percent capital adequacy ratio stand 14 percent, enable them, continue enable them, safely conduct business operations. however, also fact operate condition considerably change change reflect possible modality operation 2009. the change condition include decline external finance increase costs, rise domestic foreign exchange demand increase domestic borrow requirement government, will, way too, refinance repayment portion external debt. this change condition also result banks' effort influence, propose arrangement cnb channels, aspect central bank's monetary policy. during negotiation ministry finance bank consortium grant eur 750m loan, bank cause unprecedented situation, condition grant loan upon four major change make cnb's policy. these requirement follows: abolish limit impose credit growth, monitor growth basis original currency loan granted, reduce kuna allocate portion reserve requirement 75 50 percent, ensure sufficient level kuna liquidity order constantly keep money market interest rate 10 percent, harmonise central bank's exchange rate control mechanism banks. i would like clarify background requests, intention criticise banks, explain element central bank take account define implement measures. let start statement, come bank circles, deteriorate foreign borrow condition point insist curb growth banks' credit placements, especially situation bank plan growth 2009 remain prescribe limits. some also opinion bank altogether cease lend impose limits. however, banks' household corporate placement increase 11.2 percent end january year relative december 2007, basis calculation pursuant decision limit banks' placement growth. with limit growth set 13 percent, bank january sufficient room normal credit growth. the "catch" was, however, foreign currency clause, which, time exchange rate depreciate significant degree, increase nominal value loan low limit banks. this problem loan index euro, kuna depreciate versus euro 0.7 percent past 13 months. however, depreciate 12.3 percent swiss franc, bank large share loan index swiss franc find limit "too low", also slow placement growth order avoid purchase cnb bills. in regard, i would like stress several occasion 2006 2007 publicly warn risk connect loan index swiss franc, client commercial banks. deputy governor vujčić speak parliament, warn fell deaf ears. interest loan low interest loan demand grew. in meantime, even low interest rates, due appreciation swiss franc, kuna value repayment loan sizeably increased. a result come banks' wish solve limit problem remove restriction placement monitor loan basis original currency. a regard issue, cnb cannot anything. we warn risks, market 2 bi review 36/2009 player aware aware this. they opt loan face consequences. thus, see restriction growth total bank placement arise effect regulation. provided, course, exchange rate remain stable. however, bank seem share expectations. therefore, i think recent reference exchange rate depreciation likely aim step banks' request removal limit placements. true, strong depreciation, maintain limit could lead credit crunch country. but unrealistic scenario. the second third bank request relate increase kuna liquidity, background lurk wish ensure additional source liquidity continue growth placement intensify cnb issue activities. this irregardless fact experience show high kuna liquidity create direct depreciation pressure kuna exchange rate. the last request, harmonise effort bank central bank maintain exchange rate stability involve scenario cnb would close banks' short position previously agree exchange rate end business day. in words, stability exchange rate would maintain solely expense central bank's foreign exchange reserves. the cnb, course, concede request. it good ministry finance manage secure credit arrangement worth eur 750m without attempt exert pressure cnb. however, element still present. a function bank system new circumstances, everything know tell u stability financial system imperative maintain normal economic situation country function economy whole. this necessarily presuppose stability exchange rate key factor price stability. all market participant must give contribution, include commercial banks, altruism best interest. rise inflation, rise interest rates, risk loan repayment defaults, disturbance external payments, come that, would significant adverse effect operation banks. one need recollect happen countries, hungary, mention others, problem bank face disturbances. for reason, feel bank croatia, regardless foreign-owned, cannot operate without take account state economy, client financial system country whole. it interest must prevail despite problem face parent banks. in regard, explain mr pröll, austrian finance minister, cnb would look favourably upon attempt withdraw capital, deposit pay total accumulate profits, would destabilise domestic bank system. in case, cnb would force undertake protective measures, regardless thus connect risks. we receive assurance would withdrawals. the second imperative relate foreign currency asset commercial banks, is, liquid foreign currency claim eur 7.6bn (roughly amount cnb's net foreign currency reserves), circumstance must use maintain stability financial system. in october, repeal marginal reserve requirement amount eur 460m, introduce two change system currency allocation reserve requirement (effect: eur 1.1bn) recently low minimum rate foreign currency claim 28.5 25 percent, thus release eur 840m. today low rate 25 20 percent, release eur 1.25bn. our activity aim direct intervention foreign exchange market: today already sell eur 185m foreign exchange market average foreign exchange rate 7.44 kuna one euro, value previous intervention eur 328m, mean past three week half billion euro sell banks. these intervention bi review 36/2009 3 aim prevent sudden short-term exchange rate fluctuations. however, foreign exchange intervention cannot remain cnb's instrument. indirectly, influence stability kuna exchange rate kuna liquidity: today, example, hrk 8.5bn bid submit repo auction, half accepted. hence, intend change decision limit banks' placement growth expect fiscal policy part preserve stability. we aware restrictive kuna liquidity policy lead growth money market interest rates, growth need automatically transfer growth interest rate household corporate loans. still, objectively speaking, would difficult expect interest rate decline. this, however, mean cnb socially insensitive. we feel debtor good protect prevent foreign exchange rate depreciate prevent interest rate growth. interest rate go one two percentage points, depreciation speak two digit numbers. i would like u remember 1990s say inflation 15 percent month great evil economy could face would sufficient index salaries, exchange rate, interest rate system work. but inflation soon reach 40 percent month system collapsed. a similar thing would happen exchange rate. once genie bottle hard put back. in situation like this, exchange rate either defend let go. there between. we know depreciation would take us. this view situation 2009. whether succeed plans, cannot guarantee. great many thing even depend us, even market player croatia external factors. in case, everything power come situation alive wind possible. 4 bi review 36/2009 ben s bernanke: american international group testimony mr ben s bernanke, chairman board governor u federal reserve system, committee financial services, u house representatives, washington dc, 24 march 2009. * * * chairman frank, rank member bachus, member committee, i appreciate opportunity discus federal reserve's involvement american international group, inc. (aig). in testimony, i describe support aig difficult necessary step protect economy stabilize financial system. i also discus issue relate compensation note two matter raise experience merit congressional attention. reason original lend decision we federal reserve, work closely treasury, make decision lend aig september 16 last year. it extraordinary time. global financial market experience unprecedented strain worldwide loss confidence. fannie mae freddie mac place conservatorship two week earlier, lehman brother file bankruptcy day before. we concern number major firm intense stress. aig's financial condition deteriorate time, cause actual expect loss subprime mortgage-backed security credit default swap aig's financial product unit, aig-fp, write mortgage-related securities. a confidence firm declined, effort find private-sector solution unsuccessful, aig face severe liquidity pressure threaten force imminently bankruptcy. the federal reserve treasury agree aig's failure condition prevail would pose unacceptable risk global financial system economy. some aig's insurance subsidiaries, among large unite state world, would likely put rehabilitation regulators, leave policyholder face considerable uncertainty status claims. state local government entity lend $10 billion aig would suffer losses. worker whose 401(k) plan purchase $40 billion insurance aig risk stable value fund would decline value would see insurance disappear. global bank investment bank would suffer loss loan line credit aig, derivative aig-fp. the banks' combine exposure exceed $50 billion.1 money market mutual fund others hold aig's roughly $20 billion commercial paper would also take losses. in addition, aig's insurance subsidiary substantial derivative exposure aig-fp could weaken event parent company's failure. moreover, lehman case clearly demonstrates, focus direct effect default aig's counterparties understate risk financial system whole. once begun, financial crisis spread unpredictably. for example, lehman's default commercial paper cause prominent money market mutual fund "break buck" 1 in addition, many bank borrow security aig's security lend program give aig cash collateral. upon aig bankruptcy, bank would take possession security instead receive back cash, expose possible loss securities. bi review 35/2009 1 suspend withdrawals, turn ignite general run prime money market mutual funds, result severe stress commercial paper market. a i mentioned, aig $20 billion commercial paper outstanding, failure would exacerbate problem money market mutual funds. another worrisome possibility uncertainty safety insurance product could lead run broad insurance industry policyholder creditors. moreover, well know market many major financial institution large exposure aig. it failure would likely lead financial market participant pull back even commercial investment banks, institution perceive weak would face escalate pressure. recall event take place passage emergency economic stabilization act, provide fund treasury use help stem global bank panic october. consequently, unlikely failure additional major firm could prevent wake failure aig. at best, consequence aig's failure would significant intensification already severe financial crisis worsen global economic conditions. conceivably, failure could result 1930s-style global financial economic meltdown, catastrophic implication production, income, jobs. the decision federal reserve september 16, 2008, full support treasury, lend $85 billion aig view background mind. at time, federal entity could provide capital stabilize aig federal state entity outside bankruptcy court could wind aig. unfortunately, federal bankruptcy law sufficiently protect public's strong interest ensure orderly resolution nondepository financial institution failure would pose substantial systemic risks, i call congress develop new emergency resolution procedures. however, federal reserve authority lend fully secure basis, consistent emergency lend authority provide congress responsibility central bank maintain financial stability. we take collateral loan aig's pledge substantial portion assets, include ownership interest domestic foreign insurance subsidiaries. this decision buy time subsequent action congress, treasury, federal deposit insurance corporation, federal reserve avoid failure systemically important institution support improvement key credit markets. the federal reserve's ongoing involvement aig have lend aig money avert risk global financial meltdown, find uncomfortable situation oversee preservation value dismantling, role quite different usual activities. we devote considerable resource effort engage outside advisers. use right creditor, work aig's new management team begin difficult process wind aig-fp oversee company's restructure divestiture strategy. progress make fronts. however, financial turmoil worsen economy since september contribute large loss company, federal reserve find necessary restructure extend support. in addition, trouble asset relief program (tarp), treasury inject capital aig november march. throughout difficult period, goal remain unchanged: protect economy preserve financial stability, position aig repay federal reserve return treasury's investment quickly possible. in role creditor, make clear aig's management, begin last fall, deep concern surround compensation issue aig. we believe taxpayers' interest aig retain qualify staff maintain value business must sell repay government's assistance. but, time, company must scrupulously avoid excessive unwarranted compensation. we press aig ensure compensation decision cover robust corporate governance, 2 bi review 35/2009 include internal review, review compensation committee board directors, consultation outside experts. operate framework, aig voluntarily limit salary, bonuses, type compensation 2008 2009 ceo senior managers. moreover, executive compensation must comply stringent set rule promulgate treasury tarp fund recipients. the new york attorney general also impose restriction compensation aig. many raise specific issue regard payout retention bonus employee aig-fp. my reaction upon become aware specific payment that, notwithstanding business purpose might serve action, highly inappropriate pay substantial bonus employee division primary source aig's collapse. i ask aig-fp payment stop inform mandate contract agree government's intervention. i ask suit file prevent payments. legal staff counsel action, grind connecticut law provide substantial punitive damage suit would fail; legal action could thus perverse effect double triple financial benefit aig-fp employees. i also inform company instruct pursue available alternative reserve bank convey strong displeasure federal reserve retention payment arrangement. i strongly support president dudley's convey concern direct company redouble effort renegotiate plan could result excessive bonus payments. i also direct staff work treasury administration review whether fp bonus retention payment reclaimed. moreover, federal reserve treasury work closely together monitor address similar situation future. lesson learn aig to conclude, i would note aig offer two clear lesson upcoming discussion congress elsewhere regulatory reform. first, aig highlight urgent need new resolution procedure systemically important nonbank financial firms. if federal agency tool september 16, could use put aig conservatorship receivership, unwind slowly, protect policyholders, impose haircut creditor counterparties appropriate. that outcome would far preferable situation find now. second, aig situation highlight need strong, effective consolidate supervision systemically important financial firms. aig build concentrate exposure subprime mortgage market largely sight functional regulators. more-effective supervision might identify block extraordinarily reckless risk-taking aig-fp. these two change could measurably reduce likelihood future episode systemic risk like one face aig. bi review 35/2009 3 elizabeth a duke: credit availability prudent lend standard testimony m elizabeth a duke, member board governor u federal reserve system, committee financial services, u house representatives, washington dc, 25 march 2009. the original speech, contain various link document mentioned, find u federal reserve system’s website. * * * chairman frank, rank member bachus member committee, i please appear today discus several issue relate state bank system. first, i discus condition bank system, credit conditions, bank underwrite standards. then i describe federal reserve activity enhance liquidity financial market improve condition financial markets. finally, i discus federal reserve's effort ensure overall safety soundness bank system well promote credit availability. a well aware, federal reserve take significant step improve financial market conditions, work treasury bank thrift supervisor address issue u.s. bank organizations. we remain attentive need bank remain sound financial condition time continue lend prudently creditworthy borrowers. fortunately, many bank continue lend environment, shutdown securitization market evaporation many type nonbank credit, much important right u.s. bank system able carry credit intermediation function. background the federal reserve supervisory regulatory authority bank hold companies, state-chartered bank member federal reserve system (state member banks), certain financial institution activities. we work federal state supervisory authority ensure safety soundness bank industry, foster stability financial system, provide fair equitable treatment consumer financial transactions. the federal reserve primary federal supervisor majority commercial bank assets. rather, consolidate supervisor bank hold companies, include financial hold companies, conduct inspection institutions. the primary purpose inspection ensure hold company nonbank subsidiary pose threat soundness company's depository institutions. in fulfil role, federal reserve require rely full extent possible information analysis provide appropriate supervisory authority company's bank, securities, insurance subsidiaries. the federal reserve also primary federal supervisor state member banks, share supervisory responsibility state agencies. in role, federal reserve supervisory staff regularly conduct on-site examination off-site monitor ensure soundness supervise state member banks. the federal reserve involve regulation – establish rule within bank organization must operate – supervision – ensure bank organization abide rule remain, overall, safe sound condition. a key aspect supervisory process evaluate risk-management practices. because rule regulation many case cannot reasonably prescribe exact practice individual bank use risk management, supervisor design policy guidance expand upon requirement set rule regulation establish expectation range bi review 35/2009 1 acceptable practices. supervisor rely extensively policy guidance conduct examination assign supervisory ratings. begin summer 2007, u.s. global economy enter period intense financial turmoil present significant challenge financial service industry. these challenge intensify latter part 2008 global economic environment weaken further. a result, part u.s. bank system come severe strain, bank institution suffer sizable losses. state bank system i would like briefly summarize overall condition u.s. commercial bank large bank hold company (bhcs). for u.s. commercial bank group, profitability measure deteriorate dramatically 2008. indeed, commercial bank post substantial rare aggregate loss fourth quarter 2008, first time happen since late 1980s. this loss large part reflect write-down trade assets, high goodwill impairment charges, and, significantly, increase loan-loss provision take response deteriorate asset quality, high net charge-offs, weaken economic conditions. a year-end 2008, loan delinquent 30 day nonaccrual status exceed 4.5 percent total loans, high level since early 1990s. moreover, nonaccruing loan – likely result additional charge-offs – reach almost two-percent loans, ratio double year-end 2007. despite poor earn performance, capital ratio hold relatively well, report tier 1 total risk-based capital ratio increase course year. the performance state member bank track industry whole. the earn performance 50 large u.s.-based bank hold company (bhcs) group, together represent three-fourths asset bhcs, deteriorate rapidly last two quarter 2008. in aggregate, company report fourth quarter net loss $42.7 billion – versus $25.5 billion third-quarter loss – due mainly elevate loan-loss provisions, large goodwill impairment charges, continuation heavy trade asset write-downs. for year, company generate $67 billion loss. nonetheless, regulatory capital ratio actually improve 2008 – support substantial private capital investment company first half trouble asset relief program (tarp) investment u.s. treasury toward end year. a consequence, bank hold company aggregate continue maintain capital ratio well excess minimum regulatory requirements. condition credit market a chairman bernanke note present board's recent monetary policy testimony congress february, u.s. economy undergo severe contraction. from past experience, know borrow household nonfinancial business tend slow economic downturns. since 1953, inflation-adjusted growth rate debt owe household nonfinancial business fallen, average, 2 percentage point annual rate year follow business cycle peak (as date national bureau economic research, nber). the inflation-adjusted slowdown debt growth past year much pronounce previous downturns: annualized debt growth household nonfinancial business fourth quarter 2008 (the up-to-date reading) was, adjust inflation, 7 percentage point slow nber-designated peak fourth quarter 2007. the slowdown debt growth differ type borrower. for example, increase nearly 6 percent fourth quarter 2007 (unadjusted inflation), home mortgage debt decline annual rate 1.5 percent fourth quarter last year. the decline home mortgage debt sharp period recession 2 bi review 35/2009 good data – date back 1950s. non-mortgage consumer credit also decline fourth quarter last year – annual rate 3.25 percent. the pull-back consumer credit also somewhat sharp average experience previous nine nber recessions. among businesses, growth debt nonfinancial corporation slow 12.5 percent annual rate fourth quarter 2007 1.5 percent annual rate fourth quarter last year. the slowdown debt growth sector also substantial experience past recessions. this simple comparison current slowdown credit market flow previous recession ignore many important change financial landscape occur past half-century. significant among change large increase flow credit come nonbank sources. for example, hold household mortgage banks, save institutions, credit union decrease share 50 percent 1985 share 30 percent total end 2007. similarly, bank hold 70 percent outstanding consumer credit 1985, 45 percent 2007. of course, bank remain vital financial intermediaries, current financial crisis demonstrates. the severe turmoil market securitized asset serve increase banks' importance. and significance bank provision credit extend far beyond direct loans. bank supply credit indirectly provide back-up liquidity credit support financial institution conduit also intermediate credit flows. in 1950, banks' share financial intermediation 50 percent, fell rise 48 percent mid-1970s, decline 33 percent turn century. if one adjust data include "credit equivalents" off-balance-sheet activity banks, adjust market share financial intermediation bank would remain 40 percent recent years. in term direct lending, weekly data federal reserve board collect bank show total bank loan lease increase almost 4 percent 2008. the increase bank lend year whole roughly 10 percent pace growth see 2006 2007. much increase bank lend last year likely reflect household business draw exist line credit rather extension new loans. in addition, freeze-up securitization market likely contribute banks' balance sheet growth. accord federal reserve's senior loan officer opinion survey bank lend practices, bank tighten lend standard sharply past 18 months. the january 2009 survey find respondent tighten lend policy major loan category late 2008. respondent also indicate demand loan business household continue weaken, balance, survey period. with regard commercial loan particular, many survey respondent point le favorable uncertain economic outlook reason tighten lend standard term previous three months. most respondent indicate worsen industry-specific problem bank's reduce tolerance risk also important factor decision tighten lend policy commercial loans. among respondent saw increase loan demand previous three months, indicate business borrow shift bank bank nonbank source source become le attractive. in addition, 30 percent report inquiry potential business borrower decrease survey period. for commercial real estate (cre) lending, 80 percent domestic bank report tighten lend standard previous three months, slightly le roughly 85 percent report october survey. of note, 30 percent respondent indicate shutdown commercial mortgage backed-securities (cmbs) securitization market lead increase cre lend bank bi review 35/2009 3 second half 2008, whereas 15 percent indicate shutdown cmb securitization market reduce volume cre lending. survey respondent also note continue tighten consumer products, include residential real estate lend revolve home equity line credit (helocs). notably, four nearly 80 respondent report make subprime mortgage loan previous three months. step back, clear recent year bank financial market experience period risk generally under-priced credit freely available. the realization many market participant risk large anticipate contribute decline price financial assets. a result, financial institution – include bank organization – experience significant losses, lead need raise additional capital or, cases, sell shut operations. it apparent bank institution impact way adverse condition current environment. federal reserve action since 2007 the federal reserve respond forcefully financial economic crisis continue so. in discuss federal reserve actions, i first summarize monetary policy action relate liquidity provision, highlight supervisory actions. monetary policy liquidity provision in term monetary policy, federal reserve aggressive. a know, federal open market committee (fomc) begin ease monetary policy september 2007, december 2008, committee set range 0 25 basis point target federal fund rate. we also employ additional tool ease financial conditions, improve function credit markets, thereby support economic activity. to improve mortgage market function support house market economic activity broadly, federal reserve begin purchase large amount agency debt mortgage-backed securities, recently announce substantial additional purchase security year-end. in addition, federal reserve announce plan purchase $300 billion long-term treasury security help improve condition private credit markets. since first announce purchase last november, conform fix mortgage rate fall 1 percentage point. the federal reserve also establish new lend facility expand exist facility enhance flow credit business households. in response heighten stress bank fund markets, increase size term auction facility help ensure bank could obtain fund need provide credit customers, expand network swap line foreign central bank ease condition interconnect dollar fund market home abroad. last fall, money market tighten considerably follow failure lehman brothers, establish new lend facility provide liquidity money market mutual fund support function commercial paper market. the u.s. treasury, federal deposit insurance corporation (fdic), federal reserve take number action strengthen financial sector promote availability credit business households. this include inject additional capital banks, increase fdic deposit coverage, provide guarantee select senior bank obligation noninterest-bearing deposits, establish new liquidity facility financial markets. in addition, federal reserve treasury recently launch term asset-backed security loan facility (talf) facilitate extension credit household small business anticipate range eligible collateral 4 bi review 35/2009 facility likely expand financial assets. the federal reserve expect assist treasury's public-private partnership investment program, announce monday, expand range collateral eligible talf program include certain legacy securities. supervisory activity improvement risk-management practice many current problem bank financial system stem risk-management failure number financial institutions, include firm federal supervision. clearly, lapse unacceptable. the federal reserve involve number exercise understand, document help address risk-management lapse shortcoming major financial institutions, include undertake senior supervisor group, president's work group financial markets, multinational financial stability forum.1 base result efforts, federal reserve take vigorous step improve risk-management practice regulate institutions. our action cover liquidity risk management, capital plan capital adequacy, firm-wide risk identification, residential lending, counterparty credit exposures, commercial real estate lending, among areas. liquidity capital give special attention. the crisis undermine previous conventional wisdom company, even stress environments, may readily borrow fund offer high-quality collateral. for example, inability bear stearns borrow even u.s. government security lead collapse. a result, work bring need improvement institutions' liquidity risk-management practices. along u.s. supervisory colleagues, closely monitor liquidity position bank organization – daily basis large critical firm – discuss key market development supervisory analysis senior management. we use analysis find examination ensure liquidity fund management, well contingency fund plans, sufficiently robust incorporate various stress scenarios. look beyond present period, also underway broader-ranging examination liquidity requirements. similarly, federal reserve closely monitor capital level bank organization regular basis discuss evaluation senior management. a part supervisory process, conduct analysis loss scenario anticipate potential future capital need institutions. these need may arise from, among things, future loss potential off-balance-sheet exposure return institutions' balance sheets. here, too, discuss analysis banker ensure internal analysis reflect broad range scenario capture stress environment could impair solvency. we intensify effort evaluate institutions' capital plan bring improvement needed. our effort relate capital plan capital adequacy embody interagency supervisory capital assessment process, begin february. we conduct assessment select bank institutions' capital adequacy, base certain macroeconomic scenarios. for assessment, carefully evaluate forecast submit financial institution ensure appropriate, consistent firm's underlie portfolio performance, reflective entity's particular business activity risk profile. the capital assessment program permit supervisor ass 1 senior supervisor group (2008), "observations risk management practice recent market turbulence", march 6; president's work group financial market (2008), "policy statement financial market developments", march 13; financial stability forum (2008), "report financial stability forum enhance market institutional resilience", april 7. bi review 35/2009 5 whether institutions' capital buff regulatory capital minimum appropriate severe plausible scenarios. to sum effort improve banks' risk management, look area risk management – individual collective basis – ensure institution risk-management practice satisfactory levels. more generally, see appropriate progress, aggressively downgrade supervisory rat use enforcement tools. maintain balance supervisory process the federal reserve long-standing policy procedure place promote sound risk identification management practice regulate institution also support bank lend credit intermediation process. in fact, guidance issue long ago 1991, commercial real estate crisis begin late 1980s, specifically instruct examiner ensure regulatory policy action inadvertently curtail availability credit sound borrowers.2 the 1991 guidance also state examiner "ensure supervisory personnel review loan consistent, prudent, balance fashion ensure interest party aware guidance." the 1991 policy statement cover wide range specific topics, including: • general principle examiner follow review commercial real estate loan portfolio • indicator trouble real estate markets, projects, relate indebtedness • factor examiner consider review individual loans, include use appraisal determination collateral value • discussion approach value real estate, especially trouble market • classification guideline follow agencies, include treatment guarantee • factor consider evaluation institution's allowance loan lease loss this emphasis achieve appropriate balance credit availability safety soundness continue today. to extent institution experience losses, hold le capital, operate risk-sensitive environment, supervisor expect bank employ appropriate risk-management practice ensure viability. at time, important supervisor remain balance place unreasonable artificial constraint lender could hamper credit availability. a part effort help stimulate appropriate bank lending, federal reserve federal bank agency issue regulatory guidance november 2008 encourage bank meet need creditworthy borrowers.3 the guidance issue encourage bank lend manner consistent safety soundness – specifically, take balance approach assess borrowers' ability repay make realistic assessment collateral valuations. this guidance review discuss examination staff within federal reserve system. earlier, april 2007, federal financial institution regulatory agency issue statement encourage financial institution work constructively residential borrower 2 "interagency policy statement review classification commercial real estate loans," (november 1991). 3 "interagency statement meet need credit worthy borrowers," (november 2008). 6 bi review 35/2009 financially unable make contractual payment obligation home loans.4 the statement note that, "prudent workout arrangement consistent safe sound lend practice generally long-term interest financial institution borrower." the statement also note that, "the agency penalize financial institution pursue reasonable workout arrangement borrower encounter financial problems." it state that, "existing supervisory guidance applicable account standard require institution immediately foreclose collateral underlie loan borrower exhibit repayment difficulties." this guidance also review examiner within federal reserve system. more generally, direct examiner mindful procyclical effect excessive credit tighten encourage bank make economically viable loans, provide lend base realistic asset valuation balance assessment borrowers' repayment capacities. across federal reserve system, implement train outreach underscore intentions. we mindful potential banker overshoot attempt rectify lend standards, want understand interest continue make loan creditworthy borrowers. conclusion the u.s. bank industry face serious challenges. the federal reserve, work bank agency act – continue act – ensure bank system remain safe sound able meet credit need economy. we aggressively pursue monetary policy action provide liquidity help repair financial system. in supervisory efforts, mindful risk-management deficiency bank institution reveal current crisis ensure institution develop appropriate corrective actions. it take time bank industry work current set challenge financial market recover. during recovery, economy need strong stable financial system make credit available. the challenge regulator authority support prudential bank intermediation help restore health financial system economy whole. we want bank deploy capital liquidity, responsible way avoid past mistake create new ones. banker operate prudently current challenge environment, let fear drive decisions. the federal reserve continue work bank agency congress promote concurrent goal foster credit availability safe sound bank system. 4 "federal regulator encourage institution work mortgage borrower who be unable make their payments," (april 2007). bi review 35/2009 7 josé de gregorio: monetary policy pass-through interest rate speech mr josé de gregorio, governor central bank chile, honorable chamber representative’s economic, promotion development commission, santiago, 16 march 2009. the spanish original prevails. * * * mr. president. i wish thank economic, promotion development commission honorable chamber representative invite speak monetary policy decision affect country’s financial lend conditions. the global economy endure terribly uncertain times, implication country’s prospect growth inflation. thus, share preoccupation evaluate monetary policy action – one main stabilize tool available country – ultimately affect cost borrow face household firms. monetary policy, context inflation target float exchange rate like one operate chile since 1999, important mechanism smooth business cycle. period weak output demand performance, reduce medium-term inflation outlook, lend countercyclical monetary policy action cushion negative effect consumption, investment employment. this central bank chile presently doing, act resolutely moderate effect global crisis – bad see decade – chile. the transmission monetary policy the central bank chile’s monetary policy operate largely effect cost lending, influence cost bank financing. the bank’s main instrument monetary policy interest rate, mpr. it worth note level board choose every month mpr represent objective cost overnight lend banks. in words, central bank operate interbank market, see interest rate bank lend borrow overnight approach mpr. therefore, important understand interest rate, operate specific well define market (among bank term one day only), affect spend invest decision make household firm even several years. the explanation phenomenon that, normal circumstances, matter today’s level mpr, whole future path expect market interest rate. this ultimately affect entire yield structure. in words, five-year loan, instance, important potential borrower idea mpr behave next five year know current level. the first-order implication conduct, implementation communication monetary policy. in fact, obviously important, decision adopt central bank board monetary policy meet element shape credit condition within economy. also first order market’s perception monetary policy manage future month years. this lead u extremely cautious communication, order decision make perceive adequate persistence. the monetary policy board implement past month clearly illustrate phenomenon. despite fact mpr hold constant 8.25% last month past year, thank way communicate decision bi review 35/2009 1 incorporation explicit bias mpr level expect market six month ahead drop significantly, pull deposit rate long terms. subsequent reduction mpr apply year go beyond market expectations, reduce finance cost (figure 1). to succeed communicate properly, transparently credibly key monetary policy decision cause impact needed. this make monetary policy effective, central bank maintain systematic policy communication transparency, presentation make board members, monetary policy reports, transparency mechanism policy decisions. in latter area actually make major innovation since monetary policy meet last thursday. we upload public website background information base publicly available data hold meet decide monetary policy. today’s scenario: uncertainty risk monetary policy one many factor influence cost borrow face household firms. another factor gain significant importance perception risk volatility sweep every financial market. this increase worsen global financial crisis last september. in general, despite effort make economic policy maker main economy around world, still dwell extremely uncertain scenario. this number implication ultimately affect condition cost credit firm household chile everywhere. to begin with, external lend standard domestic bank become stringent. we see that, although bank able access foreign credit sources, short maturity large spread external reference interest rates. this reflection difficulty continue haunt main global financial institution reluctance embark new businesses. this alter liquidity available local money market, remain stable, aside transitory turbulence early october address central bank implementation new modality provision liquidity. secondly, meltdown world output trade increase credit risk globally. in turn, firm household good financial situation tend naturally postpone spend borrow decisions, await normalization financial environment, thus shrink demand credit. all result increase average finance cost tough lend standard agent actually engage borrow operations. we see various risk volatility indicator substantially pre-september figure (figure 2). a write late monetary policy report,1 extra financial burden client chilean bank tend reflect precisely high level global uncertainty impact chilean economy. i must stress phenomenon occur today every economy world, sometimes catastrophic implication level output solvency financial institutions. because prepare country long confront severe deterioration international economic environment, chile financial market suffer limit effects, sudden stop but, contrary, increase credit supply without generalize process insolvency. these precaution permit macroeconomic policy – fiscal monetary – clearly countercyclical, help cushion effect world crisis economy. 1 central bank chile (2009). 2 bi review 35/2009 the transmission mpr reduction lend interest rate one important element diagnosis countercyclical effort actually work evaluation perform permanent basis way decision affect borrow condition face household firms. this issue new, subject analysis several year back central bank’s monetary policy sustain expansionary path.2 the evidence gather sum central bank’s monetary policy decision reflect banks’ financial cost quickly, overall cost credit months. this response pattern similar economies. lately, review information,3 find that, even moment great uncertainty experience recent months, reduction mpr translate reduce borrow cost business consumers. one good example trend interest rate commercial loan 30 89 days, link fund work capital. this rate high october last year, year far fall substantially. we estimate cut mpr combine 350 basis point (bp) january february, rate would 250 bp today. a similar situation see case consumer loans. the cost mortgage financing, meanwhile, le sensitive change mpr precisely long-term borrow decisions. however, without drop long-term rate – partly originate monetary ease – mortgage rate would stay largely current level (figure 3). we estimate, then, monetary policy decision recently adopt begin pas credit condition face household firms. this pass-through continue near future, especially reduction mpr board determine last week. we keep monitor effect permanently, u essential mpr propagate market rate smoothly. we certainly expect late mpr reduction last thursday result additional decrease bank system’s lend rates. this type exercise also permit evaluate impact high degree uncertainty, volatility risk observe since last september. if exercise ask would lend rate hypothetical scenario without global financial crisis, find would 50 bp 350 bp present level, large effect interest rate commercial consumer loans. in specific case mortgage loans, increase interest rate occur september december 2008 largely link implication external condition local perception risk (figure 4). all clear illustration severe uncertainty high risk unleash last september affect domestic economy. non-bank finance source notwithstanding key role play domestic bank fund household firms, especially small ones, big company equally important credit sources. thus, around 45% total corporate borrow non-bank, external debt domestic bond top list. therefore, important understand behavior interest rate credit offer global outlook financial conditions. the central bank chile direct effect external financial conditions. like banks, chilean firm see borrow condition tighten change state affairs. still, bank firm continue enjoy normal access world financial markets, owe 2 berstein fuentes (2003). 3 becerra

reward learn experience us. i hope, foreign participant find seminar useful, reward and, may i add, enjoyable. i tell cover many important topic last three days, i gather, great clarity various issue grow importance retail payment systems, relative role bank non-banks payment systems, main principle govern oversight, prepay cards, aspect relate cross-border remittance service even issue pertain branchless banking. i want use opportunity valedictory address share significant change payment system india, reserve bank’s role area look ahead challenge go forward. but first allow small digression. i hope time go round enjoy sight heritage famed part india. mamallapuram bear testimony rich, ancient culture region, long forgotten, thank rapid development vicinity, leave once-upon-a-time great trade port almost brink extinction. nature too, play role erosion piece history. the great shore temple see believe actually one original seven pagoda (spires, temples), rest erode submerged. nature, again, lend help hand, i tell tsunami 2004, part submerge remain temple visible, albeit briefly, water ocean recede temporarily. we “concrete” evidence role play small town india's ancient trade culture. the payment system central bank let try relate payment system today. payment settlement system play important role improve overall economic efficiency. they consist diverse arrangement use systematically transfer money – whether use currency, paper instrument cheques, variety electronic channels. it something use every day. indeed ability make receive payment confidence remain cornerstone commercial activity designing, implement run robust payment system effort focussed. there phenomenal change architecture technology payment system last decade. until year ago, payment system india bi review 33/2009 1 almost entirely base paper, currency cheque dominant form payment retail wholesale transactions. with technological advancement, today quite complex collection disparate arrangements, different participants, different rules, different process place, ensure quick flow money. payment systems, therefore, implication play monetary policy, and, therefore, form important part central bank's mandate. the main concern ensure robust payment system efficiency safety systems. internationally, nature intensity central bank supervision retail payment system vary considerably. in many cases, oversight limit systemically important payment systems. some explicit legal authority australia, base regulatory power bank unite states, some, part broad financial stability objective, unite kingdom. apart economic efficiency, payment system social dimension efficient payment system important prerequisite financial inclusion. the focus attention payment system worldwide traditionally systemically important payment systems. of late, however, financial inclusion become major objective, existence efficient retail payment system perceive significant public good, deserve increase attention. the importance payment settlement system prompt governor central bank group ten (g-10) country establish 1990 permanent central bank committee viz., committee payment settlement system (cpss), successor group expert payment systems, set 1980. the cps establish monitor analyse development domestic payment settlement systems, well cross-border

evolution payment system india payment system india – like part world – begin cash-based systems. the evolution time commerce trade trigger vary payment instrument come use india. even though cash system dominated, early payment system denominate cash – primitive form bill exchange – hundi – continue use form, part country even today! with advent banking, cheque clear bankers' clear house, conduct net settlement basis, predominant form clear settlement, despite inherent risk associate net settlement systems. the electronic era india begin early 1990s reserve bank develop technology-based payment settlement systems, also take oversight systems. let give significant figure illustrate rapid transition paper paperless systems. the share cheque total value economic transaction (including cash) decline 5.2% 2001 3.9% 2008. the value fund transfer electronic mean entire payment system increase phenomenally – 2% decade ago 74% now. the number transaction retail system, inclusive cheques, electronic payment cards, also striking, seven million transaction per day, account 95% term number total transactions. this underscore importance continue focus retail payment system india. the growth non-conventional form retail payment system india reveal interest trend. we aware role credit card lifestyle spend patterns. in india though credit card somewhat lacklustre beginning. i still recall how, 2 bi review 33/2009 late eighties, government own bank – we, india, call public sector bank – undertake pioneer activity, taker payment mode. the indian culture save spend, spend first repay later. the task public sector bank early year therefore much market new product bring fundamental change cultural mind-set attitudes. more importantly, make merchant establishment accept credit card payment good service easy task either. bank use innovative strategy (such provide free credit card account holders, card even non-customers bank, entice merchant establishment scheme discount rewards, etc.). similarly, early stage development, bank get together inter-connect share atms. the initiative fail get grind abandoned. yet, today, key word financial sector inter-connectivity share payment system infrastructure. you interest know today national-level atm switch, inter-connects nearly 35,000 atm banks, across country. with open economy, many bank join credit card band wagon. soon, bank begin aggressively push credit card even unwilling customer also concern method use entity recovery function outsource banks. the reserve bank, much concern low level penetration credit card initial years, quickly step ensure fair practice customer protection. the reserve bank also take upon task assess exist retail payment system lay clear road map future. legal reform constitute first step direction. the reserve bank’s role the rapid expansion economy phenomenal increase non-cash payment transaction clearly define task challenge reserve bank. this lead 2007 payment settlement system act, draft tenet formulate reserve bank. this legislation provide legal basis framework requirement payment settlement systems. it also provide clear definition relate process net settlement finality ensure full final settlement participants, recourse roll back reversal transactions. the payment settlement system act also mandate reserve bank regulate payment settlement systems, encompass system provider – often commercial bank – also intermediary well technology providers. we begin process authorisation payment systems. hopefully instil great confidence amongst user systems, addition ensure system robust well designed, base sound principle optimal risk management. we also believe provide high level reliability operation compliance international requirement combat money laundering. to aid reserve bank manage task payment settlements, board regulation payment settlement system (bpss), comprise rbi management external experts, established. international experts, review legal framework implementation systems, endorse scope coverage payment settlement system act. recent initiative innovation safety heart payment systems. recognise importance, reserve bank take early initiative create guarantee platform systemically important payment systems. the result establishment clear corporation india ltd (ccil) 2001. the ccil own manage commercial banks, reserve bank bi review 33/2009 3 direct stake. you recognise arms-length relationship accordance principle good corporate governance. the ccil function central counter party (ccp) select category transaction government bonds, inter-bank foreign exchange market, call money market, etc., thus effectively managing, mitigating, counterparty risk arise possible default constituent. the ccil platform fully electronic high level operational security provide straight through process (stp). this unique initiative widely acclaim success. this infrastructure efficiently mitigate counter party risk over-the-counter (otc) market – which, note, root crisis credit derivative segment current global financial turmoil. the reserve bank instrumental establish 1999 indian financial network (or infinet). the infinet, similar s.w.i.f.t., platform domestic transmission inter-bank message electronic mode. the cheque truncation system, implement rbi india, scale see anywhere else world, yet another landmark advance payment settlements. the system help customer accelerate realisation cheques, leverage late technology. i claim pride state-of-the-art technology characteristic many retail payment system india. it may interest note use public key infrastructure (pki)-based security electronic transaction use infinet since early 1999 – many year international network-based financial message transfer systems, s.w.i.f.t., migrate technology. in develop payment systems, reserve bank sensitive conscious india's low level literacy, economic cultural diversity. accordingly, develop local language-based atms, atm use vsat-based telecommunication difficult geographical terrain, solar power-based systems, multi-application-based smart card small-value payments. build multidimensional efforts, reserve bank facilitate process set national payment corporation india, aegis indian banks’ association will, due course, provide operate retail payment system objective ultimate settlement central bank money. challenge a technology relentlessly advances, payment mechanism expand proliferate. this make task central bank complex challenging. let take moment highlight major challenge reserve bank face manner seek address them. • the first challenge relate multiple role central bank. in developmental role, reserve bank operator well settlement provider many electronic payment systems. these include electronic clear service (ecs-credit debit clear national ecs) akin ach service elsewhere world, national electronic fund transfer (neft) one-to-one electronic-based credit-push fund transfers, etc. the operation system eventually migrate propose national payment corporation india, happens, challenge also manage operational aspect system adequate firewalls. • the reserve bank statutorily empower regulate supervise commercial banks. but non-banks entity provide vital payment system service need bring unify oversight function. towards end, payment settlement system act authorise reserve bank also regulate supervise non-banks entities. the second 4 bi review 33/2009 challenge, therefore, manage myriad service providers, play important role smooth operation payment systems. • another challenge country like india, receive large number remittance migrant expatriates, ensure availability efficient, low-cost payment system transfer funds. here, central bank different country take view role non-bank entity process. • fourth, high rate technological obsolescence demand system subject regular continuous upgrades, service / settlement provider end, also customer end. the problem face replicate high-technology requirement across large number user well known. migration magnetic stripe base card chip-based card need token-key-based authentication device instead pin aspect may impact cost well implementation-related logistics. fortunately, indian context, relatively easy address since join user-based technology band wagon late point time. of course, cannot, indeed not, count forever advantage leap frog technology, go forward, challenge frontier best practice. • the final challenge, one grow importance day, ensure integrity system money-laundering finance terrorism. perspective way forward let look ahead emerge opportunities, retail payment system task set central banks. accord international estimates, volume retail payment major country far exceed number large-value transactions. these volume offer opportunity potential entrant / service provider vie market share. user also will try new system provide comfort, ease operation efficiency. that said, central bank worldwide remain ever vigilant ensure new system conform critical minimum requirements. second, one advantage multiple system service provider widen choice user. competitive force will, course, ensure product service continually upgraded. more importantly, risk disperse across many unit bundle one basket. the need regulate monitor operation multiple entity important challenge central banks. third, market dynamic ensure operational efficiency especially volume substantial. a case point indian mobile telephone industry. when first introduce decade ago, average cost mobile phone call use rs.24 per minute (roughly half u dollar) use charge caller call receiver. today, india boast world’s low per call rate – local call charge caller, per call rate re.0.50 paisa per minute (just one u cent). a reduction much one-fiftieth original call charge short span time call revisit moore’s law! an encore similar dramatic reduction cost retail payment system beyond realm possibility. a begin already make area atm-based payment whereby charge levy customer use atm belong bank, april, 2009. fourth, retail payment go large-scale expansion, new issue emerge. the demarcate line large-value retail-payment system get blurred. this call increase effort set bench mark even retail payment systems. consider risk inherent systems, fresh initiative need address bi review 33/2009 5 customer-protection issues. these assume great importance context increase spread concept branchless banking. by indications, retail payment go driver future payment settlement architecture. the reserve bank take proactive step towards operationalisation within regulatory framework mitigate risks. my staff advise already cryptology risk management – risk, would take account following: r – recognition – identify risk early take proactive step get hand; i – improvisation – new methods, technique tool secure good monitoring, provide feed-forward rather feed-back system; s – segmentation – address small system sub-systems individually address unique feature also mindful systemic impact; k – knowledge – enable knowledge-based decision knowledge-powered economy, result scientifically-engineered output-oriented action. all effort aim provide good risk management framework. retail payment hold key value chain economy achieve progress today’s complex world. innovation, risk management, effort increase international co-operation key success. i hope profit participation seminar, importantly, enjoy spend last three day mamallapuram. for part, i must say i greatly enjoy here. 6 bi review 33/2009 mary c nkosi: create environment bank operate effectively malawi speech mr mary c nkosi, deputy governor reserve bank

review 33/2009 daniel k tarullo: modernize bank supervision regulation testimony mr daniel k tarullo, member board governor u federal reserve system, committee banking, housing, urban affairs, u senate, washington dc, 19 march 2009. the original speech, contain various link document mentioned, find u federal reserve system’s website. * * * chairman dodd, rank member shelby, member committee, i appreciate opportunity present view federal reserve board important issue modernize financial supervision regulation. for last year half, u.s. financial system extraordinary stress. initially, financial stress precipitate sharp downturn u.s. global economies. what ensue damage negative feedback loop: the effect downturn – rise unemployment, decline profits, decrease consumption investment – exacerbate problem financial institution reduce value assets. the impair financial system has, turn, unable supply credit need household business alike. the catalyst current crisis broad-based decline house prices, contribute substantial increase mortgage delinquency foreclosure significant decline value mortgage-related assets. however, mortgage sector visible example much broad credit boom, underlie cause crisis run deep mortgage market. they include global imbalance save capital flows, poorly design financial innovations, weakness risk-management system financial institution government oversight institutions. while stabilize financial system set stage economic recovery remain top priority near term, federal reserve also begin evaluate regulatory supervisory change could help reduce incidence severity future financial crises. today's committee hear timely opportunity u share think date contribute deliberation regulatory modernization legislation. many conclusion draw financial crisis period precede it, range across topic diverse capital adequacy requirements, risk measurement management financial institutions, supervisory practices, consumer protection. in board's judgment, one key lesson unite state must comprehensive strategy contain systemic risk. this strategy must multifaceted involve oversight financial system whole, individual components, order improve resiliency system potential systemic shocks. in pursue strategy, must ensure reform enact aim cause current crisis, source risk may arise future. systemic risk refer potential event shock trigger loss economic value confidence substantial portion financial system, result major adverse effect real economy. a core characteristic systemic risk potential contagion effects. traditionally, concern run large bank, example, would lead failure bank, also failure financial firm combine effect fail bank's unpaid obligation firm market uncertainty whether firm similar vulnerabilities. in fact, recent episode systemic risk begin markets, rather classic run bank. a sharp downward movement asset price magnify certain market practice vulnerabilities. soon market participant become uncertain value bi review 33/2009 1 assets, uncertainty spread asset liquidity freeze up. in bad case, liquidity problem become solvency problems. the result spillover effect within financial sector financial sector real economy. in remarks, i discus several component broad policy agenda address systemic risk: consolidate supervision, development resolution regime systemically important nonbank financial institutions; uniform robust authority prudential supervision systemically important payment settlement systems; consumer protection; potential benefit charge governmental entity express responsibility monitor address systemic risk financial system. in elaborate agenda, i discus action federal reserve take exist authority identify area believe legislation needed. effective consolidate supervision systemically important firm for reason i stated, supervision individual financial firm sufficient condition foster financial stability. but surely necessary condition. thus first component agenda systemic risk regulation systemically important financial firm subject effective consolidate supervision. this mean ensure regulatory requirement apply firm consequent supervision effective. a issue effectiveness, many current problem bank financial system stem risk-management failure number financial institutions, include firm federal supervision. clearly, lapse unacceptable. the federal reserve involve number exercise understand document risk-management lapse shortcoming major financial institutions, include undertake senior supervisor group, president's work group financial markets, multinational financial stability forum.1 base result efforts, federal reserve take step improve regulatory requirement risk management regulate institutions. our action cover liquidity risk management, capital plan capital adequacy, firm-wide risk identification, residential lending, counterparty credit exposures, commercial real estate. liquidity capital give special attention. the crisis undermine previous conventional wisdom company, even stress environments, may readily borrow fund offer high-quality collateral. for example, inability bear stearns borrow even u.s. government security help cause collapse. a result, work bring need improvement institutions' liquidity risk-management practices. along u.s. supervisory colleagues, closely monitor liquidity position bank organization – daily basis large critical firm – discuss key market development supervisory analysis senior management. we use analysis find examination ensure liquidity fund management, well contingency fund plans, sufficiently robust incorporate various stress scenarios. look beyond present period, also underway broader-ranging examination liquidity requirements. similarly, federal reserve closely monitor capital level bank organization regular basis discuss evaluation senior management. a 1 see senior supervisor group (2008), "observations risk management practice recent market turbulence)," march 6; president's work group financial market (2008), "policy statement financial market developments," march 13; financial stability forum (2008), "report financial stability forum enhance market institutional resilience," april 7. 2 bi review 33/2009 part supervisory process, conduct analysis loss scenario anticipate potential future capital need institutions. these need may arise from, among things, future loss potential off-balance-sheet exposure asset come balance sheet. here, too, discuss analysis banker ensure internal analysis reflect broad range scenario capture stress environment could impair solvency. we intensify effort evaluate firms' capital plan bring improvement needed. go forward, need change capital regime financial environment return close normal conditions. work domestic foreign supervisors, must strengthen exist capital rule achieve high level quality require capital. institution also establish strong capital buff current regulatory minimum good times, weather financial market stress continue meet customer credit needs. this one number important way current procyclical feature financial regulation modified, aim counteract rather exacerbate effect financial stress. finally, firm whose failure would pose systemic risk must subject especially close supervisory oversight risk-taking, risk management, financial condition, hold high capital liquidity standards. turn reach consolidate supervision, board belief statutory coverage systemically important financial firm – affiliate insure bank provide bank hold company act 1956 (bhc act). the current financial crisis highlight fact become apparent recent year – risk financial system arise bank sector, also activity financial firm traditionally subject type consolidate supervision apply bank hold companies. for example, although security exchange commission (sec) authority broker-dealer sec-registered unit bear stearns large investment banks, statutory authority supervise diversify operation firm consolidate basis. instead, sec force rely voluntary regime monitor address capital liquidity risk arise full range firms' operations. in contrast, hold company bank – regardless size – subject consolidate supervision safety soundness purpose bhc act.2 a robust consolidate supervisory framework, like one embody bhc act, provide supervisor tool need understand, monitor and, appropriate, restrain risk associate organization's consolidate group-wide activities. these tool include authority establish consolidate capital requirement organization, obtain report conduct examination organization subsidiaries, require organization subsidiary alter risk-management practice take action address risk threaten safety soundness organization. application similar regime systemically important financial institution bank hold company would help promote safety soundness firm stability financial system generally. it also worth consider whether broad application principle consolidate supervision would help reduce potential risk-taking migrate more-regulated less-regulated part financial sector. to 2 through exploitation loophole bhc act, certain investment banks, well financial nonfinancial firms, acquire control federally insure industrial loan company (ilc) avoid prudential framework congress establish corporate owner full-service insure banks. for reason discuss prior testimony committee, board continue believe loophole current law closed. see testimony scott g. alvarez, general counsel board, committee banking, housing, urban affairs, u.s. senate, oct. 4, 2007. bi review 33/2009 3 fully effective, consolidate supervisor must clear authority monitor address safety soundness concern part organization. accordingly, specific consideration give modify limit currently place ability consolidate supervisor monitor address risk organization's functionally regulate subsidiaries. improve resolution process the importance extend effective consolidate supervision systemically important firm is, course, link perception market participant firm consider too-big-to-fail, thus support government get financial difficulty. this perception obvious undesirable effects, include possible moral hazard effect firm able take excessive risk market belief fall back government assistance. in addition effective supervision firms, unite state need improve tool allow orderly resolution systemically important nonbank financial firms, include mechanism cover cost resolution government assistance require prevent systemic consequences. in cases, federal bankruptcy law provide appropriate framework resolution nonbank financial institutions. however, framework sufficiently protect public's strong interest ensure orderly resolution nondepository financial institution failure would pose substantial systemic risks. develop appropriate resolution procedure potentially systemic financial firms, include bank hold companies, complex challenge task take time complete. we begin, however, learn models, include process currently place federal deposit insurance act (fdia) deal fail insure depository institution framework establish fannie mae freddie mac house economic recovery act 2008. both model allow government agency take control fail institution's operation management, act conservator receiver institution, establish "bridge" institution facilitate orderly sale liquidation firm. the authority "bridge" fail institution receivership new entity reduce potential market disruption, limit value-destruction impact failure, – accompany haircut creditor shareholder – mitigate adverse impact government intervention market discipline. any new resolution regime would need carefully crafted. for example, clear guideline need define firm could subject new, alternative regime process invoke regime, analogous perhaps procedure invoke so-called systemic risk exception fdia. in addition, give global operation many large diversify financial firm complex regulatory structure operate, new resolution regime must structure work seamlessly possible domestic foreign insolvency regime might apply one part consolidate organization. in addition develop alternative resolution regime systemically critical financial firms, policymakers expert carefully review whether improvement make exist bankruptcy framework would allow fast orderly resolution financial firm generally. such improvement could reduce likelihood new alternative regime would need invoke government assistance provide particular instance protect financial stability and, thereby, could promote market discipline. oversight payment settlement system a suggest earlier, comprehensive strategy control systemic risk must focus simply stability individual firms. another element strategy provide close oversight important arena firm interact one another. payment 4 bi review 33/2009 settlement system foundation financial infrastructure. financial institution market depend upon smooth function system ability manage counterparty settlement risk effectively. such system significant risk-reduction benefit – improve counterparty credit risk management, reduce settlement risks, provide orderly process handle participant default – improve transparency participants, financial markets, regulatory authorities. at time, system inherently centralize concentrate clear settlement risks. thus, system well design able appropriately manage risk arise participant default operational disruptions, significant liquidity credit problem could result. well current crisis erupted, federal reserve work strengthen financial infrastructure support trading, payments, clearing, settlement key financial markets. because infrastructure act critical link financial institution markets, ensure able withstand – amplify – shock important aspect reduce systemic risk, include real problem institution big interconnect allow fail disorderly manner. the federal reserve bank new york lead major joint initiative public private sector improve arrangement clear settle credit default swap (cds) over-the-counter (otc) derivatives. a result, accuracy timeliness trade information improve significantly. in addition, federal reserve, work supervisor president's work group financial markets, encourage development well-regulated prudently manage central clear counterparties otc trades. along lines, board encourage development two central counterparties cd unite state – ice trust chicago mercantile exchange. in addition, 2008, board enter memorandum understand sec commodity future trade commission promote application common prudential standard central counterparties cd facilitate share information among agency respect central counterparties. the federal reserve also consult foreign financial regulator regard development oversight central counterparties cd jurisdiction promote application consistent prudential standards. the new york federal reserve bank, conjunction domestic foreign supervisors, continue effort establish increasingly stringent target performance standard otc market participants. in addition, work market participant enhance resilience triparty repurchase agreement (repo) market. through market, primary dealer major bank broker-dealer obtain large amount secure finance money market mutual fund short-term, risk-averse investors.3 we exploring, example, whether central clear system improvement might beneficial market, give magnitude exposure generate vital importance market dealer investors. even pursue similar initiatives, however, board belief additional statutory authority need address potential systemic risk payment settlement systems. currently, federal reserve rely patchwork authorities, largely derive role bank supervisor, well moral suasion help ensure critical payment settlement system necessary procedure control place manage risks. by contrast, many major central bank around world explicit statutory basis oversight systems. give important robust payment settlement system financial stability, functional 3 primary dealer broker-dealer trade u.s. government security federal reserve bank new york. the new york reserve bank's open market desk engage trade behalf federal reserve system implement monetary policy. bi review 33/2009 5 similarity many payment settlement systems, good case make grant federal reserve explicit oversight authority systemically important payment settlement systems. the federal reserve significant expertise regard risk appropriate risk-management practice payment settlement systems, substantial direct experience measure necessary safe sound operation systems, establish work relationship central bank regulator use promote development strong internationally-accepted risk management standard full range systems. provide authority would help ensure critical system hold consistent high prudential standard aim mitigate systemic risk. consumer protection another lesson crisis pervasive consumer protection problem signal, even lead to, trouble safety soundness financial institution stability financial system whole. consumer protection area financial service not, be, limit practice potentially systemic consequences. however, evaluate range measure help contain systemic problems, important recognize good consumer protection play support role – among thing – promote sound underwrite practices. last year board adopt new regulation home ownership equity protection act enhance substantive protection provide high-cost mortgage customers, require tax insurance escrow certain case limit use prepayment penalties. these rule also require lender provide high-cost loan verify income asset loan applicant prohibit lender make loan without take account ability borrower repay loan income asset home's value. more recently, board adopt new rule protect credit card customer variety unfair deceptive act practices. the board continue update consumer protection regulation appropriate provide household information need make inform credit decision address new unfair deceptive practice may develop practice product change. systemic risk authority one issue receive much attention recently possible benefit establish systemic risk authority would charge monitoring, assess and, necessary, curtail systemic risk across entire u.s. financial system. at conceptual level, expressly empower governmental authority responsibility help contain systemic risk should, implement correctly, reduce potential large adverse shock limit spillover effect shock occur, thereby enhance resilience financial system. however, one underestimate challenge involve develop implement supervisory regulatory program systemic risks. nor establishment authority view panacea eliminate period significant stress financial market reduce need important reform i discussed. the u.s. financial sector extremely large diverse – value add amount nearly $1.1 trillion 8 percent gross domestic product 2007. systemic risk may arise across broad range firm markets, may concentrate key institution activities. they occur suddenly, rapid substantial decline asset prices, even probability occurrence build slowly time. moreover, current crisis illustrated, systemic risk may arise nonbank entity 6 bi review 33/2009 (for example, mortgage brokers), sector outside traditional purview federal supervision (for example, insurance firms), institution activity base country operate across national boundaries, linkage interdependency among financial institution financial institution markets. and, existence systemic risk may apparent hindsight, identify risk ex ante determine proper degree regulatory supervisory action need counteract particular risk without unnecessarily hamper innovation economic growth challenge assignment agency group agencies.4for reasons, systemic risk authority would need sophisticated, comprehensive multi-disciplinary approach systemic risk. such authority likely would require knowledge experience across wide range financial institution markets, substantial analytical resource identify type information need analyze information obtained, supervisory expertise develop implement necessary supervisory programs. to effective, however, skill would combine clear statement expectation responsibilities, adequate power fulfill responsibilities. while systemic risk authority require rely information, assessments, supervisory regulatory program exist financial supervisor regulator whenever possible, would need sufficient power achieve broad mission – monitor contain systemic risk. these power likely would include broad authority obtain information – data collection reports, necessary, examination – range financial market participants, include bank organizations, security firms, key financial market intermediaries, financial institution currently may subject regular federal supervisory report requirements. how might properly construct systemic risk authority use expertise authority help monitor, assess, mitigate potentially systemic risk within financial system? there numerous possibilities. one area natural focus systemic risk authority would stability systemically critical financial institutions. it also likely would need role set standard capital, liquidity, risk-management practice financial firms, give importance matter aggregate level risk within financial system. by bring broad knowledge interrelationship firm market bear, systemic risk authority could help mitigate potential financial firm source of, negatively affect by, adverse shock system. it seem sensible role systemic risk authority complement, displace, firm's consolidate supervisor (which, i note earlier, systemically critical financial institution have). under model, firm's consolidate supervisor would continue primary responsibility day-to-day supervision firm's risk- management practices, include relate compliance risk management, focus safety soundness individual institution. another key issue extent systemic risk authority would appropriately calibrate ability take measure address specific practice identify pose systemic risk – coordination supervisor possible, independently necessary. for example, may practice appear sound consider perspective single firm, appear troublesome understand widespread financial system, practice reveal share dependence firm particular form uncertain liquidity. 4 for example, existence supra-normal profit market segment may indicator supra-normal risks, also may result innovation part one market participant create undue risk system. bi review 33/2009 7 other activity systemic risk authority might undertake include: (1) monitor large rapidly increase exposure – subprime mortgage – across firm markets; (2) assess potential deficiency evolve risk-management practices, broad-based increase financial leverage, change financial market product increase systemic risks; (3) analyze possible spillover financial firm firm markets, example mutual exposure highly interconnect firms; (4) identify possible regulatory gaps, include gap protection consumer investors, pose risk system whole; (5) issue periodic report stability u.s. financial system, order disseminate view elicit consider view others. thus, numerous important decision make substantive reach responsibility systemic risk regulator. how authority, created, structure locate within federal government also complex issue. some suggest federal reserve role, others express concern add responsibility would overburden central bank. the extent new responsibility might good match federal reserve, act either alone part collective body, depend great deal precisely congress define role responsibility authority, well complement federal reserve's long-established core missions. nevertheless, chairman bernanke noted, effectively identify address systemic risk would seem require involvement federal reserve. a central bank unite states, federal reserve critical part play government's response financial crises. indeed, federal reserve establish congress 1913 largely mean address problem recur financial panics. the federal reserve play key role part serf liquidity provider last resort, power prove critical financial crisis throughout modern history. in addition, federal reserve broad expertise derive activities, include role umbrella supervisor bank financial hold company active monitor capital market support monetary policy financial stability objectives. it seem equally clear financial regulator must involve successful overall strategy contain systemic risk. in first place, course, appropriate attention systemic issue normal regulation financial firms, markets, practice may support strategy. second, information insight gain financial regulator realm expertise important contribution demand job analyze inchoate risk financial stability. still, collective process surely valuable assess systemic risk, important assign clearly responsibility authority actual systemic risk regulation, since share authority without clearly delineate responsibility action sometimes prescription inaction. conclusion i try today identify element agenda limit potential financial crises, include action federal reserve take address systemic risk several measure congress consider make financial system strong safer. in so, must avoid respond current crisis, must instead fashion system challenge regulate dynamic innovative financial system. we federal reserve look forward work congress legislation meet objectives. 8 bi review 33/2009 t t mboweni: central bank financial stability – lesson future keynote address mr t t mboweni, governor south african reserve bank, 48th aci world conference, cape town, 13 march 2009. * * * introduction honour aci members, organisers, moderators, guests, lady gentlemen. thank invitation speak illustrious event. it indeed privilege rare opportunity share idea state global financial system market practitioner across world. it difficult current circumstance give optimistic address. nevertheless, i try avoid paint dismal depress picture instead focus thing learn recent experiences, contribute towards good future. the mood global economy change almost over-exuberance depth recession le two years. we certainly experience unprecedented event action take restore stability trust global financial system surpass previous ones. judge programme conference, expect issue discuss great detail next two days. this presentation also make, towards end, comment state south african bank sector. it remain difficult understand various role players, include supervisors, central banks, rat agencies, multilateral agencies, governments, risk manager highly competent private sector participants, fail fully comprehend development that, hindsight, bind bring u time point. yet, important thing apportion blame, try understand avoid repeat mistakes. there many lesson learnt, view lesson valuable point view supervisor policy makers, also traders, banker financial market participants. clearly, situation still unfolding, one best talk “preliminary lessons”. lesson number 1: the sum perfectly rational individual decision doesn’t equal perfectly rational market with hindsight, clear that, although individual institution hedged, transfer manage risk exposure sophisticate ways, systemic level point reach become impossible fully diversify transfer risk. the global financial system finite entity, although risk pass around, disappear. we probably underestimate inter-linkages financial system across globe, extent globalisation create complicate network circuit contagion financial risk. the lesson take forward never lose sight systemic implication individual institutions, transaction events. financial stability systemic concept, play much big role future take much seriously case exuberant year prior 2008. issue macro-prudential analysis supervision, crisis preparedness stress test financial system likely feature much strongly collective endeavour year come. bi review 32/2009 1 lesson number 2: if something seem good last, probably the current crisis result specific combination number causes. for years, liquidity global financial market mispriced, therefore generally take granted. interest rate low, huge profit lock carry trade fund could obtain minimal cost overnight markets, invest high-yielding longer-term assets, emerging-market financial assets, equities, securitised mortgage loan asset-backed securities. south africa beneficiary trend: 2004 2007, net inflow record financial account balance payment total r391 billion. if inflow include “unrecorded transactions” added, figure would well r500 billion. compare combine net outflow around r23 billion prior four years. the advantage inflow significant: allow south african reserve bank restore fragile foreign exchange reserve position healthy one, help country finance current account deficit, build infrastructure, boost economic growth increase employment. overall, make country slightly resilient adverse development currently experiencing. however, abruptly remind portfolio flow fickle, cannot rely upon source external fund tide turns. even though south africa still maintain positive net balance financial account first three quarter 2008, significant net outflow portfolio investment global investor force deleverage. in addition, fund international market become much expensive. we also remind market move cycles, fallacy people advocate “decoupling emerge markets” “the business cycle conquered” prove widely miss point. what lesson learnt? the lesson prolong period high asset growth fully justify trend real sector bind correct. for example, house price continue grow double-digit rate economy grow two three per cent per year? how balance sheet bank consistently grow four five time fast underlie economy? how off-balance sheet activity bank consistently outpace on-balance-sheet growth without signal sort distortion? how profit target bonus keep rise year year, underlie real economy still much same? it human nature tolerant continuous rise asset price price declines. perhaps careful future: growth rate price increase justify development underlie activity real economy, asset bubble develop, effect bubble burst serious. lesson number 3: the seed next crisis sow solution current one without much choice, central bank government (mainly) industrialise world take unprecedented action attempt restore confidence financial system. these action include significant liquidity injections, low collateral requirements, asset swaps, longer-maturity refinance operations, intervention foreign exchange markets, co-operation among central bank market operations, monetary accommodation, quantitative credit easing, capital injection bank financial institutions, substantial fiscal stimulus package and, cases, nationalisation banks. look instrument available bank governments, really use one way another crisis. action implement may lifeline world financial system, also well aware may, inherently, negative consequence long term. the major central bank plan exit strategy well. government 2 bi review 32/2009 manoeuvre heavy indebtedness, potential crowd private sector would address reasonable limit moral hazard restored. in recent speech1, jeffrey lacker, president federal reserve bank richmond, note “the strike feature central bank lend government financial support current turmoil extent extend well beyond boundary previously understand constrain lending”, “the scope financial safety net ultimately must roll back”. although inflation currently issue many people worry about, know measure currently take potentially inflationary, point attend to. a one colleague remark “the house fire, need fire engine scene, mop operation come later”. lesson number 4: every good party need strong bouncer in financial markets, bouncer supervisors. look previous issue imf’s global financial stability report, bi quarterly reports, various individual central banks’ financial stability reports, evident many cause financial crisis noted, act upon. a point colleague jean-claude trichet2 capacity chairman global economy meet central bank governor bi – meet also attend regular basis – several policy maker indicate market participant need prepare significant correction. with hindsight, clear danger sign supervisor could possibly counter decisively. to list warnings, excessive leverage securitisation re-securitisation, excessive dependence short-term wholesale funding, complete under-estimation under-pricing risk, particular liquidity risk, skew incentive structures, overreliance mathematical statistical risk model without proper understand assumptions, dynamic constraints, blind reliance credit rat without properly analyse understand methodology caveats, proliferation financial innovation result complex product well understand sell buy them. however, supervisor advocate financial stability seem powerless address issue party still go on. only week nationalised, northern rock report record profit hail innovative business model financial strength, include capital adequacy. it difficult supervisor spoil fun everything go well. yet, supervisor financial stability function central bank take role bouncers, muscle! much attention currently give international forum strengthen supervisory regulatory framework give legal power financial stability practitioners. for example, recommendation make financial stability forum strengthen prudential framework banks, include regard capital, liquidity, risk management market infrastructure, strengthen framework transparency valuation, change role us credit ratings, enhance responsiveness authority risk cooperation deal weak banks.3 other issue address various forum way pro-cyclicality financial regulation could reduced, area regulatory arbitrage could eliminated, 1 lacker, j. financial condition economic outlook. remark make south carolina business industry political education committee, 13 january 2009. 2 trichet, j-c. undervalue risk uncertainty – think market turmoil. speech 5th ecb central bank conference, frankfurt main, 13 november 2008. 3 draghi, m. how restore financial stability. lecture 5th bundesbank lecture, 16 september 2008. bi review 32/2009 3 cross-border supervisory crisis resolution framework could strengthened, example supervisory colleges. lesson number 5: common sense prevail a comment recently make perhaps one good thing current crisis engineer student future actually train for: engineers. in past decade so, financial world take mathematicians, statisticians, engineer scientists. these professional make breakthrough development sophisticate risk management valuation techniques, contribute vastly financial innovation development new products. but probably over-relied models. after all, engineer different field banking, finance business management, many instance great divide create business acumen board director banks, model banks’ operation based. while financial risk model continue play important role future, good balance basic business common sense, challenge underlie assumption model attempt understand inherent limitation constraints. some comment south african bank system we would like conclude address promise earlier, make comment south african bank system, appear weather storm relatively well now. to date, south africa’s bank system remain largely shield direct effect global financial market crisis, although bank somewhat affect general re-pricing risk increase fund costs. south african bank limit direct exposure trouble toxic securitised debt market us, partly owe prudential restriction type asset extent domestic bank allow invest offshore. in addition, securitisation activity bank

spanish economy 2008 address mr miguel fernández ordóñez, governor bank spain, govern council bank spain occasion presentation annual report 2008, madrid, 16 june 2009. * * * lady gentlemen, the year 2008, subject annual report i submit today council, saw strain international ﬁnancial market heighten turn global ﬁnancial crisis ultimately trigger widespread loss conﬁdence unprecedented worldwide economic recession. the ﬁnancial tension push large number bank broad range country brink. and cause loss global ﬁnancial system which, due caution estimate call for, amount trillion euro. the crisis affect ﬁnancial markets, asset-backed security interbank deposit market bring grind halt. the habitual stress indicator surge all-time high around october remain high level despite improvement recent months. clearly, globalisation conducive growth ﬁnance recent year also instrumental swift simultaneous spread tensions, see extend further. testify real impact ﬁnancial crisis harshness contraction 6% world economy end-2008, decline world trade 20%, term annualised rates, advance country full-blown recession growth emerge economy dwindle substantially. the picture worsen ﬁrst quarter 2009, mark currently appear crisis height. the improvement late indicator suggest contractionary force abating, danger continuous deepen recessionary spiral appear allayed. a real ﬁnancial crisis scale currently attain reveal deep-seated weakness affect structural interlinkages economic systems. in principle, severity crisis depend magnitude shock trigger strength economy bear down. evidently, perspective, increase u subprime mortgage defaults, bankruptcy lehman brother episode may single could alone trigger situation seriousness scale seen. rather, episode prey economic market structure fragile incubate unsustainable trend could detect correct time. with hindsight, clearly mistake assume ﬁnancial market virtually unfettered capacity improve risk management, give excessive leeway self-regulation. further, continuous expansion spend advance economy basis grow private debt key component so-called “global imbalances”, whose danger many report warned. but detection problem sufﬁce either properly diagnose potential scope act accordingly. indeed, economic policy – monetary ﬁnancial policy particular – were, broadly speaking, clearly excessively lax upturn. economic authority face challenge design appropriate mechanism strengthen institution economy and, crisis behind us, prevent trend recurring. this challenge ﬁrstly involve far-reaching review basic principle underpin ﬁnancial market regulatory supervisory policy recent years. a new bi review79/2009 1 balance must strike regulation self-regulation, provide ﬁnancial institution investor appropriate incentive curb natural tendency ﬁnancial system accentuate business cycles. it also necessary extend purview regulator supervisors, avoid presence “blind spots” ﬁnancial systems, seek suitable response fact market many market player increasingly global, term geographical scope action product trade. the crisis also highlight advisability design set place macro-prudential supervisory framework concern overall stability thus complement individual bank-focused microprudential supervisory conduct. macroeconomic strategy likewise review light shortcoming evidenced, order detect correct time imbalance i refer earlier. in case ﬁscal policies, great emphasis sustainability public ﬁnances medium long term would provide powerful countercyclical component offset excessive private-sector spending. a regard monetary policy strategy, careful analysis make role play identiﬁcation appropriate coverage risk stability originate, develop and, worst-case scenario, materialise ﬁnancial markets. fiscal monetary authority also share substantial challenge design “exit strategies”. these allow, crisis overcome, wind various measure central bank government adopt face risk crisis might bring world economy verge depressive spiral grave consequences. the raft measure adopt wide-ranging, many base common principle jointly agree upon different international fora. multilateral cooperation crucial successfully tackle global crisis. further headway must thus make along lines, harness opportunity provide g20 meet london last april. not vain, one lesson draw past experience economic redeployment behind national border protectionism sure-ﬁre recipe exacerbate prolong global crisis present one. among measure adopted, central bank advance economy react decisively provide abundant liquidity ﬁnancial system substantially cut key interest rates. these standard monetary policy measure late complement other, non-conventional measures. the european central bank begin early increase liquidity assistance and, october, banks’ application liquidity begin meet full, range ﬁnancial asset accept collateral operation widened. the main reﬁnancing rate cut 325 basis point all-time low 1% follow may meeting. and, regard extraordinary measures, term liquidity inject extend 12 months, fund provide currency euro, thank cooperation agreement central banks; european investment bank grant status eligible counterparty, order smooth course loan institution make european smes; decision take purchase cover bond similar type asset-backed bonds. at time, expansionary monetary impulse unprecedented proportion set train europe, commensurate seriousness contractionary trend experience real ﬁnancial domain. at government level, measure aimed, ﬁrst, support ﬁnancial system and, further, stimulate demand. among former, selective bail-outs bank systemic importance open month 2008 followed, heighten tension market summer, raise deposit guarantee scheme limits, government-backed bank issues, public injection capital purchase safeguard value trouble asset hold banks. all measure umbrella 2 bi review 79/2009 common principle concert action, level head state government europe, g20 meet globally. among demand-stimulus measures, aside operation automatic stabilisers, pivotal economy spain, measure base increase public spend aimed, many occasions, group sector adversely affect crisis, tend predominate. the european economic recovery plan approve december provide reference point coordination measure europe. the spanish authority also adopt broad set similarly gear measures. these include raise limit deposit guarantees, creation fund acquisition financial asset purchase high-quality asset spanish banks, guarantee bank bond issues, various special ﬁnancing facility instrument ico (ofﬁcial credit institute), introduction new personal income tax deduction launch state fund local investment special state fund revitalise economy. in spain, international crisis impact economy particularly delicate time. already way process adjustment imbalance build long growth phase spain share above-mentioned factor fragility world economy, though degree intensity. certain component undoubtedly particular spain. start share elements, expansion spanish household corporate spend base excessively debt. true, private sector start relatively low debt levels. admittedly, too, euro area membership provide particularly valuable framework stability broaden ﬁnancing possibilities. no le true, however, fact single monetary policy stance prove overly lax year spanish domestic condition ﬁscal policy, even though substantial budgetary consolidation undertaken, enough offset excessive monetary looseness. a great containment current spend upturn would help curb imbalance would strengthen underlie budgetary position. other feature expansionary phase were, however, speciﬁc. in spain, productive factor ﬁnancial resource overly concentrate real estate sector. further, structural constraint economy, productivity function labour market, show sufﬁcient improvement. another singular factor position relative strength spanish ﬁnancial system face crisis. spanish bank continue pursue “traditional” business model entire upturn, focus retail ﬁnancial intermediation. this certainly main reason why, widely known, role spanish intermediary generation, acquisition ﬁnancing toxic asset prove negligible. a system’s supervisor, banco de españa also contribute entrench relative strength, policy focus cyclical pattern build provision rigorous deﬁnition scope consolidation ﬁnancial groups. the spanish ﬁnancial system thus able ride ﬁrst wave crisis – nature origin which, let remind you, strictly ﬁnancial – readapt source fund new market situation. loan securitisation therefore leave centre stage deposits, short-term commercial paper issue bank resort new abundant liquidity provision policy implement ecb whole eurosystem. nonetheless, transformation ﬁnancial crisis real recession give rise second wave risk ﬁnancial stability, whose nature time eminently macroeconomic. the spanish ﬁnancial system face second wave relative advantage le damage ﬁrst. but guarantee immunity since deterioration spanish economy exert pressure, various channels, bi review79/2009 3 banks’ save banks’ income statements. i shall discus i turn ﬁnancial system, analyse situation outlook spanish economy. the spanish economy escape unscathed global contractionary trends, 2008 undergo far-reaching adjustment. decline gdp evident third quarter, lead economy post 0.7% fall output year-end term year-on-year rate. this recessionary pattern become visible ﬁrst quarter 2009, gdp decrease year-on-year rate 3%, employment 6% level year earlier. a world level, improvement since late indicator appear point ease contractionary trends. the adjustment spanish economy impact particularly domestic spend component show great excess long upturn. the origin behaviour lie overlap series differ shocks. firstly, correction real estate sector high level private-sector debt, start prior crisis, already entail significant element spend containment. further, however, forceful effect international financial crisis global recessionary trend compound situation, amplify contraction domestic demand, eliminate possible external support exacerbate loss confidence. this latter factor was, moreover, particularly affect impact far-reaching deterioration labour market income expectations, important matter i shall return later. a result factors, mark decline spanish household spending, consumption residential investment. in 2008, item account jointly 80% decline contribution national demand output, stand slightly 4 pp year average. naturally, heighten ﬁnancial crisis ﬁnal stretch year, subsequent deterioration macroeconomic expectations, saw contractionary impulse spread component domestic spending, mean business investment ultimately collapse second half year. indeed, sole prop spend 2008 net external demand, show mark increase contribution 1 pp gdp growth year whole 2.3 pp ﬁnal quarter. set progressive weaken world economy, improvement external contribution due notable slowdown imports, whereby fall gdp prove moderate countries. the decline residential investment, along sharp pick-up household save rate 13% disposable income, entail abrupt reduction household net borrowing, insofar household generate net lend capacity amount equivalent 0.6% gdp year whole. the slowdown household debt intensiﬁed extent debt/gdp ratio begin fall close month year. in case businesses, decline productive investment also lead sharp reduction net borrowing, ultimately manifest slowdown rate increase debt ratio, although interest burden still continue increase. a result change sign intensity foreign trade, reduction nation’s high net borrowing, step open month 2009, show 25% decline ﬁrst quarter compare period year earlier. foreseeably, decrease external deﬁcit continue apace come months, may halve within two years, evidence speed adjustment induce depth contraction domestic demand. on supply side, weakness activity pass productive branches, particular force construction industry. employment rapidly erode follow fourteen year uninterrupted job creation. in late 2008 early 2009, job destruction intense and, since labour supply remain notably strong, unemployment rate surge 17.4% ﬁrst quarter year, bear young less skilled. 4 bi review 79/2009 regrettably, high unemployment ﬁgure show one risk i refer present annual report 2007 materialised. i insist need prevent adjustment spanish economy fall predominantly employment, previous recessions, since would signiﬁcant adverse multiplier effect demand activity, via disposable income future income expectations. and stated, prove precisely one powerful channel propagation contractionary trends. one traditional behavioural pattern spanish economy thus recurring, reveal persistent weakness institutional framework arrangement must corrected. the high increase labour cost witness last year, reﬂecting rise inﬂation ﬁrst half year, favourable employment. wage cost pressure begin abate 2009, line improve inﬂation expectations, follow decline rate change cpi recent months. indeed, inﬂation move markedly rise trend ﬁrst half 2008, price slow sharply close month year result abrupt turnaround oil food price mark sluggishness demand. this deceleration become pronounce 2009 date, annual rate change cpi fall march, april may (-0.9% latter month). while cpi trajectory reﬂects correction price rise volatile component open month 2008, ongoing recession, severely affect consumption, prompt adjustment price margin begin impact service le volatile components. and mean price growth differential euro area turn negative, foreseeably remain come months. the cpi expect continue temporarily post negative rate change come month and, statistical effect link high oil price ﬁrst half 2008 strip out, inﬂation resume positive although moderate rate change. this price behaviour line improvement competitiveness require lessen scope cost recession, prompt necessary adjustment embark sound recovery. the outlook spanish economy point decline gdp rest year lead signiﬁcant fall 2009, albeit slightly low forecast european countries. it highly likely bad contraction already passed, intensity restrictive impulse begin diminish second half year broad range measure implement progressively deploy effects. a result, fall activity 2010 expect le pronounced. the course employment scenario, event, cause concern; despite somewhat positive signal give recent indicators, link part seasonal factors, job destruction may run time unemployment rate may continue rise trend. the imbalance build long expansionary phase, form inﬂation differential resort external ﬁnancing, swiftly reabsorbed, provide unquestionable source relief global outlook described. yet rapid correction occur back excessive brake activity, entail major cost term job destruction, high unemployment deterioration productive fabric. if institutional feature behind development reformed, risk that, even acute phase crisis over, continue hold back spanish economy’s possibility recovery become drag progress real convergence europe. to rebuild sound foundation growth, economic policy contribute set place appropriate condition revive conﬁdence, return ﬁnancing ﬂows normal reinvigorate spend plans. that require headway restore health ﬁnancial position private sector bank system, completion adjustment bi review79/2009 5 real estate sector and, all, improvement productivity, competitiveness job creation incentives. the correction construction sector prove intense. and although still sizeable stock unsold housing, reduction interest rate house price doubt make residential market accessible. cheap borrow term ease credit restriction also help breathe new life spending. but recovery external demand, move international crisis, act main support. and competitive national production is, powerful effect be. to end, frequently indicate banco de españa, sustain increase productivity must attain pertinent cost, margin price adjustment made. the scale global recession call implementation demand-side expansionary ﬁscal monetary policies. and context substantial cut central bank intervention rate see past year understood, cut conducive signiﬁcant decline cost ﬁnancing sharp expansionary stimulus. in spain, potential effect pass-through particularly powerful result prevalence ﬂoating interest rate loans. spain, too, move adopt demand-stimulating discretionary ﬁscal measure order bolster expansionary impact substantial transfer income private sector, especially households, arise operation automatic stabilisers. the ﬁscal drive spanish authority considerable scale generally exceed develop countries. it budgetary impact accentuated, moreover, sharp fall tax revenue consequence economic recession magnitude real estate adjustment; accordingly, ﬁscal situation deteriorate rapidly. it recall spanish economy start healthy budgetary position, surplus somewhat 2 pp gdp low public debt ratio compare european counterparts. indeed, last year’s presentation annual report council, i refer budgetary policy one main underpinnings spanish economy phase cycle i point favourable ﬁscal position would allow automatic stabiliser operate full extent without jeopardise budgetary stability. one year on, ﬁscal result 2008 projection available – point budget deﬁcit approach 10% gdp 2010 public debt ratio might exceed threshold 60% gdp – augur drastic change outlook, possibility ﬁscal policy boost spend exhausted. fiscal measure call question commitment budgetary stability medium term categorically avoided, since would adversely affect cost raise fund conﬁdence spanish economy, could also generate expectation future tax rise might ultimately sterilise expansionary effect measure adopted. public-sector debt must prevent become obstacle spanish economy good place grow. accordingly, priority must give promptly deﬁning credible strategy reduce deﬁcit level compatible budgetary stability, exceptional circumstance lead rise deﬁcit disappeared. the demand-side expansionary ﬁscal monetary impulse prove powerful contribute alleviation contractionary force play. evidently, though, possibility use type policy become notably constrained, home abroad. it also bear mind that, economic ﬁnancial fragility beleaguer world economy resolved, demand-side policy adopt neutral stance. all consideration diagnosis spanish economy current international crisis limit leeway available demand-side policy mean, rather, 6 bi review 79/2009 economic policy central role play implement reform help improve productivity behaviour factor product markets. it area authority undoubtedly effective room manoeuvre, also considerable responsibility. let begin labour market, press problem found. the scale job destruction highlight existence distortion emerge force recession compound contractionary trends. and risk that, past, surge change level unemployment may stick delay subsequent recovery. labour market dysfunction also closely link discourage behaviour economy respect gain economic efﬁciency productivity, hamper possibility attain genuine improvement competitiveness raise growth potential. economic recovery spain require structural change encourage technologically dynamic productive sector high growth potential take baton construction. for occur, labour market must function reallocate resources, increase adapt workers’ skill new demands, make productive process within company efﬁcient. reform focus ensure labour condition adjust economy’s different cyclical juncture and, particular, speciﬁc circumstance company productive sector face. that prevent adjustment come push large number worker market. change also need hire arrangements. these must allow worker lose job return promptly active work life, spend long period unemployed, consequence adverse past. improvement labour market intermediation system mobility train unemployed also important. resolute action would help check business closure lessen risk decapitalisation, admittedly high present. if, moreover, signiﬁcant progress make eliminate administrative formalities, spanish economy would good place resume high growth rate world recovery began. to bring new productive pattern enable high rate potential growth regained, structural measure must span wide range ﬁelds. improve level educational attainment labour force vital raise quality productivity human capital. decisive effective action boost knowledge economy contribute substantially increase technological capital bridge gap blight spanish economy area. and improve competitive environment business take decision crucial step result overall gain efﬁciency

interaction industry service increase inﬂuence latter determine international competitiveness. it likewise necessary continue push liberalisation competition network industries, condition input provide productive activity allow spanish company compete equal foot develop countries. the liberalise impulse must regained, particular, energy, telecommunication rail transport sectors. i shall devote ﬁnal part address analyse situation spanish bank system great detail. an economic environment mark real ﬁnancial global crisis pose ﬁrst-order challenge normal pursuit bank activity. a stated, ﬁrst wave shocks, conﬁned essentially ﬁnancial arena, appreciable direct effect banks, indirect effect absorb orderly fashion. however, last bi review79/2009 7 autumn second wave shock unleashed, result real global crisis which, naturally, impact spanish banks. the spanish economy’s entry recession consequence bank bad debts. in particular, repercussion include arise high sensitivity employment – and, therefore, households’ ability pay – deterioration activity, adjustment real estate sector, relative weight bank balance sheet become signiﬁcant. the deterioration economic situation reduce demand credit bank customers, whose spend plan income expectation normally revise downwards economic downturns. likewise, bank become cautious grant loan result subsequent upward revision risk proﬁle borrowers. in combination, two factor translate, actually seen, substantial slowdown bank credit. base past cyclical behaviour variable, growth rate bank credit tend stand gdp. this cyclical component credit currently reinforce difﬁculties still beset wholesale fund market need spain rest international ﬁnancial system redress high level leverage attain past. the behaviour banks’ bad debt also follow certain cyclical patterns. default increase when, now, deterioration activity weaken ﬁnancial position bank customers, particularly case household whose member lose job. thus, follow long economic boom bring doubtful asset ratio historically low levels, year 2008 saw sharp rise ratios, persistence difﬁculties real sector economy suggest pressure yet dissipated. this risk bank must mindful manage appropriately. the diminish pace activity increase bad debts, general trend across spanish bank save banks, exert pressure income statement already 2008. the recur income inherent traditional bank model, therefore le reliant ﬁnancial market developments, explain why, despite difﬁcult economic circumstances, bank result positive, clear contrast report many institution develop countries’ bank systems. but spanish banks’ result come considerable pressure future. in short term, result foreseeable increase bad debts. in medium term, competition fund squeeze operate margin pressure readily offset past generation high volume business. and i believe ongoing deleveraging ﬁnancial sector, economy general, take place spain globally, view transitory. nor seem feasible substantial contribution private capital forthcoming tension international ﬁnancial market subside. from overall perspective spanish system position overcome challenges, though i reiterated, talk immunity completely place. indeed, bank position come cop tensions. this pursue different lend policy recent year term rate expansion loan degree risk concentration. even among bank follow similar strategies, notable difference identiﬁed regard selection speciﬁc risks, ability manage buffers, term proﬁtability solvency, available alleviate effect risk may materialise. for reason bank make change necessary adapt new circumstances. these change unavoidably involve step effort rationalise operate cost correct overcapacity sector arise worldwide tendency towards low level leverage. 8 bi review 79/2009 this overcapacity bank industry tackle restructure process allow sound efﬁcient ﬁnancial intermediation system take root. such system strength spanish economy preserve that, crisis behind us, sustainable growth path underpin efﬁcient allocation resources, include ﬁnancial ones, may resumed. this central role ﬁnancial intermediation system explain state has, addition support measure i previously discussed, show readiness, like governments, provide capital viable credit institution need it. these contributions, assistance, must nevertheless conditional upon restructure institution receive public funds, seek low cost taxpayer maximum efﬁciency. this approach square fully common principle agree upon international forum spain member, back expressly parliament broad

2000s advance economies. in fact, benefit long time last decade regard major economic achievement. yet increase financial integration countries, precisely insurance mechanism, may also play role spread current financial crisis virtually every open economy world. a key point limit extent rest world finance country’s external imbalance. in well-functioning monetary order, policy-makers market able ass limit external fund available country finance payment deficit, limit reach take corrective action. we know limit difficult assess, depend specific domestic international circumstances. the sophisticate financial market are, easily country finance payment deficit; le urgently need policy adjust domestic economy. i still hear alan greenspan saying: “it tempt conclude u current account deficit essentially by-product long-term secular forces, thus largely benign. after all, seem able finance international current account deficit relative ease recent years.”5a key question, ultimately, is: decide sustainable payment deficit is? the answer question, right wrong, mark evolution international monetary system since second world war. allow brief retrospective. under bretton wood agreement, availability international liquidity, ultimately form gold, bind criterion foster country adjust external imbalances. the system break u enough gold finance imbalances, want live within constraints, finance vietnam war. the move flexible exchange regime early 1970s expect solve problem. the think time country’s balance payment definition balance float system, exchange rate adjust ensure balance. define limit sustainable payment deficit, beyond finance would start become problematic, consider non-problem. the market would decide. that consensus time. not many disagreed. i still remember surprise robert triffin – chair bachelor’s dissertation committee louvain 1978 – ask “should u adjust finance current account deficit?” i give textbook answer, didn’t look convinced. financial market indeed expect finance external deficits, decide more, least prevail price (i.e. exchange rate). and decision made, adjustment rather violent. we experience market simply refuse finance external imbalance 1980s 1990s, produce major exchange rate adjustment lead financial crises. however, concern mainly develop emerge markets. furthermore, crisis often happen country refuse allow currency fully float. in cases, crisis erupt country try peg exchange rate overvalue levels. one lesson asian crisis late 1990s, particular, country either let 4 for comprehensive account function risk-sharing across countries, see e.g. lewis, k. (1996), “what can explain apparent lack international consumption risk sharing”, journal political economy, 104(2), pp. 267-297. 5 alan greenspan: “international imbalances”, remark before advance enterprise conference, london, england, december 2, 2005. 2 bi review 79/2009 exchange rate float order avoid accumulate excessive external imbalances, adjust macroeconomic policy ensure consistency peg.6we enter century new consensus, policy-makers take back seat rely heavily market allocate capital across countries, imf mandate exert strong surveillance role view ensure transparency encourage early adjustment. this consensus reach g7 summit cologne, 1999, late adopt g20. the expectation fully met, several reasons. first, several emerge market economy let currency float freely, continue peg exchange rates, although undervalue rate (instead overvalued). the reason fear float also desire promote export well accumulate reserve self-insurance policy case crisis. in turn, accumulation large surpluses, especially emerge asia oil-exporting countries, make possible finance u current account deficit. it also influence monetary condition us, low long term interest rate make monetary condition expansionary would otherwise case. the second reason imf succeed convince country pursue macroeconomic policy consistent sustainable current account positions. advance economies, particular us, take imf advice fully consideration decision-making. emerge economies, partly follow example give advance countries, also attach le importance imf surveillance. the accumulation external asset make le dependent imf fund advice. for example, imf succeed complete art. iv surveillance programme china since 2006. furthermore, imf reproach emerge market economy lack legitimacy, view relatively low quota representation. what lesson learn experience last ten year crisis? either recommendation contain consensus prevail asian crisis wrong appropriately implemented. i tend side last view. the lesson i would thus draw crisis recommendation implement last decade strengthened. the fact crisis restore imf place heart international financial system provide hope respect. however, recent month fund concentrate mainly crisis resolution. on hand, strive international monetary order crisis exception, fund great role prevention. in respect, discussion take place international forum burst crisis focus mainly strengthen regulatory prudential measures, macroeconomic surveilance. one could even see risk way crisis address could weaken fund’s preventive tools, least respect macroeconomic policies. let elaborate. one element concern that, even crisis, imf able convince member large external imbalance constitute serious threat global financial economic stability. the crisis see several key player unrelated accumulation external imbalances, thus unrelated way international financial system works. the imf seem favour view origin crisis find members’ policies, external imbalances, insufficient regulation supervision improper behaviour market participants.7 there wide range 6 “exchange rate regime emerge market economies”, ecb monthly bulletin, february 2003. 7 see imf (2009): “lessons global crisis macroeconomic policy”, 19 february 2009; blanchard, o.

also conceivable money laundering, perpetrate high scale, would complicate ability financial institution manage operation risks. another consequence money launder grand scale may erode effectiveness management monetary policy, potential change demand cash economy. money launder also bad economy development undermine legitimate business, competition reduce tax revenue national authority launderers would operate underground outside tax net. the combat money launder presuppose existence capacity resource national level. in many develop countries, real challenge compete demand regard utilization scarce resources. the scarcity resource critical law enforcement spheres, since national jurisdiction le efficient law enforcement agency case overwhelm demand enforce national laws. in conclusion, i would like urge member public look information combat money laundering, start next week. i look forward everyone’s participation effectively combat money laundering. i thank attention. 2 bi review

"not anything," either regard event last september generally financial crisis. policymakers congress, department treasury, federal deposit insurance corporation (fdic), federal reserve – counterpart

particular, i compare credit current crisis 1990-1991 episode that, might remember, also include financial crisis. to preview conclusions, i confess i actually rather startle pattern data. i originally start look data determine much bad credit contraction episode compare previous episodes. instead, data suggest actual credit contraction episode quite subdue compare might expected. so i think policy help maintain flow credit business households. how well policy contain crisis worked? a market-by-market perspective the policy response financial crisis substantial occur fronts. fiscal policy monetary policy, well policy relate government guarantee safety nets, deposit insurance, use improve condition financial sector. in discuss policy appear work (or likely work case more-recent

interest rate method monetary policy the federal open market committee (fomc) respond financial crisis aggressively ease short-term interest rates, begin september 2007. at december 2008 meeting, committee reduce target federal fund rate close low bound, set range 0 1/4 percent. with inflation expect remain subdue time, fomc indicate short-term interest rate likely remain low extend period. by

a credit crunch, accord white house council economic advisers, "occurs supply credit restrict range usually identify prevail market interest rate profitability investment projects."11 judge whether credit crunch happen real time – and, extent, even hindsight – easy. it extremely difficult sort relative importance flow credit reduce demand due weak economic activity, reduce supply borrower appear

jean-pierre roth, chairman govern board swiss national bank, half yearly medium news conference, berne, 18 june 2009. * * * since begin financial crisis august 2007, monetary policy pass three distinct stages. in first stage, interbank market gradually dry up, seek protect swiss economy deterioration condition credit market. from start crisis, counter force push level three-month libor undertake appropriate reduction repo rate. between september 2007 september 2008, able stabilise libor 2.75%. thus protect economy rise interest rate result increase risk premia money market. since confident economic downturn would moderate effect prices, refrain adopt restrictive monetary policy, despite fact soar oil price cause inflation rise risk destabilise inflation expectations. the second stage begin autumn 2008 emergence first indication swift downturn economy sharp deterioration financial crisis collapse lehman brother investment bank. we rapidly relax monetary policy bring libor target 225 basis point level 0.5% within three months. at time, charge stabilise financial sector, commit take large portfolio illiquid ubs assets. in addition, conclude euro versus swiss franc swap arrangement european central bank central bank poland hungary, ease refinance bank grant mortgage loan swiss franc two countries. these swap make possible counteract rise libor generate additional demand swiss franc outside normal field operation. the third stage begin march 2009. by then, price stability threatened, temporary inflationary escalation 2008, quite opposite – risk fall price come three years. since, time, room manoeuvre area interest rate limited, decide turn unconventional instrument order bring relaxation monetary conditions. how economic financial situation develop since assessment march? global economic outlook global economic activity decline sharply expect first quarter 2009, especially europe japan. however, recent financial macroeconomic indicator show encourage signs. stock exchange index start edge up. oil prices, fall since july 2008, rise since march. risk premia money capital market declined. in addition, index business activity household confidence clearly turn upward again, even remain historically low levels. the combine effect development lead u modify risk assessment substantially affect scenario global economy. we still believe positive growth could set within u second half year europe begin next year. we continue expect modest global recovery, considerable under-utilisation production capacity eliminate next quarters. consequently, unemployment likely increase develop country whole. bi review 77/2009 1 swiss economic outlook a expected, swiss economic situation continue deteriorate first month year. in first quarter, gdp contract 3.2% annualised terms. however, figure obscure much sharp drop final demand. a precede quarter, part production was, effect, absorb increase stocks. external demand plummet level capacity utilisation fell substantially manufacture sector. final domestic demand private entity stagnated, likely weaken month ahead, since company reduce equipment investment household expenditure check grow uncertainty labour market. the number individual affect short-time work rise fast begin year, unemployment increase regular pace. this trend likely persist next month since lead indicator labour demand fall sharply. nevertheless, hop sign improvement observe abroad gradually transmit swiss economy. from second quarter, decline export likely slow down. however, growth figure probably remain negative next quarter due weaken domestic demand well reduction inventory levels. for 2009 whole, swiss national bank (snb) continue forecast reduction gdp 2.5% 3%. these figure still relatively moderate comparison country since switzerland benefit broad diversification relative flexibility economy. even so, i wish stress risk attach forecast clearly skew downside. change monetary financial condition how monetary financial condition develop since last assessment march? let u begin look movement interest rate money capital market well currency movement foreign exchange markets. on money market, three-month libor move down, far would liked. it decline check level risk premia, currently stand around 40 basis points. a announce march, objective still “to gradually bring libor low end new target range, i.e. approximately 0.25%.” progress slow, since monetary policy influence risk premia indirectly, instance, promote climate great confidence bank sector. the capital market affect force work opposite directions. on one hand, long-term rate interest, affect global developments, rise slightly. this increase reflect renew optimism upturn economy, inflationary fear increase capital requirement part public sector. on hand, risk premia fall somewhat. nonetheless, remain elevated, – moreover – reduction occur varied, depend quality borrowers, maturity bond question industry. the month november 2007 march 2009 saw significant appreciation swiss franc, 10% trade-weighted term 11% euro. although interest rate reduce october december last year, strengthen swiss franc unwelcome effect tighten monetary conditions. in view development, decide march assessment prevent appreciation swiss franc euro purchase foreign currency foreign exchange market. we achieve objective. since appreciation swiss franc euro cease volatility respect european currency diminish considerably. let u proceed examination monetary condition term volume – words, term credit monetary aggregates. overall, credit still grow annual rate 3%. however, general figure compose number 2 bi review 77/2009 different movement opposite directions. mortgage lend increase rapidly since november. the growth rate rise 3.6% december 4.2% april, advance relate fall libor. other credit currencies, contrast, begin fall april (–0.8%), might expect phase economic cycle. other credit grant swiss francs, however, continue grow rate 1.2%, despite fact already relatively high level. loan grant private company grow rate 10.2% first quarter 2009 compare first quarter 2008. thus, perceive slight indication credit crunch switzerland. clearly, decline quality certain borrower recession, inevitable cyclical tighten loan condition occur, cannot term credit crunch. this statistical information confirm quarterly survey lend condition snb conduct 20 important swiss bank since begin 2008. the survey show third bank question tighten lend condition slightly. this proportion little high loan grant large company grant small medium-sized companies. to summarise, situation bank lend market remain relatively relax clearly good u euro area. nonetheless, deterioration cannot rule future. we move monetary developments. for eighteen month now, demand liquidity interbank market increase substantially – i mention – loss trust among bank bring market standstill. the snb force take place lend bank provide market generous amount liquidity major expansion repo lending. moreover, additional liquidity create purchase foreign currency exchange rate market bond issue private sector borrowers, make swiss franc fund available swap arrangement european central bank central bank poland hungary. consequently, may, monetary base 132% within space one year amount chf 105 billion. the medium long-term inflationary threat large amount liquidity limit able absorb rapidly, slow lend issue snb bills, soon confidence return markets. however, liquidity accumulate bank could give rise excessive creation money massive expansion bank credit. in may, growth narrow monetary aggregates, sensitive change rate interest, exceed 40% m1 30% m2. in essence, strong rate growth reflect preference part general public liquid monetary asset time deposits, due financial uncertainty fall interest rates. the m3 aggregate, affect substitution effects, continue grow moderate rate 4.2% may, show that, present, create central bank money confine interbank level transmit rest economy. monetary policy need ensure level monetary aggregate become excessive long period. the indicator monitor show currently case. inflation inflation risk inflation develop line expectations. in first quarter zero, anticipate 0.1%. overall, forecast unchanged current year, inflation remain negative rest 2009. this, essence, attributable price import goods, comparison high level 2008. however, inflation domestic good services, despite weaken year, remain 1%. bi review 77/2009 3 the outlook follow year slightly adjust upwards. we shall return point moments. monetary policy decision at monetary policy assessment march, identify number element lead u foresee negative inflation 2009 risk deflation 2010 2011. in view threat, relax monetary condition take supplementary measures. we reduce three-month libor target range 25 basis point 0–0.75%, aim rate 0.25%. in order achieve this, grant longer-term repo credit conclude foreign exchange swaps. to prevent swiss franc appreciate euro, purchase foreign currency foreign exchange market; also purchase bond issue private sector issuer foster decline capital market risk premia. all all, operation achieve objective. the situation gradually normalising, although remain vulnerable. the risk still clearly skew downside major. give conditions, view inflation forecast, consider time correction yet come, additional relaxation monetary condition necessary either. we thererfore today decide continue expansionary monetary policy, maintain measure implement 12 march. inflation forecast chart how inflation forecast revised? the dash red curve chart represent new forecast. it cover period second quarter 2009 first quarter 2012, map future development inflation assumption three-month libor remain unchanged 0.25% forecast period. for purpose comparison, dash-dotted green curve show inflation forecast march monetary assessment, also base three-month libor 0.25%. the new forecast still show negative inflation 2009, slight adjustment upwards. this explain recent upturn price fossil fuel commodity general. however, average year, inflation remain negative, unchanged rate -0.5%. in 2010, inflation likely return slightly positive rate could little figure forecast march. this due fact although domestic inflation fall still amount around 1% end year import deflation recede rapidly. finally, 2011, new forecast show inflation accelerate little end forecast horizon libor remain level low aim present. thus, see libor cannot remain 0.25% indefinitely. however, forecast also shows, would advisable increase libor since weak inflation rate expect 2010 (0.4%) 2011 (0.3%) indicate deflation risk completely disappeared. we continue use inflation forecast guide decisions. in way, ensure unconventional measure currently force compromise medium long-term price stability. 4 bi review 77/2009 observe inflation june 2009

board swiss national bank, half-yearly medium news conference, berne, 20 june 2008. * * * around world, effect financial crisis implementation monetary policy composition central banks’ balance sheet become apparent. on one hand, conventional monetary policy exhaust options, unconventional measure increasingly used. on hand, central bank manage illiquid asset take effort stabilise bank system. both situation also apply swiss national bank. therefore, give brief assessment development international financial markets, i turn attention unconventional monetary policy measure take snb. i move discus snb stabfund. to conclude, i look risk face snb associate activities. situation international financial market although first week year saw stock market around globe experience low level many years, surprisingly positive result u bank sector mid-march prompt turnaround market sentiment. stock market since record strong price gains. other financial market segment also saw significant recovery. a result, downward spiral, trigger collapse lehman brother last september which, short while, even threaten bring global financial system crash down, come halt. after climb unsustainable high recent years, price many investment fell extremely low level turmoil past winter. the rapid recovery financial market since march must also partly regard correction previous excesses. furthermore, extremely expansionary monetary policy pursue worldwide likely also contribute calm situation. however, recovery financial market conceal fact uncertainty still high. how sustainable shift market sentiment really remain seen. the risk suffer setback remain correspondingly high. the snb’s unconventional monetary policy measure at quarterly assessment march, confront need significantly expand monetary policy. since repo rate already practically zero, resort unconventional monetary policy measures. we decide conclude longer-term repo transaction one hand, purchase foreign currency swiss franc bond other. by simultaneously intervene money, foreign exchange capital market necessary, strong broad-based monetary policy impact generated, without lead major distortion market concerned. allow add remark foreign currency bond purchases. purchase foreign currency the aim buy foreign currency prevent appreciation swiss franc euro. this key component unconventional monetary policy. it important emphasise engage foreign exchange intervention order bi review 77/2009 1 bring depreciation swiss franc, prevent appreciation franc role safe currency. therefore, reproach occasionally hear snb’s policy encourage international depreciation race unjustified. a look exchange rate movement show clear appreciation swiss franc course financial market crisis (cf. chart 1). so question snb conduct beggar-thy-neighbour policy. we give great deal latitude regard foreign exchange interventions. there fix threshold beyond become active; simply decide accordance situation hand. and market become use certain level intervention. we feel approach promise high possible impact, turn allow u phase strategy easily time comes. furthermore, comment volume foreign currency purchases. the purchase foreign currency fulfil purpose – i refer first unilateral intervention foreign exchange market since 1992. the appreciation swiss franc euro, particularly dangerous swiss real economy crisis, halted, volatility eur/chf exchange rate ease considerably (cf. chart 2). if necessary, continue intervene foreign exchange market prevent appreciation swiss franc euro. the snb occupy strong position regard. with interest rate zero bind policy quantitative easing, advantage market participant expect appreciation swiss franc. for interventions, neither take specific rate interest account neutralise expansion money supply. purchase swiss franc bond with purchase swiss franc bond issue private domestic borrowers, want low risk premia capital market and, doing, make easy private issuer raise capital. depend situation, try achieve great possible impact risk premia capital market liquidity deploy least amount capital. we want give individual company preferential treatment, instead wish ease refinance company switzerland overall. by also purchase primary market, directly promote raise new capital. initially, restrict purchase mortgage bond (pfandbriefe). since begin april, however, also buy corporate bonds. in segments, hope achieve great impact market whole. in principle, buy marketable bond pay market prices. apart mortgage bonds, buy bond issue financial institutes. a mid-june, total purchase amount around chf 2.5 billion mortgage bond roughly chf 300 million corporate bonds. for time being, plan continue purchase selectively. a regard volume, set restrictions. the bond purchase also seem fulfil purpose. risk premia come significantly (cf. chart 3). that said, able benefit favourable mood financial markets. the fact that, past weeks, several issuer find way back issue market first time long time proof effectiveness strategy. snb stabfund development market since ubs package measure announce show transfer illiquid asset ubs snb stabfund appropriate absolutely necessary. have asset remain ubs’s book value 2 bi review 77/2009 market price, bank’s existence would seriously threaten last months. the transfer asset conclude begin april. ultimately, total volume asset transfer amount usd 38.7 billion, purchase price roughly usd 1 billion book value asset ubs end september 2008. in addition, substantial portion amount transfer include liability form derivative currently need finance snb. the initial finance stabfund therefore considerably low purchase price. it comprise snb’s loan stabfund total usd 26.6 billion ubs’s equity contribution value usd 3.9 billion. the fund’s portfolio contain several thousand positions. table 1 give overview portfolio different investment segments. the portfolio management concept base long-term risk/return assessment. for asset cash flow expect exceed current market price, mainly pursue hold-to-maturity strategy. for asset case, sell opportunity arises. the objective portfolio management repay snb’s loan full possible. market development date impact strongly stabfund’s assets. a stands, asset enter balance sheet market value. rather, write balance sheet value long consider sustainable base result impairment test. however, despite method state asset balance sheet amortise cost, stabfund already use equity capital end march. up point, necessary make value adjustment amount roughly usd 5 billion. nonetheless, still look though stabfund ultimately able pay back loan. this because, one hand, market recover; positive turn event april may corroborate this. on hand, asset generate relatively robust cash flow now. owe interest payment loan repayments, snb loan already reduce considerably. by mid-may, come usd 23.7 billion. in addition, original size stabfund decline around usd 6.7 billion result sales, maturity close derivative positions. in mid-may, size stabfund, value amortise cost, roughly usd 32 billion, around usd 4 billion comprise contingent liability derivatives. the performance stabilisation fund’s asset due reassess end second quarter. approximately 80% snb’s loan stabfund denominate u dollars. originally, snb fully refinance dollar loan via exist swap facility federal reserve. now, le 20% refinance thus, account stage usd 3 billion. by contrast, outstanding volume snb usd bill – launch february 2009 refinance snb loan stabfund – already usd 15 billion. in addition short-term finance operations, snb conclude long-term deposit transaction amount usd 4 billion. we plan reduce use swap facility federal reserve. risk the risk face snb result commitment stabfund substantial, yet owe bank’s strong balance sheet, risk absorbed. i would particularly like emphasise snb’s commitment actually considerably low usd 60 billion still get quote public quite often. the snb consider loan stabilisation fund hindrance – either risk capability monetary policy latitude. the unconventional measure also pose additional risk snb’s balance sheet form interest rate, currency credit risks. however, analysis show that, term consolidate balance sheet, risk relatively low. bi review 77/2009 3 the snb well aware fact unconventional monetary policy measure pose balance sheet risks, also whole series risks, include difficulty connect correctly assess monetary policy impact find best way phase unconventional measures. a stabfund, convince – – must take risk order able avert other, even great risks. extraordinary time call extraordinary measures. the financial market crisis confirm belief snb must strong

financial supervision regulation european union. undoubtedly important reforms, particularly – – background financial crisis start august 2007. while ecb interest reforms, particular macro-prudential side, namely establishment european systemic risk board (esrb). macro-prudential supervision origin phenomenon systemic risk. a particularly illuminate account nature need macro-prudential supervisory policy provide 2000 andrew crockett, general manager bank international settlement chairman financial stability forum.2 crockett argue “consolidate shift perspective already take place, complement micro-prudential perspective increase awareness of, attention to, macro-prudential facet”. he define objective macro-prudential supervision limit likelihood failure, correspond costs, significant portion financial system (responding systemic risk). in contrast, micro-prudential objective see limit likelihood failure individual institution (responding idiosyncratic risk). from today’s perspective distinction seem relevant one decade ago. however, experience present crisis history past crises, well transformation modern financial systems, require u go further. we ask ourselves, example, scope macro-prudential supervision. i would distinguish two dimensions. the first one analysis monitor risk. the second one containment risk identified, require specific instruments. this raise question institutional set-up conduct macro-prudential supervision. 1. monitor analyse risk the literature suggest three main consideration way systemic risk monitor analysed.3 a first one macro-prudential analysis need capture component financial system interact. this include intermediaries, market infrastructure underpin them. in respect, important consider present components, hedge

system would go beyond regular financial stability analysis. on basis considerations, key output macro-prudential analysis would ideally periodical graduate ex ante risk assessment measure amount risk overall financial system implication economy large. this assessment would also estimate overall degree instability could result certain unexpected adverse event materialise, include scenario extreme shocks, ultimately also assess resilience financial system economy general. whereas macro-prudential (and micro-prudential) supervision mainly concern extreme event financial crisis (“tail risks”), forward-looking approach require prevent extreme imply careful assessment also make tranquil times, establish far system crisis risk – materialise – could bring close crisis. what need conduct analysis monitoring? the start condition implement comprehensive macro-prudential function adequate information basis. the first part information basis good system continuous market intelligence, give hands-on picture current market development expectation direct contacts. the second part consist regular collection macro-prudential data statistics, relate macroeconomic environment, financial market relate infrastructures, payment settlement systems, regulate unregulated intermediaries, non-financial corporation households, well relationship main economic financial sectors. the third part consist regular collection firm-level information data, particular large complex financial institutions. this relate specific item information regard on- off-balance-sheet items, appropriate breakdown exposure relate asset liability side (geographical, sectoral, currency, etc.), include identification counterparties. for identification interlinkages major intermediary assessment contagion risks, international “risk map” – propose example de larosière report – would particularly helpful.12 lastly, large complex groups, micro-prudential information liquidity risk management model would required. the second instrument suite analytical tool model staff familiar them. although formal model limitations, help structure qualitative quantitative information collect regular risk assessments. exist research offer eight broad group approach models: financial stability indicators, contagion spillover models, early warn signal models, stress test models, macro-financial risk-based flow-of-funds account models, macro-econometric forecast models, calibrate general equilibrium financial stability model model (including model firm household vulnerabilities). these model pro cons, promise easy implement others. each serf different purposes, also overlaps. since financial stability analysis general macro-prudential analysis particular much le understand policy areas, advisable use multiplicity approaches. how many overall list use much depend resource available develop maintain them. but investment analytical toolkit likely significant. i expect authority develop macro-prudential supervisory function extend reallocate resource order meet requirements. 12 “high-level group financial supervision europe”, report, brussels, 25 february 2009. bi review 77/2009 3 2. contain risk if risk systemic stability identified, next step contain them. i would consider three way achieve this. a first option communicate risk source risk financial market participants, view alert induce adjust behaviour. a second option strengthen supervisory oversight financial institution markets, view avoid excessive risk-taking. the third option achieve objective use regulatory powers. the three step summarise follows: (i) alerting, (ii) supervise closely (iii) regulating. the choice instrument use may vary, depend severity risk circumstances. a major challenge macro-prudential supervision relate decision-making system capable accommodate three options. let provide illustrations. first all, address certain macro risk may require adoption regulatory measure across board, apply particular financial institution markets. this may blur responsibility macro- micro-prudential supervision. alternatively, one follow suggestion crockett i mention distinguish regulatory supervisory action conduct level individual institution affect whole markets. the supervisory regulatory measure aim contain aggregate risk externality would part macro-prudential toolkit, whereas measure aim stability individual institution would part micro-prudential policy. follow objective-oriented approach, measure aim reduce pro-cyclicality financial system would part macro-prudential policy. some concrete idea discuss reduce pro-cyclicality, adjust capital requirement business cycle (making le stringent bad time stringent good times), add maximum leverage ratio introduce dynamic provision rule (where reserve accumulate good time draw bad times).13 measure aim dampen pro-cyclicality may also affect compensation structures, transparency account rules, internal governance (e.g. relate risk management function), design certain financial instruments, maturity mismatches.14 the macro-prudential toolkit would also include measure reduce contagion limit transmission channel financial instability. much progress make last two decade area payment settlement systems, need done, suggest recent debate central clear counterparties otc derivatives. new challenge emerge result significant increase wholesale fund financial intermediaries, emergence new institution (some highly leverage bank much exposed) increase transfer risk previously concentrate bank sector agents, insurance companies. a comprehensive framework policy analysis still lacking. a number proposal specific macro-prudential measure put forward, follow objective-oriented approach.15

financial market development annual report), bank england international monetary fund (in global financial stability report).16 with hindsight perhaps acknowledge communication effective change behaviour financial market participants, supervisory authorities. furthermore, insufficient understand force different risk factor materialise combined. for example, much develop monitor system, cover also non-regulated financial sector so-called shadow bank system, well granular frequent picture main exposure among large complex financial institutions, good insight could gain scope crisis erupt spread across financial systems. have integrate assessment impact financial innovation, risk develop credit risk transfer market would good understand monitored. however, flow information micro-prudential supervisor insufficient undertake assessment. 3. the institutional framework have set main objective tools, i would like address issue institutional framework support implementation macro-prudential supervision. such framework inevitably involve two main actors: central bank authority charge regulate supervise financial institution markets. the latter information individual participant market developments, responsible stability individual institutions, former analytical capability assess macroeconomic risk global financial market developments. a properly function system require full flow information: supervisory authority central bank, view provide relevant information monitor analyse risk and, vice versa, central bank micro-prudential supervisor order provide result risk analysis ensure appropriate measure implemented. also important clear allocation responsibility proper accountability ensure right incentive place achievement result cooperative manner rather inter-institutional fighting, recipe disaster. to consider option available let refer simplicity turner review basis analysis.17 in extreme synthesis, turner review attribute central bank main responsibility conduct risk analysis, come policy implications, three model considered: • in model 1, central bank identify systemic risk make recommendation authority charge micro-prudential supervision, set main action take address risks. capital ratio leverage, maturity mismatch contagion risk, kashyap, rajan stein, “rethinking capital regulation”, 2008 federal reserve bank kansa jackson hole symposium, propose capital insurance mechanism. 16 nier (2009), “financial stability framework role central banks: lesson crisis”, imf work paper wp/09/70, april, go even state that: “with hindsight, collective failure address key objective—mitigation systemic risk” “an expand role central bank go beyond tool already typically disposal may enhance overall effectiveness financial regulation, allow synergy exploit exist new regulatory tool mitigate systemic risk”. 17 “the turner review: a regulatory response global bank crisis”, march 2009 (www.fsa.gov.uk). bi review 77/2009 5 • in model 2, central bank charge identify risks, also able take specific macro-prudential measure require authority charge micro-prudential supervision so. • in model 3, joint committee, compose representative central bank supervisory authority, make final decision appropriate policy response. in view, third model third best, risk blur responsibility ensure proper accountability central bank micro supervisor. within propose committee, public disagreement central bank supervisor could arise, would hurt credibility process. this mean de facto micro supervisor veto right central bank. if instead two component committee allow disagree public, model 3 would become quite similar model 1, difference make public supervisor would explain disagree central bank take suggest action. another disadvantage model 3 emerge supervisory authority independent political authority. i elaborate need independence, view recent crisis, anything, strongly confirm it. look around europe, would interest verify extent recent crisis bank solvency problem emerge mainly country supervisory authority outside central bank independence former (also financial institutional terms) le well protect latter. in countries, model 3 would create channel influence central bank. furthermore, context european union model 3 would particularly difficult implement, would require agreement multiplicity national authorities, unless get situation central bank supervisory authority represent one european-wide institution. while current system central bank represent ecb, supervisor yet similar system. model 1 2 ensure clear allocation responsibilities, either central bank supervisory authority. in assess two models, key issue consider concern conflict interests, particular within central bank within supervisory authority, respectively. let’s consider first conflict interest within central bank, would emerge particular model 2, objective price stability objective macro-financial stability. a conflict would arise central bank would address two objective one instrument, i.e. interest rate. the central bank could push use interest rate achieve price stability also counter macro systemic risks. for instance, could increase interest rate prematurely, order stop financial bubble developing, underlie economic development require it. the interest rate necessarily efficient way prevent prick bubbles. the conflict interest would vanish central bank two distinct instrument address two objectives, clear assignment. the interest rate would assign achieve price stability, macro-prudential measure would aim macro-financial stability. during current crisis, ecb show separation achieved. on one hand interest rate use view achieve price stability, while, one hand, liquidity-injecting measure aim stabilise money market. each measure adopt justify public way keep separate two objectives. overall, experience suggest interest rate macro-prudential instrument rather complementary give rise conflict interest. let’s consider potential conflict interest supervisory authority, macro- micro-prudential objectives. supervisory authority might make trade-off achieve both. for instance, would difficult supervisor decide 6 bi review 77/2009 tighten capital requirement liquidity ratio boom economy bank individually experience difficulties. there might incentive address difficulty general, rather specific, measures. in european framework, give micro-supervisory authority exert national level, problem uniformity action. in model 1, central bank make recommendations, clear various national authority would react implement it. there could situation implementation differ across countries, without clear justification. ultimately, incentive safeguard competitiveness national system would induce respective authority adopt minimalist approach, would detriment overall stability. on hand, national economy may develop different ways, even euro area, macro risk arise country may relevant others. for example, last ten year euro area country experience fast growth domestic credit rise asset prices, others financial dynamic subdued. however, look risk take bank system across countries, emerge fast- slow-growing countries. this imply model 2 central bank able adopt measure take adequately account different macroeconomic development across countries. overall, seem great conflict interest objective macro micro prudential supervision price stability macro-prudential supervision. this reason i tend consider model 2, central bank give two instrument order achieve two distinct objective appropriate, especially within european framework, even euro area. this seem model implement us. the u administration propose give feed power address build risk threaten financial system whole, focus core institution markets. the creation council regulator proposed, feed need seek council’s approval act systemic risks. the de larosière report opt instead model 1. it suggest creation european systemic risk council (esrc), embed ecb, correspond general council. the general council ecb compose governor national central bank 27 eu member states, plus president vice-president ecb. the council would open series observers, like commission, three authority create three lamfalussy committee (for banking, market insurance), 27 national supervisors. the esrc able issue recommendation aim identify correct systemic vulnerabilities, national supervisor would responsible implementation. a i mention previously, model raise issue uniformity treatment across single market. the experience last year show national authority tend use discretion room manoeuvre available transposition european legislation. this would also case recommendation esrc. finally, de larosière report foresee separate arrangement euro area. we thus peculiar situation country participate euro two level discussion decision systemic risk, one eu level one national level, euro area country eu level. unless, course, ecb decide issue recommendation euro area. one key proposal contain de larosière report obligation national micro-prudential supervisor provide necessary information ecb order support latter’s risk analysis esrc. from de larosière report european council conclusion adopt today, long discussion member states, base proposal commission. the main content proposal maintained. the european bi review 77/2009 7 systemic risk board (rather council) power make recommendation implement policy directly. it support analytically logistically ecb. the commission present legislative proposal autumn specify new institutional arrangements. indeed, work need elaborate detail institutional framework esrb, well new european authority micro-prudential supervision. conclusion the recent crisis show importance macro-prudential supervision promote financial stability. a lot work need do equip competent institution analytical instrument ass monitor systemic risk toolkit necessary contain risks. some concern may arise whether decision-making process, particular within europe even euro area, expect set next month effective context single financial market, also comparison reform put forward us. implementation key. indeed, time go by, financial market show sign stabilisation, risk sense urgency reform fade away nationalistic tendency institutional jealousy re-emerge. the force push towards maintain status quo gain strength. if force firmly counteracted, crisis could turn waste opportunity. and next crisis could move closer. 8 bi review 77/2009 mervyn king: monetary policy development speech mr mervyn king, governor bank england, lord mayor’s banquet banker merchant city london mansion house, london, 17 june 2009. * * * my lord mayor, mr chancellor, my lords, ministers, aldermen, mr recorder, sheriffs, lady gentlemen, it quite year. a year remember, repeat. since last met, financial panic sweep market september, several major financial institution failed, remarkable collapse confidence around world lead unprecedented decline industrial production national output. world trade fell almost 15% six months, fast rate decline great depression. face crisis, bank england take extraordinary actions. bank rate cut virtually zero, monetary policy committee embark programme £125 billion asset purchases. and business deal call once-in-a-century event. since panic last autumn, overall output fall around 3% unite state unite kingdom, 6% germany, 7% japan. the collapse spend economy painful consequences. in le year, 5 million job lose unite states, almost 2 million euro area, almost half million unite kingdom. despite unprecedented fall activity, sign british economy begin stabilise, financial market improve markedly. there three solid reason think recovery activity likely occur point year. the first i call “honda effect” – many firms, honda last year plant swindon, cut back production meet demand stock, resume production year inventory reduced. the second factor level sterling which, despite recent rally, still 20% low summer 2007. that encourage switch spending, home abroad, towards good service produce uk. finally, perhaps important, enormous policy stimulus inject economy. bank rate cut four percentage point four months. but monetary policy committee judge even insufficient prevent inflation fall 2% target, embark programme asset purchase design increase money supply improve condition non-bank corporate credit markets. the programme shortly extend work capital finance, particular help small companies. but bank must become arbiter allocation public credit individual company sector – decision rightly necessarily province government. so limit scope bank’s activity area. the success policy judge increase bank lending. it aim increase money supply. there already tentative sign programme begin beneficial effect growth rate broad money pick up. so certainly grind believe rapid fall activity come end. but equally solid reason believe path full recovery could protracted. the obvious supply bank lend company bi review 76/2009 1 household remain constrained. the stock bank lend non-financial company fall recent months, household lend flat. part undoubtedly reflect weak demand face recession. but evidence prospective borrowers, term lender will extend credit, suggest banks’ ability finance sustain recovery remain impair low level equity capital. stress test design ass viability bank different test capacity bank system finance recovery. investor continue demand high return finance banks. put bluntly, market data credit spread imply bank view bad credit risk customers. a result, company bypass bank access capital market directly so. indeed, first four month year, finance raise debt equity market normally case entire year. most companies, however, especially small medium-sized enterprises, rely heavily bank finance. and current market sentiment may take addition equity capital bank system able supply credit price scale finance sustain recovery. that likely take time. it soon reverse extraordinary policy stimulus inject uk economy monetary policy, provision liquidity support banks, guarantee bank funding, fiscal policy. nevertheless, early prepare “exit strategies” explain would work. the challenge face monetary policy committee straightforward principle difficult practice. a activity return normal levels, outlook inflation pick up. and outlook inflation guide decision pace time withdrawal monetary stimulus. reach judgement outlook inflation never easy, assess implication policy always matter balance risks. in contrast, choice instrument simple. when appropriate mpc raise bank rate gradually run portfolio asset manner consistent maintain orderly markets. just one plan present degree monetary stimulus persist indefinitely, bank expect current extraordinary liquidity support continue ever. in due course, strategy need exit temporary support, extensive bank guarantees, permanent regime liquidity insurance bank announce last year. the bank england talk bank manage transition. a emerge recession, fiscal policy change. in take extraordinary measure stabilise bank wide economy, past build-up debt transfer private public sector. and right use temporary fiscal stimulus counter depth downturn experience last year. but five year national debt, proportion national income, expect double level crisis. so also necessary produce clear plan show prospective deficit reduce next parliament, return gradually decline path ratio national debt national income. we must learn lesson event past two years. they cannot final conclusion present crisis way run. but two stand out. first, price stability guarantee stability economy whole. second, instrument use pursue financial stability need sharpen refining. set bank rate maintain price stability successful itself, prevent recession induce financial crisis. but let’s throw baby bathwater. the period prior crisis stable economic environment generations. and, unlike previous recessions, crisis wasn’t precede unsustainable boom output. in five year lead crisis, overall gdp growth remain close long-run average inflation differ 2% target average 0.2 percentage 2 bi review 76/2009 points. divert monetary policy goal price stability risk make economy le stable financial system so. to argue monetary policy direct counter inadequately price risk argue unemployment price worth pay tame bank system. inflation target necessary sufficient condition stability economy whole. when policy necessary sufficient, answer abandon, augment, it. indeed, overarch lesson crisis authority lack sufficient policy instrument take effective actions. nowhere evident deal northern rock absence proper resolution powers. for domestic institution particular issue settle bank act 2009, new resolution power successfully deploy bank deal dunfermline build society march. what power required? there broad consensus traditional policy instrument need augment “macro-prudential” toolkit. but “macro-prudential” instrument for? be increase resilience individual banks, protect economy banks? the former imply sensible extension current regime capital requirement individual institutions. the latter go heart problem cause financial sector whole rest economy. we need reflect deeply nature failure design regulatory response – many financial market continue function well. but bank enter crisis historically low level liquid assets, inadequate level capital absorb losses. moreover, unite kingdom, financial sector become big highly leveraged. first, size bank system was, proportion gdp, five time unite states, risk uk taxpayer correspondingly greater. second, process reduce high leverage great damage rest economy. and require adjustment still long way run – large bank unite kingdom manage reduce leverage ratio 2008, remain historically high levels. third, interconnection institution create potential fragility across system, saw last september. fourth, risk associate large-scale proprietary trade probably hard control limit liability companies. so need instrument prevent size, leverage, fragility risk financial system become great. the result “macro-prudential” toolkit contain number instrument reduce risk, across system time. it must put together hurry. and i share concern many long way identify precise regulatory intervention would improve function markets. a far individual bank concerned, face uncomfortable choice structure regulation bank sector. if bank think big fail, then, word distinguish american economist, big. it sensible allow large bank combine high street retail bank risky investment bank fund strategies, provide implicit state guarantee failure. something must give. either guarantee retail depositor limit bank make narrow range investments, bank pose great risk taxpayer economy event failure face high capital requirements, must develop resolution power large complex financial institution wind orderly manner. or, perhaps, element three. privately own manage institution big fail sit oddly market economy. one important practical step would require regulate bank produce plan orderly wind activities. that would provide information authority absence make past decision future institution difficult. make much part good housekeep bank rest us. and would sensible various authority work across national boundary identify detail plan large cross-border financial institution could wind down. bi review 76/2009 3 the bank england new statutory responsibility financial stability. bank rate instrument deploy achieve monetary stability, use exclusively purpose. to achieve financial stability power bank limit voice new resolution powers. the bank find position rather like church whose congregation attend wed burial ignore sermon between. like church, cannot promise bad thing won’t happen flock – prevention financial crisis neither anyone else’s power, study history human nature would reveal. and experience suggest attempt encourage good life power voice enough. warn unlikely effective people ask change behaviour seem highly profitable. so entirely clear bank able discharge new statutory responsibility issue sermon organise burials. whatever ultimate shape structure regulation bank system – and, many said, need think carefully get right – change necessary. the cost crisis measure simply term impact public finances, destruction wealth, number job lost. they also see lose trust financial sector among part economy. for generation more, business family country told, least city, discipline market economy essential, even painful short run, great prosperity long term. that belief merit market economy embrace many year misplaced. but blue – case financial sector – come crisis stem weakness real economy. it wreak havoc business families. unemployment, saw today’s figures, rise sharply. and yet bank system receive financial support almost unimaginable scale. we work financial sector much regain trust work outside it. “my word bond” old words, important. “my word cdo-squared” never catch on. there support country, case, excessively bureaucratic regulation. but change structure, regulation indeed culture bank system necessary. blame individual substitute acknowledge failure system, certain type banking. we real opportunity put right, regain trust lost. lord mayor, prepare toast banker merchant city london, remember city bank bank much trade complex securities. so u tonight would like pay tribute work since become lord mayor, support effort promote financial literacy, thank lady mayoress splendid hospitality extend u evening. so i invite rise join traditional toast good health prosperity "the lord mayor lady mayoress", ian lin luder. 4 bi review 76/2009 josé de gregorio: global confidence crisis – value wait coordination failure revisit keynote speech mr josé de gregorio, governor central bank chile, open post-graduate program school economics business administration universidad de chile, santiago, 4 june 2009. i wish thank pablo garcía enrique orellana helpful contribution comments. * * * “when, today, unknown unknown dominate, economic environment complex appear nearly incomprehensible, result extreme prudence, outright paralysis, part investors, consumer firms. and behaviour, turn, fee crisis.” (blanchard, 2009). i want begin thank invite open academic year post-graduate program school economics business administration universidad de chile. most presentation audience primarily interest learn bank’s view economy, lecture tend focus largely national international juncture prospects. on occasion, i take advantage academic set bring u together, freedom i give choose subject, refer central aspect current global crisis, namely confidence crisis, focus key concept help u understand go global economic juncture. the natural question is: ingredient lead financial event mid-september last year end way did? the develop world enter severe recession, output drop simultaneously countries. the crisis spread around world like virus, unprecedented and, course, unforeseen strength speed, make distinction among economies’ strength weakness (figure 1). what happened? why differentiation? how could massive contagion occur? why synchrony? all important question understand crisis transmit make through. if one thing difficult explain intensity impact. in chile, neither path domestic economic cycle experience analysis traditional transmission channel external crisis – is, financial commercial channel – capable fully explain happen (de gregorio, 2009). the hypothesis seem grind moment deterioration global confidence, understand worsen expectation increase uncertainty around world, amplify response initial impact, push u acute synchronize crisis could envision first. it help study historical relationship among data cycle pattern tend repeat regular basis. but current crisis, precedent many decades, look simple correlation base normal period misleading. from standpoint, important conceptualize happen today, order analyze prospect economy draw policy conclusions. to address subject i use basic economics allow u understand synchrony severity current crisis. these argument present many year profession gain enormous importance today. the first refer existence multiple equilibrium effect fail coordination. the second deal effect uncertainty economic decision making. these two element help u understand confidence crisis sweep world aggravate output contraction, hit hard demand industrial goods. in next section i describe main bi review 76/2009 1 idea clarify impact confidence crisis, analyze international scenario follow section. some basic idea the objective account basic idea behind coordination failures, multiple equilibrium uncertainty affect aggregate demand. coordination failure let u assume simple economy1 large number consumers. each consumer demand d unit manufacture good, think durable good (e.g., car, house, appliance, electronic device). we also think durable good demand firm invest (e.g., machinery equipment, warehouses, plants). the demand consumer firm function expectation future income, directly relate expect value aggregate output economy. y denote level output ey future expect value. we also assume demand depend level uncertainty call σ i discus later. for now, enough consider demand fall uncertainty grows. thus, demand good represent d(ey,σ). firms, example, produce demand them.2 normalize population firm consumer 1, equilibrium occur demand equal supply (y=d). in equilibrium rational expectations, product must equal expect product, or: y=d(y,σ) now, couple assumption find equilibrium (figure 2). the equilibrium unique a. for this, demand assume concave, is, additional demand good small income increases. to ensure unique equilibrium assume that, ey=0, demand good positive. this understand individual another source income expenses, always want devote part income consume good. another simple way see think individual want borrow acquire good, even income low, presumably always expect fund available future repay. a see, however, possible multiple equilibrium exist, low high output, result coordination failures. uncertainty value wait decision make uncertainty always complex thing study. often simplify, turn quadratic specification order use certainty equivalence. surely 1 this exercise base mit class exercise which, despite save note number inquiry friends, i unable find. the original model somewhat complex assume strategic interaction among firms, demand take given. more formal model develop cooper john (1988). for thorough review literature, see cooper (1999). 2 note illustration, many aspect leave analysis. in case assume friction price-setting mechanism prevent firm sell want give price. this friction may come firm decide much produce know demand, would lead u incorporate producers’ decision story. analytically, however, would change much. 2 bi review 76/2009 fall short describe much complex reality; example, analysis consider decision invest consume (durables) presence irreversibilities.3 when decision irreversible, chance back out; example, investment make secondary market exist liquidate it. the purchase durable good another case. we know, however, general always way get rid good, part cost impossible recover – sink cost. a firm build plant, instance, get rid firm resell cost specific feature prospective buyer appreciate. in environment certainty, expense incur whenever benefit outweigh costs. therefore, choice spend spending. but uncertainty irreversibility, choice long spend spending, rather spending, spending, waiting. this option value, time go by, uncertainty fades. thus, uncertain choice is, profitable wait. imagine case firm invest. such investment consist enlarge facility purchase new capital goods. if thing go right, investment profitable. if thing go wrong, benefit invest low, present value project negative. hence, firm know thing go go wrong, would prefer invest. if pass time help know certainty whether thing go right wrong, firm may find convenient wait see. wait permit keep choice invest invest open, case investment already made. thus investment analyze theory options. the firm must balance cost postpone investment benefit learn situation make good inform decision. then, large uncertainty, great benefit waiting. this logic apply consumer must decide purchase durable good, uncertain future income. if probability lose job increases, may advisable wait make decision. although analysis simple intuitively, easy formalize. a consumer sell car electronic device lose income, cost. the high cost, irreversible decision becomes.4this idea permit u explain decision wait see optimal permit u justify demand, d, depend negatively uncertainty, σ. the increase uncertainty fall demand what critical analysis important quantitative point view. the decision marginal. an increase uncertainty result “some” decrease spending. an uncertainty shock common lead every firm every consumer paralyze spending, cause collapse demand. the main point fall sharp one even one possible equilibrium (figure 3). this could case household decide increase save significantly, low-income family would rather spend durable goods. the could true firm decide invest. thus, household firm would delay 3 for case irreversible investment, dixit pindyck (1994) provide thorough analysis. a simple example present de gregorio (2007), chapter 4. 4 implication like one describe infer precautionary save theory. in order avoid cost lose utility extreme negative events, consumer choose keep buffer-stock savings. if uncertainty aggravates, example increase dispersion future earnings, precautionary save probably increase, do postpone consumption decisions. bi review 76/2009 3 decision spend durable goods, await uncertainty clear up. households, however, would continue spend non-durables. actually, share good like foodstuff total consumption basket would increase. durable investment goods, meanwhile, one subject wait see strategy and, nature, purchase postponed. thus, two possible equilibria: b c, output original level a. furthermore, think case c loss confidence big, magnify fall demand may result cyclical adjustment. in case pessimism dominates. everyone think economic activity fall due increase uncertainty exactly happens, pessimism justified. this point general: face multiple equilibria, private expectation coordinate economy converge one other? evidently natural mechanism, fail coordination easily lead economy settle bad equilibrium. the exercise i present pretty simple surely overlook many relevant aspects, especially dynamic might allow u analyze loss confidence. it still helpful explain increase uncertainty trigger deterioration output financial crisis deepen fall output, whose effect substantial. let proceed, then, show happen world chile observe increase uncertainty agents’ expectation propagation around globe. the global crisis confidence i start list main aspect i focus on: • the synchrony crisis unprecedented. the drop output make distinction among economies’ strength weaknesses. • global uncertainty distrust particularly acute towards end last year. • the severe drop demand concentrate largely durable goods. investment consumption product collapse end 2008. to contextualize episode, i begin recall debate accumulation strong global imbalance go several years, focus implication way correct them. the central bank chile identify significant risk many monetary policy reports. meanwhile, world proceed unusual dynamism. world gdp grow annual average nearly 5 percent 2004 2007, commodity price increase manifold. copper, instance, go sell us$1.00 per pound late 2003 approach even briefly surpass $4.00 april july 2008. oil go trade around 30 35 dollar per barrel late 2003 close 150 dollar last july. meanwhile, unite states, subprime mortgage crisis already erupt mid 2007, march 2008 important financial institution, bear stearns, collapsed. an important point preamble fact september 2008 string event i mention significant effect economic expectations, change mean expect growth increase uncertainty. this, despite fact bear stearns bankruptcy significant occurrence international financial market. actually, volatility stock market go ring mid-2007, pretty mild compare september 2008 (figure 4). this stock volatility index (vix), normally use 4 bi review 76/2009 good indicator uncertainty,5 show increase several time peak crisis september october last year. the late figure show uncertainty declining, although remain high. thus, accord market consensus, world growth 2008-2009 post significant change march september 2008 (figure 5). the situation chile differ much (figure 6). during whole 2007, growth projection 2008 fluctuate around 5 percent, even eruption house crisis unite states. at time bear stearns’ bankruptcy adjustment expect growth year, september even slight correction upwards. the bank’s forecast similar. the growth projection 2009 different; actually large part correction do december 2008. in sum, since september significant correction apply expect value growth. in addition small forecast future earnings, increase relate uncertainty (figure 7). in unite states, early 2008, width distribution growth projection 2009 2 percentage points. in early 2009, width increase 2.3 percentage point and, may, least data first quarter year available, width 3.3 percentage points. in chile, gdp projection take economic expectation survey depict similar picture, is, level uncertainty among forecast growth increasing, despite fact that, year pass new data added, projection good also small degree uncertainty. what begin happen september 2008 change dramatically economic scenario around world, chile included? a i say before, simple observation traditional transmission channel external crisis cannot explain events. on one hand, financial condition tighten significantly worldwide. the domestic financial system also suffered, although without episode might compromise solvency. however, possibility reduce access external funds, plus increase global risk, put pressure internal financial conditions, cause significant increase interest rate lend standards. at time, future earn become uncertain, household firm significantly reduce demand new credit, reveal bank credit survey central bank conduct quarterly basis. overall, tighten financial condition severe hind banks’ access external credit proper function domestically. this possible also set measure adopt central bank ministry finance ensure proper function financial system. nonetheless, due high uncertainty, sensation world economy might enter significant depression huge loss wealth trigger unprecedented erosion global confidence. growth forecast begin adjust great speed. undoubtedly hit behavior household firm hard around world, stop spend plans, put hold indefinitely. consumers’ entrepreneurs’ expectation indicator show profound weaken last quarter 2008 (figure 8). a look durable good consumption indicator reveal steep fall sale level (figure 9). all take back previous point presentation. the dramatic increase uncertainty begin september last year alter people’s behavior substantially, lead abrupt sudden paralysis demand durable goods. 5 bloom (2009) present evidence use indicator help understand u economic cycle, precisely firm temporarily put decision hold regard investment new hirings. bi review 76/2009 5 at world level, situation wasn’t different. expectation individual firm suffer severe decline (figure 10). stock price around world drop dramatically, reflect worsen expectation (figure 11). the price commodity also fell reduction demand expect future. the exception gold, commonly use store value time perceive risk increase (figure 12). the drop demand particularly steep manufacture sector. this explain severity correction growth forecast country export manufacture product japan germany recently industrialize asian economies, among others. these country expect experience average fall gdp around 5 percent year. the main effect reduction world demand chilean economy drop price exports, many countries. this pull term trade debilitate national income prospects. however, i say number time before, impact reduce demand mild country export natural resource relate goods, like chile. hence drop export country sell raw material world relatively small effect output. their demand dropped, prices, experience collapse associate postpone expenditure good industrial origin. although sell tougher, export volume adjust le world average, expect fall around 10 percent year, baseline scenario late monetary policy report foresee volume chilean export drop around 2 percent annually period. this one factor explain mild impact crisis latin america. this crisis particularly harsh industrialize economies, see steep fall demand product due great fall demand durable investment good (figure 13). final remark expansionary macroeconomic fiscal policy help boost economic activity face deep drop demand. however, effect confidence obvious. thus, essential measure take sustainable credible. if lack credibility, expansionary effect constrain lack confidence. furthermore, conceivable presence deep macroeconomic weakness expansionary policy might exacerbate loss confidence. this explain many country need raise interest rate make fiscal adjustment midst economic crisis, economic policy financial system lack credibility. this obviously case chile today. in country, extraordinary fiscal monetary stimulus effective, effort sustainable credible. this visible also, different degrees, economy region commit foreign exchange flexibility, price stability, fiscal responsibility financial soundness. develop economy need correctly address medium-term effect monetary expansion increase public debt. if origin global loss confidence financial crisis, stabilize bank industry restore payment system priority necessary condition economic recovery. hence importance develop country place stabilize financial system, timidly begin bear fruit. no simple rapid prescription exist rebuild confidence lost. some think convey optimism good idea. however, optimism ground, lack sense reality communicated. on hand, send pessimistic message erode confidence even further. if one thing know, economics every walk life, people cannot fool forever, way act realistically. 6 bi review 76/2009 we endure world recession, nobody disagree current hardship world economy faces, discussion shift see first sign recovery. the scenario global economic financial catastrophe dissipated, confidence seem recovering. one piece evidence “free fall” world economy may stop evolution growth projection year (figure 14). after sharp deterioration post-september 2008, downward revision growth expect year moderate magnitude significantly economic zones. in japan, suffer one intense revision past months, late forecast revise upwards expect growth 2009. gdp growth 2010, post small systematic fall since september, show stability late forecasts. combine this, perception regard investors’ appetite risk seem pick up. sovereign premium declined, capital flow emerge economy returning, interest rate treasury bond increase many economy various expectation indicator signal degree recover confidence. extreme pessimism withdrawing, cannot expect accelerate recovery. the confidence crisis one piece – important one – explanation synchrony strength shock occur end last year. however, distortion motivate confidence crisis persistent effects, even confidence fully recovered. the loss confidence explain sharp sudden downfall global economy, well propagation countries. however, origin crisis loss confidence, rather trace back year financial excess take time resolve.6 the big and, light know today, unreasonable private overborrowing many develop country corrected, lead significant de-leveraging mostly households. they raise save rate hold back growth consumption demand. the country grow fast base credit boom adjust. we cannot expect world economy go back pre-crisis growth rates. these normal stage business cycle, magnitude imbalance form country experience financial crisis indicate recovery slower. this downturn economic cycle combine financial crisis, cost magnified. this understand even quantify use consumption theories, save future opportunity. thank much. reference blanchard, o.

[in euro area, disinflation could result 3.5-point year-on-year increase purchase power 2009; rise unemployment could reach two points.] secondly, automatic stabiliser strong effect euro area, thank unemployment benefit broad tax base. they are, construction, temporary, appropriate targeted, guarantee countercyclical impact. thirdly, large-scale stimulus package adopt shall implement 2009 2010. in euro area, equivalent 1.7% gdp expected, accord imf, contribute raise growth 0.9 point 2009 0.3 point 2010. fourthly, governments’ strong commitment guarantee solvency bank prevent risk credit crunch. in france, two structure set up, société de financement de l’économie française (sfef) société de prise de participation de bi review 75/2009 1 l’etat (sppe), give government considerable room manoeuvre recapitalise bank sector ensure financing, thereby economy. last, least, 325-basis-point decline ecb’s refinance rate since july 2008 unprecedented, term size speed. in environment characterise fix rates, effect decrease shall spread progressively, rate new loan already falling, line cut policy rates. in addition, ecb embark quantitative ease policy aim banks, which, contrast unite states, provide 80% finance economy. since october 2008, ecb provide unlimited liquidity ease collateral rule refinance operation. at may meeting, govern council decide extend maturity provision liquidity one year purchase euro-denominated cover bond issue euro area. a result, 1-year interbank market converge level u 1-year market rate. what type financial regulation framework move towards? the current crisis highlight certain failure financial regulation why, beyond immediate measure i described, ambitious agenda reform financial regulation launched. this overhaul crucial lay foundation stable financial system. it implement hasty manner want avoid hurt recovery crisis. the g20 lay clear principle guide overhaul financial regulation. they mainly cover three areas: strengthen prudential standards, redefinition scope regulation revision account standards. before bring three dimensions, i would like point g20 action plan impose requirement stakeholder concern financial stability: good ass risk face financial system whole? on point, agree systemic risk the risk need take good account of. we able identify it, control it, capture prudential terms. in many respects, systemic risk result liquidity risk, leverage, compound financial innovation high transformation risks. these factor easy measure level individual banks. they even le level financial system whole. this nevertheless challenge face today. let come back g20 action plan. this plan first recognise need strengthen prudential regulation three areas. capital requirement need strengthen make counter-cyclical introduce system capital buffers. the quality capital enhance definition harmonised. we also may need add range instrument currently available simple mechanism measure leverage order complement information provide solvency ratio. another lesson g20 learn crisis current scope regulation supervision inappropriate narrow. the current framework base implicit idea bank alone – collect deposit – source risk system whole. this use case. yet, long true all. it evident systemically important institution market need regulated. in concrete terms, g20 widen scope regulation include rat agencies, hedge fund derivative markets. the general principle abandon silo approach regulation, structure around institutions' legal character (e.g. banks, insurance companies, etc.), move type regulation base role perform different player stability system (liquidity provision, deposit-taking, market making, etc). lastly, g20 set road map improve account standards. agreement point broad previous ones. the member g20 sometimes divergent view role account rules. in particular, one controversial 2 bi review 75/2009 point relate mark-to-market scope application fair value accounting. nonetheless, i observe g20, ask account standard setter take great account financial stability constraints, implicitly acknowledge impact account choice latter neutral. in event, country agree three objectives: reduce complexity account standards, increase harmonisation standard internationally introduce forward-looking system provisioning. the discussion g20 summit find strong echo europe. in fact, exaggeration say european drive force international project i described. in regional terms, report high level group chair jacques de larosière cornerstone new financial regulation supervision emerge europe crisis. these recommendation appear highly relevant me. they reconcile efficiency pragmatism. whether concern develop european system financial supervision set systemic risk council auspex ecb escb, idea truly conducive greatly strengthen surveillance risk individual institution level european financial system whole. the reform i describe make possible incentive financial system player compatible stability system. the crisis highlight two type incompatibility, least divergence need corrected. first, within financial industry itself. financial innovation development business model financial intermediary weaken credit discipline favour strict return-oriented discipline. regulator work correct regulatory source incentives, dangerous financial stability. i think notably work aim reduce regulatory arbitrage counter short-termism encourage certain prudential account provisions. second, need reconverge incentive private- public-sector players. their divergence natural phenomenon period economic financial boom. in periods, regulator supervisor find hard limit risk-taking risk financial stability unclear competition fierce. maximise profit competition consideration stand way prudence prevention financial imbalances. counter force require particular implementation independent macro-prudential policy. this one main thrust reform propose jacques de larosière. how strengthen financial stability international level? the overall reform agenda i outline would complete without component concern strengthen international financial architecture. let conclude speech point. this strengthen currently two visible faces: imf financial stability board. the imf become one key actor new international architecture. it tasked, together financial stability board, monitor implementation g20 agreement financial regulation. it also central role play multilateral surveillance financial risks: since late april, conduct early warn exercise financial macroeconomic risk jointly financial stability board; also extend analysis resilience domestic financial sector part financial system assessment program (fsap) include systemically important countries. indeed, one notable outcome g20 member country undertake accept assessment peers, including, first time, unite states. this broaden fund's role support treble resources, increase lend capacity usd 750 billion. in addition, instrument disposal reviewed, notably creation new credit line facility aim bi review 75/2009 3 country prove track record design avoid stigma often associate imf's interventions. the financial stability board face new international financial architecture. a know, new name former financial stability forum. in fact, much change name. the forum become fully-fledged international body. it gain firepower thank reinforce permanent administrative structure. it also gain greatly legitimacy thank broaden membership g20 countries. moreover, acquire new power position supervisor international standard setters. lastly, strengthen key role supervision financial stability full participation exercise identify vulnerability develop imf. let stop here. thank lady gentlemen. 4 bi review 75/2009 bi review 75/2009 1 shyamala gopinath: address regulatory perimeter issue – indian experience remark m shyamala gopinath, deputy governor reserve bank india, ninth annual international seminar policy challenge financial sector, co-hosted the board governor federal reserve system, the imf, the world bank “emerging crisis – build strong international financial system”, washington dc, 3-5 june 2009. * * * the regulatory perimeter boundary issue engage attention policy maker internationally quite time central issue associate current crisis. paradoxically origin well severity impact crisis concentrate heavily regulate institutions. however, view, real issue lay recognize address dynamic inter-connectedness entity across regulated, unregulated lightly regulate domain perpetuate high leverage. it systemic crisis attribute single component system would incomplete assessment. borrow field natural ecosystems, sustainability complex flow system depend optimal balance efficiency resilience network. while financial system consider efficient, inherent element ensure resilience obviously inadequate. at heart self-feeding financial ecosystem entity access liquidity, banks, act fulcrum around system moved. it therefore surprise system collapse fulcrum become vulnerable. the peripheral entities, though, much integral part system need recognize such. the basic premise i elaborate upon remark today far systemic stability concerned, important focus interconnect linkage amongst major entity within system, whether regulate unregulated. extend regulatory boundary valid issue examine sake, address specific contextual concerns. but decide perimeter, extremely important framework hardwiring perimeter. this important regulation create incentive certain activity move beyond boundary. one issue focus extend perimeter, apart issue clearly enunciate literature, relate heterogeneity regulatory focus across various segments. the boundary vary different regulatory cluster – focus bank regulator would entirely different security regulator, insurance regulator etc. may different focus require regulation markets. if entire financial system look single ecosystem, inspite inherent difference various market players, possible identify macro driver whole system, network flows. use perspective, become evident focus perimeter would miss integral component may need regulatory attention. current crisis – perimeter issue a mention earlier, origin current crisis lay within heavily regulate institutions. the impact crisis, however, exacerbate dynamic interconnectedness entity across regulated, unregulated lightly regulate 2 bi review 75/2009 sectors. a recent report point out, two concern relate “outside perimeter” entity contribute current crisis were: (i) maturity transformation undertake entities, traditionally use function banks; (ii) systemic leverage result hugely leverage position entities, either direct borrow bank fund markets. the central issue interaction unregulated entity formal regulate fund channels, essentially bank money markets. the maturity transformation primarily entail heavy reliance entity short term fund fund long term assets. the prudential framework bank place significant reliance management alm mismatch unregulated entities, sivs didn’t oversight business model, run huge alm mismatches. the model break fund market start seizing. many entities, like hedge funds, consciously leave unregulated fact manage private capital pool issue investor protection relevant. however, appreciate systemic risk entity pose account huge leverage position carry either formal bank channel fund markets, particularly repo markets. the seamless efficiency think provide close integration underlie asset market repo market prove chimera. the disaggregated exposure regulate cluster point time unregulated entity available market collapsed, exposure become evident. another critical aspect bring forth crisis market behaviour impact entities, unregulated, huge trade book dynamically hedge huge portfolios. the market maker derivative structure product market need normally hedge portfolio risks, direct impact underlie markets. in normal times, individual action systemic impact. however, time crisis view become absolutely uni-dimensional, large number big player tend hit market side resultant impact underlie market huge. it could, thus, argue efficient market enable unregulated cluster acquire systemic proportion reinforce connectedness regulate cluster. the indian experience india unique regard formalize structure generic non bank finance sector heterogeneous sub-segments. there 13000 non bank finance company (nbfcs) whose asset comprise around one-tenth bank sector. the nbfcs india comprise heterogenous type financial institution include all-india financial institutions, development finance institutions, non bank finance companies, etc, one root particular stage development financial sector. all-india financial institution (aifis), development finance institution (dfis), largely offshoot development plan india, create long-term finance sectoral/regional focus. non-banking financial company (nbfcs), hand, mostly private sector institutions, carve niche indian financial system. the basic regulatory framework the indian financial system predominantly bank intermediate system accordingly regulation bank work basic systemic lever. the non-banking space comprise heterogeneous entity regulate rbi. broadly speaking, rbi regulate company take public deposit non-deposit take entity involve asset financing, provide loan investments. other non-banking bi review 75/2009 3 entity house finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, stock broking companies, merchant bank companies, venture capital fund etc. regulate respective sectoral regulator exempt nbfc regulations. regulation non-banking finance company india consider necessary far back sixty adjunct monetary credit policy country protection depositors' interest. the emphasis regulation protection interest depositor direction issue rbi deal acceptance deposit matter relate thereto. the unfettered growth deposit institution accept outside bank system ninety matter concern. further absence prudential norm ceilings, several non-bank finance company make poor investment choices, lead high level npas, liquidity crunch consequent significant default repayment deposits. therefore, regulatory action take include registration companies, statutory power give rbi rbi (amendment) act january 1997. the act provide registration nbfcs; nevertheless rbi focus mainly depositor protection put place stringent regulatory requirement entities. with growth financial system, gradually come realize even non-deposit take entities, mostly asset finance loan business, could pose systemic risk account interaction formal bank system market base financing. moreover, many entity lightly regulate segment essentially indulge regulatory arbitrage – permit bank happen channel. it therefore decide 2006 put place elaborate prudential framework identify entity systemic implications. a gradually calibrate regulatory framework create address issue systemic risk, include prudential capital requirements, exposure norms, liquidity management, asset liability management, creation entity profile report requirements, corporate governance disclosure norm non bank finance company define systemically important. it recognize early mere acceptance public deposit would capture systemic importance entity hence focus shift acceptance public fund form. so, entity access public funds, whether deposits, inter corporate deposits, debt instrument ncds cps, bank loans, consider interconnect entity hence treat source potential risk. the ultimate objective interconnectedness result transmission risk bank payment settlement system. in indian context, provide huge systemic advantage fact regulation key financial market – money market, government security market, forex market credit market – vest bank regulator i.e. rbi. thus channel interconnectedness bank financial sector entity beyond regulatory purview. from financial stability perspective, framework prove sound model. some specific provision illustrate effectiveness framework address inter-connected linkage briefly mention below: • prudential limit bank exposure (funded non-funded) non-bank finance company – individual well aggregate; • restriction bank finance non-bank finance company collateral share on-lending capital market intermediaries; • prudential limit bank exposure equity market include exposure capital market intermediary brokers; • prudential regulation inter-bank exposure bank reduce systemic risk; 4 bi review 75/2009 • participation overnight unsecured money market limit bank primary dealers; • lending/borrowing non-banks overnight market allow repos collateral government bonds; • securitisation guideline issue bank 2006 provide for, inter alia, credit enhancement deduct capital, profit/premium sale amortise life security issued, liquidity support attract 100 per cent risk weight. address inter-connectedness – pipeline issue the security firms/investment bank regulate security regulator, security exchange board india (sebi) regulation primarily focus transparency discipline market practices. a entity normally fund base business would require prudential regulation, decision take entity register sebi need normally register rbi. while entity form part separate regulatory cluster, inter-linkages regulate cluster unregulated entity may need examine particularly entity also undertake fund base business. therefore constant evaluation require function institution different regulator address regulatory gaps. while mutual fund regulate investor protection angle security regulator, systemic implication inert-linkages become apparent post-lehman scenario severe risk aversion liquidity crunch. rbi announce special 14 day repo notify amount rs.20,000 crore enable bank meet liquidity requirement mutual funds. the real issue reliance money market mutual fund short term fund place large corporates bank redemption facility par current account banks. it decide jointly work security regulator identify address macro-prudential concern arise current framework. private equity/venture capital activity regulate activity per se. however, issue bank involvement fund come focus recently india. the g30 recommend large systemically important bank institution restrict undertake proprietary activity present high risk serious conflict interest. sponsorship management co-mingled private pool capital ordinarily prohibit large proprietary trade limit strict capital liquidity requirements. keep view reputational risk involve activities, reserve bank mandate maintenance certain level economic capital case approve recent past. importantly, exposure bank venture capital fund treat capital market exposure count regulatory limit. a revise regulatory framework – key consideration the broad feature possible framework capture inter-linkages outline below. (i) specification nature connectedness entity may consider induce vulnerability system; (ii) identification, haze unregulated cluster, class entity consider either significant direct connectedness regulate cluster significant presence market segment regulate entity also present; bi review 75/2009 5 (iii) put place report system capture interconnect flow within identify sub-system – regulate cluster unregulated entity regular basis; (iv) prescription prudential framework – key – regulate cluster contain risk arise connectedness. (v) for unregulated entities, significant aspect would contain leverage capability general across major market segments, particularly fund markets. a simple quantitative limit would best suited. (vi) some systemically significant entities, though, may still need formal prudential regulatory structure, include capital adequacy requirement. from policy perspective, critical point would last two – effective regulation regulate entities, restrain leverage capability unregulated/lightly regulate entities. in case, prove effective combination since banks’ exposure entity could regulate absolute exposure norm even tweak risk weight applicable exposures. i realize problem would much involve predominantly market base financial system direct bank linkage obvious. but even regimes, clearly demonstrated, indirect linkage bank enmesh maze. that would important ensure market provide leverage capability entity beyond limit. contingency liquidity provision the recent crisis bring fore role lender last resort (lolr), extent central bank intervention entity intervention extended. the question circumstance extent safety net extend non-deposit take institution widely debated. the basic underpin lolr philosophy internationally institution whose failure conclusively decide cause broad systemic instability need support interregnum. a long bank institution fulfil criterion, case straightforward. however, development global financial market growth non-banks alternate medium financial intermediation, decision simple recent experience clearly shown. in india, provision reserve bank india lend directly non-bank entities, except specify ones, specific instance workable arrangement devise interest broad stability provide liquidity support institutions/sectors indirectly. in respect non-banking finance companies, post-lehman fallout severe systemic liquidity crunch even non-banking finance sector stressed. it apprehend scenario asymmetrical information general risk aversion banks, strain non-banking finance sector could eventually pose systemic risk. it decide provide liquidity systemically important nbfcs face temporary liquidity mismatch spv. the key part liquidity provide spv rbi purchase fully government guarantee bonds. further, facility mean tide temporary liquidity mismatch balance sheet expansion. the aggregate quantum facility around rs. 200 billion (usd 4 billion) interest rate lolr rate banks. similarly case mutual funds, face severe redemption pressures, decide facility lend bank 14-day repo enable bank meet temporary liquidity need mutual funds. 6 bi review 75/2009 a regard protection depositor interests, comprehensive prudential framework already place deposit take companies. stringent capital adequacy leverage requirements, exposure norms, disclosure prescribe part structure regulatory framework. statutorily, company require invest least 10 per cent outstanding deposit unencumbered government bonds. further, nbfcs ensure time full cover public deposit maintain them. all company accepting/ hold public deposit require create float charge statutory liquid asset favour depositor mechanism “trust deed”. conclusion the issue extend regulatory perimeter balance act need carefully nuanced term intend objectives. the thrust regulation may need bear regulate cluster – particularly deposit take institutions. however, unregulated cluster, key issue would contain ability systemic leverage – directly bank indirectly fund market subject effective report arrangement inter-linkages regulate clusters. from systemic stability perspective, would equally, more, important focus interconnectedness regulate unregulated/lightly regulate entities. gertrude tumpel-gugerell: monetary policy challenge light current financial market development speech m gertrude tumpel-gugerell, member executive board european central bank, alpbach talks, vienna, 15 june 2009. * * * introduction ten year ago, 1 january 1999, euro introduce common currency 11 member state european union. today, euro use around 330 million citizen 16 country establish stable currency, accept financial market worldwide. look inflation performance first decade monetary union inflation average slightly 2% period, ecb fulfil mandate maastricht treaty, maintain price stability euro area whole. nonetheless, undoubtfully, currently face big challenge far: the world hit severe economic financial downturn, deep since begin great depression 1929. it pose grave challenge financial industry central bank community, well supervisory regulatory authority national government citizen large. the key challenge arise current financial market turbulence since august 2007 global financial market experience extensive corrective realignments. the repercussion turbulence initially visible financial market form dramatic increase risk premia increase volatility interest rate movements. the outbreak financial market turbulence entirely unexpected, however. both ecb institution warn macroeconomic imbalance systematic undervaluation risk year lead crisis. those year characterise extend period low interest rates, low inflation sustain economic growth, globally within euro area. at time, liquidity abundant default risk consider many low. this environment strengthen investors’ risk appetite. in particular, financial market participant expect environment continue quite time, risk systematically underestimate search ever high yield intensified. a result, commercial bank readily grant credit house purchase household otherwise could afford it, without adequately assess creditworthiness credit default risk. at time, attempt achieve high yields, number innovative increasingly complex financial product offered, particularly unite states. one prominent example bundle mortgage new highly complex financial product resale new security third party via global financial markets. it eventually become evident practice viable long house price unite state continue increase. when many year increase house price come end house price start fall, problem soon emerged, include euro area, bank among buyer securities. investor suddenly begin doubt quality assets. this lead sharp correction price financial markets, accompany withdrawal fund markets, lead correspond liquidity shortage banks, particularly money market. bi review 75/2009 1 response crisis from begin crisis, ecb act decisive manner. it take number measure unprecedented nature, scope timing. the ecb provide large amount liquidity support banks. by make change operational framework, ecb make sure solvent bank would sufficient access funding. when crisis intensify september last year, introduce number new measures. most importantly, provide bank unlimited access liquidity fix rate six months. the ecb also expand list asset eligible use collateral eurosystem’s credit operations. moreover, recently announce measures, namely provide long term refinance one year purchase cover bond eur 60 bn. a result new measures, size eurosystem’s balance sheet expand substantial eur 600 billion stand 16% gdp, compare 10% mid-2007. the measure take ecb ease banks’ balance sheet constraint thereby certainly help avoid sudden collapse supply credit emergence systemic crisis. moreover, line substantial weaken global demand economic activity, inflationary pressure risk diminishing. a result, ecb’s policy rate cut 3.25 percentage point since intensification crisis last october. these rate reductions, together liquidity management measures, significant impact money market interest rates. since last october overnight money market rate fall even steeply ecb’s policy rates. money market rate euro area reach low level international standards. low money market rate also lead low interest rate private household firms, although decline money market rate far great decline interest rate credit household firms. the fiscal authority euro area also demonstrate capacity react rapidly exceptional circumstances. in coordinate effort, national government euro area provide support bank system, notably recapitalisation guarantee liability assets. the fund provide package announce stabilise financial sector type measure amount 23% euro area’s gdp. the overall fiscal stimulus – discretionary policy measure effect automatic stabiliser – amount 3.6 percentage point gdp 2009 2010. overall, ongoing financial market turbulence, euro area eu whole prove capacity act decisively promptly difficult circumstances. lesson crisis the current financial crisis point number weakness need address avoid similar crisis future. some weakness root current design international financial system. this particularly true regard lack transparency accountability within financial system. in respect, much rely financial player take responsibility evaluate risk effectively increase transparency regard risk. in addition, various initiative national, european international level aim, particular, improve robustness financial system i would like highlight three area i think change necessary: need increase transparency, dampen pro-cyclicality improvement institutional design field financial supervision regulation. first, need undergo global regulatory supervisory repair. the basel committee already set milestone regard include publication principle sound liquidity risk management supervision current work strengthen 2 bi review 75/2009 basel ii capital framework. work also underway concern development measure mitigate pro-cyclicality stem regulatory frameworks, namely build buff good time withdraw le benign conditions. in context, let recall g20 leader approve recommendation fsb address procyclicality, implement end year. to aim, basel committee develop proposal countercyclical buff way promote provision cycle, aim come concrete proposal year-end. second, regulatory gap need closed. in respect, g20 leader endorse last april extension regulatory net systemically important institutions, market instruments. these include systemically important hedge funds, credit rat agency over-the-counter (otc) derivative markets. with aim prevent regulatory arbitrage, imf together fsb, request develop, autumn, guideline ass systemic importance. and third, macro-prudential supervision strengthened. this include particular global monitor systemic stability supervision systemically important cross-border institutions, properly address interlinkages among themselves, financial non-financial institution markets. in context, i fully support broaden mandate strong institutional basis give financial stability board (fsb). the g20 leader call re-established fsb develop macro-prudential tools, together bank international settlement (bis), identify take account macro-prudential risk across financial system limit build systemic risk regulate entities. moreover, envisage cooperation imf fsb conduct early warn exercise crucial success global monitor systemic risks. at european level, proposal de larosière group establish european systemic risk council substantially improve assessment risk financial stability eu level. in order new council perform task optimal manner – view – three requirement must fulfilled. first, ecb must timely access relevant information, include information concern individual institutions. second, risk warn new council translate effective policy action. and third, new council independent effective decision-making, essential solid institutional legal basis. i also think current crisis hold lesson monetary policy. the crisis show u stable financial system prerequisite price stability. monetary policy-makers try mitigate risk build-up financial bubble aware effect policy decision financial system. therefore, one could argue asset price play great role monetary policy considerations. a build-up asset price bubble might severe economic consequence long term, central bank try deal bubble pre-emptively. nonetheless, interrelation financial stability go beyond pure consideration asset prices. analyse development borrow lending, particularly loan private sector, helpful extract relevant signal monetary development potential financial imbalances. consideration aspect must become extensive systematic future. strengthen ecb’s role financial supervision contribute ensure proper consideration give possible build-up financial imbalance make monetary policy decisions. the current crisis clearly demonstrate risk financial stability accompany risk price stability. central bank must give even great consideration risk analyses. bi review 75/2009 3 the benefit euro current crisis a mentioned, current crisis represent great challenge euro far. 2009 difficult year. accord recent macroeconomic projection ecb staff, publish june year, euro area economy expect contract 4.1% 5.1% 2009. this means, among things, few jobs, high unemployment, le investment le exports. that said, forget europe would look today without euro. in addition financial market turbulence, problem financial sector economic downturn, would face potentially large fluctuation europe’s national currencies. in fact, currency country outside euro area experience considerable fluctuation current crisis. this additional source uncertainty countries. therefore, turmoil confirm one clear advantage euro, namely that, stormy seas, good aboard large ship small boat. this seem also reflect fact many central eastern european country express wish join euro area quickly possible. this surprise, give many country already make progress towards adopt euro. nevertheless, country must first fulfil relevant criterion join euro area. still, i would like emphasise euro area close shop. five new country join since start monetary union january 1999, slovakia become new member euro area january year. the door open meet clearly state predefined criterion membership economic monetary union. conclusion joseph schumpeter coin expression creative destruction bring entrepreneurial innovation progress. schumpeter certainly mind economic financial crisis severity extent experience today. but concept schumpeter mind, current crisis also create window opportunity change reform. this window, however, remain open forever. therefore, act bring forward necessary reform international financial system strengthen supervisory architecture. the ecb stand ready take part macroprudential supervision. 4 bi review 75/2009 jean-claude trichet: the financial crisis response ecb speech mr jean-claude trichet, president european central bank, ceremony confer honorary title doctor honoris causa university national world economy, sofia, 12 june 2009. * * * lady gentlemen, it great privilege sofia today accept honorary doctorate distinguish university national world economy (unwe), bulgaria’s respect economics institute. to properly mark occasion, i would like talk global financial crisis roots, ecb’s response crisis. the global financial crisis root let start briefly highlight origin evolution current crisis. imagine neutral observer look financial sector decade ago didn’t look eve current financial crisis. he would find completely different financial industry, one past decade undergo dramatic shift focus. he would discover financial system move away traditional role support trade real investment. he would find financial system speculation financial gamble run rife. he would encounter system transform – system long manage genuine economic risk one actually create assume financial risk – risk result arbitrage intentional exposure asset price changes. that observer would realise financial liberalisation innovation make economy productive. the securitisation assets, example, great potential diversify economic risk manage efficiently. but also mean financial institution able sell loan take balance sheet, weaken lenders’ incentive conduct prudent screen constant monitor credit risk. so underwrite standard lend oversight declined, contribute excessive credit growth second half 1990s. in sum, observer would conclude factor fuel credit asset price boom past decade also create condition bust. in mid-2007 start see backlash. the start financial turmoil sudden unexpected. the financial system work past decade – flaw incentive overly complex product global imbalance macroeconomic backdrop – long sustainable. the asset cycle turned, weakness expose investor suddenly lose confidence. after year exceptional risk appetite high profits, pendulum swing opposite direction, market become extremely sensitive financial risk. in september last year, crisis escalate sharply, turn large-scale crisis confidence global financial panic. financial intermediary restore liquidity buffers, try economise capital scale balance sheets. they sell asset tighten lend conditions. bank financial institution drastically reduce exposure risk imprudently accumulate phase financial euphoria. financial intermediation loan company curtail wake forceful process “deleveraging”. bi review 74/2009 1 this point important spillover financial crisis set in. we saw almost immediate spillover financial sector real economy. the credit squeeze loss confidence start take toll real economy, negative feedback develop financial sector real economy, since become major feature economic financial developments. almost simultaneously, crisis originate advance economy spill emerge market economies. since fourth quarter 2008, virtually economy – industrialise country emerge market – face synchronise business cycle many part world. the ecb’s response financial crisis since start financial turmoil, central bank around globe face unprecedented challenges. we ecb central bank react swiftly, flexibly decisively. the ecb take lead exceptional decision early 9 august 2007. we have, since then, modify operational framework use exceptional set non-standard policy tools. these tools, combine bold action take euro area government recent months, play essential role prevent collapse financial system bolster confidence. i would like emphasise despite upheaval exceptional measures, objective remain unchanged: preserve price stability medium term, that’s guide policy. in doing, support condition financial economic stability. the crisis change objective. interest rate a regard interest rates, ecb’s govern council react promptly decisively intensification broaden global financial turbulence. we low key interest rate 325 basis point since october 2008. this large cut ever decide short period europe. these move fully line strategy. the upside risk price stability indeed recede considerably period due sharp fall oil commodity prices, abrupt slowdown economic activity. a price stability needle compass, take account ease inflationary pressure low interest rates. in context, i would like underline since introduction euro 1999, ecb’s quantitative definition price stability – inflation rate below, close to, 2% euro area, medium term – prove invaluable asset. it guard undesirably high inflation deflation. long-term inflation expectation euro area, whether base survey extract financial indicators, continue firmly anchor level consistent definition price stability. inflation expectation exceptionally resistant sudden upward short-term price changes, ensure also case sharply fall inflation. non-standard measure in addition reduce interest rates, take exceptional policy action response crisis – “non-standard” measure relate liquidity management. at start money market stress august 2007, ecb react within hour temporarily provide additional liquidity bank immediate liquidity needs. we fact first central bank take non-standard measures. when mid-september 2008 crisis intensify interbank trade come virtual halt, ecb engage new mode liquidity provision. we start provide refinance 2 bi review 74/2009 well level bank absorb fulfil reserve requirement normal times. our approach comprise three main “building blocks”. • we significantly adapt regular refinance operations. we follow “fixed rate full allotment” tender procedure significantly expand maturity operations. bank grant access essentially unlimited liquidity policy interest rate maturity of, initially, six months. this exceptional mode operation. in normal time auction give amount central bank credit let competition bidder determine interest rate. this unusual mode operation imply currently act surrogate market term liquidity allocation price-setting. • our second build block long list asset take collateral. this list already long crisis, extend even accept even wide range security collateral. • the first two build block offer unlimited refinance wide range collateral. but reach financial system couple third build block, namely large number counterparties always able take part refinance operations. even financial crisis, number high major central banks. follow change operational framework october last year, number rise further. all non-standard measure supplement exceptional step ecb’s govern council decide early may june year. • we conduct liquidity-providing longer-term refinance operation maturity 12 months. this lengthen maturity provide bank liquidity fix rate full allotment. this move consistent operation undertake since october 2008 recognise central role play bank system euro area economy. • the european investment bank (eib) become eligible counterparty eurosystem’s monetary policy operations. access eurosystem’s liquidity natural complement eib’s finance initiative facilitate accommodation eib additional demand lend programme. • furthermore, eurosystem purchase euro-denominated cover bond issue euro area €60 billion. these purchase target important segment private security market, particularly affect financial market turbulence. we outline specific modality implementation last week. our primary concern take decision recent month maintain availability credit household company accessible rates. i describe “enhanced credit support”. furthermore, flexible liquidity management ensure solvent bank get difficulty liquidity constraints. our response crisis carefully calibrate financial economic structure euro area. in particular, need bear mind euro area’s financial system predominantly bank-based. take structure private credit outstanding example: recourse bank make 70% non-equity external finance euro area. by comparison, u equivalent proportion around 30%. this reflect fact u financial system primarily market-based. in euro area, guarantee steady access credit household company largely mean preserve viability bank system. bank play dominant role economy appropriate focus non-standard measure bank sector. bi review 74/2009 3 conclusion to conclude, i would like call attention follow points. to start with, are, first time, put test soundness resilience globalise economy, become increasingly integrate past fifteen years. we draw, systematically without complacency, lesson global crisis fight against. secondly, duty. our duty considerably reinforce resilience global financial system soundness real global economy. we allow that, year now, new crisis would emerge would similar current one. that would unforgivable. thirdly, international community engage draw lesson crisis. we agree method, role g20, role financial stability board, role international financial institutions, particular crucial role international monetary fund, also bank international settlements, past year show remarkable lucidity analysis. a regard global financial sector, agree broad orientation follow: reduce procyclicality, fight short-termism, impose transparency. fourthly, still today difficult unpredictable environment. we permanently need remain alert, place complacency. i would two main message regard. a concern direct government support financial sector, today’s priority “rapidity execution.” decision already take implement swiftly. this hold true, particular, recapitalisation, currently 55% fund earmark recapitalisation use euro area. in crisis times, rapid implementation crucial. a concern global governance, i insist absolute necessity reinforce macroeconomic policy surveillance systematically important country economies. the imf play fundamental role monitoring, couple responsible active peer surveillance. finally, central bank fundamental role ensure monetary financial stability long-term perspective. the world economy count central bank continue act anchor stability, need ever. the european central bank, part, continue anchor stability confidence. thank attention. 4 bi review 74/2009 daniel k tarullo: large bank small bank era systemic risk regulation speech mr daniel k tarullo, member board governor u federal reserve system, north carolina banker association annual convention, chapel hill, north carolina, 15 june 2009. the original speech, contain various link document mentioned, find u federal reserve system’s website. * * * the financial crisis aftermath reveal fundamental problem risk management financial institution supervision government regulators. these shortcoming arise small part failure private public sector adjust far-reaching change financial market recent decades. there growing, though certainly unanimous, view supervision regulation must substantially orient toward contain systemic risk address associate problem pose institution consider too-big-to-fail. the public policy agenda thus rightly dominate time proposal legislative administrative measure direct systemic risk. in moment i offer view subject. even move era systemic risk regulation, however, important recognize change financial service industry affect every bank america, large small. while small bank likely see extensive supervisory change propose large financial institutions, must adapt risk-management practice new competitive economic conditions. only continue play distinctive role provide credit individual small businesses. the change financial service industry precede crisis, crisis itself, regulatory change follow together carry important consequence banks. it seem particularly appropriate address implication change north carolina, home institution range large small.1large bank if learn anything present crisis, systemic risk much build financial system. this situation outcome decades-long trend, traditional bank lending, trading, capital market activity increasingly integrated. the visible manifestation trend explosive growth securitization increase involvement bank affiliate part securitization process. and, learn course crisis, universe institution whose potential failure regard systemic consequence extend well beyond banks, even bank hold companies, include financial firm subject mandatory prudential regulation. more generally, emergence so-called shadow bank system change important feature traditional bank model, particularly large institutions. these bank become increasingly dependent wholesale fund provide securitization, commercial paper issuance, source – fund often poorly match maturity firm's assets. 1 the view present necessarily member board governor federal open market committee. bi review 74/2009 1 the result rise vulnerability institution non-traditional source risk. the new market-based liquidity problem arise sudden, sharp movement asset price lead enormous market uncertainty concern value assets. a liquidity-strained institution make increasingly distress asset sales, place downward pressure asset prices, lead margin call leverage actor mark-to-market loss holder assets. since multiple firm rely similar marketable asset ready source liquidity, extreme price decline could ensue, engender negative feedback loop that, unchecked, would threaten solvency firm operate assumption liquidity asset sale borrow secure assets. these change competitive environment prompt advance relaxation past decade many restriction bank activity affiliation establish 1930s. a result changes, take place administrative action statute, bank could operate nationally, practical restriction ability pay competitive deposit rates, could conduct much broad range activity within operations, could affiliate virtually kind financial firm. in response now-permissible bank involvement activity affiliation broker-dealer financial firms, regulatory agency impose detail capital requirement insist good risk management. but overhaul financial regulation take account impact trade capital market activity traditional bank systemic risk. the financial crisis focus attention policymakers need kind regulatory reorientation. i recently set forth fairly extensive explanation change i believe accompany reorientation.2 i repeat whole agenda today. instead, let simply highlight item illustrate concretely era systemic risk regulation would look like. first, within federal reserve, adjust consolidate supervision practice take great account risk faced, created, affiliate principally involve trade capital market activities. recent supervisory practice move quickly enough away traditional focus bank hold company regulation way protect insure depository institution subsidiaries, toward attention factor common exposure different affiliate within consolidate entity. second, must strengthen exist regulation supervisory guidance, particularly area bank involvement trade market significant. the centrality liquidity problem crisis require considerable attention adequate liquidity risk-management practices, particularly firm substantially reliant wholesale funding. while serious liquidity problem occur outside traditional commercial bank lend borrow activities, crisis reveal significant fragility financial institutions' extensive use short-term repurchase agreement reverse repurchase agreement finance large portion dealer inventory trade positions. on side balance sheet, capital requirement asset trade book reveal crisis seriously deficient, base 10-day trade horizon. along colleague regulatory agency and, indeed, international colleague basel committee bank supervision, work proposal address problems. third, augment supervisory approach bank hold company include explicitly systemic perspective. "horizontal reviews" risks, risk management, practice conduct across multiple financial firm ground uniform 2 daniel k. tarullo (2009), “financial regulation wake crisis,” speech deliver peterson institute international economics, washington, d.c., june 8. 2 bi review 74/2009 set supervisory stress parameter help identify common trend firm-specific weaknesses. we incorporate routine supervisory practice lesson learn recently complete supervisory capital assessment program nation's 19 large bank hold companies. fourth, important solve legislation so-called boundary problem financial regulation. last year series run nondepository financial institution raise systemic concerns. institution may consider too-big-to-fail, least too-interconnected-to-fail, must subject regulatory requirement consolidate supervision. of course, step i would recommend, either within federal reserve financial regulatory structure generally. they should, however, give idea kind change necessary shift focus systemic risk regulation. small bank let turn situation small bank – north carolina around nation. the financial crisis originate small banks, hardly escape fallout crisis itself, serious recession followed. on average, commercial bank le $1 billion asset report modest net profit first quarter 2009, recover average loss position fourth quarter 2008. but average figure hide fact nearly one five bank lose money first quarter. a march 31, nonperforming asset twice level one year ago, measure total loan category other real estate owned, stand historic peak. furthermore, capital ratios, although still strong bank group, fall since early 2008. at time, importance traditional financial intermediation services, hence small bank typically specialize provide services, tend increase time financial stress. indeed, crisis highlight important continue role community banks. this seem opportune moment review virtue community bank identify difficulty face community banker recession beyond. the dramatic change u.s. financial service industry i describe early also produce new competitive environment community banks. consolidation reduce number bank institution (that is, commercial bank thrifts) unite state nearly 50 percent since 1989. the number community bank decline similar percentage, leave share bank institution community bank virtually unchanged.3 even number bank institution declining, number bank office (branches plus headquarters) growing. not surprisingly, big bank driver increase bank offices. since 1989, number community bank office decline 14 percent. the number office per community bank increase 2.4 3.9, even 60% growth must understand context change large banks. in 20-year period, number big bank office increase 42 percent, number office per big bank tripled, 17 nearly 55. the net effect decline 25 percent share bank 3 statistic paragraph next base definition term "community bank" include independent commercial bank thrift asset le $1 billion bank thrift subsidiary hold company total bank asset le $1 billion, 2008 dollars. the term "big bank" define include commercial bank thrifts. bi review 74/2009 3 office operate community banks. the share deposits, bank assets, small business loan hold community bank decline substantially well. these decline explain number factors, include legal developments, technological advances, change business strategy large bank non-bank financial service providers. for example, deregulation allow bank expand geographic reach, facilitate formation number large, geographically diversify bank organizations. these large bank organization find many local markets, compete business community bank call market home. here north carolina, number large bank branch presence state double past twenty years, 18 39. at time, technological advance make information household small business readily available, allow (typically large) institution substitute credit score costly traditional technique underwrite type consumer small business loans. this development allow large bank compete effectively community bank provide type loans. another salient change competitive environment non-bank financial service provider become increasingly important participant financial service sector, capture large grow share retail financial service business. for example, number credit union decline 42 percent since 1989, credit union deposit quadrupled, credit union increase share national deposit 4.7 percent 8.5 percent. in addition, credit union shift traditional membership base common interest membership encompass anyone life work within one local bank markets. in last years, credit union also move beyond traditional focus consumer service provide service small businesses, increase extent compete community banks. these change pose significant challenge community banks. even so, many community bank thrived, large part local presence personal interaction give advantage meet financial need many households, small businesses, agricultural firms. their business model base important economic explanation role financial intermediary – develop apply expertise allow lender make good judgment creditworthiness potential borrower could make potential lender le information borrowers. a small, growing, body research suggest financial service provide large bank less-than-perfect substitute provide community banks.4 consistent view, one study find increase competition large, geographically diversify bank organization affect profitability community bank urban areas. there evidence profitability effect rural areas, actually likely positive negative.5 thus, community bankers, increase presence local market large, geographically diversify bank organization appear adversely affect profitability. this circumstance may due fact 4 see, example, robert adams, kenneth brevoort, elizabeth k. kiser, (2007).

"the profitability small single-market bank era multi-market banking," journal bank finance 33, pp. 263-71. 4 bi review 74/2009 branch manager large depository institution typically local connection relationship community bank president. furthermore, although survey data indicate small business increase reliance large bank non-bank financial service provider recent years, data show firm reduce average number financial service obtain community banks. rather, small business are, average, use financial service type service past, obtain service great number wide variety financial institutions, often include community banks.6 to remain successful, business must adapt change competitive environment. the adaptation community bank past two decade evidence substantial change balance sheets, asset liability sides. on asset side, average ratio total loan total asset average share lend comprise commercial real estate loan increase markedly. on liability side, reliance deposit individuals, partnerships, corporation decline somewhat, dramatic increase share community bank hold broke deposits. in addition, community bank become reliant non-interest source revenue. these change business strategy, undoubtedly help maintain community bank profitability much past two decades, may current financial environment exacerbate risk face community banks. in difficult operate environment, federal reserve examiner encourage community bank focus maintain sound loan quality strong credit administration practices. in addition, work community bank ensure maintain appropriate capital planning, credit administration, liquidity management policies. for example, early year, federal reserve issue supervisory guidance (sr letter 09-4) reemphasized importance capital plan prudent dividend policy bank hold company (bhcs) bank subsidiaries. this guidance – direct bhcs, large small – remind ensure remain source strength bank subsidiary curtail dividend financial condition stress. a key part effective capital plan process evaluation risk pose concentration specific portfolio loan assets, buff necessary offset potential loss holdings. in late 2006, bank agency issue guidance address concentration commercial real estate lending. this guidance set forth supervisory expectation management risk stem concentrations, include consideration effect stress market condition bank's asset capital. in time since guidance issued, examiner report many community bank conduct rigorous effective stress tests. but examiner also visit many institution recently begin essential step ensure management information system sufficiently detail support robust analysis bank concentration, identify work stress test needed. fund management also area receive renew supervisory focus bank sizes. a depositor fund provider become sensitive bank risk, many bank reinforce contingency fund plan develop sophisticate system closely track source us funds. these step particularly important bank face weak asset quality. 6 see robin prager john d. wolken, (2008). "the evolve relationship community bank small businesses: evidence survey small business finances," federal reserve board finance economics discussion series 2008-60. bi review 74/2009 5 conclusion the difference business model systemically important financial firm community bank obvious. yet financial crisis ensue recession reveal deficiency risk management institution types. change competitive environment require bank respond change business strategies. but financial crisis also reveal importance bank adopt risk-management strategy appropriate strategic changes, bank regulatory agency adapt supervisory model kind change financial institutions. the characteristic financial service industry change enormously last 30 years. along nature regulatory regime effective, key aim prudential regulation remain always – encourage efficient allocation capital productive us protect system defect excess inherent financial markets. a recover crisis recession, likely enter new era systemic risk regulation assume much great importance supervisors. but role bank management, risk management banks, also remain always – allow institution play effective intermediate role safe sound fashion. 6 bi review 74/2009 mark carney: rebalancing global economy remark mr mark carney, governor bank canada, international economic forum america conference montreal, montreal, 11 june 2009. * * * the theme conference – "adapting new world order" – suggest clear global commerce finance reorganize wake current crisis. however, outcome far preordained. how manage rebalancing global economy could profoundly influence open, equitable, prosperous new world order be. globalize product, capital, labour markets1 lie heart new world order aspire. however, next wave globalization need firmly ground participant responsible. in recent years, belief power market always accompany commitment build resilient markets. moreover, times, policy-makers private sector live responsibilities. in talk today, i outline agenda redress fail order build responsible, resilient globalization. but first i want highlight current challenge stem several key imbalances. across economies, demand must rotate deficit surplus countries. within economies, major stock adjustment inventories, labour, capital required. excessive level private debt must also reduced. to offset result shortfall private demand, public demand must increase. the role public demand bridge gap. to successfully, must temporary, credible, accompany measure relaunch open, resilient, responsible global economy. the (newly) old world order it long ago bask seemingly effortless prosperity globalization. during past quarter century, steady advance transportation, communication, information technologies, underpin widespread adoption liberal economic policies, shrink globe expand economy. never history economic integration involve many people, variety goods, much capital.2 the pace breadth globalization make possible part onset global supply-chain management.3 in effect, technology globalization facilitate widespread application two powerful force economics: division labour comparative advantage. national economy become tightly linked, demand one country drive production inventory cycle across several countries. from price 1 the globalization labour market due mainly information technology, facilitate global outsource services, include medical financial services. 2 the effective global labour supply quadruple 1980 2005. merchandise export grow 20 per cent global gdp, twice level reach height last great wave globalization century ago. 3 advance information technologies, specialize production processes, reduce communication transportation cost lead whole new range good service become tradable. for example, past 30 years, share import percentage manufacture production tripled. bi review 73/2009 1 perspective, net result steady downward pressure price manufacture good steady upward pressure commodity prices.4,5 the global capital market similarly transform period. cross-border capital flow reach 15 per cent global gdp, five time rate begin 20th century. by large, flow facilitate diversification risk, transfer technology, acceleration global growth. at time, global market become interdependent. the action others matter more, particularly time stress. globalization lift hundred million people poverty create potential hundred million share destiny. for canada, contribute second-longest expansion nation's history – period characterize rise real incomes, surge employment, low, stable, predictable inflation. in recent years, however, global economy become increasingly unbalanced. the process rebalancing profoundly affect medium-term outlook global economy. rotation domestic demand deficit surplus country we experience inevitable correction global imbalances. these characterize misalign relative prices, underdevelop financial sectors, excess save emerge markets. these match rapid credit expansion, asset-price booms, negative save many western economies. these trend encourage policy inflexible exchange rate overreliance export-led growth asia and, unite states, promotion unsustainable household spend response burst tech bubble. these measure collectively contribute low stable interest rate environment, feed enormous risk take leverage across market currencies. these imbalance evident current accounts. in reversal usual trends, emerge market run surpluses, develop country run deficits. poor country effect lend rich ones. in 2006, american deficit reach almost 7 per cent gdp chinese surplus 10 per cent. the net foreign liability world's develop economy net foreign asset large emerge market explosive paths. that could go forever eventually brutally stopped. when cavalier "search yield" replace desperate "rush shelter," leverage viciously unwind across markets, sharply increase risk premia around world. in real economy, bank expect u.s. current account deficit year fall almost two-thirds peak. china's surplus also narrow, although le dramatically (partly reflect offset sharp fall commodity prices). the unwind global imbalance highlight fundamental interconnectedness global economy. virtually every financial asset planet significantly re-priced crisis intensified. the reverberation contract u.s. consumer demand spread rapidly via global supply chains, global inventory glut develop virtually overnight. a 3 per cent decline u.s. consumption good past six month feed 20 per 4 for canada, combination low price import manufacture good high price commodity export drive improvement term trade, bolster real disposable income per caput 8.5 per cent five year lead 2008. 5 the rise commodity price due rapid increase manufacture emerge markets, production relatively

hardly desirable. a sustainable rebalancing domestic demand deficit countries, unite state unite kingdom, toward surplus countries, china germany, take time – likely dampen pace global growth. reduction debt, reallocation labour capital the second important correction period transition "new world order" characterize significant stock adjustment financial real sector major industrialize economies. a key lesson japan's lose decade economy grow excess build bubble removed.6 in japan, include commercial real estate, physical capital, highly leverage corporate sector. financial imbalance loss deteriorate economy quickly overwhelm capital buff japanese bank sector. the result negative feedback loop real financial economy take nearly decade break. there strike parallel unite states. early decade, substantial misallocation investment (much finance abroad) private real estate. in addition, key industry auto invest capital stock become increasingly misalign prospective demand. there also important differences. unlike japan, excess debt unite state concentrate household financial sectors, deleveraging financial sector trigger rather result recession. with u.s. bank raise significant capital cushion losses, negative feedback loop financial real economy slowed, though yet reversed. more capital require globally; toxic asset core bank still need addressed; host vital financial markets, private-label securitization, must relaunched. a result, stabilization global financial system remain precondition sustainable recovery, globally canada. this process financial stock adjustment mirror adjustment process real supply side economy. in last quarter 2008, become clear level inventories, employment, capital commensurate level global demand. each, turn, fell roughly sequence one would expect, give relative adjustment costs: first, inventories; next, employment, quasi-fixed; last, capital, investment fell rate replacement. although global demand trade level appear approach bottom, inventory labour adjustment already substantial, still come. unemployment likely rise across g-7, sharp increase still come economy least-flexible labour markets. uncertainty employment outlook weigh consumption major economy time. the capital stock adjustment process take longer, global investment growth likely remain negative well 2010. this serve significant drag global growth expect reduce potential growth major economies. 6 see "way out economic financial crisis: lesson policy actions," masaaki shirakawa, governor bank japan, speech japan society, new

likely positive third quarter 2009, largely owe massive fiscal expenditure tax cuts. self-sustaining private demand major economic area yet imminent. the g-20 strategy enact extraordinary fiscal stimulus offset financial headwind bridge gap end stock adjustment process restoration private demand. it success depend three interrelate factors: scale private save response; magnitude, duration, credibility fiscal response itself; eventual rebalancing risk public private sectors. let address factor turn. the evolution private public save one big imponderable outlook household save rates. in run-up crisis, household increasingly "saved" capital appreciation rather current income. a decline roughly 30 per cent u.s. wealth cause household save rate rise sharply nearly zero 2005 2008 4 per cent first quarter 2009. the new equilibrium household save depend multiple factors, include wealth effects, risk aversion, evolution financial system, crucially, credibility fiscal policy itself. the surge private save offset rise public dissaving. the world well way spend average 2 per cent gdp discretionary fiscal measures. simultaneous fiscal action mean spillover across country offset degree, thereby limit net leakage maximize overall impact. in addition, current global concentration infrastructure spend provide support commodity prices. but limit everything, include fiscal policy. across g-7 year, average deficit 12 per cent gdp. global public borrow requirement two time great last year. compound effect need avoid abrupt withdrawal fiscal stimulus mean average public debt level many major economy could increase 110 per cent gdp stabilizing. the composition global save need change radically. these dynamic could become self-defeating credibility fiscal path call question. a combination substantial upward pressure interest rate investment ricardian effects7 consumption would retard recovery. it therefore paramount fiscal policy framework retain credibility. this require effective current initiative realistic exit strategies. in regard, canada's experience 1990s steady overachievement near-term target road fiscal balance relevant. ultimately, return sustain growth private sector demand accommodate desire private save essential. an open, global economy centre private risk take best prospect this. but assured, much need done, start orderly retreat public sector. 7 ricardian equivalence refer theory increase government spend largely offset reduction private consumption, reflect future anticipate tax increases. 4 bi review 73/2009 redistribution risk public private sector the financial panic require bold response public sector. the loss faith solvency core bank institution time threaten function global financial system. while absolutely necessary, response crisis profoundly shift risk private sector public sector. since october, g-7 commit systemically important financial institution allow fail. across world, bank finance guaranteed. with securitization market still moribund, asset purchase tail risk assume public sector. government even guarantee warranty certain car models. with precedents, pressure host new risk-sharing arrangements.8 we need think carefully risk best hold emerge crisis. there two considerations. first, risk price best bear private sector, whereas uncertainty wide significant potential impact best bear public sector. second, risk endogenous: public policy private decision influence aggregate risk system. for example, widespread private use collateral mitigate counterparty risk reduce credit risk sharply increase liquidity risk. similarly, public sector's recent assumption risk create moral hazard. if leave unchecked, eventually promote private behaviour add overall risk system. the expedient become permanent. government assume extraordinary tail risk quite ordinary financial risks. they decide whether keep former effectively shut activity associate (for example, aspect securitization). they return latter private sector. a central bank agenda renew globalization but so, animal spirit clearly moribund? perception changed. there good appreciation amorphous endogenous nature risk. there also welcome acknowledgement uncertainty. know black swan might discipline activity. humility seldom go fall. unfortunately, newly humble private sector may re-engage belief system resilient. to accomplish this, central banks, along public agencies, must promote necessary market infrastructure responsible policy. there four priority renew globalization. first, transparency increase risk identify effectively price efficiently. the crisis lay bare important deficiency woefully inadequate disclosure securitized products. the bank canada use collateral policy improve disclosure asset-backed commercial paper (abcp), create standard become commonplace. the current global initiative transfer many over-the-counter derivative onto clear house motivate partially desire promote standardization. second, core fund market make efficient le susceptible extreme price movements. the crisis clearly exacerbate seizure interbank repo markets: good collateral become unfinanceable overnight, firm failed, risk aversion skyrocketed, global economy plummeted. promise avenue break (il)liquidity spiral include introduce clear houses, standardize products, implement through-the-cycle margining, ensure effective netting. a ultimate provider 8 see "(nearly) nothing fear fear itself," olivier blanchard, chief economist, international monetary fund. publish the

mean submit peer review within financial stability board external review international monetary fund. fundamentally, mean adopt coherent macro policy allow real exchange rate adjust achieve external balance time. this crisis cause part failure meet challenge bedevil architect original bretton wood system. give current, deeply synchronous global recession, cost free rid obvious all. conclusion i would like conclude word impact rebalancing canada. it appear likely global economy enter period low potential growth. the substantial capital misallocation financial excess boom year take year work off. rebuild globalization also take time. recognize scale industrial restructure low investment period, bank low estimate canadian productivity potential growth. the shift composition global growth

strengthen zambia’s financial private health sector remark dr caleb m fundanga, governor bank zambia, second private health sector trade fair, lusaka, 5 june 2009. * * * the chairperson, bank health; representative medical council zambia; representative the general nurse council; representative zambia medical association; member zambia union nurse organisation; member zambia alliance private health providers; representative pharmaceutical society zambia; distinguish invite guests; lady gentlemen. * * * it great joy gratitude i stand address important second private health sector trade fair. this occasion bring together many esteem medical provider private sector important stakeholder delivery medical service zambia like financial institutions, pharmaceutical distributors, commercial supplier support medical industry. the bank zambia regulator financial system commit strengthen financial sector position relevant country development agenda provide finance sector like health qualify private health providers. i believe lead improve quality medical service provision zambia contribute country’s economic growth. distinguish lady gentlemen, bank zambia, recognize important role private sector continue play provide health service much zambia’s population. these service providers, whether doctors, nurses, midwives, clinical officers, dentists, pharmacist offer client increase choices. more choice health provision allow people find best care particular circumstance needs. the expand choice reach provide private sector wonderful complement exist public health services. furthermore, recent decision zambian government designate health education economic sector undoubtedly, assist investor health education sectors. this entail investor sector enjoy various incentive previously available investment real sector. chairperson, in order private health sector truly flourish zambia, vital government provide enable environment ensure private provider health service obtain finance need expand improve medical practices. most micro, small, medium enterprise firm africa, include health businesses, receive 5 percent finance banks, large firm get 22 percent finance need banks. in zambia, recent survey financial inclusiveness indicate one third population financially serve bank non bank financial institutions. barrier access credit identify included; high interest rates, cap loan excessive collateral requirements. bi review 73/2009 1 the importance increase access bank service large proportion population cannot overemphasized. financial service critical tool help people step onto economic growth ladder create bright future tap creativity create job incomes. it also instrumental broad human development, let client invest seek protection shock bad fortune. it however, gratify note follow survey, commercial bank non-bank financial institution zambia increasingly become receptive lend small medium-sized enterprise regard establish department dedicate small medium enterprise lend introduce financial product specifically design meet finance need businesses. in work bank health, bank show interest learn private health sector, sector whose business characteristic largely unknown banks. however, bank still misunderstand risks, overestimate costs, underestimate potential return lend sectors, health sector. in addition structural barrier financial sector limit access finance, many private health care provider limit financial business-management skill often struggle prepare bankable loan application business proposals. it difficult commercial bank ass credit risk loan without financial statement business plan support loan application. chairperson, i happy state “banking health”, support u.s. government, work address barrier credit provide market research information private medical sector commercial bank microfinance institution understand business characteristic sector. the financial management train bank health provide health business also low risk lend borrowers. lady gentlemen, let end point challenge arise global financial economic crisis huge surmountable. major economy world put place various stimulus packages, expect take world economy crisis. without doubt, measure benefit emerge develop economy well, provide remain commit pursue strong socio-economic policies. although global financial crisis negatively affect zambian economy many respect present serious challenge maintain health economy, macroeconomic stability maintained. the bank zambia continue monitor global development take appropriate measure maintain confidence bank system avoid systemic risk. it important note despite crisis, still remain investment confidence zambian economy one example number new commercial bank commence operation zambia last 12 months. the bank zambia also commit ensure availability finance viable business include qualify health businesses. do help create foundation great investment health nation. we appreciate partnership initiative “banking health” extend health service zambia look forward great investment health sector zambia. i thank you. 2 bi review 73/2009 josé manuel gonzález-páramo: address 2008 bernácer prize award ceremony honour markus brunnermeier speech mr josé manuel gonzález-páramo, member executive board european central bank, 2008 bernácer prize award ceremony honour markus brunnermeier, madrid, 10 june 2009. * * * lady gentlemen,1 it great pleasure give honour address word occasion year’s award ceremony bernácer prize professor markus brunnermeier princeton university. guillermo de la dehesa ask share think importance scientific research european central bank monetary policy. in context, i would like express appreciation influential contribution make year’s laureate academic debate field particular relevance central bank policymakers. markus brunnermeier particularly praise help u improve understand main cause mechanism behind current financial crisis, well scholarly advice policymakers general public global financial system put stable solid foot regulatory reform. but i revert later. let first emphasise research play crucial role eurosystem much central banks. research provide essential input definition ecb’s price-stability monetary policy strategy well design operational framework. besides, order conduct monetary policy regular basis, ecb need accumulate knowledge information dynamic economy tend evolve, specific market work, policy instrument influence price output development various transmission chains. moreover, ecb also perform core function task support smooth operation payment system contribute safeguard financial stability likewise require substantial theoretical empirical knowledge. it go without say detail information financial market economy whole mainly originate research efforts, whether undertake within outside ecb. central bank certainly always remain art much science sense clear rulebook prescribe best policy action specific circumstance exist. uncertainty simply pervasive. for example, quantitative knowledge central bank monetary transmission process remain imperfect fragile due preponderance data, estimation model uncertainty macroeconomic model building, compound constant risk structural change evolve economy societies. central banker also regularly face situation unique unprecedented, alternative state (or likelihood) really well know understood. these situation so-called knightian uncertainty clearly defy measurement thus pose challenge empirically-validated policy advice. in face uncertainty, arrive certain decision monetary policymakers need combine knowledge derive variety model individual experience judgement. notwithstanding this, way monetary policymakers filter information receive experience make usually depend theoretical concept adopt internalise professional lives. it responsibility central bank institution ensure fundamental idea behind 1 i grateful m. hoerova m. kremer input speech p. hartmann f. smets comments. bi review 73/2009 1 actual monetary policymaking reflect far possible “state art” respective disciplines, invalidate even falsify idea “defunct economist”, loosely quote john maynard keynes’s famous conclusion the general theory. the ecb attempt cope responsibility foster intense exchange information manpower academic world levels. lead expert economics finance regularly visit ecb discus recent find seminars, conference workshops, often co-hosted major central bank research institutions, well provide consultancy. the member govern council executive board ecb play active part regular exchange view theory practice monetary policy. it emphasise close relationship theory policy make give rise cross-fertilisation. scientific progress definitely improve conduct monetary policy central bank task time; likewise true academic often benefit practitioners´ deep knowledge data institutional detail well broad experience aspect real-world monetary policymaking. insight research invaluable particularly time big financial crisis since great depression. find correct policy prescription alleviate consequence resolve current crisis require thorough understand underlie causes. markus brunnermeier’s research play prominent role here. for instance, research bubble shed light institutional friction strategic consideration lead significant mispricings assets.2 while market participant may aware flaw asset valuation, lack common knowledge lead build bubble hind bursting. this approach depart conventional market efficiency view rational trader immediately stabilise price shorten overvalue asset and, contrast, integrate important aspect trade behaviour mainstream economics finance. when bubble burst risk re-assessed, financial institution suffer losses. in current crisis, uncertainty size location exposure bank bank-sponsored conduit “toxic” asset translate fund liquidity problems. a paper brunnermeier pedersen, “market liquidity fund liquidity” explain fund problem affect market liquidity lead mutually reinforce liquidity spirals.3 balance sheet constraint financial intermediary naturally lead market illiquidity expectation future liquidity risk lead panic asset price declines. indeed, liquidity shortage one key propagation mechanism current crisis illustrate negative

market crucial banks’ liquidity management also transmission monetary policy. the work fund market liquidity also offer possible mechanism resolution liquidity spirals. the key policy prescription improve fund liquidity financial institution order prevent solvent institution drive business protract illiquidity. this policy follow extensively eurosystem recent past. liquidity spiral also create

well crisis management analysis toxic asset purchases, asset guarantee mortgage subsidies, example. notwithstanding important theoretical advance markus brunnermeier contribute substantially, still much learn root causes, trigger propagation mechanism financial turmoil, precisely spread real sector, cause deep financial economic crisis arise negative feedback loop two sectors. the severe challenge policymakers pose exist knowledge gap reflect controversial debate optimal response mitigate resolve current crisis prevent future crisis occurring. quick progress relate research topic essential ecb monetary policy financial stability perspective. while present ecb already perform certain task shall contribute safeguard stability financial system, foresee range task responsibility ecb relate financial stability matter become substantially enlarged. accord recent proposal european commission reform financial supervision european union, draw recommendation de laroisière high-level group, ecb would play important role new european systemic risk council charge macro-prudential financial supervision european union. for ecb effectively perform task requires, among other, major investment support macro-prudential analytical infrastructure, example development implementation suite early warn signal model significant extension exist macro stress test models. but also need innovative approach optimal policy response macro-prudential risk identified, since european systemic risk council also issue policy recommendations. in contrast assessment systemic risk basis build staff also make research contribution literature, macro-prudential regulation policy relatively new concept good analytical basis still need developed. this area brilliant scholar like markus brunnermeier make invaluable contribution. and already start so. i herewith extend sincere congratulation – markus – win 2008 bernácer prize, much deserve. 4 brunnermeier, m., crockett, a., goodhart,

saran, p r ravi mohan, t gopinath, muneesh kapur preparation paper gratefully acknowledged. the paper also benefit report work group i g-20 “enhancing sound regulation strengthen transparency”. * * * the world currently midst severe financial economic crisis since great depression. although crisis originate sub-prime mortgage market unite states, spread europe late rest world. the speed contagion spread across world perhaps unprecedented. what start relatively limit crisis u house mortgage sector turn successively widespread bank crisis unite state europe, breakdown domestic international financial markets, late full blow global economic crisis. almost government central bank world busy last 9-18 month effort contain effect crisis fiscal monetary policy measures, respectively. just global nature crisis unprecedented, global nature response, exemplify coordinate action commit g-20. along coordinate fiscal monetary policy actions, comprehensive re-examination financial regulatory supervisory framework also underway around world. against backdrop, paper attempt analyse emerge contour regulation financial institution emphasis emerge challenge dynamics. the paper organise follows: section i provide broad overview global development contribute current global financial crisis. section ii present ongoing discussion debate international level light shortcoming extant regulatory framework. section iii analysis proposal reform regulatory framework, section iv discus difficulty implement regulatory proposals. i. evolution crisis: go wrong? what identifiable source market failure lead current financial turbulence? the current ongoing financial crisis attribute variety factor development sub-prime mortgage sector, excessive leverage, lax financial regulation supervision, global macroeconomic imbalances. at fundamental level, however, crisis also reflect effect long period excessively loose monetary policy major advance economy early part decade. after dotcom bubble burst u around turn decade, monetary policy u advance economy ease relatively aggressively. policy rate u reach one per cent 2002, hold around level extend period, long probably necessary (taylor, 2009; yellen, 2009). excessively loose monetary policy lead excess liquidity consequent low interest rate worldwide; burst financial innovation period amplify accelerate consequence excess liquidity rapid credit expansion (de larosière report, 2009). what interest episode that, despite persistent accommodative monetary policy, accompany strong worldwide macroeconomic growth result bi review 72/2009 1 measure inflationary pressure good services. consequently, central bank advance economies, particularly us, withdraw monetary accommodation extend period. the excess liquidity worldwide show rise asset prices, late commodity prices, particularly oil. it measure inflation start rise central bank begin tighten monetary policy, though belatedly. with significant increase investment consumption, along decline savings,1 aggregate demand exceed domestic output u extend period, lead persistent increase current account deficits, domestic save investment imbalance grew. this large excess demand u supply rest world, especially china, provide good service relatively low cost, lead correspond current account surplus china elsewhere. the surplus generate oil export country add emerge global imbalances. large current account surplus china emes equivalent deficit u elsewhere often attribute exchange rate policy china, emes oil exporters. give fact u demand exceed output, apparent u current deficit would continue elevate levels. in event flexible exchange rate policy china, source import u would country china. although lack exchange rate flexibility asian emes oil exporter contribute emergence global imbalances, fully explain large grow current account deficit us, particularly since europe whole exhibit current account deficit time. accommodative monetary policy correspond existence low interest rate extend period encourage active search high yield host market participants. thus capital flow emerge market economy (emes) surge search high yields, could absorb economy presence either large current account surplus small deficits, largely end official reserves. these reserve recycle u government security government sponsor mortgage entity fannie mae freddie mac. thus, accommodative monetary policy keep short term interest rate low, recycle reserve contribute low long term interest rate advance economies, particularly unite states. such low long term interest rate contribute growth mortgage finance consequent rise house prices. furthermore, stable macroeconomic environment – relatively stable growth low inflation – major advance economy run crisis lead sustain under-pricing risk hence excessive risk take financial innovation. it may ironic perceive success central bank increase credibility monetary policy, give rise enhance expectation regard stability inflation interest rates, could lead mispricing risk hence enhance risk taking. easy monetary policy may generate search yield result dilution standard assess credit risk lead erosion sound practice (mohan, 2007). low yield encourage excessive leverage bank financial institution attempt maintain profitability. lacuna financial regulation supervision allow excessive leverage financial system. asset either take banks’ balance sheet off-balance sheet vehicle effectively unregulated; financial innovation synthetically reduce perceive risk balance sheets. the sustain rise asset prices, particularly house prices, back excessively accommodative monetary policy, lax lend standard couple financial innovations, result high growth mortgage credit households, particularly low credit quality households. due “originate distribute” model, 1 the u personal save rate hover slightly zero mid-2005 mid-2007 (yellen, 2009). 2 bi review 72/2009 mortgage securitized. in combination strong growth complex credit derivative use credit ratings, mortgages, inherently sub-prime, bundle variety tranches, include aaa tranches, sell range financial investor look high yields. a inflation start creep begin 2004, u federal reserve start withdraw monetary accommodation. consequently, mortgage payment start rising, house price start ease. low/negligible margin finance incentivised default sub-prime borrowers. although loan supposedly securitized sell balance sheet special institutional vehicle (sivs), loss ultimately bear bank financial institution wipe significant fraction capital. the uncertainty extent likely bank loss lead breakdown trust among banks. give grow financial globalization, bank financial institution major advance economies, especially europe, also adversely affect loss capital write-offs. inter-bank money market nearly freeze reflect high spread money market debt markets. there aggressive search safety, mirror low yield treasury bill bonds. these development significantly accentuate follow failure lehman brother september 2008 complete loss confidence. the deep linger crisis global financial markets, extreme level risk aversion, mount loss bank financial institutions, elevate level commodity oil price (until third quarter 2008), sharp correction range asset prices, combined, suddenly lead sharp slowdown growth momentum major advance economies, especially since lehman failure. global growth 2009, see healthy 3.8 per cent april 2008, expect imf contract 1.3 per cent. thus, cause current crisis reflect interaction monetary policy, choice exchange rate regime number country important change within financial system (de larosière report, 2009; bis, 2008), along lax regulation arise belief efficient market light touch regulation. to recap, low interest rates, together increase excessive optimism future push asset prices, stock price house prices. low interest rate limit volatility prompt search yield credit quality curve, underestimation risk lead creation purchase risky assets. central banks, focus measure consumer price inflation aggregate activity, neglect asset price movements, perceive full implication grow risk late (imf, 2009). ii. shortcoming financial regulation supervision there call fundamental rethink macro-economic, monetary financial sector policy meet new challenge realities, perhaps represent structural shift international financial architecture demand potentially enhance degree coordination among monetary authority regulators. a review policy relate financial regulation, way, need address acute policy dilemma short run fundamental re-think broad framework financial economic policy medium-term (reddy, 2008). a great deal active discussion go internationally exist regulatory practice future financial regulation supervision. it also perhaps correct say emerge consensus direction need take financial regulation supervision. among influential report issue are: • report high level group financial supervision european union (chairman: jacques de larosière). bi review 72/2009 3 • the structure financial supervision: approach challenge global market place (group thirty; chairman: paul volcker). • the fundamental principle financial regulation (the geneva report). • the turner review: a regulatory response global bank crisis (financial service authority uk); finally, • the report work group i g-20 “enhancing, sound regulation strengthen transparency (g-20). what common among report acknowledgement regulation supervision advance economy clearly lax recent time need considerable rethink lead much strengthened, perhaps, intrusive regulation supervision financial sector. there clear recognition serious regulatory supervisory failures. the root re-thinking really question exist intellectual assumption respect function markets, nature financial risk. to quote turner review: “at core assumption theory efficient rational markets. five proposition implication regulatory approach followed: (i) market price good indicator rationally evaluate economic value. (ii) the development securitized credit, since base creation new liquid markets, improve allocative efficiency financial stability. (iii) the risk characteristic financial market infer mathematical analysis, deliver robust quantitative measure trade risk. (iv) market discipline use effective tool constrain harmful risk taking. (v) financial innovation assume beneficial since market competition would winnow innovation deliver value added. each assumption subject extensive challenge theoretical empirical grounds, potential implication appropriate design regulation role regulatory authorities”. (turner review, 2009, p.30) what specific development financial system arise broadly accept intellectual assumption lead ongoing global financial crisis? financial bank crisis long history, old existence financial sector itself. what common among almost crisis build excessive leverage system inevitable burst financial bubble result leverage. what interest current crisis excess leverage occur period great consensus develop basel process need level adequate capital require bank institution across major jurisdictions. furthermore, sophisticate financial risk management capability also believe develop within large financial institution period unusually high rapid growth magnitude sophistication financial system. with financial deregulation key jurisdiction like unite state u.k., along countries, financial institution also grow complexity. financial conglomerate begin include financial function one roof: banking, insurance, asset management, proprietary trading, investment banking, broking, like. the consequence inadequate appreciation assessment emerge risks, within institution system wide. what factor lead emergence excessive system wide institutional risk? among notable development last decade unprecedented explosive growth securitized credit intermediation associate derivative (yellen, 2009). the 4 bi review 72/2009 assumption underlie development constitute mechanism take risk balance sheet banks, place diversify set investors, thereby serve reduce bank system risks. a late april 2006, imf’s global financial stability report note dispersion would help “mitigate absorb shock financial system” result “improved resilience may see few bank failure consistent credit provision” (as quote turner report, p.42). this assumption already prove erroneous, although simple form securitisation exist long time. among key function bank maturity transformation: intermediate short term liability fund long term asset non-financial sector. bank typically highly leverage hence trust confidence crucial function stability. traditionally, therefore, bank exercise sharp vigilance risk element assets, typically illiquid, order ensure constant rollover short term fund liabilities. what securitization turn illiquid asset liquid ones, theory disperse risk banks’ balance sheet also reduce requirement bank capital. with asset see liquid short term instruments, begin fund ultra-short term liabilities, include even overnight repos whose volume increase manifold recent years. systemic risk increase trade instrument inherently susceptible price swing depend change market sentiment. furthermore, liquidity risk market also understand adequately. it assume liquid market would always exist, hence securitized asset assume inherently le risky illiquid long term credit assets. financial innovation arise search yield compound problem second order derivative proliferate valuation become increasingly dependent model valuation credit ratings, rather observable transparent market valuation, hence inherently opaque. thus, problem arise market price visible, valuation asset bank shadow bank system become unobservable. consequently, trust confidence evaporate market froze. compound problem emergence shadow bank system take asset banks’ balance sheets, thereby reduce latter’s capital requirements. the complexity magnitude intra-financial sector transaction explode past decade, particularly past five years. thus financial sector increasingly serve itself, exhibit high profit growth, relatively little non financial sector economy, financial sector exist serve principle. the debt financial company increase level exceed gdp lead economies. thus, process take risk balance sheet securitization, risk return extend bank system original rationale securitization get belied. rather reduce systemic risk system complex securitisaiton associate derivative serve increase systemic risk. moreover, become increasingly difficult trace risk ultimately lay. the regulatory system clearly behind curve take account developments. the procedure calculate risk-based capital requirement under-estimated risk inherent trade securitized instruments, thereby add incentive bank securitise asset trade instruments, bore low risk weights. the trade instrument largely otc market exhibit little transparency. a result overall process, bank become effectively capitalized, leverage ratio unregulated shadow bank system investment bank reach unsustainable levels. with existence low interest rates, mispriced low risk perceptions, inherent incentive originate lend distribute securitized instruments, household indebtedness increase unprecedented levels, particularly housing. demand house asset rise hence house prices. thus micro behavior lead increase bi review 72/2009 5 systemic risk adequately appreciate understood, hence monitor authorities. thus immense emerge challenge confront financial sector regulator consequence ongoing global financial crisis. we look forward extensive debate academic level among practitioners. how change view efficiency rationality markets, particularly financial markets? what effect re-examination financial innovation future? what regulatory authority meantime debate settle intellectual level? will overreact restrict financial growth month year come? will affect global gdp growth well? i turn key proposal make overhaul strong financial regulatory architecture. iii. reform regulatory framework: future perspective a great deal discussion go national international level reform financial regulatory system address various weakness emerged. there question financial regulation strengthen round. hitherto unregulated institutions, market instrument bring regulatory framework, framework need redesign address emerge need national international levels. a new enthusiasm financial regulation unfolds, important keep mind basic function financial system, strengthen need real economy good served. we need ensure financial system continue play vital role intermediate save provide adequate level fund real sector, thereby support economic growth. it need recognize financial market remain global interconnected, financial innovation would continue important foster economic efficiency. hence, strengthen financial regulation supervision, endeavour make process careful stifle entrepreneurship financial innovation. but follow question need constantly asked: “financial innovation towards objective?” a long financial innovation see promote price discovery, great intermediation efficiency, hence, overall efficiency growth, must encouraged, appropriate safeguard maintain financial stability. unproductive financial innovation, however, need discouraged. moreover, debate financial innovation regulation consider term potential systematic relevance innovation besides capability bring effectively regulatory umbrella (mohan, 2007). therefore, need reform regulatory framework shield financial system potential crises, identify measure mitigate consequence future episode financial stress. the regulatory framework need keep pace associate risk rapid effective manner. large complex financial institution continue operate multiple jurisdiction order meet need large global clients, supervision need good coordinate internationally robust global resolution framework. in order avoid regulatory arbitrage, need great consistency regulation similar instrument institution perform similar activities, within across borders. in addition, capital market require great emphasis reduce counterparty risk ensure infrastructure allow remain source fund period stress. the post-crisis period likely characterize financial system function low level leverage, reduce fund mismatch (both term maturity currency), le exposure counterparty risk, great transparency regard financial instruments. after credit market recover crisis, 6 bi review 72/2009 important mitigate inevitable pressure expand profit increase risk-taking. a develop macro-prudential approach important context. the type, size, cross-border exposure institution market emerge crisis likely considerably different before. a bank financial institution consolidate, policy maker adapt prudential regulation vary degree size concentration. similarly, competition policy important ensure healthy competition. financial institutions, market instrument therefore continue evolve way pose challenge regulation, notwithstanding retrenchment currently underway. financial institutions, policymakers, supervisor regulator need become good equip manage interconnectedness markets, domestically globally, effect innovation, potential incentive become misaligned. it necessary consider appropriate time change regulatory framework go forward. recommendation promote proportionate regulatory reaction needed, acknowledge possible limit self-regulation approach contexts. for example, ultimately capital buff system enhance economic expansion order draw need downturns, change current environment may negative consequence real economy. a consider comprehensive review consequence reform harmonization, coordinate across jurisdictions, necessary increase effective transition stable financial system (g-20, 2009). in short, overarch mandate reform make regulatory regime effective cycle. this relate many issue include certain aspect compensation scheme financial institutions, margin requirement risk management practice focus value-at-risk calculation base short historical samples, capital adequacy framework, valuation loan-loss provision practices. in addition, need redefine scope regulatory framework order establish appropriate oversight institution market may source systemic risk. risk management also need enhance good evaluate vulnerability arise low-frequency, system-wide risks, good mitigate risks. against broad background, section endeavour focus define priority action far financial regulation supervision concerned. macro prudential orientation a observed, build micro institutional risk result unfold massive macro risk, partly rise unsustainable asset prices. a supplement sound micro-prudential market integrity regulation, national financial regulatory framework therefore reinforce macro-prudential oversight promote system-wide approach financial regulation supervision mitigate build-up observable excess risk across system. prudential regime encourage behaviour support systemic stability; discourage regulatory arbitrage; adopt concept “systemic” risk, factor effect leverage funding. in jurisdictions, require improve coordination mechanism various financial authorities, mandate financial authority take account financial system stability, effective tool address systemic risks. it also require effective global table, propose financial stability board, bring together national financial authority jointly ass systemic risk across global financial system coordinate policy responses. a number policy institutions, particularly central banks, enhance analysis systemic risk recent year – many systemic vulnerability cause enhance current turmoil fact identify – policy mechanism effectively translate analysis policy action lacking. the basic idea multiply bi review 72/2009 7 capital adequacy ratio systemic risk factor. good measure macro-prudential risk found. it argue leverage ratios, maturity mismatch estimate bank credit expansion take account. highly leverage fast grow “systemic” institution would subject high capital requirement rest. the idea increase systemic risk, increase leverage, maturity mismatch, credit expansion asset price increase boom times, bank capital require increase, reduce downturn deleveraging take place (geneva report, 2009). potential macroprudential tool could explore could include: • complement risk-based capital measure simple indicator aim measure build-up leverage, enhance sensitivity off-balance sheet exposures; • capital requirement adjust financial cycle; • loan-loss provision standard incorporate available credit information; • the use long historical sample ass risk margin requirements; • great focus loan-to-value ratio mortgages. further, challenge continually endeavour strike balance macro micro prudential regulation. regulatory regime with emergence shadow bank system leverage financial institutions, scope regulation oversight need expand include systemically important institutions, market instruments. accordingly, perimeter financial sector surveillance would extend possibly differentiate layer allow institution graduate simple disclosure high level prudential oversight contribution systemic risk increases. financial authority need enhance information material financial institution markets, include private pool capital. large complex financial institution require particularly robust oversight give size global reach. consideration would also need give put regulatory disincentive institution become big fail. the regulatory oversight framework strive treat similar institution activity consistently, great emphasis function activity le emphasis legal status. the main bone contention here, inter alia, whether regulate private pool capital, include hedge funds. there difference regard role fund current global financial crisis. nevertheless, broad agreement private pool capital, include hedge funds, source risk owe combine size market, use leverage maturity mismatches, connectedness part financial system. the widespread reliance market participant credit rat market instrument lead inadequate risk analysis themselves. thus, credit rat agency (cras) subject regulatory oversight regime. further, need modification rat agency’s practice procedure manage conflict interest assure transparency quality rat process, particularly process underlie rat complex securitised instrument derivatives. give global scope credit rat agencies, oversight framework consistent across jurisdiction appropriate share information national authority responsible oversight credit rat agencies. 8 bi review 72/2009 procyclicality once condition financial system recovered, international standard capital liquidity buff enhanced, build-up capital buff provision good time encourage capital absorb loss draw difficult time current period. it necessary develop methodology link stage business cycle capital requirement non-discretionary way account prudential standards. many question also arise account convention procedure perceive add procyclicality financial system. it recognise clock turn back fair value account address issue temporary market illiquidity. what need make clear nature price uncertainty, manner speak symmetrically potential mispricing illiquid market much boom markets. enhancement could include good guidance principle mark-to-market valuation, information variance around fair value calculation data history price. prudential oversight there three broad area regard prudential oversight require strengthening: capital adequacy framework, liquidity risk management infrastructure otc derivatives. capital adequacy framework there clear need high quantity quality capital result minimum regulatory requirement significantly exist basel rules. the emphasis tier i capital. the transition future rule carefully phase give importance maintain bank lend current macroeconomic climate. capital require trade book activity increase significantly. publish account could also include buff anticipate potential future losses, through, instance, creation “economic cycle reserve”. a maximum gross leverage ratio could introduce backstop discipline excessive growth absolute balance sheet size. further, context rapid financial innovation risk-based regulatory capital requirements, well construct non-risk-based capital measure least partially address problem model deficiency advance approach ensure minimum level capital retain bank system. liquidity risk management a new element future regulatory approach explicit recognition liquidity regulation supervision must recognise equal importance capital regulation. individual institution demonstrate internal incentive structure liquidity risk may procyclical due link market credit risk, accelerator factors, mark-to-market effect asset value net worth. structural reliance short-term wholesale market funding, include via securitization, increase sensitivity bank balance sheet cost fund procyclical elements. therefore, regulatory policy need reflect appropriately true price fund liquidity financial institutions’ balance sheet – ensure market rely excessively central bank emergency liquidity support facility. area could consider include • improve fund risk management strengthen risk management governance control • introduction minimum quantitative fund liquidity buff high-quality liquidity asset bi review 72/2009 9 • introduction regulatory charge institution present higher-than-average liquidity risk price access central bank liquidity order encourage institution hold better-quality collateral. an effective global liquidity framework manage liquidity large, cross-border financial institution include internationally agree level liquidity buffers, encourage increase quality composition. such framework need comprehensive take account liquidity need overall institution. infrastructure otc derivative the explosion credit derivative offshoot (cdos etc) demonstrate clear need oversight transparency market. a note earlier, market credit default swap (cds) operate bilateral, over-the-counter (otc) basis grow many time size market underlie credit instruments. in light problem involve large player market, attention focus systemic risk pose cds. there global consensus need central counter party (ccp) otc derivative product accordingly effort on, us, eu elsewhere implement ccp cds. the development ccp facilitate great market transparency, include report price cds, trade volumes, aggregate open interest. the availability price information improve fairness, efficiency, competitiveness market — enhance investor protection facilitate capital formation. the degree transparency, course, depend extent participation ccp. if needed, incentive may provide national authorities, example, take high capital charge transaction clear central counterparties. in order foster transparency promote use ccp exchange trade credit derivatives, public authority also encourage financial industry standardize contract use data repository remain non-standardized contract promote fair open access central counterparty services. in order mitigate systemic risk result counterparty credit risk, short run, would also beneficial competitive environment central counterparties without impose regulatory requirement unduly fragment market. compensation risk management compensation among issue gain prominence contributory factor emergence global financial crisis explosion remuneration financial sector, particularly comparison trend rest economy. much attention give development sound practice principle international standard setters. it important reform regard do industry-wide basis, improve risk management compensation practice systemically important firm undermine unsound practice others. along enunciation principle practices, need look carefully inherent market incentive structure lead observe compensation practice financial sector. act flaw incentive structure likely effective regulatory prescriptions. risk management the fundamental weakness risk management practice reveal current crisis inability financial institution adequately monitor risk concentration across product geographical areas, shortcoming stress test inappropriate practice manage risk arise structure products. first foremost, remain responsibility private sector take lead strengthen firm-wide risk 10 bi review 72/2009 management frameworks. both management board director responsible put place adequate risk management control systems. generally, bank expect place effective internal policies, system control identify, measure, monitor, manage, control mitigate risk concentration timely manner, various conditions, include stress market situations. the supervisory authority would oversee compliance best practice capture firm-wide risk concentration arise on- off-balance sheet exposure securitization activities. transparency in recognition serious problem arisen, clear need great emphasis great market transparency techniques, data characteristics, caveat involve valuation complex financial instruments, improve information regard otc derivative market clear arrangement report exposure format permit regulator aggregate ass risk system whole. this would help investor perform due diligence currently outsource cras, also help latter good job measure tail risks. the fundamental issue two fold: standard setter work supervisor regulator reduce complexity account standard facilitate good assessment uncertainty surround valuation achieve consistency valuation method single set account standards. enforcement through expand financial stability forum, rename financial stability board, international monetary fund

international level regulatory cooperation. whereas principle outline regulatory overhaul increasingly well accepted, many challenge arise mode implementation, practicality. the first issue various proposal lead increase level regulatory capital economic cycle, extension capital requirement bank like institution currently unregulated lightly regulated, inevitably lead low profitability equity investors. the bargain power bank institution become weak current circumstance hence little observable protest regard proposal present. a financial crisis resolved, normalcy returns, expect financial industry utmost resist requirement high capital time. it challenge regulator government resist demand relaxation new capital requirements, enhance minimum level capital buff propose good times. the lobby power financial industry restore time hence authority need prepare challenges. low systemic profitability level also effective endogenously limit compensation level financial sector. bi review 72/2009 11 second, proposal provision contra-cyclical capital face significant implementation issues. regulator need significant technical work understand business cycle turn point recognised. what would trigger change capital buff either direction? would change kick-in anticipation business cycle turn post facto? how formation rule-based would change regulate institution know advance need do? an additional issue sphere arise possibility economic cycle occur different time different jurisdictions. this would necessitate great cross border cooperation home host regulator term applicable capital requirement different segment international financial conglomerate. an additional problem emes would lack adequate data business cycle identification. third, general agreement macro prudential regulation identification systemic risk like build asset bubbles. however, considerable technical work need do national international level identify risk are, systemic not, kind regulatory action would effective. in recent experience, example, ample awareness build global financial imbalances, asset price bubble, little agreement need done. even adequate work do identification systemic risk, regulatory measure necessary, enforcement methodology internationally. within national regulatory systems, issue relate inter-regulatory cooperation also arise, in-charge issue early warn system listen them? fourth, general agreement extension regulation systemically important institutions, market instruments. here issue implementation. how decide systemically important? considerable debate range around regulation hedge funds, come sizes, shape forms. some large, leveraged, others large leveraged, yet others small leverage otherwise. whereas may individual hedge fund equity pool systemically important, may collectively. furthermore, could collectively important systemically good times, become time extensive leveraging. similar story market instruments. thus work national international regulatory system cut regard. excessive regulation could indeed snuff entrepreneurship do carefully. fifth, great deal debate emerge around issue securitised credit offshoots. very

speech mr jürgen stark, member executive board european central bank, austrian industrial organisation, linz, 8 june 2009. * * * introduction follow default lehman brother mid-september last year, turmoil financial market start august 2007 turn major financial crisis. liquidity dry up, credit flow economy slow down. problem financial system quickly spill real economy, adverse feedback loop real economy financial sector emerged. this lead severe synchronise global economic downturn 80 years. the euro area spared. economic activity decline sharply, inflation low level since launch euro. monetary fiscal authority across globe respond quickly decisively extraordinary developments. in particular, background rapidly recede inflationary pressure risks, eurosystem take monetary policy liquidity management measure unprecedented nature, scope timing. since october last year reduce interest rate main refinance operation 325 basis points. we also provide unlimited liquidity support bank system euro area maintain flow credit. likewise, government euro area react swiftly stabilise financial system counteract adverse impact financial crisis real economy. look ahead, monetary fiscal authority need remain credible effective, fulfil respective responsibilities. in doing, lay solid foundation future economic recovery long-term economic growth job creation. the crisis show important independent central bank firmly commit objective price stability. at time, government must make strong credible commitment path fiscal consolidation thus comply stability growth pact. but must also resist temptation increase size stimulus measures, could erode trust sustainability public finance undermine effectiveness measure already adopted. in presentation today, i would like first analyse economic outlook discus detail policy measure take response crisis. i consider implication lesson draw crisis central bank monetary policy. economic outlook a. global economic situation let begin assessment global economic situation. the turmoil financial markets, trigger systematic under-pricing risk, particularly u sub-prime mortgage market, develop fully-fledged financial economic crisis global level. while world economy continue face severe synchronise downturn, recent international business confidence indicator suggest pace decline economic activity slow somewhat. most forecaster expect global economy likely recover 2010, albeit gradual pace. the june 2009 eurosystem staff bi review 72/2009 1 macroeconomic projection euro area, published, line overall assessment. they base assumption global economy outside euro area contract 1.6% year grow 2.1% 2010. nonetheless, economic prospect remain fraught uncertainty. compare month ago, overall risk global economic growth become balanced. a strong positive confidence effect expect trigger monetary fiscal policy measure could lead sustain recovery global demand global trade, quick normalisation financial market credit conditions. of course, global policy action fail strike appropriate balance economic stimulus longer-term sustainability, financial market condition could turn unfavourable again. global inflation rate continue diminish rapidly. this mainly due low commodity prices, weak labour market condition great global economic slack. risk global inflation seem broadly balance short medium term. beyond horizon, however, inflation risk depend efficiently authority withdraw policy stimulus. b. euro area activity in line global developments, economic activity euro area also contract sharply since second half 2008. the euro area economy shrink 4% past two quarters, bad decline since start economic monetary union. for current quarter, evidence economy shrink further, though slow pace. the economy long free fall; see first sign stabilisation. indicator consumer confidence business sentiment continue improve somewhat. we also see encourage sign normalisation financial markets. look ahead, euro area economy likely weak remainder year, gradually recover course 2010. the eurosystem staff projection real gdp growth broadly line recent forecast imf european commission. both institution expect euro area economy contract 4% 2009, follow gradual recovery 2010. quarterly growth rate expect return positive level mid-2010. the project gradual recovery reflect significant macroeconomic stimulus way measure take make financial system function normally inside outside euro area. c. euro area price development inflation euro area decline rapidly since reach high level, 4%, last summer. in may, euro area hicp inflation 0.0%, accord preliminary estimate eurostat. this low number register since launch euro. the rapid decline period primarily due mark fall global commodity prices, particularly oil prices. if exclude food energy, however, hicp inflation past year moderate marginally. in april, recent month data, hicp inflation exclude food energy 1.8%. inflation rate likely enter negative territory summer, expect turn positive end 2009. this largely explain base effect energy prices. these effect concern ecb, aim maintain price stability medium term. in words, monetary policy strategy aim ensure short-term volatility inflation rate lead volatility long-term inflation expectations. it important confuse temporarily negative inflation rate likely experience summer outright deflation. let remind difference: deflationary process persistent, broad-based self-sustaining fall overall price 2 bi review 72/2009 level. it reinforce anticipation price decline future. a consequence, inflation expectation become disanchored negative, firm household may decide postpone investment major purchases. in fact, experience moment describe period rapid disinflation. this link transitory movement relative price principle welcome development. provide medium-term inflation expectation remain well anchor level consistent price stability, low negative inflation rate short period time may help sustain real income may therefore stimulate spending. but even expect inflation rate turn positive end year, weak economic outlook euro area expect keep domestic price pressure contain time. accord eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, hicp inflation euro area likely moderate, zero, average year. inflation expect pick up, remain moderate level 2010. forecast produce european commission international organisation paint similar picture. the risk outlook view broadly balanced. however, long term, important current policy stimulus withdraw due course. d. monetary finance condition let turn monetary analysis, particularly useful assess risk price stability medium long term. the late money credit data support assessment diminish inflationary pressure medium term. the deceleration broad money growth observe 2008 increase towards turn year continue rapid pace. development money credit aggregate volatile past months. this may explain partly sharp reduction key ecb interest rates, may encourage shift allocation funds. if disregard volatility, continue deceleration pace underlie monetary expansion credit growth seem reflect sharp deterioration economic activity. a regard finance condition euro area, external finance cost decline since october last year, particularly sharply since start year. follow policy interest rate cuts, bank lend rate fall significantly. this indicate pass-through mechanism policy rate real economy continue function recent months, even though evidence banks’ margin widened. with credit spread across rat class decrease record high stock price rising, overall cost finance euro area non-financial corporation diminishing. in general, recent positive sign financial market point gradual improvement confidence among investors. policy measure i turn policy measure take response current crisis. both monetary fiscal policy-makers react forceful timely manner, aim restore confidence. and indeed, regard eurosystem’s monetary policy liquidity management measures, seem response bear fruit. confidence return financial markets, business survey pick up. i expect global domestic demand increasingly benefit significant economic stimulus measure take far bring financial system back normal functioning. monetary policy the ecb act timely, decisive appropriate manner since start financial market turmoil. we cut key policy rate 325 basis point since last october, escalate financial crisis lead rapid decline inflationary pressures. bi review 72/2009 3 the interest rate main refinance operation stand 1.0%, low level since launch euro. this level appropriate take account information analyses. money market rate fall even record lows, loan interest rate charge bank declined. our substantive monetary policy ease already felt real economy. in addition low policy interest rate quickly sharply, resort highly non-standard liquidity operation order provide financial system liquidity urgently needed. last october, adopt “fixed-rate full allotment” procedure open market operations. this give bank much central bank liquidity want key policy interest rate, expand list eligible collateral. couple fact essentially financially sound euro area credit institution participate eurosystem's refinance operations, measure significantly ease banks’ balance sheet constraints, thereby avoid sudden stop supply credit emergence systemic crisis. at govern council meet early may, decide extend maturity range liquidity-providing operation six 12 months. furthermore, decide eurosystem purchase euro-denominated cover bond issue euro area. last week announce detail purchase programme. these decision take enhance credit support economy banks. more specifically, measure aim promote ongoing decline money market term rates, encourage bank maintain expand lend clients, improve market liquidity important segment private debt security market, ease fund condition bank enterprises. these measure take account central role play euro area bank system finance economy. this contrast financial structure economic regions. the above-mentioned measure lead significant increase eurosystem’s balance sheet: reach peak 19% gdp december 2008 10% gdp mid-2007, €850 billion. this increase size balance sheet correspond high level outstanding refinance operations, consequently increase amount risk bear eurosystem. since peak december, size eurosystem’s balance sheet decline around €300 billion 15% gdp may 2009. this decline suggest gradual increase money market activity, least short maturities. the fact take additional risk coincidence. whenever liquidity dry market participant reluctant lend other, central bank step in, time put reputation risk. to summarise, employ wide range measure counter effect financial economic crisis. the approach follow tailor need euro area, bank system play important role finance major economies. these difference important implementation transmission monetary policy, therefore eurosystem’s reaction crisis cannot compare directly lead central banks. fiscal policy measure let turn fiscal policy reaction economic crisis. fiscal authority euro area demonstrate willingness capacity act rapidly coordinate manner exceptional circumstances. it important distinguish measure intend support bank sector fiscal policy measure aim stimulate demand. 4 bi review 72/2009 support bank sector government support bank sector necessary; safeguard stability financial system. the price success, however, government incur substantial fiscal cost credit risk ultimately bear taxpayers. follow adoption concert european action plan 12 october 2008, euro area government announce national measure support bank sector. these measure consist government guarantee interbank lending, recapitalisation financial institution difficulty, increase coverage retail deposit insurance asset relief schemes. overall, euro area government commit 23% euro area gdp financial sector support measures. for euro area, various support measure adopt far expect small direct impact government deficits, whereas impact debt expect 3% gdp. finally, contingent liability relate financial rescue measure expect 8% gdp, exclude government guarantee retail deposits. these figures, however, reflect different development take place across euro area countries. between end-september end-october 2008, concurrent announcement broad-based bank rescue packages, adverse shift market sentiment towards sovereign borrower occurred. it become expensive insure default euro area countries, change mood reflect significantly high sovereign cd premia euro area countries. this would suggest bank rescue package bring increase public sector credit risk. at time, long-term government bond yield spread vis-à-vis germany widen substantially euro area countries. these spread mainly reflect perception differ liquidity credit risk among countries. the fact development government bond yield spread mirror high sovereign cd premia suggest concern fiscal sustainability become important factor, affect investors’ perceptions. in particular, government bond yield spread seem high member state regard particularly vulnerable current environment. among relevant factor current fiscal imbalances, also external imbalances, could ultimately repercussion general government budget. past fiscal behaviour may also play role. rise long-term government bond yield may gradual impact government borrow costs, change interest rate affect cost newly issue debt debt variable interest rates. however, may signal reduce willingness part investor provide long-term fund well difficulty access capital market funds. so far, euro area country enjoy relatively low interest rate new government debt issuance, despite face considerably difficult market conditions. look ahead, economy recover competition finance increases, government may face high bond yield again. discretionary use fiscal policy in addition provide financial support bank sector, euro area government react forcefully counter negative impact financial turmoil real economy. besides operation automatic stabilisers, provide significant cushion euro area economy way low tax revenue high spend unemployment benefits, discretionary use fiscal policy help mitigate effect global economic downturn. however, fiscal stimulus measure need remain temporary combine measure ensure fiscal sustainability medium run. this preserve trust sustainability public finance support recovery long-term economic growth. bi review 72/2009 5 for 2009 2010, european commission estimate overall fiscal impulse euro area economy, measure change general government deficit, 4.6% gdp, 60% due automatic stabilisers. while recent coordinate fiscal loosen broadly accept legitimate necessary step short run, give exceptional economic circumstances, also entail significant fiscal burden. the late available economic forecast (ec spring 2009 economic forecasts) point dramatic development euro area public finances. in addition rapidly deteriorate general government deficit, expect 6% euro area gdp 2010, euro area debt ratio increase 15 percentage point 80% gdp 2010. in 2009 2010 13 16 euro area country expect budget deficit 3% gdp reference value. these figure high, though compare favourably major economic region also provide substantial fiscal impulse economy. the budget deficit unite kingdom unite state project 14% gdp 2010, whereas japan project 9% gdp. against backdrop, euro area country must reject call additional fiscal loosening. in current environment, fiscal stimulus likely counterproductive could hamper economic recovery two ways. first all, even high fiscal deficit could fuel market concern country’s ability meet future debt obligations, thus put upward pressure interest rates. second, increase budget deficit would also raise concern high tax burden future, thus induce consumer save rather spend additional income. let turn two important question regard fiscal authorities’ response economic crisis. first, measure potential restore confidence? second, measure effective? the financial sector support measures, combine eurosystem’s enhance credit support measures, successful safeguard stability financial system. together, initiative potential tackle crisis confidence root also take account fundamental role bank sector function economy. the restructure bank sector top policy priority, progress domain key economic recovery. give challenge lie ahead, bank take appropriate measure strengthen capital base and, necessary, take full advantage government support particular recapitalisation measures. a regard fiscal policy response, let first say merit discretionary measure le obvious safeguard function financial system. in principle, automatic stabiliser represent first line defence economic downturn. however, exceptional circumstance country room manoeuvre, fiscal policy contribute macroeconomic stability also discretionary actions. when assess merit different measure taken, differentiate measure (1) expenditure increase (2) tax cuts, (3) measure like guarantee loan subsidy specific sector economy. in fact, although support credit-constrained firm could ease access credit restructure balance sheets, may also lead inefficient allocation capital prop company would otherwise fail. moreover, type support would difficult reverse might act brake long-term growth. turn effectiveness fiscal measure stimulate demand (i.e. spend increase tax cuts), crucially depend behaviour economic agents, turn also affect size fiscal multiplier (i.e. gdp effect fiscal stimulus measures). the expectation high government spend today may lead high taxation future would induce household firm save rather spend additional income, thus reduce size fiscal multiplier. therefore, public perception overall fiscal sustainability play important role impact respective national fiscal stimuli. 6 bi review 72/2009 the effectiveness fiscal stimulus measure also depend extent private investor respond positively tax policy, investment likely responsive case “temporary” tax breaks, provide incentive bring forward future investment plans. at time, risk fiscal stimulus measure may crowd private investment put upward pressure interest rates. a regard size fiscal multiplier, empirical study (e.g. perotti (2002), blanchard perotti (2002), imf weo (2008)) show short term (i.e. one quarter) public spend multiplier large tax multipliers. by contrast, long term, revenue measure associate high growth fast recoveries. these result reflect theoretical keynesian prediction high disposable income tax cut saved, government purchase good service directly affect aggregate demand. however, evidence relative effectiveness different measure mixed. for euro area, measure adopt government estimate short-lived impact real gdp growth, limit year introduced. besides factors, effectiveness stimulus package depend large extent design implementation. fiscal stimulus measure “timely, temporary targeted”. “timely” mean measure take effect needed; delay assess cyclical situation, take decision implement measure may fail prevent drop output. “temporary” imply fiscal impulse last long recession question. “targeted” relate expect size multiplier effect. in addition “ttt” criteria, measure consistent policy objective fiscal sustainability, long-term economic growth function market mechanism. implication policy measure the current crisis increase role government economy. some bank rescue operation involve outright nationalisations, government significant exposure financial sector. similarly, large fiscal stimulus package adopt many country lead large increase size public sector economy. at time, turmoil interpret crisis market economy. it encourage critic market economy speak demand much large role economy governments. the financial system clearly need fundamental overhaul. financial institution take different approach adopt appropriate incentives. risk-takers liable reap reward action also bear responsibility consequences. we need strengthen regulation financial system, particular, must improve international cooperation national supervisor financial sector. but let hasten add policy-makers must get carry away recent events; act measure way, throw baby bathwater. while government alternative support systemically relevant financial institutions, should, rule, keep assistance specific sector firm minimum. and intervene, prepare clear credible exit strategies. no matter serious current crisis is, market economy remain best way organise economic affairs. it 20 year ago since breakdown socialist system eastern europe, demonstrate failure central plan heavy government involvement. therefore, emerge current crisis, role government economy need scale back. it presence bank sector must gradually reduce restructure sector start take effect. the stimulus measure must reverse due course. we see past so-called temporary measure end permanent. bi review 72/2009 7 an exit strategy comprehensive programme withdraw neutralise measure take financial crisis, without cause harm economy. if well-defined exit strategy, government may get bogged positive impact measure take may undermined. a well thought-out exit strategy need reassure economic agent timely restoration level play field different sector economy ultimate objective. a such, exit strategy need contain clear criterion time withdrawal financial support reversal fiscal stimuli. in principle, extra government debt incur asset acquisition cover future sale assets. the state guarantee serve stabilise bank system would need call on. a fiscal stimuli, euro area government lay clear exit strategy announce stimuli. some measure expire automatically explicitly design temporary. the possible difficulty reverse fiscal stimulus package may hind return sound fiscal position short run. under circumstances, peer pressure mechanism, eu fiscal framework based, may weaken thus make difficult return sound fiscal policies. a matter fact, country high fiscal deficit may tempt put political pressure peers. protract excessive deficit may undermine credibility eu fiscal framework, thus cast doubt fiscal sustainability jeopardise stability growth pact. in respect, let say current crisis teach u important lesson importance preserve public’s trust soundness public finances. at current juncture, euro area government must make credible commitment return sound fiscal policies. do full compliance stability growth pact credible exit strategy. this requires, first, full reversal fiscal stimulus measure take far. this necessary ensure efficient allocation resource minimise distortion incentive economic agent avoid permanent increase size public sector. second, government must live commitment maintain fiscal discipline. this mean credible fiscal consolidation plan implement early possible, include consolidation effort least 1% gdp per annum necessary. if euro area country practise fiscal restraint seriously, debt dynamic danger spiral control. the current crisis show important country consolidate good economic time build “fiscal reservoir” draw period “drought”. many euro area country fail so. they suddenly find turbulent environment burden high fiscal deficit debt ratios. their room fiscal manoeuvre limited, capacity adopt effective counter-cyclical measure needed. in addition, development government bond yield spread since last autumn show that, uncertain times, financial market increasingly discriminate country basis creditworthiness, include fiscal fundamentals. we see first, timid sign economic recovery; investor regain appetite risk. it critical euro area government boost confidence soundness public finance element support recovery long-term economic growth. a regard monetary policy, equally important draw strategy withdraw due course extraordinary measure implement announced. the ecb obviously cannot maintain current degree support indefinitely. we provide substantial short-term support financial system real economy, thereby ultimately maintain price stability. but macroeconomic condition warrant removal monetary stimulus? 8 bi review 72/2009 in fact, prepare take appropriate action macroeconomic environment improves. we ensure measure take quickly unwind liquidity provide absorbed. this includes, instance, unwind increase average maturity refinance operations. be prepare exit non-standard measure – soon macroeconomic condition justify move – help maintain price stability medium term ensure firm anchor longer-term inflation expectations. any change operational framework course communicate good time. the ecb eurosystem remain commit pursue timely transparent communication policy. likewise, financial sector need live responsibility become dependent long-term fund ecb’s refinance operations. it important financial sector also help restore confidence among banks. japan, since early 1990s, exemplify economic damage result promptly restructure ail financial system. some early attempt policy-makers stimulate economy downturn ineffective lead high inflation. the 1970s come mind, surge oil price lead persistently high inflation low economic growth. unsurprisingly, people wonder exceptional measure take central bank fiscal authority current crisis result another period high inflation. but situation today different 1970s. the eurosystem’s objective maintain price stability medium term, nothing else. all monetary policy decision since financial crisis erupt take order safeguard price stability symmetric way. maintain price stability remain objective guide decisions. this imply accommodative monetary policy stance pursue reverse economy start recover upside risk price stability emerge again. the people euro area trust commitment deliver price stability know independent subject outside influence. lesson monetary policy crisis let turn important lesson i think draw current crisis respect monetary policy. i would like raise three points. first all, current crisis demonstrates, again, important central bank remain independent political influence. even experience bad economic downturn since 1930s, long-term inflation expectation euro area remain solidly anchor line ecb’s definition price stability. this represent strong reassure protection deflationary spiral, result market agent trust commitment ability deliver price stability. our independence, clear mandate precise definition price stability crucial factor maintain inflation expectation firmly anchor challenge times. secondly, although central bank may charge additional task aftermath crisis, primary objective must remain maintenance price stability. we cannot allow conflict interest arise. the high-level expert group head jacques de larosière, former governor bank france manage director imf, identify number weakness supervisory framework inside outside europe contribute build-up current crisis. one group’s proposal give ecb responsibility so-called macro-prudential supervision. this mean supervision aim limit risk distress financial system whole, extend supervision individual financial institutions. build de larosière report, european commission recently propose establish european systemic risk council (esrc), chair ecb president. bi review 72/2009 9 the ecb welcome commission’s proposal. establish esrc substantially improve present institutional arrangement risk assessment eu level. much work do esrc also useful assess risk price stability. but i would also like stress maintain price stability must remain primary objective eurosystem. with one tool disposal – interest rate – cannot achieve one objective. therefore, particularly important risk warn new council translate policy action responsible authority effectively possible. the ecb cannot use policy interest rate mitigate risk directly relate price stability. at time, price stability best contribution make financial stability. my third point concern important role play monetary analysis – particular role asset price – assess risk price stability medium term. price stability primary objective, imply focus short medium-term movement inflation. any build-up financial imbalance could pose risk price stability long term could overlook restrictive short-term approach. the ecb’s assessment risk price stability well equip detect type risk base comprehensive economic monetary analysis – well-known two-pillar strategy. the first pillar, economic analysis, common central banks. this analysis basically consist identify risk price stability short medium term analyse interplay aggregate supply aggregate demand economy. the second pillar, monetary analysis, play prominent role ecb central banks. the ecb pay special attention monetary development recognition fact monetary growth inflation closely relate medium long term. analyse development credit, particular loan private sector, helpful extract relevant signal monetary developments. this analysis also imply regular monitor asset price development implications. this analysis become even prominent future. the ecb pioneer come monetary analysis, benefit hindsight, say monetary analysis serve u well recent years. back 2005, monetary analysis already indicate upward risk price stability come strong growth money credit, drive rapid increase asset prices, house price particular. this lead u increase interest rate series step start december 2005, time economic analysis provide mix signals. the decision tighten monetary policy early stage may one reason financial imbalance euro area develop far countries. conclusion to conclude, let summarise main points. the world economy bad recession since 1930s, euro area economy exception. the fiscal monetary authority respond forcefully effort slowly start bear fruit. the pace economic contraction appear slow down, confidence indicator improve somewhat. the crisis highlight importance sound public finances. government need consolidate good economic time order room manoeuvre not-so-good times. with respect monetary policy, crisis demonstrate importance independent central bank credibly commit price stability. the pre-crisis year also show usefulness monetary analysis, second pillar eurosystem’s assessment risk price stability. in particular, help maintain medium-term perspective. 10 bi review 72/2009 look ahead, fiscal monetary authority important role sustain economic recovery. government must devise enact credible strategy exit bank sector ensure discretionary policy measure adopt crisis reversed. their full compliance stability growth pact best tool solidly anchor market expectations. furthermore, ecb’s commitment maintain price stability best contribution monetary policy make sustain economic recovery long-term economic growth. the ecb well prepare take appropriate action also exit non-standard monetary policy liquidity management measure credible manner macroeconomic environment improves. most importantly, continue deliver expect deliver, maintain price stability, provide anchor confidence difficult times. reference blanchard, o. r. perotti (2002).

household saw present value save decline asset price dropped. together factor cause effective demand economy simultaneously stay behind productive potential, result major global recession. a whole crisis start bubble house market, country also hit slump property prices; true coastal area u.s.a., also european country like spain ireland. the burst bubble, financial market crisis recession real economy time make current situation particularly challenging. we know historical comparison recession go along bank crisis tend especially long severe3; see phenomenon sweden, norway japan. therefore, government world charge take require measure timely well targeted. if want adhere audacity hope, also need audacity change; therefore, new instrument need brave step warranted. the neglect risk consequence one main reason mess general misperception risk. in financial industries, many believe innovation like structure asset-backed security would improve diversification risk thereby help reduce markets’ vulnerability adverse shocks. however, risk never actually trade away, stay concentrate book financial corporation involved. there nothing wrong risk diversification, obviously something wrong innovative product complex understand people originate distribute them. and something wrong market properly understand participant 2 andrea m. maechler li lian ong (2009) “foreign bank cese countries: in penny, pound?” imf work paper 54/09. 3 carmen m. reinhart kenneth s. rogoff (2008) “is 2007 u.s. sub-prime financial crisis so different? an international historical comparison“ nber work paper no. 13761. bi review79/2009 7 participant know party must come end soon keep dance music playing4. a second misperception respect risk belief financial globalization would reduce country risk grow opportunity international risk sharing. the core idea risk share individual country risk negatively correlated, home country affect negative shock, foreign country face positive shock time, return country would protect internationally diversify investor domestic income losses. but increase financial globalization make easy investor invest different countries, also make easy financial crisis spread across borders. if international investor recover crisis country a, might start sell asset country b, way affect sign crisis. this kind crisis transmission, sometimes also refer contagion, far mostly affect emerge markets; first time witness phenomenon global scale. a consequence crisis, global risk perception shift towards prudent assessment, like often financial markets, market tend overshoot, go risk ignorance high degree risk aversion. such overshoot currently take place regard spread government bond europe. whereas interest german 10-year government bond decreasing, several european country face high interest rates, partially explain soar demand liquidity, course high german papers. the rather unusual increase interest spread austrian sovereign debt versus germany addition associate exposure austrian bank central eastern europe. 4 widely quote statement chuck prince, ceo citigroup, ft interview july 9, 2007 “when music stops, term liquidity, thing complicated. but long music playing, you’ve get get dance. we’re still dancing.“ 8 bi review 79/2009 in respect i want clarify central eastern europe’s economic potential still intact, growth rate region exceed western europe u.s. year come, investment still view asset rather liabilities. the euro shield stormy time refer particularly negative episode austrian world financial history, paul krugman correctly stated: “smaller country – like austria 1931 – may mercy financial tides, unable control economic destiny”5. now, austria become big country unhappy days, something else change favor since then: member european union part euro area. in contrast previous crises, time effort fight recession part coordinate european macroeconomic recovery plan upon european commission eu member state already agree november 2008. if compare situation last recession enter eu, take place early 1990s, monetary union key trade partner helpful prevent competitive devaluation neighbor country harm economy back then. in sense, euro work shield small open economy europe. what need do now? policy maker confront two main task moment. on one hand must restore stability financial market bring back liquidity, recapitalizing bank get toxic asset banks’ balance sheets. in europe, example serve guidance deal bank crisis, instance swedish finnish experience early 1990s. (if anything, austrian experience 1930s would rather qualify example save banks.) in austria already take measure establish confidence among savers, government also present stabilization package banks, allot 100 billion euro, roughly 1/3 austrian gdp; 15 billion euro reserve recapitalizing banks, 75 billion bank guarantee additional 10 billion insure domestic deposit protection. in term gdp, austrian banks’ stabilization package among big eu. 5 paul krugman (2009) “the return depression economics crisis 2008“, norton, page 4. bi review79/2009 9 10 bi review 79/2009 the second task face fight global recession prevent turn last depression. this challenge monetary fiscal policy. the main objective monetary policy euro area always preserve price stability, current state affair mean prevent deflation. i assure that, govern council ecb take available measure stabilize inflationary expectation euro area keep anchor positive terrain. we keep interest rate low long time required, stand ready use unconventional measure quantitative ease assure european firm consumer access credit appropriate conditions. a fiscal policy, necessity large timely stimulus package obvious. olivier blanchard others imf6 explain concisely late last year stimulus package look like. it broad-based crisis hit economy whole; fairly long-term crisis won’t go away next quarter; support many country possible global crisis time beggar-my-neighbor policies. although automatic stabilizer european country help adjust loss effective demand, additional discretionary spend needed. the crisis also highlight difference eu u.s. term fiscal policy. while two region roughly comparable economic size, eu lack federal budget like u.s. in time crisis, timely target action warranted, eu budget 1% total gdp rather shiftless compare u.s. federal budget 20% gdp. in term fiscal policy, european country mostly fight recessions. like u.s., state within eu affect way crisis; eu member state hit severely crisis also one amass high budget deficit quickly therefore find hard finance stimulus spending. some new eu member state affect rather harshly crisis already, unfortunately understand yet remain country assist country act european solidarity, also economic interest support country relatively high import demand products. like so-called “tequila crisis” 1995, immediately understand politician washington help mexico best interest u.s., thankfully charge administration know deal situation. it also take time policy maker europe recognize best interest europe pave way european initiative economic stabilization recovery. for instance, european council level head state government, already decide double ceiling eu’s support facility balance-of-payments assistance 50 billion euro. what shall do future? if macroeconomic policy work together well-coordinated way globally, i convince master crisis successfully prevent global depression. but also change financial system way crisis occur again. now concluding, let briefly point idea change global financial system look like. first, need cooperation even integration international financial supervision authorities. that mean end formerly common practice institution shop around low level regulation globe hence minimize degree supervision. next, i think must increase number institution subject 6 olivier blanchard, antonio spilimbergo, steve symansky, carlo cottarelli (2008). “fiscal policy crisis,” imf staff position note, december 29, 2008. bi review79/2009 11 regulation moment reserve commercial banks. put simple, every single institution capacity create kind trouble fail bank may create regulate like bank; i think highly leverage institution hedge funds, need regulate generally understood. then take close look function rat agencies. they wrong enron, wrong subprime market yet rat continue enormous importance access credit many firm even governments. a importance base assumption superior information hold agencies, i really wonder assumption sustain longer. the crisis show importance international cooperation importance financial institution like imf, eib ebrd, able help quickly provide country need appropriate credit lines. whereas european union consider establish certain institution least fund exist institution generously, global level imf re-established essential role. with respect conditionality imf loan might well question wisdom market whether useful contain public spend strongly turn severe crisis generations. but result g20 summit show willingness necessary close cooperation among big economy there. the agree upon increase credit lines, additional fund imf creation special draw rights, measure provide stimulus effective global demand, new approach financial market regulation help u ensure financial stability control trim shadow bank system. therefore, confident crisis contained, recovery won’t take long time coming; prosperity grow again, sustainably balance manner. 12 bi review

16 june 2009. * * * good morning lady gentleman it great pleasure i welcome today presentation afreximbank. i extend particularly warm welcome dr oramah mr chafa. this critical element might call frontier expansion policy, create extend link core role central bank wide pasture trade real economy. last month date, bank co-hosting first seminar islamic financial service board mauritius. today’s event fruit collaboration two institutions, afreximbank bank mauritius. on occasion board meet afreximbank hold mauritius december last, i draw attention president chairman board afreximbank, mr jean-louis ekra, lack awareness afreximbank’s programme facility business community i express view knowledge afreximbank’s product could represent useful tool promotion market product diversification trade. i extremely delight president afreximbank respond positively request i convey heartfelt thank him. today’s event give opportunity share think role international trade trade finance, especially context current economic turmoil, paul krugman put seminal book “the return depression economics”; “malign neglect” “shadow bank system” lead “loss traction” central bank steady real economy storm. international trade over many years, see country progressively open economy international trade, either multilateral trade system, increase regional cooperation part outward-oriented domestic reform programs. we go beyond system third world merely exporter raw material importer manufactures. international trade nowadays back internet create efficiency raise standard condition living. it enable nation produce high efficiency scale. it help increase productivity. it allow instant spread knowledge idea range choice available consumer expand continuously. trade globalization without doubt bring enormous benefit many country citizen world. we might disagree exact modality sequence trade tariff reforms, u would dispute international trade major driver global economic growth since end second world war. trade expansion boost post-war economic recovery lead economy today; germany japan notable example come mind. it figure large “growth miracles” asian tigers, mauritius, also china! but happen without country face crises. bi review79/2009 1 the impact crisis trade finance today face bad economic crisis generation crisis threaten undo economic development many country achieve far. undoubtedly world trade one bad casualty global financial crisis. this even threaten “erode people’s faith open international trade system.” the negative impact world trade find way two main channels. first credit crunch result financial market turbulence lead fall supply trade finance, rightly describe oil wheel international trade; secondly spillover financial crisis real economy cause bad recession since great depression fuel contraction trade volumes. and u believe open trade almost article faith, watch grow disbelief threat protectionism start rear ugly head. a economic activity collapse unemployment soar many countries, protectionist sentiment rise along attraction trade-distorting policies. many country implement domestic stimulus package aim protect business industries, favour domestic good service sometimes expense imports. policy-makers perfectly aware policy action international implication – short term boost domestic demand long term, undermine international trade system global wealth welfare. outlook world trade 2009 if look prospect world trade 2009, see world bank predict volume world trade good service decrease around 6 percent. accord world trade organisation (wto), collapse global demand expect drive manufacture export roughly 9 percent volume terms. international trade thus forecast continue deteriorate even emergence wide consensus argue 2009 global economy shrink recession strikes. against bleak backdrop, i believe important put thing right perspective. yes, trade powerful engine transmit shocks, whether positive negative, one part globe another. but, no, certainly cause collapse demand. the financial crisis, transmute global economic crisis, drive world economy now! lesson previous crisis crisis are, without doubt, challenge time bring along wealth lesson opportunity will learn past mistakes. a u president obama recently put it: must waste opportunity crisis presents. the destructive protectionist streak aftermath great depression serf stark reminder danger revert beggar-thy-neighbour policy past. we learn lesson scarcity trade finance unavoidable crises. the experience south east asian country time asian financial crisis decade ago; russia 1997-98; turkey 2000-01; brazil argentina argentine crisis 2001-02, still resonate minds. another lesson learn multilateral cooperation also help make trade finance affordable resilient time crisis. wto advocate cooperation among stakeholder trade finance market keep flow trade finance going. among measure propose g20 summit injection usd250 billion support trade

conclusion round. this view share wto director-general lamy, who, underscore importance conclude doha round, warn “the stress test multilateral trade system still come”. i align view mutual benefit trade important preserve interest one maintain enhance trade openness costs. indeed i strongly believe that, protectionist sentiment notwithstanding, trade continue function hand-maiden economic

economic times. this give opportunity articulate position regard strong lobby exporter favour continue depreciation currency. export lobby clamour depreciation rupee ensure competitiveness, guarantee survival. but need look side coin – consumer producer price inflation arise pass-through high import prices. at time one main concern protect people purchase power, intervention bank mauritius keep rupee depreciate level would inappropriate, would also irresponsible! and put rest, all, rupee depreciation mantra, i need add recent imf mission propose re-classify exchange rate regime manage float freely floating. i remind french writer, jean baptiste poquelin – many probably know famous name, molière. molière one well-known play, “le bourgeois gentilhomme”. le bourgeois gentilhomme molière

this put u top category country like uk us. this opportune time embark drastic overhaul exchange rate regime; proposal however offer food think shape thing come emerge new economic order. financial

“preparing recovery” is! in addition inescapable “regulatory soul-searching”, financial crisis global recession also warrant revolution way think conduct business. go well-trodden path pessimism wait

crisis speech mr jean-claude trichet, president european central bank, conference organise nueva economía fórum the wall street journal europe, madrid, 22 june 2009. * * * lady gentlemen, i would like thank organiser invite today talk ecb’s policy action time truly unprecedented challenge – financial system, business large small drive economy citizen spain, euro area beyond. a might remember, i madrid five year ago give speech “the challenge european economy 2004”. at time one important issue whether economic recovery become apparent second half 2003 would gather momentum. another important issue need economic policy would make euro area economy resilient sudden sometimes unexpected event foster potential sustainable long term growth. needle say, challenge euro area currently face different order magnitude 2004. yet, fundamental level, key issue similar, namely pave way robust recovery increase long term growth potential sustainable manner. in view two question – cyclical structural – closely entwined. to restore confidence near-term long-term future, policymakers euro area elsewhere must maintain appropriate balance bold short-term action return path sustainable medium term. a i explain, ecb’s policy action since onset financial crisis time bold strongly anchor medium-term framework monetary policy strategy. we first act sign financial stress emerge back august 2007. we step forcefully breach collapse major financial player abroad threaten global financial stability last autumn, embark full allotment mode fix rate supply liquidity. and recent months, deepen set measure call policy “enhanced credit support”. all measure use share two crucial features: first, design effective preserve function money market, appropriate finance economy take account significant rebalancing inflationary risks; second, easily unwind financial crisis attenuate see risk future rise inflation. these two feature ensure measure take fully consistent ecb’s primary objective, preserve price stability euro area medium term. beyond monetary policy, i see two policy priority go forward. first, government need spell envisage unwind crisis-related fiscal stimulus measure return sustainable fiscal position medium term. this particularly important substantial support financial sector might still needed. while support often directly affect fiscal balances, create contingent liability may cater for. second, urgent need reform global financial architecture distract need progress labor product market reform euro area. rigorous implementation lisbon reform agenda remain press ever, increase productivity efficiency foster development private sector, also facilitate return sustainable fiscal positions. bi review 78/2009 1 in remark today, i would like first recall origin crisis. i explain detail various action ecb take support euro area economy financial system. before concluding, i also say word specific challenge currently face spanish economy. the root financial crisis propagation over past ten years, witness dramatic shift focus large part financial sector – away facilitate trade real investment towards unfettered speculation financial gambling. to clear, i deny financial liberalisation financial innovation past two decade make important contribution overall productivity economies. for example, securitisation asset – transformation bilateral loan tradable credit instrument – tremendous potential diversification efficient management economic risk. but way securitisation implement also mean bank non-banks able sell loans, also often place fully off-balance sheet immediately extended. this weaken incentive conduct prudent screen constant monitor loans. this true recent product innovation field securitisation. it true financial innovation two hundred year old: cover bonds. i return asset class give detail assessment i describe ecb’s recent policy actions. the credit boom exacerbate three multipliers. first, incentives: ill-designed compensation scheme loan manager trader reinforce shorten time horizons. second, complexity: increasingly complicate opaque financial instrument make difficult holder security ass quality underlie investments. and third, global macroeconomic imbalances: chronic shortage save industrialise economy make possible excess save part world. this act multiplier exacerbate year immediately precede crisis sharply rise price oil commodities. in mid-2007, suddenly though unexpectedly, interaction perverse incentives, excessive complexity global imbalance throw credit boom reverse. the asset cycle turned, many miss link financial chain exposed. the collapse mid-september last year major financial player, turn large-scale crisis confidence global financial panic. a intensity crisis become evident, financial intermediary restore liquidity buffers, scale balance sheet tighten lend conditions. financial institution dramatically reduce exposure risk imprudently accumulate phase financial euphoria. collectively, engage large-scale process “deleveraging”. banks’ intermediation reduce aggregate, loan company curtailed. the credit squeeze toll real economy set in. ecb policy action financial crisis a i said, ecb take swift forceful action mitigate effect crisis event unfolded. we first act back august 2007, temporarily provide day 1 turmoil unlimited liquidity preserve normal possible function money market. allow stress measure together support measure euro area government yield one important result sometimes seem overlooked: single failure systematically relevant financial institution euro area. this achievement whose importance cannot overstated. 2 bi review 78/2009 the ecb’s policy action time carefully calibrate structure euro area economy. this relate particular financial structure, differ profoundly unite states, example. the euro area largely bank-centred financial system, whereas unite state primarily market-based. a number illustrate differences. at end 2007, stock outstanding bank loan private sector amount around 145% gdp euro area. the correspond proportion bank loan gdp unite state 63%. this mean bank sector twice important euro area unite states. it also mean effective, ecb policy must focus first foremost bank sector. the euro area financial structure i describe provide background policies. these policy guide monetary policy strategy, key element quantitative definition price stability. we aim inflation rate below, close to, 2% medium term. the precise quantification policy objective prove invaluable asset, fail-safe mechanism excessive swing inflation expectations, downwards much upwards. long-term inflation expectation euro area, whether base survey extract financial indicators, exceptionally resistant sudden short-term price changes. we ensure inflation expectation remain impervious short-term change inflation, even face sharply fall inflation. the ecb’s response financial crisis line euro area financial structure medium-term objective. since intensification financial crisis september last year – background rapidly recede inflationary pressure –, take monetary policy measure unprecedented nature, scope magnitude. these measure fall two categories: first, conventional measure form interest rate changes; second, become know “non-standard” measures. the latter measure take together constitute call ecb’s policy enhance credit support. these specific action take sustain flow credit beyond could achieve interest rate reduction alone. interest rate action before explain detail core element policy enhance credit support, i would like talk briefly interest rate – conventional indicator monetary policy. since october last year cut key policy rate total 325 basis points. it stand 1%, historical low ecb also national central bank predecessors. money market yield long overnight maturity fall even strongly policy rate. this important mean crucial element monetary policy transmission mechanism intact. borrower euro area directly benefit low level six-month twelve-month money market rate widely use bank set float rate loan household companies. this particularly true spain float rate loan widespread, example respect mortgage loans. enhance credit support let turn exceptional policy action take response crisis – so-called “non-standard” measures. a already mentioned, significant stress interbank market first manifest august 2007, ecb immediately step breach accommodate temporarily elevate liquidity demand bank fix rate operation full allotment, provide €95 billion market within hours. overnight lend kind continue provide albeit bi review 78/2009 3 low volume follow three days. so say ecb first central bank crisis engage non-standard measures. liquidity management measure when mid-september 2008 interbank trade come virtual halt, ecb engage new mode liquidity provision. we start provide refinance well level bank absorb fulfil reserve requirement normal times. let explain this. there three main build block new liquidity management approach. 1) our primary concern maintain availability credit household company accessible rates. we significantly adapt regular operation crisis. since then, follow new “fixed rate full allotment” tender procedure significantly expand maturity operations. bank grant access essentially unlimited liquidity policy interest rate maturity six months. on 7 may decide lengthen maturity refinance operations, introduce new one-year operation, first take place day tomorrow. to appreciate fully change mean, let u step back moment look normal times. in normal times, auction give amount central bank credit, mainly refinance operation one-week maturity, let competition among bidder determine interest rate credit become available bank system whole. this mean liquidity injection restrain policy decision. last autumn, change that. a demand liquidity individual institution expand abnormally market dramatically cease allocate liquidity, turn practice around. we determine lend rate – low level – stand ready fill shortage liquidity might occur interest rate maturity six months. this mean currently act surrogate market term liquidity allocation price-setting. 2) the second build block new liquidity management approach list asset take collateral. this list already large crisis, enlarge even accept even wide range security collateral. government security account 44% nominal value security list. the rest private securities. in contrast many central banks, ecb already intermediate private paper crisis even strengthen aspect crisis accept even wide range private paper. the total value eligible security currently €12.2 trillion, equivalent 130% gdp euro area. this ample eligibility collateral dramatically ease banks’ liquidity constraint crisis and, ultimately, encourage extend new credit continue roll mature loans. 3) the first two build block offer unlimited refinance wide range collateral. but reach financial system couple third build block, namely large number counterparties always able take part refinance operations. even crisis, 1,700 counterparties fulfil relevant criteria. this number high time major central banks. follow change operational framework october 2008, number rise even further. our measure safeguard bank system’s access liquidity result considerable expansion eurosystem’s balance sheet, reach peak 19% gdp height crisis around turn year. since then, see liquidity flow move back balance sheet money market. this sign improve 4 bi review 78/2009 confidence favourable conditions. we therefore see indication function money market improving. cover bond purchase another unconventional element add may: outright purchase cover bonds. this measure complement liquidity management measure i described. cover bond debt security issue banks, give access fund longer-term nature ecb’s refinance operations. cover bond thus allow bank manage maturity mismatch asset liabilities. why decide engage purchase particular asset class? several reason guide decision. first, i already stressed, euro area measure support flow credit non-financial sector need operate first foremost banks. cover bond major source fund bank euro area intensification financial crisis last autumn, cover bond market virtually shut down. the govern council come conclusion eurosystem could help revive market, term liquidity, issuance spreads, engage outright purchase cover bonds. already announcement 7 may, carry purchase, wave new issuance cover bond degree compression spreads. this true particular spanish banks, traditionally significant issuers, also bank country cover bond much le widespread. the effect liquidity expect take place actual program conducted. let stress purchase – like policy – target euro area whole particular country. our purchase benefit bank issue cover bond also bank hold assets. more importantly, beyond banks, purchase benefit real economy, obtain fund banks. second, cover bond different nature variety asset-backed security become popular turn sour financial crisis. importantly, cover bond involve transfer credit risk underlie asset issuer investor. the credit risk stay originator, preserve incentive prudent credit risk evaluation monitoring. we could thus say cover bond incentive compatible many asset-backed security not, least way concept implement crisis. in year precede crisis, bank tend favour issuance asset-backed security issuance cover bonds, form finance appear cheap environment characterise heavy underprice credit risk. give financial crisis clearly expose dire consequence underpricing, usefulness conservative asset class cover bonds, prove safe asset time obvious. i believe cover bond asset-backed security contribute thrive capital market, cater different set investor issuers. last least, ecb’s measure enhance credit support design full respect euro area macroeconomic framework, found clear division task policy responsibility ecb national authorities. financial support measure potentially involve significant transfer credit risk financial institution taxpayer clearly fall realm fiscal policy. the decide outright purchase cover bond fully consistent fundamental principle. while expect effective support credit, purchase burden eurosystem excessive credit risk therefore limit flexibility conduct monetary policy. bi review 78/2009 5 before concluding, allow word challenge face spanish economy. over last decade spanish economy show strong performance term output particular employment growth. spain dispose world-class company important sector include energy, communication banking. spain hard hit reassessment risk financial sector overall change economic sentiment since intensification global crisis last autumn. the spanish economy also face specific challenges, stem part macroeconomic imbalance develop many year relate sharp reversal house construction boom. for many year strong growth domestic demand lead relatively high inflation. the persistent inflation labour cost differential average euro area expansion hamper competitiveness regained. the present situation suggest need labour market reform wage moderation particular discontinue wage indexation. appropriate structural reform support sustainable economic upswing also consolidation public finances, crucial spain entire euro area, confidence restored. conclusion a i note begin speech, current environment clearly much challenge five year ago. at time question whether economic recovery euro area sufficiently robust. currently, still downturn phase – downturn globally prove deep since second world war. while first sign pace economic weaken decelerating, must remain alert. we uncharted waters, still risk sudden emergence unexpected financial turbulence. this said, overarch aim must restore confidence, take measure solidly anchor expectation household companies, lay groundwork return sustainable prosperity. this call bold yet solidly ground response. we must maintain balance need take immediate action commensurate gravity today’s situation, equally undeniable obligation return path sustainable medium term. the ecb part necessary continue solid reliable anchor stability confidence challenge times. i thank attention. 6 bi review 78/2009 thomas jordan: low

central bank also remarkable area liquidity management. first, enhance information share collective monitor market development and, late on, mean coordinate step provide liquidity, central bank cooperate start crisis guarantee smooth function global money market provide support international bank system. the first initiative direction agreement december 2007 eurosystem u federal reserve grant loan u dollar euro area counterparties connection fed’s term auction facility. the need strengthen liquidity provision order address global liquidity squeeze ease pressure international money market also lead central bank adjust operational framework order increase effectiveness expand ability reach market stress. this result certain degree international convergence operational frameworks. a part adjustment operational frameworks, central bank extend lend institution depository banks, include non-bank financial institution even directly real sector. bi review 78/2009 1 direct lend real sector represent significant deviation traditional central bank practice use bank main channel transmission central bank liquidity. but area crisis prompt central banker reconsider exist practices. the issue optimal response monetary policy asset price bubble also re-examined, prevail view – postulate central bank’s policy interest rate blunt instrument address bubble – come much strict scrutiny subject past decade. finally, need strengthen role central bank preserve financial stability also become focus policy debate effort make address cause crisis. the recognition market failure well regulatory supervisory deficiency root crisis prompt relevant public private forum make significant effort identify weakness international financial sector develop measure restore smooth functioning. in case europe, increase concern current prudential framework base national regulatory supervisory regime cannot address many challenge arise activity large, complex highly interdependent financial institution operate across borders. to sum up, current crisis likely bring important change future economic financial system live. these include change nature relationship degree coordination among different policy public authorities, revision regulatory supervisory domain well reform international financial architecture. therefore, likely witness number institutional change bring new environment policy-making number area relate central banking. 2. a new environment central banking? i like share think potential new environment. in order so, i organise intervention around six specific issue among view deserve particular attention: 1. should increase policy coordination domestic level? 2. should international monetary policy coordination? 3. should see international convergence liquidity frameworks? 4. should central bank increase direct lend real economy? 5. should asset price give weight monetary policy considerations? 6. should central bank involve supervision? 2.1 more domestic policy coordination? a seen, policy response global european level characterise increase degree coordination. a natural question, therefore, seem whether future great policy coordination level euro area eu warranted. give existence single currency euro area, i first focus coordination among national fiscal policies. on fiscal side, key challenge future prevent financial crisis eventually undermine sustainability credibility public finances. what prevent happening? at point, let reiterate stability growth pact already provide coordination device fiscal policy and, particular, provide peer pressure mechanism sound sustainable public finances. it provide appropriate framework conduct coordination fiscal policy good time also bad times. 2 bi review 78/2009 the challenge time crisis is, thus, use exist mechanism best effect. to put rather bluntly, tinker keel wind strong; pact already flexible enough allow room policy adjust without undermine foundation sustainable path. indeed, eu country already face considerable long-term challenge cost associate population age bear mind consider short-term demand policies. if start position le strong, inappropriate short-term response may make u literally “age faster” expose even strongly need adjustment cope long-term challenges. country large deficit and/or debt level may particularly vulnerable regard. unfortunately, many euro area country enter financial crisis economic downturn unnecessarily weak fiscal balances, miss opportunity present past years’ revenue windfall consolidate budgets. while never popular message even normal times, still deserve mention mistake avoid crisis passed. indeed one fiscal policy error prior include 2000-01 mistakenly interpret budgetary improvement good time evidence structural improvements, often use motivate spend increase tax cuts. on positive note, say compliance stability growth pact first ten year somewhat uneven, eu’s overall fiscal performance term avoid high budget deficit build-up government debt much good decade precede pact.1 indeed, eu country comply stability growth pact take advantage relatively large automatic stabiliser much work. these accomplishment guide beacon. sound fiscal policy strong keel provide basis stability necessary condition good long-term growth challenge sea ahead. one additional dimension policy coordination euro area single monetary policy national fiscal policy member states. in respect, institutional set-up european monetary union consist clear efficient assignment objective instrument different authorities, together strict division responsibilities. the ecb must focus primary mandate deliver medium-term price stability condition full independence. fiscal policy must focus traditional objective relate allocation, redistribution stabilisation (to vary extents), contribute maintain environment macroeconomic stability. of course, set monetary policy ecb take account fiscal policy stance, one factor contribute outlook price stability medium term. it go without say open exchange view information among different authority welcome enhance common understand desirable objective strategy pursue them. however, cannot scope active ex-ante coordination fiscal monetary policies. indeed, commitment ex ante coordination fiscal monetary policy may blur responsibility various authority expense accountability may ultimately reduce incentive pursue objectives. thus, current macroeconomic policy framework euro area base separation responsibility appropriate ensure sustain non-inflationary economic growth. 2.2 more international monetary policy coordination? while cooperation field liquidity management unprecedented scale certainly one hallmark public response current turmoil, another example without precedent central bank coordination decision ecb five 1 see article entitle “ten year stability growth pact”, ecb monthly bulletin, october 2008. bi review 78/2009 3 major central bank ease global monetary condition 8 october 2008. commentator observer wonder whether concert policy decision may begin new era increase international monetary policy coordination response economic financial globalisation. it important stress coordinate interest rate cut take specific context specific objective. there extraordinary uncertainty time economic outlook strong evidence upside risk price stability diminish global level. the coordinate cut address need respond common shock transmit around globe almost simultaneously. through joint communication, international central bank community provide signal strong commitment respond macroeconomic implication financial market turmoil. there doubt past three decade trade, economic financial linkage among different region work grow tighter, course policy-makers take account design policies. however, talk international policy coordination, important define clearly mean. policy coordination mean, course, central bank need adopt policy stance entire world certainly cannot surrogate domestic macroeconomic prudence weaken commitment central bank institutional objective. indeed, difference cyclical positions, structure economy (e.g. term market rigidity frictions, sectoral leverage, financial systems, etc.), monetary policy institutional framework well shock hit economy almost necessarily lead difference decide appropriate monetary policy stance. thus, systematic monetary policy coordination may eventually come cost weaken central bank’s commitment institutional objective. for central banks, international policy coordination good understand continuous cooperation exchange information staff decision-making levels, share experience mutual understand trust, much lie consensus among central bank monetary policy gear towards domestic price stability, sound public finance flexible economic structure create condition long-term economic growth financial stability. 2.3 more international convergence liquidity frameworks? since august 2007 central bank respond variety way financial market disruptions, reflect difference extent market hit turbulences, difference design operational frameworks. however, general major central bank step intermediation role view address liquidity squeeze and, so, show certain degree convergence operate procedures. in particular, central banks: • pursue active reserve management, reassure bank orderly access overnight fund increase frequency operations. • increase supply fund (notably long-term); expand vary degree definition collateral accept collateralised lend operations; provide access collateralised lend large number counterparties. • adapt tender procedure open market operation direction price rather quantity-based schemes, akin use stand facilities. • a turbulence developed, central bank strengthen cooperation enhance communication collective market monitor coordinate action provide liquidity. in respect, significant number swap line central 4 bi review 78/2009 bank set facilitate distribution foreign currency liquidity domestic counterparties. overall, one lesson draw turmoil certain key operational feature facilitate implementation monetary policy stress. in particular, central bank good position distribute reserve effectively — interbank lend impair — capable provide access collateralised lend operation large scale wide set counterparties broad range collateral. yet, important issue, i clear answer, – much whether rather – convergence understand “optimal” feature operational framework stress, reflect design operational framework steady state. for this, need, particular, develop good understand optimal mix private market central bank intermediation need carefully liaise supervisory bodies. i clarify i say “optimal” context, i mean “uniform”. to extent monetary policy strategies, central banks’ status vis-à-vis governments, certain specific feature domestic financial system persist, optimal liquidity framework country monetary union reflect country area-specific factors. 2.4 more scope direct lend real economy? an additional issue come fore present crisis, especially last months, concern extent central bank may engage direct lend real economy. this purely theoretical subject, recent establishment federal reserve system several liquidity facility direct non-banks show (for instance, direct money market fund issuer commercial paper). in principle, scope direct lend central bank real economy depend extent malfunction money credit market distort bank lend prevent aggregate household business obtain credit. in sense, central bank decide bypass bank system start lend household firm directly sake preserve orderly function economy. in practice, even abstract possible legal constraint (e.g. prohibition monetary finance state european monetary union), several issue central bank must consider decide appropriateness “own” economy provide direct finance real sector. i stress term “own” one case unique answer. whether central bank engage direct lend much depend number consideration refer structural feature economy, gravity crisis, state financial system number institutional factors, notably govern relationship central bank government. for instance, one apparently straightforward observation need provide direct credit economy time dysfunction bank activity likely depend relative importance bank sector financial intermediation. follow argument, one may argue bank-based economy may relatively le need provide credit agent bank market-based economy. indeed, focus provide support bank sector, central bank may increase chance sustain economy whole. however, extreme circumstance (notably, bank sector long able fulfil institutional role main engine financial intermediation), central bank may reach opposite conclusion: exactly bi review 78/2009 5 bank sector’s predominance financial intermediation, dysfunctional state might prompt central bank intervene entire economy come halt. if so, central bank need decide sector target. once again, easy choice. it may imply need central bank take decision optimal allocation resource economy which, historical experience shows, good leave private sector. other concern may relate risk political pressure government interference, especially scale finance programme require support treasury. if finance ensure expansion central bank’s liabilities, may give rise general concern fiscal cost action take monetary authority.2 finally, relate previous arguments, direct lend real economy may imply increase financial risk take central bank, potentially expose latter risk financial independence and, ultimately, institutional independence. the purpose remark certainly suggest central bank abstain direct lend real sector, rather point number aspect consider many complexity central bank would ever take decision light heart. this why, embark policy, central bank may prefer provide indirect support (i.e. banks) real economy. base considerations, eurosystem choose make full use possibility provide operational framework support economy, use bank sector intermediary agent. indeed, euro area’s financial system still predominantly bank-based, despite despite significant change area’s financial landscape recent decade (as result number structural developments, include introduction euro). just illustrate point, 2007 aggregate bank lend private sector amount 145% gdp euro area, compare 63% us. by contrast, ratio outstanding debt security issue euro area private sector relative gdp (81%) le half us. thus, bank play dominant role euro area economy that, guarantee steady access credit household company euro area large extent mean preserve viability bank system. the eurosystem provide bank unlimited access fix rate refinance operation (of course, adequate collateral). more recently, eurosystem announce plan purchase euro-denominated cover bond issue euro area provide support credit provision bank sector. these purchase target important segment private security market, particularly affect financial market turbulence contribute achieve objective maintain availability credit household company accessible rates. 2.5 more weight give asset price monetary policy? another interest debate gain – obvious reason – renew interest strength past year role asset price take monetary policy design. indeed, experience present, large volatility asset price jeopardise stability financial system potentially undermine macroeconomic stability. the repetition boom-bust cycle potentially high cost 2 see cukierman, a. (2006), “central bank finance independence – how much capital central bank have?”, m. blejer s. milton (eds.), the capital need central banks, bank england press. 6 bi review 78/2009 macroeconomic stability associate typically abrupt reversal asset price bubble beg question: monetary policy give weight asset prices? there various argument must carefully weigh order answer question. first, know bubble extremely difficult identify real time. assess whether asset price drive fundamental surround much uncertainty — perhaps sometimes uncertainty “knightian” sense — central bank refrain target asset prices. moreover, hold view that, monetary policy action influence asset price developments, magnitude swing policy rate would need curb boom bust cycle asset price time “irrational exuberance” could large adverse implication macroeconomic stability short term.3based arguments, broadly share central bank academic community, one policy view (perhaps, predominant view past years) postulate good wait bubble burst ease monetary policy aggressively provide support bank system economy. this so-called “mop after” approach. in case, sharp monetary policy ease burst bubble supportive price stability financial stability, though possible expense create moral hazard excessive risk-taking future boom times. an alternative approach consist “leaning wind”. accord approach, monetary policy conduct “symmetric” manner financial cycle. in words, accommodative time fall asset prices, restrictive financial market boom. for instance, central bank conduct slightly tight monetary policy warrant price stability objective, build-up potentially detrimental asset price boom identified. by so, central bank would buy insurance risk harmful asset boom-bust cycle, potential cost term macroeconomic financial stability. the main argument approach insurance premium associate policy may excessively high. in fact, contractionary policy response asset price increase may end destabilise economy asset price revaluation drive fundamentals. this risk relate difficulty i mention concern identification asset price misalignment real time. this risk, however, act perfect alibi policy inaction. a recent literature early indicators4 start researcher bi shows, indicator base money credit development provide guidance nature consequence extraordinary asset price developments, thereby help define need policy action. a current financial crisis illustrates, macroeconomic cost financial instability challenge pose maintenance price stability provide support case flexible “leaning wind” strategy. more generally, lesson current crisis seem central bank assign great role asset price monetary policy consideration aim pre-empt emergence asset price bubbles. 3 see papademos (2009) review recent argument challenge view monetary policy blunt tool lean “against wind” (“monetary policy “great crisis”: lesson challenges”, speech 37th economics conference “beyond crisis: economic policy new macroeconomic environment”, vienna). 4 see instance detken, c. f. smets (2004), “asset price boom monetary policy”, ecb work paper, no. 364; alessi, l. c. detken (2009), ““real time” early warn indicator costly asset price boom/bust cycles: a role global liquidity”, present eabcn crei conference business cycle developments, financial fragility, house commodity prices, barcelona, 21-23 november 2008. bi review 78/2009 7 how one implement policy approach practice? the answer much depend monetary policy framework specifically adopt central bank. central bank follow inflation targeting, commonly adopt strategy among develop emerge countries, may find relatively difficult make approach fit policy framework. indeed, inflation targeters tend concentrate pursuit price stability specific horizon generally assign low weight need monitor asset price indicator (notably, monetary credit variables) may signal build financial imbalances.5in response concerns, inflation targeters specify information, include macroeconomic forecasts, take account order formulate monetary policy decisions. such information includes, inter alia, monitor credit property price conditions. in addition, inflation target central bank relax strict focus specific forecast horizon monetary policy, explicitly refer “medium term” horizon enlarge horizon macroeconomic projections, also take account challenge stem asset price developments. i like stress ecb’s two-pillar monetary policy strategy well suit cope challenge bring asset price developments.6 more precisely, two feature ecb’s monetary policy strategy may provide suitable framework implement “leaning wind” approach: • first, ecb’s definition price stability objective – inflation rate below, close to, 2% medium term – allow conduct restrictive monetary policy period boom asset prices, even environment relatively subdue inflationary pressures. in case, “leaning wind” would likely result low inflation short term, would expect effective maintain price stability long term, help prevent materialisation deflation risk asset bubble bursts. • second, ecb’s analysis monetary credit developments7 aim identify longer-term inflation risk also provide signal grow financial imbalances, could principle use implement policy “leaning wind”. this close link monetary credit development evolve imbalance asset credit markets.8 by exploit link, monetary analysis (consisting comprehensive assessment liquidity credit conditions) may provide early information develop asset price imbalance and, therefore, allow timely response imply risk price financial stability. thus, ecb’s two-pillar strategy may represent practical way mimic “leaning wind” approach. 5 christiano et al. (2008) show recent paper close economy, application inflation target context rise bubble might lead policy stance actually encourage growth asset price bubble (see christiano, l., c. ilut, r. motto m. rostagno (2008), “monetary policy stock market boom-bust cycles”, ecb work paper no. 955. october). 6 see also april 2005 ecb monthly bulletin article entitled, “asset price bubble monetary policy trichet, j.c.

detken smets, cit.; goodhart, c. b. hofmann (2008), “house prices, money, credit macro-economy”, ecb work paper series, no. 888. 8 bi review 78/2009 2.6 more central bank involvement supervision? the recent financial market crisis also highlight important role central bank play safeguard financial stability need increase interaction central bank bank supervisors. this need increase interaction, also identify financial stability board (fsb) one recommendations, would support enhance central banks’ role financial stability assessments, crisis management resolution, liquidity provision. first, regard financial stability assessment: central bank benefit extend access supervisory information especially relation systemically relevant institutions, order identify risk vulnerability financial system whole efficient way. in context, fsb international monetary fund already intensify cooperation view enhance assessment financial stability risk global scale, eu valid bank supervision committee committee european bank supervisors. these effort also mirror national regional levels, intensification cooperation exchange information central bank supervisory authority overall good monitor assessment risk financial system. the side coin relate issue incorporate outcome financial stability risk analysis policy action field supervision, also need reinforced. second, area crisis management resolution : global nature financial market increase interlinkages market institution require competent financial authorities, central banks, supervisor ministry finance strengthen coordination mechanism management crisis involve cross-border financial institutions. in eu, important milestone reach memorandum understand (mou) sign competent authority member state june 2008. this mou establish common principles, procedure terminology use party involve cross-border crisis. third, relation liquidity provision: order maintain stable money markets, central bank would benefit enhance access supervisory information, include liquidity stress-testing contingency fund plan banks. at time, supervisor would benefit information available central banks, banks’ bid behaviour. overall, need enhance interaction central bank supervisory authority widely acknowledged, recent event call question whether improve interaction cooperation suffices. in context, debate recently turn towards future supervisory architecture. in particular, financial crisis underscore urgency review eu supervisory framework, still base national responsibility background increase financial market integration grow role large cross-border financial institutions. in response concerns, high level group set chairmanship mr jacques de larosiére mandate examine allocation task national european level. the final report group, publish last february, include number proposal strengthen macro- micro-supervisory arrangement europe. a regard arrangement macro-prudential supervision, de larosière report propose establish european systemic risk board auspex ecb, substantially improve assessment systemic risk financial stability eu level. by assign strong role central banks, particularly ecb, report recognise institution play lead role macro-prudential supervision. however, order new board perform task optimal manner, important three key requirement fulfilled: bi review 78/2009 9 • first, ecb must timely access relevant information, include concern individual institutions; • second, risk warn new council translate effective policy action; • and third, new council must solid institutional legal basis order ensure independence effectiveness decision-making processes. 3. conclude remark the financial turmoil, begin summer 2007, develop time one disruptive crisis world experience many decades. this start turmoil public authority undertake intervention key policy fields, include liquidity management, monetary policy fiscal policy, unprecedented number scale. in addition, many initiative undertake address weakness regulatory supervisory framework order provide sound foundation financial systems. despite best efforts, cannot yet see light end tunnel key financial market economic sector remain stress. it would difficult predict exactly economy return normality, i would prepare bet that, finally happens, world look different many respects. in speech i focus six specific area relevance central bank are, vary extent, state flux. they may lead change environment central bank operate. by increase effort draw right lesson crisis implement necessary reforms, especially regulatory supervisory frameworks, make sure future environment surround central bank different, also conducive price financial stability. 10 bi review 78/2009 philipp hildebrand: current state financial system switzerland introductory remark mr philipp hildebrand, vice-chairman govern board swiss national bank, half-yearly medium news conference, berne, 20 june 2009. * * * introduction this time last year report overall market environment calm somewhat. however, also stress early sound all-clear, considerable uncertainty future development crisis. our concern time prove well-founded. indeed, actual event outstrip expectations. if i may, i start conclusion: state swiss international financial system – remain – vulnerable overall. consequently, still maintain close contact big bank swiss foreign authorities, monitor development great attention. in addition continue intensive effort national international level improve regulatory framework. give scale crisis, swiss national bank (snb) convince although measure take far area head right direction, yet go far enough. i therefore begin briefly assess situation financial system, present issue snb attache medium long-term priority regard reform bank sector operate environment. in short term, however, main focus overcome crisis. situation bank sector a financial stability report publish today describe detail, situation swiss bank sector deteriorate considerably 2008. the turbulence money credit market erupt mid-2007 worsen 2008, also spill areas. the two big banks, particular ubs, hit hard negative developments. a know, together two institution record total loss chf 30 billion 2008.1 they take extensive measure strengthen resilience. in addition reduce risky positions, raise sizeable amount private capital. the resilience ubs strengthen package government measure announce federal council, snb swiss federal bank commission (sfbc, finma swiss financial market advisory authority) october 2008. owe measures, big banks’ capital situation end 2008 improve slightly compare end 2007, despite massive loss incurred. however, assessment that, overall, risk big banks’ book still material. this serious since, compare end 2007, profit potential big bank lower. bank domestic business focus, i.e. cantonal, regional raiffeisen banks, present much favourable picture. although overall profitability bank category decline 2008, still remain long-term average. their capital base high historical standard able build liquidity reserve last year. however, banks, too, economic downturn represent increase challenge. the outlook bank also shape negative forecast entire world economy. these suggest substantial deterioration credit quality – include 1 the figure publish publication, bank switzerland, report parent company level, group, consolidate level. accord figures, total loss big bank amount chf 38 billion. cf. press release 18 june 2009 bank switzerland details. bi review 77/2009 1 switzerland. consequently, increase loan losses, substantial reduction earn deterioration capital situation may expect large number banks. however, cantonal, regional raiffeisen bank appear relatively good shape withstand negative developments. the situation big bank appear difficult. in addition still sizeable market risks, face significant credit risk overall. simple comparison early crisis period show potential loss traditional lend high, set relation capital cushion. the long deep recession, great potential loss be. in basis scenario expect economy recover gradually 2010, internationally switzerland. however, cannot rule significantly deep longer-lasting recession forecast basis scenario. in adverse scenario deep long-lasting recession, large loss would possible bank domestic business focus well big banks. such loss might lead depletion substantial share banks’ current capital reserves. this might turn impair market confidence soundness. give risk potential, therefore essential big bank take necessary measure ensure resilience significant deterioration conditions. these measure include another reduction risk positions, strengthen capital base, preservation adequate liquidity cushion alignment cost structure change market environment. the opportunity offer somewhat calm environment present use take measures. the snb finma monitor development area closely. in respect, snb explicitly welcome fact that, last general meetings, big bank shareholder agree creation authorise capital. this allow big bank react appropriately flexibly market developments. regulatory agenda however, stability financial system increase medium long term, authority face challenges, banks. intensive effort currently go development appropriate solutions, international level switzerland. last autumn, instance, sfbc issue decree impose tight capital adequacy requirement big banks. in future, capital base institution exceed, good times, minimum risk-weighted capital requirement 100%. a complement this, finma also introduce “leverage ratio”, i.e. limit banks’ leverage. the snb consider leverage 20 bank sector prudent thus undesirable good times. in words, consider that, good times, capital base account least 5% balance sheet total. this line finma’s requirements. finma expect big banks’ “leverage ratio” well 3% group level well 4% individual institution good times. to prevent capital requirement procyclical impact, two step taken. first, long time delay implemented. the new finma target apply 2013 earliest, extension would option big bank compliance become impossible due situation capital market big banks’ individual earn position. second, anticyclical element explicitly build new swiss regulations. in bad times, big bank allow fall short new targets. in words, capital cushion build good time absorb loss crises. alongside reinforcement capital base, liquidity also need strengthen increase resilience banks. consequently, comprehensive revision liquidity regulation big bank currently underway. nonetheless, good capital liquidity requirement rule possibility bank face existential difficulty 2 bi review 77/2009 future. the snb therefore consider effort go facilitate orderly wind-downs large international institution future important. the lack clearly define internationally coordinate wind-down procedure contribute de facto obligation part state provide assistance institutions. any rescue large financial institution bring high costs. the “too big fail” issue also tendency harbour incentive bank enter excessive risks. in switzerland, “too big fail” question particularly relevant and, many respects, unique, give importance big bank country’s bank sector economy. a clearly define internationally coordinate wind-down procedure would help ease problem. the interplay national jurisdiction is, however, extremely complex, find solution predefined internationally coordinate procedure kind correspondingly challenge time-consuming. the snb therefore belief careful consideration must also give alternative approaches. these include rule govern organisational structure large financial institutions. the aim rule would be, crisis situation, split unit bank important function economy wind rest. this mean, however, type approach would question universal bank model such. the snb aware rule govern organisational structure large financial institution easy draw up. legal operational aspect would therefore need analyse requisite care regulation draw close collaboration bank affected. we convince everything need do implement one approach facilitate wind-down large financial institutions. if significant progress achieve within reasonable time frame, measure address size bank also examined. one way size bank influence capital regulations. capital requirement dependent upon size reduce bank’s incentive inflate balance sheet without restraint. measure direct impact size bank also conceivable. a size restriction would course major intervention institution’s corporate strategy. naturally snb aware advantage size. for reason, advantage disadvantage measure would examine weigh carefully. nevertheless, case large international banks, empirical evidence would seem suggest institution long exceed size need make full use advantages. it note although instrument size restriction far-reaching, mean new economic policy. for decade one tool prevent market dominance area competition policy. within context financial stability, objective measure would reduce risk stability bank financial system, rather maintain competition. i would like run last point briefly. in short term, priority must give overcome crisis. however, order increase stability financial system medium long term, consider reform operational environment bank sector essential. we attach particular importance alleviate “too big fail” problem. apart strict rule systemically important institutions, snb currently envisage two option intend examine – first, measure facilitate wind-down large, international institution and, second, direct indirect measure limit size. the snb examine depth, close collaboration finma, alongside possible options. there taboos, give experience last two years. the role authority what lesson learn crisis respect role authorities? if regulatory progress aim also enforced, need strong authorities. bi review 77/2009 3 this applies, one hand, finma, charge oversight individual banks, microprudential oversight. finma need sufficient qualify resource fulfil oversight responsibilities. on hand, snb must step activity even close collaboration finma also reinforce macroprudential oversight. unlike finma, snb supervise banks. we focus attention individual institution bank system whole. our macroprudential oversight largely complementary microprudential oversight carry finma. however, switzerland, overlap occur naturally microprudential macroprudential perspective due systemic importance two big banks. within ambit mandate, snb therefore consider imperative maintain direct frequent contact big banks. where necessary, step frequency intensity contacts. their purpose obtain information relevance macroprudential oversight, also inform big bank risk assessment. the snb also become increasingly involve regulatory project relevant systemic point view. initial example work introduction leverage ratio reform liquidity regulations, finma snb drive forward together. this development essentially call question division responsibility supervisory authority central bank. however, importance big bank financial system economy, great weight must give macroprudential perspective, oversight financial system regulation. 4 bi review 77/2009 mark carney: from green shoot harvest – comment financial stability remark mr

while financial system one sound world, ferocity once-in-a-lifetime global financial tempest affect canadians, regardless location occupation. so, financial system still leave u well position green

adequacy capital, 3) financial health canadian households. i conclude observation economic outlook. assessment overall financial stability since autumn, global economy deep synchronize recession trigger bad financial crisis since great depression. in recent months, financial market condition improve noticeably further, gradual progress likely numerous international policy initiative gain traction. equity market see strong gain recent month (see appendix, chart 1), credit market also rally (chart 2). while still long way go economic financial condition return normal, market seem turn back worst-case scenarios. the panic engulf global financial market last fall over. development canadian financial stability past six month reflect compete influence improve financial market condition one hand deterioration economic outlook other. overall, level risk canadian financial system judge broadly unchanged since last december. i would sound note caution familiar work land. we well prepare still tested. while strong position bank improve recent month balance sheet canadian household remain relatively sound, global recession mean reserve draw upon month ahead. let turn three risk i cite moment ago, start liquidity fund banks. liquidity fund at heart financial crisis collapse wholesale fund market banks. since august 2007, short-term interbank repo market great strain. during intense period crisis around collapse bear stearns march 2008 lehman brother others fall last year, market seize entirely: good collateral become unfinanceable overnight, firm failed, risk aversion across financial market skyrocketed. this crisis confidence le acute canada, still produce severe strain wholesale fund markets. heighten uncertainty make counterparties reluctant extend finance beyond short maturities, result intense fund pressure canadian financial institutions. bank cut back market-making activity order conserve balance sheet capacity, aggravate market volatility. these dynamic raise risk adverse feedback loop financial system real economy. the bank canada respond pressure dramatically expand liquidity facilities, government canada implement program purchase insure mortgage help canada mortgage house corporation, thereby increase access canadian institution longer-term financing. reflect strength bank scale actions, condition canada consistently good elsewhere (chart 3). since december, policy gain considerable traction, help reinforce improvement domestic fund condition global financial crisis subside (chart 4). this improvement reflect decline spread bank finance money markets, moderate extension maturities, substantial reduction cost term fund canadian banks. in addition, policy initiative allow bank increase substantially hold government securities, help boost liquidity situation capital-efficient way. these improvement support 2 bi review 77/2009 strong growth retail deposit slow credit growth (chart 5). market-making activity canadian financial market also recovering, although remain le satisfactory. policy response there important lesson draw experience. the performance core fund market crisis intensify financial panic help trigger recession. this totally unacceptable. a consequence, one bank canada's top priority promote institutional change create robust core fund markets. promise avenue break (il)liquidity spiral include introduce clear houses, standardize products, implement through-the-cycle margining, ensure effective netting. a ultimate provider liquidity system, bank think whether adapt facility support continuous private liquidity creation. bank capitalization since crisis began, capital adequacy bank around world subject intense scrutiny. concern move quickly bank exposure u.s. subprime debt structure product type crisis spread and, finally, traditional credit business household recession take hold. concern capital adequacy bank outside canada make bad uncertainty cause account standards, valuation methodologies, loss credibility basel ii regulatory capital standard. it lose investor every single financial institution fail capital ratio well basel ii regulatory minimum day go down. a consequence, investor demand ever-higher capital ratio banks, create dynamic exacerbate recession. in context, canadian institution benefit several factors: high initial capitalization (minimums set

strengthen process recovery. next, i speak medium-term issue financial sector reform, begin see new post-crisis financial landscape emerge plan respond change context financial sector master plan. first, current conditions. late economic data thailand continue show deterioration economic activity evidence estimate decline 7.1 percent year’s first quarter gdp growth. however, recently, overall domestic activity remain weak, positive sign real sector emerging, especially monthly april data show great stabilization pace contraction month-on-month basis, exports, manufacture output, capacity

2009. * * * in seminal essay deliver 16 year ago, senator daniel patrick moynihan offer strike view degradation standard society.1 he observe deviancy – measure increase crime, break homes, mental illness – reach level unimagined early generations. a mean cop onslaught, society often seek define problem away. the definition customary behavior expanded. action consider deviant acceptable standard became, almost immaculately, within bounds.2 society move on, were. well-meaning effort periodically make treat failings. but effort prove le successful, citizen policymakers alike tend grow increasingly accustom unfortunate statistics. every bite reformer throughout decade public service, moynihan seem reluctantly resign society's construct: "in sense, agency control often seem define job keep deviance within bind rather obliterate altogether."3 give financial crisis, deep contraction real economy, extraordinary fiscal monetary responses, i cannot help wonder constitute deviance economic term 2009 beyond. what level real economic output unemployment expect and, important, accepted? and level volatility constitute "new normal"?4 a i discuss, must wary macroeconomic policy – name stability – may effect low trend growth employment rates. in moynihan's framework, official sector accept period significant financial economic distress, however infrequent? that is, deviancy define understand rare crisis price dynamic, robust economic growth? or official sector say, "never – watch," become le tolerant deviation economic financial conditions? under mantle reform capitalism, policymakers instead define deviancy up, seek guarantee stability economic affairs? i suspect that, time, policymakers attract latter path. stability fine goal, final one. long panic condition ended, stability threaten displace economic growth primary macroeconomic policy objective. but must recognize singular pursuit stability, however well intentioned, may end make economy le productive, le adaptive, le self-correcting – doing, le able deliver allure promise. this fate, however, ours. the u.s. economy capable, judgment, deliver more. 1 daniel patrick moynihan (1993), "defining deviancy down: how we've become accustom alarm level crime destructive behavior," american scholar, winter. 2 the view express herein necessarily reflect view member board governor federal open market committee. i grateful valuable assistance karen dynan nellie liang board staff contribute remarks. 3 see moynihan, "defining deviancy down," note 1. 4 see mohamed el-erian (2009), "a new normal," pimco secular outlook, may. bi review 75/2009 1 the growth experiment5this recent boom bust not, say, country's first rodeo, may turn consequential since world war ii. and, here, i talk near-term peak-to-trough change growth employment levels, likely prove significant. policymakers reveal new policy preference prescription – fiscal policy, trade policy, regulatory policy, monetary policy, chiefly among them. long official recession ends, choice make may significantly alter contour u.s. economy. the hard question remain whether change prove beneficial. from mid-1980s 2007, u.s. real gross domestic product (gdp) growth average 3 percent per year, le volatile previous decades. the average unemployment rate le 5-3/4 percent, full percentage point le previous 15 years. most notable realize acceleration labor productivity mid-1990s. the bipartisan, pro-growth policy predominate period contribute meaningfully gains. tax spend decision generally seek expand economic pie. trade policy aim open new market u.s. product services, remove barrier domestically. regulatory policy permit failure, rely equal part capital requirements, regulatory standards, and, le important, market discipline. a result, business well position adopt new efficiency-enhancing technology process excel pro-growth environment. these policy help drive significant productivity gains, remarkable u.s. global prosperity.6 i mean suggest period precede crisis golden age. it wasn't. even seemingly enviable, secular period prosperity, u.s. recession 1990-91 2001 remind u periodic, cyclical weakness occurs. the labor market deteriorate downturns, great cost many family communities. but periodic deviation accepted, sense, body politic. there lesson learned, reform implemented, public private practice improve upon. but broad outline growth experiment forge on, judge largely success. hence, relative stability earn great moderation endure moniker not, view, great economic accomplishment past decades. the acclaim assign result economic boom massively increase economic output live standards. maximum sustainable growth, stability per se, predominant policy goal. strong growth, course, make possible, part, low volatility mark period.7 firm choose invest more, example, le volatile economic conditions. but, pro-growth policy coin realm. 5 the term "growth experiment" coin two decade ago describe certain pro-growth tax policies. see, example, lawrence b. lindsey (1990), the growth experiment: how new tax policy be transform u.s. economy (new york: basic books). i, however, reference broad range macroeconomic policies. 6 since 1980, performance world economy prove strong. real world gdp grow approximately 145 percent 1980 2007, compound average 3.4 percent per year (becker murphy (2009)). they also contend even current recession deep prolong contemplate pessimistic forecasters, global annual growth rate would still average good 2.7 percent 1980 2010, per capital income rise total 40 percent period. see gary becker kevin murphy (2009), "do not let 'cure' destroy capitalism," financial time magazine, march 19. 7 whether good fortune good policy, start great moderation mid-1980s end 2007, standard deviation annualized quarterly real u.s. gdp growth 2.1 percent, le half large value two previous decades. 2 bi review 75/2009 but, i remark another group international financier two year ago: "the great moderation…is neither law physic guarantee future outcomes. it description – ex post explanation relative prosperity. if policymakers market participant presume entitlement, almost surely lose favor."8 well, warn notwithstanding, treat like entitlement far many private public sector, result, lose considerable favor. the panic 2008 ha experience last 20 month cause find vaunt growth experiment fundamentally revised? during recent period turmoil, imponderable, previously think virtually impossible, happen great speed force frequency.9 asset price plummeted, market volatility reach high level decades. financial market function deeply impair across asset class geographies. a result, u.s. economy endure sudden stop. in final quarter last year first quarter year, private employment register large two-quarter percent decline since mid-1970s, real gdp saw dramatic decline half-century. these data clearly indicative significant deviance, justifiably raise question success growth experiment. policymakers rightly dispose react, respond, revisit presume record accomplishment. in revise historical record, however, hastily discount precede period prosperity. we must avoid classic case behavioral economist term "availability bias," decision make influence disproportionately recent events. ultimately, i leave economic historian ass whether panic 2008 anomalous period prosperity precede it. i believe categorization recent event deviant, ultimately, depend happen next. that is, policy change cause future economic performance suffer, boom last generation may, regrettably, turn exceptional bust. the stability experiment that new policy implement period economic turmoil coincidence. these new preference reveal much type economy policymakers aspire. and clear, stability experiment appear well intended. it aspire manage economy great care expansive effective regulation, well large persistent role government action, increase home bias global commerce. advocate stability experiment – guide compass – seem incline announce growth experiment ended, conclude result deeply disappointing. they seem prefer define deviancy up, wish assure uncertain citizenry. if government policy corrected, private practice make prescriptive, argue, ship state ensure real economy avoid rough sea altogether. the political economy confirm policy response: policymakers may pay great attention insure rare bad event – could hold account – allow score great thing flourish. 8 kevin warsh (2007), "market liquidity: definition implications," speech deliver institute international banker annual washington conference, washington, march 5. 9 kevin warsh (2009), "the panic 2008," speech deliver council institutional investor 2009 spring meeting, washington, april 6. bi review 75/2009 3 a i mention outset, stability, sense low macroeconomic volatility, fine objective, final one. the conduct monetary policy, example, aim achieve price stability throughout economic cycle. but central banker believe precursor strong sustainable growth. if policy – notably, fiscal, regulatory, trade – treat stability ultimate objective, might find low growth diminish economic potential. reform effort sorely needed, practice demand mark improvement. but policymakers wise resist hubris recently afflict actor financial sector. i describe mix new pro-stability policy experiment good reason. it might deliver promise low volatility, low unemployment, high growth course generation. but, might not. the cost stability experiment might turn large. necessarily hastily craft financial crisis began, stability experiment likely survive far long panic precede it. it surge popularity likely grow application, particularly if, i suspect, economic picture disappoints. incipient recovery since mid-march year, financial condition continue improve. panic condition show sign retreat. asset price rebounding, search new equilibrium panic-induced depth – unite state across vast majority trade partners. and improvement market coincide arrival proverbial green shoot spring. this gloss recovery appealing, course, central bankers. i, like you, root positive trend continue. but, estimation, rather indiscriminate bounce bottom – across virtually asset geography – may indicative one-time reset, may may complete. i would comfortable go forward observe dispersion valuation particular asset great differentiation across asset class geographies. the panic's hasty retreat confuse robust recovery. for economic performance turn ultimately force private final demand; now, remain weak. real consumer spend rise modestly first quarter year, drop sharply second half last year. business reduce real spend annual rate 35 percent continue cut workforces. real export fell annual rate close 30 percent. the trauma experience business consumer come panic underestimated. notwithstanding recent encourage sign contraction abating, i would expect business capital expenditure consumer spend continue disappoint next several quarters. even if, i expect, unite state emerge recession sooner advance foreign trade partners, i still cautious predict sustain run-up net export soon virtual collapse global trade. exceptional fiscal expenditures, terms, intend replace shortfall aggregate demand. and recent extraordinary monetary policy action intend low risk-free rate grow balance sheet capacity help offset pullback private financial intermediaries. but financial market may extract penalty price fiscal authority unable demonstrate credible return sustainable budgets. and unlikely look kindly monetary authority unless decidedly unambiguously chart independent paths. the federal reserve – – compromise another kind stability – price stability – help achieve government policy objectives. 4 bi review 75/2009 on balance, i would surprise countervail force – unprecedented public support underwhelming private demand – fight draw fourth quarter. but scale stimulus recent blow real economy lack precedent, predict victor tough business. of course, extraordinary monetary fiscal support may prove efficacious near term i expect, lead continue ease credit conditions, slowdown rate deleveraging, improve inventory levels, good quarterly economic statistics. even so, benefit stimulus likely wane. more important, unemployment rates, judgment, likely remain high linger long recent recessions. the "jobless recovery" may prove familiar vex refrain. a wise stanford mentor mine coin many year ago, "the economist's lag politician's nightmare."10medium-term prospect the rebalancing u.s. gdp global demand likely require patience. during transition, may well political impetus still more-aggressive macroeconomic policies. in evaluate new measures, however, policymakers' predominant interest ensure credibility fiscal monetary frameworks. for, macroeconomic policy become unanchored, misunderstand markets, continue government aggressiveness could prove counterproductive. the global economy run risk mire period slow growth several year come. some portion subpar economic performance may owe normal capital labor reallocation take place recoveries. and give serious misallocations mark onset recession, good reason believe period reallocation deep last longer. a reduction size finance house industries, example, well way. effort forestall changes, judgment, unlikely succeed promisingly advertised. but perhaps large risk change public policy may, pursuit stability, hold growth u.s. economy period. simple textbook model tell u nation's output product number hour work output produce per hour. in think medium-term prospect economy, i find useful consider two factor separately. output per hour, productivity, secret sauce u.s. economic growth rise live standards, i fear recipe may lose key ingredients. growth labor productivity arise firm's worker use good physical capital, firm become efficient convert input output. innovation play key role, directly boost efficiency firms' decision invest physical capital tend depend underlie pace innovation. in addition, today's economy, productivity many firm rely heavily intangible, intellectual, capital; although hard measure, intangible capital appear also tie innovation. to concrete, 1995 2007, u.s. labor productivity growth nonfarm business sector average 2-1/2 percent per year, mark improvement 1-3/4 percent pace mark prior quarter century. this period rapid growth labor productivity drive large capital investments, significant improvement management processes, remarkable advance technology. look ahead, policy le encourage capital accumulation, return innovation constrain policy, may find material reduction growth rate productivity live standards. 10 see george shultz (1993), turmoil triumph: my year secretary state (new york: charles scribner's sons). bi review 75/2009 5 the level support financial system capable provide also remain highly uncertain. private financial institution understandably slow create new product connect saver investors. although undesirable revert excessive risk-taking precede crisis, current financial practice seem suboptimal promote economic growth. furthermore, repeat intervention public sector run risk cause systemically significant institution operate like public utility efficient allocator capital proper arbiter liquidity. productivity may also suffer hand policy discourage trade. trade enhance productivity promote efficient specialization, permit economy scale, increase potential return innovation.11 however, bipartisan consensus favor free trade appear broken, political party internally divide question. give contention, however imprecise, anglo-american-style capitalism cause turmoil, may shortage credible persuasive voice fight grow global tide economic isolation. a hour worked, key determinant output, risk seem unmistakable. we grow accustom fall natural rate unemployment last two decades. even unemployment spike recent recessions, prevail rate find way still low levels. accord economists, non-accelerating inflation rate unemployment (nairu) neighborhood 5 percent prior financial crisis. look ahead, i could well imagine natural rate unemployment trend higher. historically, small business tend large driver new job creation. but respond macroeconomic policy favor stability growth difficult predict. the answer may ultimately depend access growth capital liquidity give change mix public policy private practices. more generally, i believe dynamism u.s. economy contribute critically pre-crisis level employment. the remarkably low level nairu make possible part extraordinary churn job see u.s. economy. for example, 12 month precede start recession december 2007, although 62 million people lose jobs, 63 million job created. policy aim limit range economic outcome not, view, keep unemployment rate low. these policy make costly firm adjust size workforces, thereby make employer reluctant hire. gauge trend growth output employment essential proper conduct monetary policy. broad change macroeconomic policy may make difficult central banker make calculations. to extent change policy reduce potential growth, raise natural rate unemployment beyond recent estimates, difficult make good timely policy. we must keep keen eye risk condition evolve. ironically, long output employment disappoint, attractive gloss stability may become. a result, evaluate benefit cost stability experiment keen eye guard downside risk real economy. 11 for discussion benefit trade modern global economy, see w. michael cox richard alm (2007), "the best all worlds: globalize knowledge economy," federal reserve bank dallas: 2006 annual report (dallas: frb dallas). 6 bi review 75/2009 longer-term prospect i lose confidence inherent innovation, creativity, dynamism u.s. economy. nor i lose confidence inherent good sense citizens. if stability experiment fail deliver promise high employment good economic performance, policymakers ultimately change prescription yet again. and so, long term, final result u.s.

fully understood, financial market real economy. the top quality work do conference great help policy making. normal time time stress over recent months, thank joint action government central banks, market show gradual sign improvement. yet, function market fully restored. at current juncture, one key challenge restore confidence context player still confront numerous source uncertainty: uncertain exposure vis-à-vis counterparties, uncertain valuation regard financial asset financial risks. in context, return normality? economic theory provide set condition fulfil market function efficiently: full information, enforceable property right contracts, absence externality mention important ones. in time stress, condition fulfilled. but hardly meet normal time either. move one situation, other, necessarily involve huge economic shock. small change economic sentiment “animal spirit” may bring financial market point near collapse. the past ten year strike case point. the development securitisation initially perceive improve welfare good risk management allocation. overall, see move towards complete efficient markets. the crisis show necessarily case: process plague information asymmetry moral hazard, create high risk concentration limit number counterparties, it also lead build-up financial imbalance prove unsustainable. in conditions, minor change may suffice trigger financial market collapse. it difficult rationalise outcome unless result kind coordination economic agent bad equilibrium. some contribution present mention strategic complementarities, explanation cannot completely rule out. indeed, seem drive force behind massive securitisation era was, participants, regulatory arbitrage. therefore, come surprise main policy response focus regulation. indeed, widespread consensus cause current financial meltdown stem failure even absence regulation important segment financial system. but may also implication monetary policy, i turn now. bi review 74/2009 1 some implication monetary policy central bank frontline since crisis unfold summer 2007. a dramatic change occur however collapse lehman brother sentiment move uncharted territories: spread reach unprecedented level money credit markets, lead worsen finance condition across industrialise countries. without action important part transmission mechanism would significantly impaired. in context, major central bank embark unconventional policy by: • increase central bank liquidity; • influence risk premia private financial credit instruments. such policy refer credit ease policies; • pre-committing conduct low interest rate policy long necessary country interest rate already reach low bound. all policy set temporary policy deem use time stress only. it obviously early gauge overall impact. so far, effective regard market confidence, contribute significant reduction various credit risk premia. one channel rely portfolio composition effects. i know contribution present make point sophisticate framework, i.e. positive feedback effect may generate great liquidity invest entrepreneurs. obviously, soundness financial system critical success unconventional policies. these policy must view state contingent policies: conditional state economy. a significant part intervention short-term oriented, acquisition focus short-maturity assets. furthermore, asset purchase usually good quality. in cases, particular eurosystem, increase monetary base determine endogenously bank system, motivate banks’ preference liquidity thus state stress bank system. finally, measure tend address aggregate risks. these unconventional measure would automatically unwind, improvement inter-bank credit market would reduce need use facilities. financial market indicators, risk premia component determinant well monetary indicator (inflation expectation addition monetary credit developments) take account carry assessment. some implication financial stability this crisis trigger debate regard possible tool develop prevent build financial imbalance design countercyclical regulatory policies. some paper present conference make point, call new macro-prudential approach propose measure systemic risk capture risk spillover tail risk correlations. i course sympathetic approach i also think measure form basis macro-prudential regulation. the general principle macro-prudential regulation straightforward: consist ensure supervision manage limit risk stability particular institution, also entire financial system. it implementation however bite complex raise several policy issues: first, question calibrate macro-prudential instrument address common exposure across financial institution contribution institution system-wide risk; second issue dampen inherent procyclicality financial system; third issue respective importance rule-based approach versus discretionary tools. finally, question 2 bi review 74/2009 remain regard institutional set-up, particular institution involve process make decisions. these issue currently debate various circle recently-published de larosière report make substantial proposal regard institutional set-up. i elaborate issue simply touch couple them. the important feature macro-prudential approach treat aggregate risk endogenous consider possible feedback effect real economy soundness financial institutions. it ultimate objective prevent costly recession one currently experiencing. consequently, implementation must ground welfare analysis. this area research required. it important implementation macro-prudential approach find right balance efficiency stability financial sector, it therefore construct act directly incentive take risk reward provide risk taking. should central bank involve in? clearly, play pivotal role: major player financial liquidity crises. they well equip ass cyclical position strong incentive since efficacy monetary policy rely smooth function transmission mechanism. on hand, alone care financial stability primary mandate, price stability, always necessarily coincide financial stability. a conclusion, i would like thank much attention kind

current financial crisis. when lehman brother go bankrupt last september, financial crisis enter new level acuteness, though recently begin subside thank bold policy initiative take country around world. nevertheless, financial crisis significant negative impact real economy. the imf revise 2009 real growth rate forecast world economy negative 1.3 percent. at current point time, japanese financial system stable whole financial institution remain sound. however, also fact japanese financial institution face much difficult earn environment. we therefore continue carefully monitor whether bank sector able maintain sufficient level robustness appropriately provide financial intermediation functions. while government central bank focus current crisis management, g20 summit many forum see vigorous discussion policy prevent recurrence financial crisis. however, primary interest debate strengthen regulation, impression critical re-examination effectiveness exist regulation consideration possible side effect re-regulation take back seat. a central banker whose mission maintain stability financial system, i believe genuinely reflect whether previous policy lead financial institution correct direction. where mistakes, must correct help financial institution set proper path. at time, recognize regulation must impede growth financial service sector. the ultimate goal regulation creation sufficiently flexible financial system able smoothly absorb internal external shocks. in remark today, i would like focus design system prevent recurrence financial crisis, consider broad perspective bind establish concept approaches. obviously, design desirable policy regulation require deep understand behind crisis. therefore, may strike many bite roundabout, i would like begin remark review background current crisis mechanism exacerbate it. bi review 74/2009 1 2. emergence "credit bubble"1at outset, i would like set cause current financial crisis way. we currently midst financial crisis. the global financial system may lull, know another challenge issue could erupt. the situation surround u allow premature conclusions. therefore, i would like ask understand remark base information available u current point time necessarily represent provisional diagnosis. no one would deny prologue current financial crisis subprime house loan crisis unite states. but essentially problem portion home mortgage single country – albeit unite state – would normally inconceivable alone plunge global financial market chaos. it therefore appropriate look macro global problem true background today's financial crisis. it undeniable low interest rate excess liquidity prevail around world since collapse it bubble behind crisis. in sense, situation would quite plausible financial crisis occur anywhere form. why u subprime house loan trigger crisis? the u current account deficit begin expand rapidly since latter half 1990s. meanwhile, emerge asian economies, include china oil produce countries, begin see current account surplus expand. this phenomenon come call "global imbalances." i sure recall variety discussion whether situation would sustainable. in fact, significant difference degree development individual countries' financial markets, situation like global imbalance appear surface disequilibrium fact one kind equilibrium itself.2 in emerge economy oil produce countries, many imperfection may observe domestic financial markets. stock market undeveloped, deposit interest rate fix low level regulation, on. because this, country may lack financial asset offer safe store wealth gain rise incomes. one solution purchase "safe" financial asset countries. the development information telecommunication technology make far easy purchase foreign asset past. and unite state supply "safe" financial assets. for emerge economy oil produce countries, translate current account surpluses, since purchase foreign asset is, ultimately, export capital. conversely, unite states, result current account deficit save shortfall due excess consumption cover import capital. this set stage spread us-made "credit bubble" rest world. obviously, global imbalance insufficient generate "credit bubble" completely divorce economic fundamentals. for that, must turn problem inherent process subprime house loan turn securitized 1 the word "bubble" use accord strict economic definition, usage often much looser, see policy debates, example. in paper, i place "credit bubble" within quotation mark indicate use colloquially rather strictly define sense. 2 cabarello, r. j. (2006), “on macroeconomics asset shortage,” the role money: money monetary policy twenty-first century, the fourth european central bank conference, 9-10 november 2006, edit andreas beyer lucrezia reichlin, pp. 272-283. 2 bi review 74/2009 instruments. on point, i would like focus question agency problem relate expansion securitization business.3 the primary characteristic securitization business complexity. today's securitized instrument extraordinarily complex structures. for example, bundle together thousand subprime house loans, dissect cash flow loan produce turn number different financial instrument different level priority. furthermore, financial instrument bundle together chop create financial instruments. a process synthesis partition repeated, risk structure become complex long easy task measure risk exposure. certainly, one could argue instrument purchase risk clear, happen many investor place excessive faith rat issue rat agency securitized instrument begin gobble complex product regardless. there second feature securitization must also discuss: "functional differentiation." most subprime house loan unite state issue financial operator call "mortgage banks." instead continue hold credit make loan, operator sell investment bank institutions. investment bank others take home mortgage credit purchased, pool together use back securitized instrument sell investors. this call "originate to distribute" (otd) model, whose process start origination home mortgage end sale securitized product base them. one problem otd model lend moral hazards. if mortgage bank able sell home mortgage credit transfer risks, incentive seriously screen loans. it hard imagine loan make applicant could meet credit standard normal times. this typical moral hazard, i believe plant seed "credit bubble." through process, enormous volume securitized instrument back relate subprime house loan come onto market. moreover, many instrument give "aaa" ratings, indicate high level creditworthiness. what surprise yield aaa-rated securitized instrument often much high yield treasury even though also aaa rating. have market function normally, price distortion could maintain long term. but point fact, one question state affairs; banks, rat agencies, investors, regulators. whether people think situation strange not, everyone seem agree ignore it. why could abnormal situation continue long? some would argue point important factor come organizational behavior certain "responsibility avoidance" attitude part organization member – refer literature "plausible deniability".4 the seller securitized instrument maintain bear responsibility, demonstrate problem instrument point fact operator sell kind instruments. they claim they, like others, calculate price instrument basis historical data experience, give bless rat agencies. in words, nobody could possibly foresee current price drops, therefore nobody responsible. it happened. meanwhile, buyer securitized instrument – institutional 3 for detail analysis slightly different perspective, see following. nishimura, k. g. (2007), "lessons subprime debacle: the trust be key rat securitized instruments", nikkei shimbun "keizai kyoshitsu," 14 december 2007 (in japanese). 4 calomiris, c. w. (2009), “the subprime turmoil: what's old, what's new, what's next,” in: maintain stability change financial system,” federal reserve bank kansa city, pp. 19-110. bi review 74/2009 3 investor – use similar logic justify purchases. everybody else buy financial instrument nobody problem it, excuse goes. it natural believe plausible deniability one reason “credit bubble” securitized instrument emerge maintain long period time. along emergence “credit bubble,” another feature distinguish current crisis – fact virtually market participant believe serious financial crisis could actually occur. how market participant come believe this? it something phenomenon so-called "great moderation." begin 1990s, unite state country saw significant decline volatility gdp real economy indicator and, result, volatility financial indicator stable well. this situation remain place long time presumably market participant illusion situation would persist future economic upheaval could never occur. there opinion illusion reinforce "greenspan put," name alan greenspan, former chairman federal reserve board (frb). in words, even financial crisis occur, former chairman greenspan frb would certainly able use monetary policy fix it. if greenspan put true, could rational market participant take risk assumption tail risk (the rarely-occurring risk financial crisis) would never emerge. in short, misplace faith market participant monetary policy generate overconfidence market. 3. erosion confidence deepen crisis i would like turn collapse “credit bubble” deepen financial crisis resulted. one distinguish feature current financial crisis liquidity crisis cause materialization counterparty risk. on july 10, 2007, s&p moody's announce would review rat several residential mortgage-backed security (rmbs) back subprime house loan assets. a consequence, aaa rat asset-backed commercial paper (abcp) back instrument also downgraded. indeed, unremarkable change rat risk asset important context market whole directly shake global financial system. in unite states, money market fund (mmfs) consider extremely safe financial assets. one primary reason mmfs allow invest aaa-rated assets. when rat downgrade abcp, mmfs reinvest. naturally, fund originate abcp use raise money find fund-raise difficulties: fund bear stearns umbrella go bankrupt; bnp paribas move freeze affiliate fund’s new application redemptions. the structure investment vehicle (siv) create bank issue abcp unable find fund sources, bank force provide liquidity enhancement instead. banks, frequently lend money, suddenly become aware counterparty risk, risk party transaction might suddenly go belly up. they begin worry bank somewhere might suddenly unable secure liquidity fail. indeed, august 9, liquidity crisis actually occurred, liquidity dry quickly interbank market. the event come know "paribas shock." many european bank among face liquidity difficulties. confront situation, european central bank (ecb) promptly announce prepare supply massive amount liquidity short-term money market.5 5 in point fact, mmfs play role deepen crisis "lehman shock" september 2008 well, discuss below. the reserve primary fund, major independent mmf, hold large amount cp issue lehman brothers. the fund incur large loss bankruptcy, plunge 4 bi review 74/2009 some argue may excessive maturity mismatch financial institutions’ balance sheet background factor trigger liquidity crisis. certainly, close observation fact current financial crisis expose maturity mismatch also "liquidity uncertainty" fundamental risk inherent financial instruments. it truism liquidity largely unrecognized exist understand disappears. for example, design abcps assume sell market time necessary, crisis actually occurred, instrument could immediately sold. have institutional fund-raise little long-term, would time cushion might enable deal crisis liquidity. although may possible take every possibility account selection assets, constant awareness uncertainty liquidity continuous assessment maturity gap asset liability key factor improve soundness financial institutions. one often-heard opinion credit default swap (cds) financial derivative amplify instability financial market current financial crisis. opinion differ merit cd themselves, one would deny dysfunction over-the-counter (otc) market, instrument primarily traded, undermine confidence financial market whole. on september 15, 2008, lehman brother declare bankruptcy. right around time, market begin talk american international group, inc. (aig) rock well, share price plummeted. aig sell large volume cd protection, believe many contract use lehman brother reference company. the bankruptcy aig would nullify cd hedges. be happen, financial institution deal aig would unable fulfill cd contract financial institutions, raise specter chain reaction. market participant suddenly force recognize counterparty risk. face circumstances, u government little choice place aig de facto administration. most cd trade directly. a long counterparty risk limit party directly involve negotiate transaction, market whole recognize broad risk. the reason market whole become aware risk market participant recognize complex intertwine relationship among arise negotiate transaction network. if counterparty risk recognize transaction somewhere – words, think risk party go bankrupt – everyone deal party risk pull chain reaction bankruptcies. so initial counterparty risk spread spawn new counterparty risk party deal counterparty. these "network externalities" certainly play major role process current financial crisis expanded. counterparty risk significantly reduce centralize transaction (institutionalizing "central counterparty"), practice, many transaction complex creation central counterparty daunt task. i think current sense paralysis pervade financial market explain merely rupture “credit bubble.” when bubble rupture, one would ordinarily expect economy return fundamentals. in words, economy get back function should. but i think anyone would say economy moment function properly. the global economy today fall far beneath potential seemingly unable pull up. the root cause erosion confidence market. when confidence eroded, market participant become extremely fearful might confront completely "break buck" (net asset per dollar face value worth le one dollar) status. this greatly undermine confidence mmfs whole, trigger rapid outflow money translate major upheaval short-term money markets. bi review 74/2009 5 unpredictable uncertain world. in case, market participant want behave rationally, natural course assume pessimistic scenario make best it.6 such market participant react readily bad news, information bad conceivable circumstances, good news. what more, situation these, market participant tend adopt strategy stand still confidence restored.7 action may rational level individual market participant lead "fallacy composition," delay restoration function market whole. 4. institutional issue financial system i would next like explore background current financial crisis follow two perspectives: monetary policy implementation financial system design. let begin consider monetary policy context so-called “bubble” phenomena. it extremely difficult central bank aware real time emergence collapse “bubbles”.8 there two school think deal bubbles. one say wait clean collapse difficult aware bubble emerge. the argue deal quickly read sign bubble numerous indicator like asset prices. both positions, however, acknowledge difficult identify emergence collapse bubble real time. when large bubble collapse severely damage financial system, monetary policy extremely limit effects, see current financial crisis. furthermore, process bubble formation involve "greenspan put"-type expectation among market participants, may lead excessive risk-taking activities. thus, current financial crisis raise extraordinarily difficult question central bank conduct monetary policy stabilize financial systems, ultimately, economies. while important discuss detail, i refrain remark today i wish highlight another important question regard design financial systems. the “credit bubble” collapse witness result grow impetus europe unite state reconsider exist regulatory framework. in background financial deregulation make great stride 1990s. the unite states, glass-steagall act, maintain clear delineation bank security business ever 1933. the glass-steagall act come lesson learn great depression design protect depositor separate bank business security business improve soundness banks. however, 1999, amidst global deregulatory movement, gramm-leach-bliley act effectively tear wall bank security businesses. this enable large commercial bank enter security business. meanwhile, 2004, security exchange commission (sec) relax leverage restriction investment banks. this deregulation decisive importance current 6 if decision maker’s confidence “contaminated” erode sense thinks, though small probability (say ε), ignorant situation faces, rational behavior describe “maximin” optimization. see, nishimura, k. g., h. ozaki (2006), “an axiomatic approach ε-contamination,” economic theory, vol. 27, 2006, pp. 333-340. 7 nishimura, k. g., h. ozaki (2007), “irreversible investment knightian uncertainty,” journal economic theory, vol. 136, pp. 668-694. 8 shirakawa, masaaki (2009), "way out economic financial crisis: lesson policy actions" (speech japan society, new york), bank japan, april 23, 2009. 6 bi review 74/2009 financial crisis.9 it say deregulation result sharp increase leverage u investment bank multiple 12 33. recent year have, addition, see grow role "shadow bank system" financial operator outside framework bank regulation. hedge fund private equity fund epitomize rise fall shadow bank system. able freely engage financial transaction without bind bank regulation, financial operator use leverage earn large profits. investment bank also consider part shadow bank system regulation loose impose commercial banks. there nothing particularly wrong enlargement shadow bank system failure pose systemic risk. however, large commercial bank also develop close tie shadow bank system hedge fund umbrella create special purpose company balance sheet transfer relate operations. it reach point performance company begin impact soundness major commercial bank themselves. in addition, shadow bank system also great influence global financial system. when begin face liquidity shortfalls, accelerate sale assets, bring downward spiral asset prices, turn become one factor systemic risk. the current financial crisis indicate form regulation necessary shadow bank system. another important point raise concern relationship basel accord (bis rules) financial crisis, specifically procyclicality capital adequacy requirements. when economy improves, bank lend increase economy accelerate capital requirement become smaller, correspond reduction downside risk. conversely, economy deteriorates, bank lend decrease economy decelerate capital requirement become large downside risk increases. thus, capital adequacy requirement consider effect amplify business cycles.10 the procyclicality capital adequacy requirement criticize exacerbate economic downturn current financial crisis. nonetheless, appear consensus reach exactly serious procyclicality is. it important future new quantitative analysis perform procyclicality facilitate objective debate. 5. re-stabilizing financial system for remainder speech, i would like trace recent debate concern regulation maintain soundness individual financial institution safety net maintain stability entire financial system. in doing, i add theoretical examinations. in review recent debate, framework "3 cs" assistance.11 the 3 c stand word "comprehensive," "contingent" "cost-effective." "comprehensive" regulation best understand regulation without loopholes. unless regulatory net span financial institution comprehensively, regulation beef up, fund flee strictly regulate sector loosely regulate sectors. 9 blinder, a. s. (2009), “six error path financial crisis,” the new york times, january 25, 2009. 10 kashyap, a. k., j. c. stein (2004), “cyclical implication basel ii capital standards,” economic perspectives, 1q/2004, federal reserve bank chicago. 11 rajan, r. g. (2009), “cycle-proof regulation,” the economist, april 8, 2009. bi review 74/2009 7 "contingent" regulation follow properties. during up-phase period, mitigate overconfidence prevent accumulation systemic risk once systemic risk actually emerges, however, impose restriction avoid reinforce economic deterioration. in preparation severe erosion confidence, may furnish policy incentive restore confidence. to sum up, desirable regulation contingent risk-taking attitude market participants, thus strict boom loose busts. "cost-effective" regulation concept important evaluation regulations. this standard dictate one regulation could achieve results, least expensive approach chosen. for example, desirable induce financial institution raise capital, good boom time fund readily available oppose slump time economy begin turn sour fund cost higher. this standard also important consider use public funding. when make decision inject capital purchase nonperforming credits, one must consider cost involve well benefit policy effects. currently, basel committee bank supervision many fora, interest group ad hoc group float many different proposal best regulate finance. take "3 cs" mind, i would like take several regulatory reform proposal come international debate examine significance. in so, perhaps easy divide regulation two categories: "ex ante measures" take prevent crisis "ex post measures" influence crisis play happens. these could also term "policies normal times" "policies emergency times." (1) ex ante measure the basel committee bank supervision take lead discussion way alleviate procyclicality capital adequacy requirements. a i explained, current capital adequacy requirement consider procyclicality properties. in response, discussion focus idea introduce variable "buffer capital." this would make acceptable institution accumulate capital economy boom draw economy slumps. however, one also critique argument term "3 cs." capital adequacy requirement meaningless apply broadly-defined financial institutions, banks. even proposal understand desirable qualitative standpoint, still many problem would involve actual implementation. for example, idea accumulate capital boom times, still question specifically much capital pace accumulated. and therein even difficult question one define determine business cycle. implementation involve real-time judgment allow begin draw buffer. however, see business-cycle date problem japanese economy, long period time require peak trough business cycle identified. there also need clearly articulate time lag national business cycle treated. these handful issue must resolve regulation could flesh out. there another international debate take place liquidity monitoring. a i noted, current financial crisis initially emerge liquidity crisis. at time, system use regulator monitor liquidity internationally-active bank inadequate. the discussion therefore turn way increase effectiveness international monitor develop common liquidity metric share information among regulators. at current point time, debate focus liquidity metric would appropriate use. however, significant difference country country effectiveness liquidity monitoring. japan engage detail monitor cooperation 8 bi review 74/2009 institution involved, country quality monitor high. one-size-fit-all-type argument therefore realistic. mechanism must sufficiently flexible adaptable circumstance individual countries. with mind, i would like mention interest approach liquidity risk.12 without doubt, financial crisis view liquidity crisis, root cause excessive maturity mismatch balance sheet fund like. therefore, would desirable regulation would provide incentive alleviate maturity mismatch, thereby prevent crisis. one possible solution would link maturity mismatch asset liability capital requirement. for example, bank raise fund longer-term deposit would low capital requirement one raise fund overnight money market. this scheme would give bank incentive take long maturity liability side particular. put aside question whether desirable link maturity mismatch capital requirements, clear continuous monitor appropriate liquidity financial institution effective tool detect early-warning sign financial crisis. the g20 meet hold april decide reorganize financial stability forum (fsf) new "financial stability board" (fsb). previously, four international institutions, basel committee bank supervision, international organization security commissions, international association insurance supervisor international account standard board, make independent judgment take independent actions. the fsb expect serve kind supervisory body institution provide coordination functions. the measure aim overcome difference among sector create regulation rule consistent throughout financial system. the g20 also decide regulate hedge funds. this first step bring shadow bank system within net regulations. (2) ex post measure the global economy midst financial crisis. the ex post measure i describe policy program actually implement government central bank today. the unite state european country take initiative address liquidity fund-raise difficulty part step stabilize financial system. these effort organize two categories: "granting government guarantee market-based fund-raising" "expanding deposit protection." government guarantee market-based fund-raise attempt stabilize market condition fund-raising, particularly bond issuance financial institutions, time financial market increasingly strained. most country also take measure raise deposit insurance ceiling deposit insurance scheme and/or guarantee unlimited protection personal deposits. these measure succeed alleviate perceive uncertainty depositor regard financial system, avoid serious upheaval bank run provide bank stable source fund-raise deposits. during current financial crisis, country respond comprehensive policy packages. public capital injection important component packages. however, specific nature injection differ country country even time time country. in cases, injection make across board, even sound banks, preemptive measure, case injection bail financial institution record large loss significantly impair 12 brunnermeier, m., a. crockett, c. goodhart, a. persaud h. shin (2009), “the fundamental principle financial regulation,” international centre monetary bank study & centre economic policy research, geneva report world economy, vol. 11, 2009. bi review 74/2009 9 capital. there also number difference design instrument accompany conditions. the unite state european countries’ government purchase nonperforming asset provide loss compensation scheme asset order cap loss amounts. these measure differ term whether asset take balance sheets, time account loss asset recognize necessity price individual assets. despite differences, however, aim remove concern soundness financial institution relieve uncertainty asset holdings. when japan confront severe financial system problem late 1990s, begin buy nonperforming asset late move injection public capital. in contrast, first step unite state european country deal current financial crisis inject public capital, move purchase nonperforming assets.13 the reason difference, presumably, difficulty value nonperforming asset speed crisis progressing. the nonperforming asset current crisis complex securitized instruments, generally back home mortgages. with market function significantly impaired, easy task arrive pricing. in unite states, public private sector join together create fund purchase nonperforming asset attempt take balance sheets. it remain see whether system function intended. a real economy worsens, scope nonperforming asset move securitized product commercial loans. a development must watch closely. the impact upheaval international financial capital market vary across country regions. while financial system unite state european country visibly shaken, japanese financial system remain stable whole. however, guarantee japan spar decline financial intermediation function worsen earn fall share price impinge institutions' capital. japan take number measure achieve policy goal maintain financial intermediation functions. on december 16, 2008, act special measure strengthen financial function amend provide injection public capital. on april 10, bank japan decide provide subordinate loan financial institution order help increase capital. prior this, february 3, restart program purchase equity financial institution ensure stability financial system support mitigate equity hold risk financial institutions. this unique policy gear towards japanese financial institutions, tend large equity holdings. the government also restart purchase program march. 6. approach new safety net separate political movement expand strengthen regulation, also completely new approach propose stabilize financial system. what financial crisis clearly teach u extreme difficulty strengthen banks' capital financial crisis way, is, macro systemic risk materialized. view opposite perspective, creation safety net would facilitate bank capital increase time crisis would greatly contribute stabilization 13 the unite state attempt unsuccessfully introduce scheme call "m-lec" purchase nonperforming asset similar do japan. since september 2008, instead opt inject public funding, european countries. 10 bi review 74/2009 financial system. the new approach i explain focus point. i would first like introduce idea private-sector "capital insurance," expansion concept ordinary insurance. then, review problem involve private-sector capital insurance, i would like discus potential capital insurance form public-private partnership overcome them. finally, several scheme also introduce variety scheme propose far. these scheme come general rubric "contingent capital" safety net attempt increase capital necessary crisis little impact possible market. (1) private sector "capital insurance"14let begin overview private-sector "capital insurance." a name suggests, scheme involve insurance policy. the bank position insure ordinary insurance policy, investor position normally occupy insurance company. when insurance policy agreed, bank pay investor premium. in response, investor lock away liability reserve "lock box." should financial crisis, pay insurance benefit bank lock box. the bank use fund increase capital. if policy term elapse without financial crisis, liability reserve lock box return investor. this basic idea behind capital insurance. what sort bank envision insured? professor kashyap advocate private sector capital insurance say open financial institution subject basel accord (bis rules). what crucial financial institution potential cause systemic risk enrolled, although proponent say institution decide whether enter insurance policy. i would like return issue moment discus fully, since issue important determine whether effective tool avoid systemic risk. the next question is: who envision insurers? professor kashyap others argue investor subject basel accord able provide insurance. if investor subject basel accord, financial crisis occurs, capital merely transfer one bank another improvement soundness bank system whole. in words, crisis break out, maintain stability financial system require injection capital outside system. accord professor kashyap others, possible investor could pension fund sovereign wealth fund (swf), problem guarantee investor invest capital insurance. finally, question identify "insured events" trigger payouts insurance benefits. the standard advocate professor kashyap proponent payout trigger move average (e.g., average four quarters) total loss financial institution enter insurance policy exceed certain threshold value. their point important look loss bank system whole, individual institutions. it reflect fact capital insurance propose ultimately insurance systemic risk financial crisis. however, put aside clear case find now, difficult subtle task determine constitute financial crisis. this another important point need address perspective risk management, since relate question quickly scheme would able strengthen capital without mistakes. while proposal professor kashyap others seem bite novel, constitute attempt provide safety net financial system attach insurance 14 kashyap, a. k., r. g. rajan j. c. stein (2009), “rethinking capital regulation,” in: maintain stability change financial system, federal reserve bank kansa city, pp. 431-471. bi review 74/2009 11 capital certain threshold. it also excellent attempt internalize external diseconomies. during 1990s, japan inject enormous amount capital bank order stabilize financial system. likewise, enormous amount capital inject european u financial institution current financial crisis. while institution anticipate able repay fund quickly, others continue require large large injections. if capital returned, taxpayer ultimately bear costs. a i touch upon discussion "credit bubble," financial institution engage excessive risk-taking assumption government central bank would something problem. that is, financial institution generate external diseconomies systemic risk, bear cost cleanup, keep profit themselves. this proposal ask institution bear cost materialize systemic risk form premiums. in sense, internalize external diseconomies. that said, proposal table professor kashyap others also many problems. first, capital insurance advocate entirely private main insurer private-sector investors. will private-sector investor able come enormous liability reserve would require halt systemic risk? they look pension fund swfs play role, always rely them? obviously, might able attract enough investor premium sufficiently high. but premium high, financial institution would forgo insurance altogether.15 also, crisis deepens, institution may require capital injection beyond amount initially envisioned. there potential systemic risk materialize liability reserve pay lock box. a crisis like current one global dimension may beyond private sector fund alone deal with. in situations, really possible stop erosion confidence? that said, idea good combine additional government-based insurance set deal large losses, so, possible maintain confidence capital insurance. the proposal professor kashyap others enrollment capital insurance voluntary. there guarantee, therefore, financial institution impact financial system stability would purchase capital insurance. this classic free-rider problem. in particular, bank consider "too big fail" might well decide purchase capital insurance. if indeed "too big fail," bankruptcy would generate systemic risk government could expect bail regardless whether enrol capital insurance. if assumption correct, bank incentive purchase capital insurance. what end situation one purchase capital insurance long believe government never allow financial crisis occur. there also question capital insurance pricing. for ordinary insurance products, price base law large numbers. however, financial crisis "tail event" rarely occurs, phenomenon probability distribution completely unknown. in either case, law large number cannot use price capital insurance. (2) capital insurance public-private partnership a i noted, scheme propose professor kashyap others many problems. however, solve public institution use back private capital insurance. first, public institution responsible part insurance, possible provide liability reserve sufficient size. moreover, need actually put liability reserve away. it sufficient commitment 15 professor blind make similar comment regard paper professor kashyap et. al. symposium sponsor last year federal reserve bank kansa city. 12 bi review 74/2009 fiscal outlay insure event occurs.16 in addition, government’s involvement would prevent private premium become high face phenomenon carry large uncertainties.17 private sector expertise must marshal order insurance program effective. therefore, one option quite possible create public-private partnership efficient private sector institution originate capital insurance is, purposes, "re-insured" government. that form japan us provide "earthquake insurance." a public-private partnership capital insurance enable system draw upon expertise private sector achieve great efficiency would see capital insurance provide public institution only. to well-functioning capital insurance, need public nature, also element mandatory enrollment. more specifically, financial institution potential trigger systemic risk must require enroll insurance program. this solve free-rider problem. it might also allow financial institution opt insurance program. however, cases, financial institution would require scale back business demonstrate trigger systemic risk. even still, easy matter come objective criterion use identify "financial institution potential trigger systemic risk." there also question whether bank need cover insurance. it impossible foresee business model source future instability financial system. therefore, regulator must constantly review definition "financial institution potential trigger systemic risk" financial sector develop evolve. the remain issue price insurance. the involvement public institution provision insurance mean burden ultimately revert public. it go without say fair public bear cost enjoy benefit stable financial system. an important issue convince public appropriateness insurance pricing. this require bite creativity mechanism use set premiums. a rather simple example, consider mechanism premium base measurement institution's systemic risk, define term gross assets. in cases, financial institution right border enrol enrol insurance may elect reduce size asset compel enroll. if premium set low side encourage financial institution participate, low provide deterrent risk-taking financial institution carry large systemic risks. without go detail here, problem solve progressive premium gear size institution. if government involve insurance, may impossible avoid give impression government-funded "bailout insurance." if case, may new moral hazard financial institutions. indeed, overstate case say big hurdle involvement public institution capital insurance suppress moral hazards. therefore, introduction capital insurance public institution involvement cannot allow undermine importance regulatory supervision enrol institutions. 16 rochet, j. c.

(3) other discussion in addition schemes, many proposal put forward enable capital strengthen financial institution crisis, serve start point active discussion deal macro systemic risk. i would like give brief overview them. the first instrument call "catastrophe bond." most people use abbreviate form "cat bond." the issuer instrument relieve obligation repay principal investor certain condition satisfied. by sell investor bond redemption waive event major losses, bank able maintain capital even loss incurred. for example, bank hold nonperforming credits, could forgive large amount debt could simultaneously downsize asset liability side keep capital untouched. another similar instrument call "reverse convertible debenture."18 this bond automatically convert equity certain condition satisfied. put aside issue account treatment, instrument similar effect capital cat bond. by sell investor bond convert equity event major losses, bank would able raise capital automatically even loss incurred. finally, contract know "margin call shareholders."19 this contract allow issuer compel shareholder purchase additional share certain condition satisfied. for example, issue equity kind agreement attached, bank incur large loss could cause exist shareholder purchase new equity, reduce need raise capital market. with instruments, possible set trigger differently accord specific purposes. for instance, objective maintain soundness specific financial institution, trigger would probably loss institution. if objective prevent systemic risk, trigger would total loss financial institution enrol system. in latter case, uniform trigger would need set contract fulfil time. in section, i try give overview several different form financial instrument could part safety net financial system. there would need form mechanism place financial institution potential trigger systemic risk hold instruments. mandatory purchase one approach, also think give incentive financial institution purchase accord. one effective method might allow institution count instrument capital. 18 flannery, m. j.

conclusion there grow momentum, particularly europe, strong bank regulation. the argument base opinion current global financial crisis would occur regulation sufficiently strong. however, one must question whether strong regulation prevent future financial crises. there demonstration point, indeed, even fully discussed, even academic circles. there undeniable impression debate bank regulation recent month accept assumption strong regulation necessary prevent recurrence crisis without critical investigation. there also careful cautious discussion side effect regulation. if one take step back fundamental economic perspective government involvement versus economic efficiency, two trade-off particular could consider importance. the first relationship improve financial intermediation function financial system stability. strong regulation may indeed increase stability financial system. on hand, government interference potential reduce economic efficiency. inefficiency financial service sector manifest form reduce financial intermediation functions. these question view issue public economics tool discipline need apply cost-benefit analysis two perspective quality quantity. such analysis apply wide range candidate regulation order arrive best balance economic efficiency government regulation interference. the second point consider trade-off financial sector innovation financial system stability. when unease financial system surfaces, always argument restrict operation financial institution undertake, manifest “narrow banking” approaches. however, many cases, argument lack perspective financial innovation. it would difficult indeed enhance value add finance industry without use innovation flexibly adapt dynamic economic developments. we must therefore consider approach promote innovation also maintain stability system. in so, must pay attention two form innovation: one achieve consolidation attrition company achieve within single company. japan large number "long-established" companies, fact illustrate process innovation latter sense take place time. financial sector exception: innovation occur primarily within banks. therefore, promote innovation financial sector see question promote "scrap build process" within organization environment changes. the current global financial crisis raise significant issue financial institution risk management supervisory regulation. in remark today, i describe active debate currently take place. japan experience rupture asset bubble early 1990s prolong period financial economic stagnation thereafter. we therefore advantage able discus issue realistically basis experiences. i look forward great contribution debate japanese academic community, hope i would like close remark today. thank kind attention. bi review 74/2009 15 gertrude tumpel-gugerell: beyond turmoil – rules, supervision infrastructure speech m gertrude tumpel-gugerell, member executive board european central bank, open

importance retail market overall stability efficiency financial system, need complete single euro payment area (sepa). performance eu market infrastructure financial turmoil the financial market turmoil impact eu payment systems, central counterparties (ccps) security settlement system mainly intensify volatile market activity. we also see peak transaction volume well frequent high margin calls. furthermore, many infrastructure cope default major participant, notably context demise lehman brother september 2008 correspond spill-over effect subsidiaries. fortunately, eu market infrastructure able effectively overcome challenge without major operational disruptions. in particular, eurosystem’s target system – backbone large-value payment infrastructure euro, also play central role provide settlement service 36 retail payment system 33 security settlement system connect ancillary system – prove bi review 74/2009 1 stable resilient. nonetheless, i would like mention three key stylise fact illustrate impact current turmoil: first, value process target last quarter 2008 show unusually high increase 13% compare first three quarter (see chart 1). when look average value settle different time band day, main difference third fourth quarter 2008 relate value settle last hour operations. this reflect strong increase overnight deposit make bank national central bank consequence switch full allotment fix rate tender ecb’s open market operations, follow intensification crisis collapse lehman brother september 2008. second, surprisingly september 2008 onwards, see remarkable increase number sender limit along decrease value (see chart 2). nonetheless, change marginal impact smooth flow transaction cause delay timely submission payments. third, level non-settled payment remain fairly stable second half 2008, amount 1% total daily average value settle system (see chart 3), indicate overall resilience target system face financial turmoil. crucially, market infrastructure continue function robustly. in particular, provide stable network despite highly disruptive condition financial markets, market infrastructure play important shock-absorbing role help maintain overall public confidence financial system. since central bank overseer financial regulator recognise long ago critical importance reliable function market infrastructure overall financial stability efficiency, take action together service providers. stringent requirement ensure eu infrastructure adequately designed, effectively manage risks, operate efficiently reliably, normal circumstance time crisis. recent experience suggest measure well-targeted. nevertheless, area improvement also identified. i shall mention key area action. area improvement a stated, i would like focus three areas: firstly, improvement relate overall crisis management arrangements; secondly, strengthen market infrastructure over-the-counter (otc) derivatives; thirdly, effort gear produce integrate retail payment infrastructure. crisis management arrangement one priority relate overall crisis management arrangement improve notification procedures, particularly regard communication insolvency public authority infrastructure provider market participants. although generally work well current turmoil, measure progress foster exchange standardise information. in addition, measure need ensure close cooperation authority regard relationship default participant coordination measure limit impact default. moreover, might advantage infrastructure able end unilaterally contractual relationship participant (without wait final decision relevant judicial administrative authority). furthermore, current turmoil remind u default rule need sufficiently clear comprehensive infrastructure participant, also 2 bi review 74/2009 cause conflict infrastructures. therefore, infrastructure become increasingly interlinked, coordination implementation default rule vital mitigate risk systemic level. finally, default lehman brother major showcase severe implication “institution-based interdependencies” two infrastructure result exposure major financial institution participate infrastructures. therefore, crucial u continue closely monitor interdependency individual institution order ass impact stability infrastructure. infrastructure otc derivative let turn need strengthen infrastructure otc derivatives. otc derivative market dynamic veritable explosion outstanding contract volume primarily past decade. the basic problem, however, dynamic evolution otc derivative market outstrip development underlie clear settlement arrangements. indeed, post-trading otc derivative remain predominantly bilateral non-standardised, respective arrangement become increasingly inadequate cop grow volume complexity otc derivative trades. this highlight particular financial market turmoil, high trade activity market volatility aggravate exist tensions. [the result process backlog uncertainty counterparty risk raise strong concern among policymakers, highlight financial stability forum’s april 2008 report 1 lesson financial turmoil.] the need strengthen market infrastructure credit default swap (cds) stem importance cd market overall financial stability, three reasons. first, systemic importance cd market come high degree interconnectivity cd market credit cash security markets, embed financial leverage cds, significant level cd exposure relation total asset capital cushion bank involved. second, associate financial risks, example compare interest rate foreign exchange derivatives, difficult manage. this stem great underlie complexity correlation different cd exposure market-wide strain occur. third, specific risk financial stability stem high degree market concentration sizable financial risk hold small group major market players. therefore – see default lehman brothers, also early near-defaults bear stearns aig – default one major cd counterparty put market severe strain. a natural inference experience current turmoil is, therefore, improve resilience otc derivative market widespread adoption central counterparty clear exchange trading. central counterparties (ccps), concentrate outstanding derivative position participate buyer seller one place, enable significant reduction counterparty risk: firstly, diversification net risk exposures; secondly, application stringent risk-based margining procedure ensure adequate management; thirdly, collateralisation outstanding exposure least daily even intra-day basis. in addition, ccps also contribute significantly market transparency integrity bring significant operational efficiency gains, e.g. standardisation risk management process well via multilateral net collateral management. 1 financial stability forum, “report financial stability forum enhance market institutional resilience”, april 2008. bi review 74/2009 3 a result, public authority industry body worldwide embrace establishment ccps cd market top priority expect number solution eu unite state run end july 2009. in view role euro derivative market, i would welcome ccp euro area. the effective timely implementation respective roadmaps full dealer commitment make maximum possible use facility essential. look ahead, also vital ensure close convergence requirement approach overseer regulator involve maintain level playing-field different ccps pre-empt possible regulatory arbitrage. at eu level, forthcoming escb-cesr recommendation central counterparties already revise include specific guidance application ccps otc derivatives. it also crucial achieve common understand global level well. in respect, look forward recently initiate joint effort cps iosco review cpss-iosco recommendation central counterparties issue 2004. finally, i wish reiterate introduction ccps panacea address concern regard resilience efficiency otc derivative markets. for instance, need complementary action ensure good risk management transparency well product yet sufficiently standardise eligible central clearing. furthermore, sound post-trading need complement enhance trading, pre-clearing lifecycle management otc derivatives, e.g. via great use automate trade confirmation, portfolio compression, registration trade central data depositories, well enhance risk management disclosure requirement financial institution involve otc derivative trading. towards efficient resilient retail infrastructure euro area let finally come third issue need focus beyond current turmoil: vital role retail infrastructure term financial stability. the retail business facilitate bulk payment relate day-to-day life financial activity individual companies. it represent financial system’s interface general public crucial preserve confidence financial system and, ultimately, euro single currency. two issue relate retail business current turmoil noteworthy. first, retail business – cornerstone saving, lending, payment service – successfully withstand financial crisis. second, bank balance business model best equip cope current challenges. therefore, retail service offer two major opportunity present time: first, revive confidence bank sector eye general public; second, strengthen banks’ balance sheets. however, one important – sometimes overlook – issue seem key prerequisite: way large value infrastructure mention before, stable efficient retail infrastructure need throughout europe order alleviate systemic risk safeguard financial stability. however, despite 50 year european economic integration, europe still lack integrate retail payment market. therefore, realisation completion single euro payment area project crucial element retail bank payment market beyond turmoil. without doubt, sepa large payment initiative undertake europe, follow euro cash changeover. major milestone already achieved: recently, regulator address uncertainty surround interchange fee reachability sepa direct debit. nevertheless still number topic common agenda, e.g. standardisation cards, payment innovations, migration end date, governance payment issue european level. 4 bi review 74/2009 harmonisation field retail payment natural area efficiency gains. however, market move slowly direction. although sepa continue mainly self-regulated project, element might need regulator involvement. the eurosystem emphasise realistic ambitious sepa migration end date necessary. such date would facilitate communication provide certainty stakeholders. the viable option achieve end date regulation public authorities. since eu regulation probably effective option eurosystem appreciate commission’s launch public consultation topic. only tear wall fragmentation ultimately bring harmonisation, efficiency gain level playing-field. such development inevitably lead increase competition. i fully aware easy – especially period low growth high credit risk – change revenue models. however, invest early benefit position successfully. corporates tell u would benefit sepa service internationally connected. take consideration renew relevance retail payments, key success factor year ahead harmonisation, innovation increase competitiveness. bank infrastructure successfully take challenge continue play important role retail payments. conclusion from begin crisis, ecb act decisive manner. it take number measure unprecedented nature, scope timing. the ecb provide large amount liquidity support banks. by make change operational framework, ecb make sure solvent bank would sufficient access funding. when crisis intensify september last year, introduce number new measures. most importantly, provide bank unlimited access liquidity fix rate six months. the ecb also expand list asset eligible use collateral eurosystem’s credit operations. moreover, recently announce measures, namely provide long term refinance one year purchase cover bond eur 60 bn. look beyond turmoil rules, regulation infrastructures, current financial turmoil teach u one key lesson future: self-regulation sufficient systemically important markets, institution infrastructures. maintain financial stability public interest. therefore, public authority must take appropriate measure regulate, supervise oversee systemically important markets, institution infrastructure order prevent systemic risk spread safeguard financial stability system. for market infrastructures, one lesson future that, despite remarkable resilience current crisis, room complacency give crucial role financial stability. on contrary, overseer regulator future year need increase effort towards ensure safe secure market infrastructure also strengthen eu market infrastructures. i highlight three specific area enhancement. first, general crisis management arrangements, particularly disseminate information increase awareness default arrangement market infrastructures. second, measure build market infrastructure otc derivatives, also euro area. and third – case large value payment system – need integrate harmonise retail payment structure. therefore, i regard continue full support stakeholder effective timely implementation single euro payment area key priority period ahead. thank attention. bi review 74/2009 5 annex i: chart chart 1 value settle target per time band chart 2 evolution limit ssp chart 3 non-settled payment ssp 6 bi review 74/2009 martín redrado: what’s wrong current framework global financial architecture? speech mr martín redrado, governor central bank argentina, bank indonesia’s 7th annual international seminar “global financial tsunami: do?”, bali, 13 june 2009. * * * climate change topic seminar, last year, appropriately embed label occasion. this particularly appeal turbulent time global economy go through. the international environment seem emerge unique combination natural catastrophes: extensive drought credit markets, earthquake trade flood distrust. and, former weren’t enough, confront risk a-flu pandemic. in context several structural change economy experience worldwide, also different microclimates. first, i briefly provide vision global economy head to. for purposes, i ass recent development “micro-environments” add several question mark likelihood achieve sustainable long-lasting recovery. then, lesson learn far crisis term change need regulatory policy framework national supra-national level addressed. in case global financial infrastructure evolve path follow, i stress lender last resort role regulatory function. the u.s. economy still “de-leveraging” mode. the two-fold hit financial asset home equity loss lead significant wealth destruction combine debt overhang call strong correction savings. this process already begin pce figures. they reveal save rate jump zero early last year five percent today. further adjustment pipeline. the labor market still downside, amid continue massive lays-off manufacture sector. although particular area seem bottom like construction service – evidence intense decline output see – spend still weak. we describe, far, witness recently “jobless recovery”. on monetary financial side, string initiative launch one deliver expect term kick start credit market. ppip, talf, tslf, tarp; even hard track extensive list program aim supply liquidity, fresh capital re-start securitization goal boost market activity crowd out. on demand side, one drawback go forward financial institution likely take advantage excessive leverage happen past. on supply side, much debate around exit strategies. particularly, feed go deal massive liquidity provision, see increase inflationary risk. however point make opposite direction: i mean deflationary scenario result unwind liquidity provision. if feed obtain profit due operation (given revaluation financial asset bought, would, course be, good news) would end withdraw cash market formerly issued. this could trigger new dry markets. so, return pre-crisis balance sheet fed. in view, roadmap sustainable recovery several feature as: i) long term funding, still absent; ii) household balance sheet repair (the micro-fundamentals point additional adjustment still come); iii) bank balance sheet repair; bank redesign basis simple criteria, low leverage bi review 73/2009 1 capital. bury old system enable new one emerge take time; iv) long-run fiscal monetary sustainability. on edge atlantic, europe catch delicate situation. first, divergence policy maker fiscal monetary policy measure prevent deepen slump. and, second, “east menace”, sizable exposure bank system eastern europe risk. currency mismatch impact credit risk still pose significant challenge region. in fact, whole periphery (both east west) scrutiny due brutal adjustment aggregate spend yield sky-rocket unemployment. in emerge world, adjustment also take place. and, cases, show hard way. we witness asian economy suffer collapse trade mostly region-driven. figure reveal u.s. import fall much intra-asia trade. on positive side, inventory data east asia suggest retrenchment industrial activity might over. again, also “green shoots” could effect anti-crisis package rather last effect domestic consumption take “driver’s seat”. on side latin america good prepare face crisis compare history way emerge market affected. and, course, development achieve chance. follow crisis 1990s 2000s, country take important step strengthen macroeconomic management, prudential regulation oversight. improve current account fiscal positions, large amount external liquidity, good liability management robust monetary framework several feature place region even first row fire line time. i would like stress, particular, strengthen balance sheets, include build liquidity buff face external shock reduce currency mismatch – one key sin past. the development domestic currency capital market corner-stone allow monetary financial system act shock smooth rather shock amplifier. several challenge lie ahead restore normal path world financial system. let tackle issue share view relevant topic need address national supra-national order. at national level, one key structural change financial stability rank high every central bank goal worldwide. both develop emerge country adjust monetary scheme focus interest rate single instrument maintain stability. in region, financial stability always forefront central banks´ tool kit due recurrent crisis. in fact, financial stability objective implicitly explicitly added, instrument adjust new priorities. within framework, many central bank revisit usual regulation, operation intervention mechanisms. in regard, economic literature lag behind. if relationship economic theory policy recommendation reasonably well define “normal” times, time turmoil, relationship become much weaker. we reach point economic theory hard time keep praxis. literature show result ambiguous contrary produce usual “technology”, especially relation approach rely interest rate single instrument. the apply manage float exchange rate regimes. recent empirical paper refine analysis start several academic argue sharp fluctuation domestic currency. instead, mitigate excessive volatility, especially develop country rather shallow capital market limit access hedge instruments, seem appropriate policy. this kind monetary financial framework ensure systemic stability main task last years. this mean give priority avoid "the next crisis" 2 bi review 73/2009 build buff minimize effect disruptions. in country, decade macroeconomic instability recurrent crisis harmless term welfare. although latin american country show low economic growth rate high macroeconomic volatility regions, case argentina different scale. if consider past 30 years, average growth latin america le half asia’s, volatility nearly double asian levels. in period time, argentina’s growth three time low emerge asia, volatility turn eight time higher. this process trigger enormous economic social losses, hind chance develop lead change citizens’ behavior. indeed, consequence process include portfolio dollarization; fiscal dominance; obstacle develop long-term credit market; mark negative correlation change retail deposit foreign exchange fluctuations. these factors, undermine power traditional monetary policy instruments, play key role design current monetary financial system. in particular, risk management strategy base four pillar (permanent equilibrium monetary market, manage float exchange rate regime, development external liquidity buffers, appropriate financial regulation supervision) compatible aim well tool available. this scheme, carefully develop along recent years, allow u overcome episode stress, minimize impact real economy avoid inconsistency might make unsustainable time. over last two years, experience four period significant financial stress domestic market monetary financial framework delivered. in events, first react firmly normalize money demand stabilize foreign exchange market. then, simple instruments, ensure liquidity provision guarantee systemic stability. finally, implement array measure include reform market central bank securities, development additional mechanism liquidity provision, change enhance future market depth transparency, instrument facilitate supply foreign currency. our system work dam rest economy, provide first time decade monetary financial stability. so view, need rethink paradigm central bank tool provide monetary financial stability. now let move national level global one. in instance sophisticate supra-national framework urgently need deal financial stability. any roadmap least follow ingredients: i) great convergence financial regulation supervision standard among countries; ii) rethink role imf; iii) reinforcement macro-prudential supervision regulation tools; iv) reformulation asset valuation methods; v) avoidance regulatory arbitrage control shadow bank system; vi) redefinition credit rat agency function. current event show cross-border bank operation systemic macroeconomic consequence domestically internationally. this call coordinate action national authority together aggressive “stepping up” international financial institutions. let clear: international architecture desperate need “guardian” global financial stability. this is, course, well-suited role imf give global reach infrastructure. so far, imf announce series measures, revisit traditional credit practice create new credit lines, flexible credit line (fcl) exogenous shock facility (esf). these welcome step also “baby” steps. a long bi review 73/2009 3 comprehensive set product different country different particular need developed, attempt perform role effectively would fall short. the imf fire power deal global event also proper equipment. this mean make available instrument ensure adequate circulation liquidity worldwide. this may include: short-term credit liquidity purpose central bank tailor specific need country , guarantee scheme develop particular domestic credit market variety product country face capital outflow unrelated economic fundamentals, among others. it matter chance many bilateral swap agreement central bank emerge crisis. it natural response system lack international provider liquidity last resort go forward. in view, welcomed, arrangement enough term size length provide alternative self-insurance via foreign reserve accumulation. in fact, development bilateral agreement regional initiative chiang mai prove need international cooperation context absence multilateral organization position perform kind “central bank central banks”. this next step need go for. and happen, role g-20 critical. so far, group manage build consensus relevant issue able make progress reform international financial architecture (expansion fsf basel committee, capitalization imf, revisit imf international lender last resort role, speed governance reform process ifis) coordinate macroeconomic policy response crisis. one key challenge g-20 face go forward consolidate formal body. that mean propose change reform international financial architecture also, importantly, systematically monitor degree implementation. the next meet go essential ass degree progress implementation course action set forth. in view, creation fsb significant reform international financial architecture far. the fsb play key role new international financial architecture. it responsible coordinate bank regulation, develop regulatory supervisory standards, prepare early warn report exchange information supervisors. enhance representation increase likelihood effective implementation standard hike quality standards. for instance, case regulatory treatment currency mismatches, we, i mean country suffer significant macroeconomic crisis, experience share. the increase credit risk face subsidiaries, subsidiary significant bank group whole, impose significant negative effect parent bank home financial market. central bank could strengthen regulation credit risk management require bank grant loan, assure currency mismatch exist debtors’ balance sheets. this regulation impose host authority subsidiary jurisdictions, also, home regulator bank group whole regard subsidiaries. this mean example home regulator ask parent bank subsidiary inside group must comply requirement. if not, penalty imposed, increase capital requirements. the effect kind currency mismatch could explicitly consider pilar ii basel ii agreement. if effect currency mismatch properly attend banks, supervisor bank group level, require additional capital attend potential effect, bank group level, worsen debtors´ income host markets, therefore, subsidiary capital position then, 4 bi review 73/2009 parent bank capital positions. also, potential effect currency mismatch explicitly address supervisory colleges. credit risk transfer another key aspect agenda. instead reduce systemic risks, credit default swap contribute raise them. risk always shift party best able bear it, subject lax regulatory constraints. another topic important highlight, relevance emerge market economies, lack transparency absence reliable statistic otc derivative market non-financial corporations. this opacity leave policy-makers without information exposure otc transaction do foreign financial institutions. a know, consequence exposure emerge market systemically important central bank provide financial assistance market, avoid major financial distress. we must work towards encourage trade credit derivative use electronic platform regulate exchange clear standardize credit derivative central counterparty. this would help reduce risk, part allow multilateral net outstanding notional amounts, and, hand, requirement post collateral. however, central bank promote usage prepare provide access central bank credit facilities, provide liquidity mean case need. a macro-prudential approach recommend regulator supervisor consider potential systemic risk vulnerability environment financial institution act. it fundamental understand interaction exist financial system real economy. this approach demand great cooperation local external regulators, require develop integrate picture financial system, consider banks, also financial institutions. the analysis macroeconomic vulnerability could subsequently impact financial system liquidity solvency also embed regulatory framework. deviation analyze relation long-term trend certain variables, credit gdp ratio, asset price (residential commercial property, share government securities, currencies), exchange rate equilibrium (real/effective) international capital flows, among others. to sum up, expect financial market go different go forward. the former market base financial system bring umbrella prudential regulation avoid regulatory arbitrage. however, could lead time slow credit expansion give high leverage sector allow fast credit expansion allege underlay fast growth rates. so again, prevent credit market bubble call tough surveillance kind financial agents, time careful choke productivity growth. in financial framework, central bank duty also rethink particularly regard ability lender last resort non-bank financial institutions. but something sure stable global financial market would reduce “parking” liquidity leave possibility divert resource efficiently allocated, help country keep catch need development societies. bi review 73/2009 5 barbro wickman-parak: the financial crisis – stand today heading? speech m barbro wickman-parak, deputy governor sverige riksbank, danske market's central bank seminar, snekkersten, denmark, 11 june 2009. * * * when i join executive board riksbank almost exactly two year ago, may 2007, i expect new job vary exciting. though i perhaps wasn’t expect excite way turn be. of course already aware problem subprime loan unite states. but, like people sweden abroad, i didn’t foresee worry sign saw would gradually develop global financial crisis historical proportions. nor i anticipate result crisis riksbank would lend several hundred billion kronor banks. or riksbank would cut repo rate 4.25 percentage point course six months, low level ever – fast monetary policy ease period inflation target. and course i could anticipate several central bank would reach low limit policy rate begin resort unconventional measures. but nevertheless – stand now. several explanation crisis one usually say crisis begin 2007 problem u mortgage market gradually develop global financial crisis, become acute autumn 2008 connection lehman brother file bankruptcy. but picture complex this. the origin course crisis analyse thoroughly probably complete history much later. however, already note several explanation crisis arise become widespread. one circumstance probably play role growth long good many countries, time inflation low – quite simply, thing go unusually well unusually long period time. and thing go well long period time probably human nature relax become slightly incautious. this appear happen time various way places, solely u mortgage market. one factor probably also contribute global save surplus mean large capital sum invest financial markets. this surplus push interest rate risk-free assets. the combination lot money invest low risk-free interest rate contribute increase demand asset profitable invest lead intensify hunt high yield. this type environment often inspire great inventiveness financial market many new financial instrument also created. these often complex difficult valuate correctly. but optimistic climate prevail – everything go well long – nevertheless easy sell them. those invest new instrument disregarded, fail sufficiently understand, risk “inbuilt” them. the financial supervisory authority regulation also lag behind development. the problem international financial market begin become apparent early summer 2007. but swedish economy swedish financial market long appear able manage fairly well, despite fact turbulence effect world around us. of course, economic activity sweden begin weaken international economic activity declined, initially seem entail serious downturn. however, lehman brother file bankruptcy september bi review 73/2009 1 2008 situation worsen dramatically. the confidence exist financial institution shake foundation one certain might next line default payments. now swedish financial market also hard hit sub-markets practically standstill. the early expectation decline economic activity would fairly mild replace much negative view future developments, sweden abroad. the lehman brother crisis also prelude series measure stabilise swedish financial markets. at time riksbank take several rapid resolute step interest ladder alleviate effect crisis economic activity. still sensitive liquidity risk decline the first phase crisis describe liquidity confidence crisis. no one trust anyone else will lend money take risks. the price loan banks, interbank rates, also rise sharply. since crisis start central bank lend large amount banks. for example, riksbank offer loan swedish kronor long maturity normal facilitate supply liquidity swedish banks. we also lend u dollar swedish bank make collateral requirement loan somewhat generous. the government try reduce banks’ liquidity risk guarantee programme, basically involve bank credit institution able sign contract government guarantee borrowing. without measure take riksbank authority financial system would cease function would still functioning. the apply course many countries. a note financial stability report publish one week ago, measure contribute ensure imminent risk liquidity shortage banks. interbank rate fallen, although still appear difficult find fund long maturities. there also sign condition international credit market ease somewhat appear become slightly easy obtain fund issue securities, even back government guarantee. now unfortunately case problem – yet solid grind regard financial stability. there still lack confidence financial institution international credit market fairly far function crisis. the situation still sensitive still risk surprisingly negative shock give crisis new energy make difficult bank obtain funding. the riksbank course follow development closely. we continue supply bank liquidity prepare long necessary. but summarise briefly, situation look somewhat bright regard liquidity risk. great focus credit risk now liquidity risk le prominent, instead great focus credit risks, economic activity weaken growth prospect deteriorated. the large policy rate cut make central bank around world fiscal policy stimulation government able prevent severe weaken economic activity. our recent forecast publish april point gdp world fall good 1 per cent 2009. this something quite unique: since 1970 gdp world increase average 3.6 per cent year growth negative even single year. the export-dependent swedish economy hard hit international downturn. in april monetary policy update forecast fall gdp 4 per cent 2009. when economic activity weaken demand good service decline become difficult banks’ borrower meet payments. bankruptcy 2 bi review 73/2009 increase bank suffer loan losses. the loan loss turn make bank even le will lend money economy risk end spiral fall activity strict credit term reinforce one another. the bank cope loan loss the main scenario riksbank’s forecast involve sweden end serious downward spiral. but recently publish financial stability report nevertheless assuming, even main scenario, swedish bank face fairly substantial loan loss 2009 2010. a large share losses, approximately 40 per cent, expect arise operation baltic country rest eastern europe. but report also note major swedish bank sufficient capital cope loss arise riksbank's forecast correct. we also observe swedish bank well-capitalised international perspective. one cannot disregard fact great uncertainty future development economic activity. when one task safeguard financial stability, natural prepare situation thing go badly. and assess resilience financial system also great interest study negative development one forecast. we therefore investigate financial stability report bank would cope scenario much weak development consider likely today. there assume, instance, gdp sweden fall twice much predict main scenario forecast 2009 2010 monetary policy update publish april. it assume really negative scenario financial stability report development baltic country rest eastern europe much weaker, although far reason behind poor development. here, too, approximately 40 per cent loan loss expect come operation regions. in scenario bank meet statutory requirement tier 1 capital adequacy least four per cent. however, may necessary high capital adequacy avoid negative consequence fund problem downgrade credit ratings. in unlikely event negative scenario occur, several bank might therefore force act strengthen capital bases. if could achieve solely private capital injections, possibility government inject capital virtue government support credit institution act last autumn. the riksbank’s assessment we, together swedish authorities, also well prepare able manage problem could arise situation deteriorate level stress test describe financial stability report. let clarify financial stability report’s test financial system’s resilience cannot compare alternative scenario “more probable” nature usually present monetary policy reports. the latter normally describe consequence monetary policy development good bad situation describe main scenario, alternative normally far main forecasts. in financial stability scenario rather exaggerated. so stand heading? let briefly summarise stand term risk focus; liquidity problem dampened, credit risk fear loan loss increasingly limelight economic prospect deteriorated. credit risk size loan loss course closely interlink economic activity. so i shall now, least reason, move talk economic activity – assessment make riksbank recent monetary policy meet april nuance view future economic development i put forward meeting. bi review 73/2009 3 thing could good bad it natural time like paint gloomy picture focus downside risks. and i probably last person deny risk exist. it also natural focus monetary policy discussion central bank policy rate approach zero stimulation may necessary extent “uncharted territory” us. but let change perspective adopt slightly positive tone. in discussion two recent monetary policy meet i point possibility recovery sweden abroad could come quickly people assuming. one could perhaps say i act devil’s advocate, one use expression argue chance thing good generally believed. a general reason upturn might come quickly expected, starts, crisis large extent describe massive confidence crisis make last impression real economy. household hesitate consumption company hesitate investment. but confidence many way on-off variable – either don’t. all country affect le time world trade decline dramatically. once confidence faith future return, may well case upturn rapid forceful country come board. my view april monetary policy meet primarily concern 2009. i think everyone agree year unfortunately really poor growth year. in sweden, many countries, growth plummet fourth quarter last year. recently publish preliminary gdp figure first quarter also show growth continue fall, although rate fall slow down. my main emphasis lie ahead u – economic cycle year 2010. i shall repeat everything i say two recent monetary policy meetings; anyone interest read minute meetings. but i would like take opportunity bring view i express then. one view i wish highlight concern house market unite states, many way origin problems. some sign stabilisation visible there, although quarter adjustment still remain stock unsold house reduce house price stop falling. fall house investment provide large negative contribution growth recent years. very little house build several year relation increase number households. when turnaround comes, house investment provide good contribution growth. i also mention stock unite state phase rapidly sooner late level demand flow, even declining, need meet increase production. however, one must bear mind “cyclical” upturn temporary final demand catch ahead. i could also see sign stabilisation important forward-looking indicators, particularly order purchase managers’ index. however, picture clear-cut never economic activity balance. but, i mention meeting, sign stabilisation become clear may affect mood permanently, least stock market. this turn positive effect households’ undermine wealth help increase consumption. further ahead may possible reinforce positive cycle investment pick up. i also mention large part economic policy stimulation, particularly investment u infrastructure, would great effect 2010. have say this, i would like point out, i discussion recent monetary policy meeting, might well case sign stabilisation i mention delusive. and definitely case i fail see 4 bi review 73/2009 seriousness economic downturn in. nevertheless, recovery could i say quick slow expected. inflation outlook may change quickly fall resource utilisation inflationary pressure mean could conduct strong, expansionary monetary policy alleviate effect economic downturn time ensure inflation undershoot target far. we see negative inflation rate year measure inflation consumer price index, cpi. but largely due interest rate cuts. the low inflation rate temporary trigger expectation future deflation. inflation expectation accord to, instance, prospera’s survey, anchor slightly long perspective around target 2 per cent. my view april meet begin see sign next summer autumn extremely low interest rate need raised. i say merely question upturn possibly way; i also point monetary policy forward-looking effect come time lag. it therefore guide development 2012 2013 close come period. i also emphasise although inflationary pressure problem point, near future, situation could look different year two. for example, commodity price could begin rise predicted, expansionary monetary policy fiscal policy conduct large country could push international inflation risk increase import inflation. i also mention could certain krona would strengthen way assumed, productivity would recover predicted. we know experience inflation outlook change rapidly. during late spring summer last year concern inflation high, even though mainly due rise oil food prices. rise unit labour cost also take consideration. fear high inflation expectation would become entrench also form part picture. we raise interest rate despite begin see sign weak economic activity future. the assessment necessary attain inflation target couple year ahead. when development turn differently, quickly change course. we course always prepare situation like that. we ready act quickly forcefully necessary, attain inflation target carry financial stability responsibilities. unconventional measure there many discussion riksbank could expect development turn weak assuming. and toolbox empty repo rate close low limit. put simply, way repo rate tool work bank either borrow buy riksbank certificate maturity one week riksbank price repo rate. in addition, know daily fine-tune operation riksbank bank interest rate close repo rate. the current level repo rate expectation future turn affect interest rate long maturity and, course, activity economy. a i mention earlier, riksbank implement number measure work bank order improve function financial markets. this include loan maturity 3 6 month swedish banks, collateral variable interest rate. these measure recently supplement possibility borrow 12-month horizon. the primary aim lend manage financial stability. but measure also monetary bi review 73/2009 5 policy side-effects riksbank active yield curve normal. the liquidity premium decline, turn lead low interest rates. if central bank want affect interest rate directly slightly long maturity various measure disposal. central bank u federal reserve bank england example buy government bond long maturity influence long-term interest rate economy, thereby try attain monetary policy easing. however, effect strategy uncertain. a yet experience kind action rather limited. moreover, government bond rate affect many factor central banks' possible purchase securities. the riksbank take measures. the executive board decide meet april time yet ripe this. but could exclude possibility might possible ahead, economic situation deteriorate assuming. during discussion type unconventional measure recent monetary policy meet i point riksbank already implement extensive measure lend banks. these measure continue long necessary. i also consider necessarily case would need take measure as, instance, federal reserve bank england. there several different reason this. the company country dependent market funding, sweden bank important source funding. i also say yet see full effect radical interest rate cut made, contribute even great uncertainty question whether stimulation unconventional measure needed. when meet july present forecast economy repo rate come three year discus whether need carry measure already carry out. we must always maintain best possible level preparedness deal various situation might arise. but thing need put plan action. conclude think i would like carefully emphasise i take regard economic activity monetary policy interpret mean sudden outburst uncontrolled optimism i much bright view come period others. and message today contain anything new relation i say recent monetary policy meeting. i assure i aware seriousness ongoing downturn. and question hawkishly “trigger-happy” want raise interest rate soon see slight sign recovery. i believe, like colleagues, need maintain low interest rate relatively long period time. what i want say rather this: i believe easy become hostage situation figure fall put large emphasis – possibly large – downside risks. and, course, one cannot rule possibility crisis economic downturn protract profound assuming. but also risk one may thus give little weight possibility thing could actually go good believe thus may receive surprise different direction. i work forecast many years, two thing particular i noted, i also believe scientific evidence: difficult predict turn point economy, and, happened, easy underestimate strength development follows. this apply downturn upturns. there perhaps reason today assume rapid recovery 6 bi review 73/2009 likely alternative. but definitely something worth prepare slightly long perspective. a central bank must good long-term planning. even busy try alleviate effect collapse economic activity must ensure bear mind medium-term perspective. this may seem self-evident, i believe may important point out. not merely emphasise short-term perspective important maintain confidence inflation target long term. there must preparedness act situation could differ expect good worse. we currently extremely low interest rate crisis extent stem low interest rate long time. we must aware imbalance may build neither “deflation nutters” “inflation nutters”. bi review 73/2009 7 mario draghi: financial stability global environment? learn lesson market crisis keynote speech mr mario draghi, governor bank italy chairman financial stability board, iosco’s annual conference, tel aviv, 10 june 2009. * * * i please today discus emerge financial regulatory landscape build response market crisis. the last month busy one international regulatory policy field. i speak main thrust reform agenda work underway ahead u implement directions. but i i would like say word change role financial stability board (fsb) play future. over last year, broad consensus emerge towards place financial stability forum (fsf) strong institutional ground, view strengthen effectiveness mechanism national authorities, standard set body international financial institution address vulnerability develop implement strong regulatory, supervisory policy interest financial stability. a strong institutional set-up make fsb effective shape global response present crisis retain globally integrate financial markets. to mark change objectives, london summit re-launched fsf fsb, expand membership broaden mandate promote financial stability. the fsb expand membership includes, addition fsf members, rest g20, spain european commission. these change enhance ability contribute ongoing effort strengthen international financial system. new member add broad perspective deliberations, increase buy-in implementation output. all member commit pursue maintenance financial stability, maintain openness transparency financial sector, implement international financial standards. to end, member commit undergo periodic peer review – based, among evidence, financial sector assessment program imf world bank. in term mandate, alongside fsf old remit – ass vulnerability affect financial system, identify oversee action need address vulnerabilities, promote coordination information exchange among authority responsible financial stability – fsb also: • monitor advise market development implication regulatory policy, best practice meet regulatory standards; • set guideline support establishment supervisory college manage contingency plan cross-border crisis management, particularly respect systemically important firms; • fsb strengthen collaboration international monetary fund (imf), include conduct early warn exercises; • importantly, undertake joint strategic review policy development work international standard set body ensure work timely, coordinated, focus priority address gaps. here strong consensus independence standard set essential must preserved. indeed, value international standard set indispensably link independence. at same, independent standard set need complement process coordination, accountability governance bi review 72/2009 1 standard setters, include regular consultation stakeholders. a see fsb last 18 month so, coordination across standard set body essential craft coherent response crisis create resilient financial sector go forward. the work iosco continue great importance regard. to support functions, fsb establish institutional structure commensurate expand tasks. this comprise steer committee take forward work fsb plenary meetings, well stand committee vulnerability assessment, regulatory supervisory cooperation, standard implementation. and greatly expand secretariat resources. ** ** ** move regulatory reform agenda, main value intense recent period international policy make broad consensus establish agenda change need build stronger, le crisis-prone financial system future. let emphasize importance this: without consensus, integrate system benefit u would high risk fracture. we need consistent implementation go forward preserve level play field across national financial sectors. to summarise broadly thrust agenda, let begin key lesson: need future take system-wide approach assessment financial system economic conditions, well system’s regulation, rather focus alone health individual institutions, market products. while individual economy financial institution appear sound market participant u authorities, fail recognise extent savings-investment imbalances, growth complex securitised credit intermediation, change pattern maturity transformation, rise embed leverage, burgeon shadow bank sector, rapid credit-fuelled growth, create large systemic vulnerabilities. in future, need – national global level – much good position understand address trend credit growth, system-wide leverage maturity transformation, inter-linkages within financial system, identify constrain emerge risks. for require additional system-wide prudential well tools. create prudential tools, regulatory set-ups policy tool require good constrain system-wide risks, include generate transparency need authority market good inform risk system, focus much reform agenda. these change course need implement national levels. but work internationally generate tool policy needed, promote coherence implementation conduct monitor required. let speak these. one central lesson crisis system enter little capital, far small liquidity buffers, capital valuation regime significant pro-cyclical consequences. much work underway bank capital liquidity address issues. the basel committee propose last year change end 2010 expand basel ii risk capture significantly increase trade book capital requirements. and committee’s much strengthen liquidity guideline process implement nationally. further work underway strengthen guidance monitor liquidity management large cross-border banks. the fsf member body also produce set recommendation mitigate pro-cyclicality. these call (i) regulatory capital requirement increase quality level capital financial system strong economic condition draw period economic financial stress; (ii) revision market risk framework basel ii reduce reliance cyclical value-at-risk base capital 2 bi review 72/2009 estimates; (iii) supplement risk-based capital requirement leverage ratio contain build leverage bank system. regard provisioning, – g20 leader – call iasb fasb reconsider incur loss model analyze alternative approach recognize measure loan loss incorporate broad range available credit information, include analyse fair value, expect loss dynamic provision approaches. policy development area underway iasb fasb, well basel committee detail proposal set year-end. on account generally, g20 ask fsb monitor progress account standard setter implement g20’s accounting-related recommendations, include effort enhance convergence, improve involvement prudential regulator stakeholder iasb’s standard set process. we welcome effort iasb accelerate work schedule reduce complexity account financial instruments, reduce inconsistency standards, goal close fsb’s global mission. some authority raise concern iasb approach certain issues. the fsb strong interest see iasb come period manner support role high-quality independent account standard setter consider constructive input key stakeholders. a know, financial stability forum (fsf; fsb), iasb, iosco others key members, prove record support ifrs one 12 key international standard promote financial stability, provide constructive recommendation enhance transparency relate iasb standards. good recent example fsf's report enhance market institutional resilience publish april 2008 request g7 fsf’s procyclicality report april 2009 include recommendation develop work group co-chaired kathy casey. we positive role support high-quality ifrs fsb plan continue so. a second important area implement system-wide approach ensure systemically relevant institutions, market activity subject appropriate oversight, transparency requirement and, needed, resolution mechanisms. in practice, mean scope regulation broadened, prudential tool standards, well intensity oversight, recalibrated good reflect systemic foot-print institution activities. how deal too-big-to-fail institution relate moral hazard concern important focus ahead. and need establish market infrastructure, include adequate resolution frameworks, address problem interconnectedness opaqueness financial system. a lot work underway areas: • the bi imf set methodology quantify systemic risk, identify systemically relevant institution activities, develop system wide tool monitor leverage. • and joint forum advance project gap scope regulation, approach address them. this cover gap regulate sector (i.e. gap aig’s hold company), unregulated markets, products, entities, iosco recently set consultative proposals. • in area otc derivatives, work thus far focus establish central counterparty clear cd market, central clear extend standardize otc derivative generally. • on hedge funds, us, eu relevant jurisdiction process articulate registration, regulation oversight arrangement hedge fund managers. the fsb, rely iosco, task foster coherent approach area. bi review 72/2009 3 • the fsf also recently publish principle cross-border cooperation crisis management, strengthen arrangement deal financial stress cross-border institutions, good prepare authority manage crisis situations. another group basel committee look legal difference across country hind orderly resolution financial firms. i would like highlight important work security market regulators, work iosco, restore transparency, market quality integrity securitisation process. the check balance within market fail address significant moral hazard problem within chain. for securitization recover play role consistent financial stability objectives, problem need addressed. there balance draw far regulation go far trust market discipline reassert itself. but one issue must lose sight much securitisation product, whether complex not, whether knowledge not, ultimately end retail investor portfolios. iosco formulate recommendation address incentive problems, conduct disclosure requirements, retention issuer economic exposure transactions, strengthen due diligence requirement asset managers, strengthen investor suitability requirements, least, reduction conflict interest credit rat agencies. we look forward receive conclusion forthcoming fsb meeting. the complement important effort strengthen risk management practice governance bank financial institutions. the lesson failure area set report guidance senior supervisor group (ssg), basel committee, iif counterparty risk management policy group. one area politicians, broad public supervisory authority pay significant attention change compensation practice financial institutions. the principle develop cover effective governance compensation systems, effective alignment compensation prudent risk taking, effective supervisory oversight disclosure engagement shareholders. they reinforce supervisory examination intervention national level, well disclosure requirement (on iosco working). we expect national authority firm implement material part principle end 2009. there clear need supervisors, regulator authority raise game, nationally internationally. at levels, authority need become responsive nimble effective mitigate emerge risks. information exchange co-operation across authority nationally internationally need improve. most country review national arrangement collaboration amongst relevant national authorities. and international level, supervisory college establish global banks. the priority ahead implementation. this largely national hands, need coherent approach across country regions. indeed, g20 leader place renew emphasis this. the fsb, standard set body imf/wb task assess implementation serve three complementary aims: first, foster great adherence international standards; second, help identify jurisdiction lag behind term implementation select standards; third, support peer review processes, fsb member commit obligation membership. ** ** ** i’d like conclude number principle guide action pursue reform agenda: • first, guide principle behind work recreate financial system operate le leverage, immune set misalign incentive root crisis, transparency allow good identification 4 bi review 72/2009 management risks, prudential regulatory oversight strengthened, system able let mismanage institution fail. • second, clarity. we commit establish clear expectation future regulatory environment look like. establish stable expectation regard future regulatory environment allow market participant make forward strategic decision great degree confidence. • third, direction clear, change case gradual. some element reform system (such high capital) need phase condition improve. • fourth, must preserve advantage open integrate global financial markets. give global market institution national regulatory rule practices, must strive international consistency standard regulation support level play field across jurisdictions. at time, open global market preserved, standard need strengthen give adequate protection “innocent bystanders” affect indiscriminate risk take retrenchment observed. • last, develop apply assertive regulation supervision contain excessive leverage address market failures, must resist impose excessive, stifle level regulation. regulation must prevent innovation, necessary improve product choice consumer expand access credit. but need ensure innovation compromise clearly state goals, include systemic stability consumer protection. the challenge regulator market participant alike is, always, strike right balance. bi review 72/2009 5 elizabeth a duke: the systemic importance consumer protection speech m elizabeth a duke, member board governor u federal reserve system, 2009 community development policy summit, cleveland, ohio, 10 june 2009. the original speech, contain various link document mentioned, find u federal reserve system’s website. * * * i want thank federal reserve bank cleveland sponsor this, seventh annual policy summit, invite speak. the agenda today's meet certainly ambitious one. you tackle question house policy might restructure stabilize neighborhood create sustainable approach homeownership. you also discuss community reinvestment act (cra) might revise ensure continue role catalyst private investment low- moderate-income neighborhoods. these certainly important issue consider try find solution set complex problem bring turmoil mortgage house markets. i tell anyone cleveland, foreclosure harm whole neighborhoods, devastate impact foreclosure crisis individuals, neighborhoods, broad economy – impact deep would remiss reconsider current policy ensure last recovery sustainable homeownership. a i look agenda, i strike fact problem we've see foreclosure neighborhood destabilization stem over-provision poorly design credit, whereas, contrast, cra birth credit generally unavailable low- moderate-income neighborhoods. so i talk today federal reserve role consumer protection, i'd like emphasize importance availability credit ability consumer use credit safely increase well-being transaction contribute economic growth. if learn nothing else crisis, learn consumer protection good consumers; also necessary restore investor confidence promote strong stable economy. how get give economic event past 18 months, would question importance link performance consumer-based financial product health broad economy. even so, important examine link order learn good job protect consumer protect stability macroeconomy future. the current economic situation develop period year confluence several market development create environment inexpensive readily available credit. advance information technology financial innovation recent decade encourage new lend product extension credit wide spectrum borrowers, include many would previously difficulty qualify credit. such development credit score low transaction cost help evaluate risk effectively consistently. similarly, advance financial engineer encourage broaden opportunity draw capital around world securitization debt. this inflow capital provide creditor new source fund expansion credit. the securitization process make versatile – also complicate – introduction structure products, collateralize debt obligations, intend match investor various credit prepayment risks. bi review 72/2009 1 a credit market evolved, financial product also changed. consumer increasingly offer complex, often le transparent, products. where vast majority mortgage 30-year, fixed-rate products, height house boom 2007, adjustable-rate product proliferate – product 2/28 (a loan low introductory rate first two years) option arm (a loan consumer could choose pay full payment, interest-only payment, even payment fully cover even interest, difference add loan's principal balance). for large number borrowers, piggy-back second mortgage substitute payments. these product rely primarily rise property value borrowers' ability refinance repayment. the high level risk pose product become apparent home price begin fall rate foreclosure increase dramatically. just mortgage product become complex, credit card terms, rates, fee also become significantly complicate difficult consumer fully understand. new practice evolved, charge different interest rate different transaction double-cycle billing, whereby lender calculate interest base current balance, also prior month's balance. while practice increase revenue lenders, le clear benefit cardholders. also, payment-allocation rule tend treat consumer unfavorably make difficult benefit fully promotion balance-transfer programs. even credit product grow variety complexity, consumer debt expand dramatically recent years. in particular, mortgage debt rise $3.5 trillion 1995 $11.1 trillion 2007,1 revolve credit grow $443 billion $939 billion period nonrevolving credit (mostly automobile student loans) grow $697 billion $1.6 trillion.2 in hindsight, hard see various factor combine create perilous situation consumers, investors, broad economy. bad decision result poorly underwrite mortgage product complex feature or, worse, feature purposefully hide consumer make scale spillover effect result default foreclosure far broad prior downturns. previously, negative impact foreclosure tend limit local area experience significant job loss recessionary pressure result fluctuation business cycle. but accelerate growth rate subprime lend market fact many risky loan bundle security set stage, individual borrower fail keep payments, result devastate entire market. investor belatedly recognize serious problem poor underwrite inappropriate loan structure – practice may facilitate securitization processes. problem also spill security back credit card receivables, auto loans, asset classes. a result, investor stop purchase asset-backed security much secondary market stop functioning. the loss investor confidence enormous ripple effect economy tighten credit squeeze house automotive sale threaten viability business reliant credit line cover inventory expenses. in addition loss investor confidence, consumer confidence also shaken. the collapse house market expose practice consumer-friendly. some lenders, brokers, appraisers, investment bank clearly motivate transaction fee little incentive ensure borrower would able sustain 1 "federal reserve statistical release, z.1, flow fund account unite states". 2 www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g19/hist. 2 bi review 72/2009 homeownership. banks, stress loss mortgage portfolios, pull back private-label mortgage lend increase price associate type lending. the effect practices, combine impact job loss ramification shrink economy, significant impact consumer confidence. consumer spend fall result, exacerbate negative cycle. a banker's perspective in think take achieve economic recovery, i often draw experience community banker. in day i lend money, keep loan balance sheet. in context success directly relate ability customer repay loans. indeed, relate ability repay borrow career lifetime. this accomplish effective underwrite risk analysis proper loan structuring. when incentive credit process properly aligned, benefit flow borrower lender: borrower assure term condition reasonably expect repay loan, lender pay interest money lent. while i necessarily believe need return time loan hold balance sheet, i believe need system balance incentive longer-term prosperity all. credit transaction conduct benefit borrower lender expand economic growth. this true community level macroeconomic level. access capital create expand small business lead job growth benefit large community. likewise, mortgage lending, responsibly done, give community solid base resident stake future. the problem face today result, large part, misalignment incentives. securitization, provide liquidity, also weaken incentive properly underwrite loans, many case pass default risk originator investors. compensation structure also problematic. some originator compensate basis particular loan feature loan volume rather loan quality. meanwhile, loan feature may appropriate small subset potential borrower – interest-only mortgage loan loan require little documentation income – offer wide group consumers. study show borrower income hold constant, loan feature matter successful repayment loan. so i hope learn misalign incentive result harm consumer implication economy overall. if recognize this, must also recognize consumer protection cannot view ancillary component scheme regulate safety soundness. rather, fundamental quality credit upon economy built. have say that, policymakers must also consider desirability dynamic economy, one useful innovation encourage credit make available many consumer ability benefit it. the tension protect consumer make credit broadly available one important make individual loan ensure stability economy. the key successful policy formulation resist temptation regulate problem moment. for example, if, reaction abuse consumer mortgage lend past years, focus solely consumer protection policies, result could overly restrictive access credit, could threaten future economic growth. on hand, policy focus strictly stabilize bank sector without give due consideration consumer protection, consumer investor confidence remain weak risk repeat mistake past. trust financial system regain sufficient consumer protection place give borrower reason believe treat fairly. bi review 72/2009 3 the role federal reserve the federal reserve address consumer protection responsibility variety ways, use regulatory supervisory authority well consumer education, research, outreach capabilities. we take multifaceted approach consumer protection, couple reasons. first, organization unique position central bank well regulator supervisor bank industry. moreover, experience arena teach u one solution sufficient address information need substantive protection consumer credit transactions. by offer broad spectrum products, services, activities, aim provide consumer information necessary make good financial decisions. for example, base belief clear well-organized disclosure help consumer make good choice among financial products, federal reserve use regulatory authority develop extensive new disclosure variety financial products, include credit cards. we currently midst major overhaul mortgage disclosures. to ensure new disclosure useful consumers, federal reserve use consumer test explore consumer process information understand important feature financial products. this quite informative exercise. we use learn consumer test improve disclosure require. for example, recently revise credit card disclosure require provide consumer account opening. the new rule require certain key term include conspicuous table field test indicate consumer unlikely read dense language comfortable interpret information table format. our consumer test effort also teach u even best disclosure cannot offer protection consumer need cases. some aspect increasingly complex product simply cannot fully understand evaluate consumers, matter well educate consumer clear disclosure. in cases, choose prohibit certain practices. for example, federal reserve recently ban practice double-cycle bill calculate interest rate credit card find test reasonable way explain practice. we also ban practice relate mortgage lend potentially unfair deceptive features. we find failure require escrow account homeowners' insurance property tax often cause borrower underestimate cost homeownership, make escrow mandatory high-cost loans. similarly, also place restriction use prepayment penalties. the federal reserve also become proactive effort make consumer aware role consumer education outreach. while long history provide unbiased, research-based information consumer variety financial products, step effort get information consumer quickly. and recently make use unconventional venue – unconventional least central bank. for example, make consumer aware foreclosure-rescue scams, board recently run 30-second public service announcement (psa) movie theatre 18 market across 10 state high foreclosure rates. additionally, coverage psa campaign receive television, radio, newspaper carry message existence mortgage-rescue scam far broad audience. a complement psa campaign, board develop 5 tip fly regard foreclosure-rescue scam provide essential information easily digestible format. material develop board leverage others. several reserve banks, instance, work add board's psa additional theatre markets. and one reserve bank decide replicate effort psa tailor particular market. in addition, psa 5 tip pick public nonprofit 4 bi review 72/2009 organizations, include national association realtors, mortgage servicers gmac. the success campaign highlight demand timely information consumer use. through effort, learn great deal importance federal reserve unbiased source consumer information. we intend build knowledge go forward – focus content provided, leverage message multiple distribution channels, create awareness information's availability. finally, research institution engage effort measure effectiveness financial education, order understand approach work best. for example, board staff, work department defense others, conduct longitudinal study involve soldier fort bliss determine whether receive two-day financial education course part advance individualize train improve soldiers' financial behavior compare receive training. we find soldier take course likely engage positive financial behavior (such save regularly, participate retirement programs, pay credit card bill monthly) le likely engage negative behavior (such pay overdraft fee pay bill late). the federal reserve bank philadelphia currently engage longitudinal study measure effectiveness homeownership counseling. throughout federal reserve system continue study apply lesson learn field behavioral economics improve financial education consumer information. the goal federal reserve's action respect consumer protection restore consumer confidence make credit transparent and, necessary, prohibit practice complex unfair deceptive. these action good consumers, benefit financial industry. we aim promote access responsible credit consumer great extent possible also recognize value innovation need restore fully function credit markets. be attentive interconnection meaningful consumer protection broad access credit ensure last sustainable economic recovery. conclusion with that, i would like come full circle end importance dialogue federal reserve bank region serve. this conference excellent example way policy shape involvement. every day across 12 federal reserve district leverage forum this, well partnership financial institution community groups, good understand financial product shape community make vast economy. i want commend take time engage thoughtful consideration policy help alleviate impact current house economic crisis neighborhoods. i also look forward continue discussion role strong consumer protection must play economic future. bi review 72/2009 5 john hurley: restore stability bank system speech mr john hurley, governor central bank financial service authority ireland, aci ireland, dublin, 10 june 2009. * * * introduction thank invite speak association again. when i last address aci autumn 2007. we time experience first month market volatility, start problem centre u sub-prime market quickly follow global problem decline liquidity sharp re-pricing risk. a aware, were, back then, foothill turn financial crisis major proportions; one demanded, continue require, immense response authority worldwide. it also crisis particular domestic resonance here, coincide correction property construction-related sectors. a countries, authority take extraordinary unprecedented measure stabilise bank system economy. my address tonight focus event since september last year turmoil become full-blown crisis authority respond since time. it clear crisis drive significant change term structure bank system well regulatory regime i share think issues. restore stability bank system necessary but, own, sufficient condition restore health economy. i conclude comment key policy challenge restore competitiveness stabilise public finances. financial market turbulence evolve crisis the event last september, centre around failure lehman brothers, seminal, government central bank everywhere intervene unprecedented way scale conceivable beforehand. begin september, global interbank market increasingly seize up, even short maturities. the severe shortage liquidity impact significantly operation bank everywhere. in response, policy maker across world take exceptional step direct financial sector interventions, well monetary fiscal policy responses. recapitalisations, deposit guarantee extensions, provision credit liquidity, programme deal distress

recently, measure address banks’ non-performing property-related asset establishment national asset management agency (nama). a final necessary stage must address optimum shape structure domestic bank

liquidity report show situation become increasingly strained. event come head monday 29th september find necessary introduce state guarantee range domestic banks’ liabilities. the objective guarantee give sufficient time bank stabilise fund situation, provide necessary confidence international investor would enable continue lend irish bank fraught environment time, thereby relieve short-term fund constraint prevent drain liquidity. to maintain confidence international wholesale market irish bank heavily dependent, essential guarantee pitch level ensure success. the guarantee result immediate improvement liquidity situation. subsequently, large number countries, include least 14 european countries, introduce guarantee scheme order obviate risks, although type, maturity, liability cover differ accord different circumstance judgement make individual countries. recapitalisation it recognise time guarantee long-term solution would still necessary determine additional capital would necessary irish banks. on basis supervisory information, irish bank meet regulatory requirements. across europe, however, international market expect high core tier 1 capital ratio crisis. a number countries, include ireland, take decision recapitalise bank basis. a consideration irish case market participants’ expectation significant write-down property-related asset would eat exist capital. the severity downturn economy also factor recapitalisation here. while irish banks, unlike many international peers, expose security base u subprime mortgages, exposure attract concern irish case system’s over-exposure property-related loans. there great uncertainty ultimate impact unwind overheat property market quality banks’ assets. there also concern bank might attempt improve capital position curtail supply credit. historical experience country show type dynamic would potentially severe last negative repercussion economy financial sector need avoid 2 bi review 72/2009 after consultation relevant authorities, decision take recapitalise large domestic bank follow due diligence banks’ exposures. the bank also require make commitment increase lend capacity small medium-sized

international commentators, imf global financial stability report, suggest challenge many country address banks’ balance sheet – specifically, identify deal impair asset – necessary step recover crisis. our domestic bank substantial exposure land development loans, create uncertainty capital position and, ultimately, affect ability provide credit real economy. it context government decide establish national asset management agency. the intention transfer land development book appropriate associate exposure nama return government bonds. it essential done; critical stage process renew confidence bank sector. the correct price asset important issue must balance value taxpayer restore capacity bank sector support real economy. the eurosystem response alongside various domestic initiative outline above, central bank continue respond crisis member eurosystem. the govern council ecb reduce key policy interest rate 325 basis point cumulatively since last october. this significant effect low borrow cost household firm across euro area, include ireland. there pick-up investor sentiment last number month partly reflect economic indicators, somewhat positive europe

main irish banks. what future hold bank system generally? while remain unclear crisis end ultimate effect be, recent sign recovery remind u need look type financial system want see emerge crisis over. this hold national, eu global levels. the ongoing crisis underline need adopt system-wide approach regulation supervision. the proposal de larosière report particularly pertinent point. a feature current crisis that, build-up pressure macro, system-wide, level widely recognise happening, publication concerns, internationally accept way central bank convey concerns, effective. this case internationally ireland. it essential, therefore, bridge gap financial stability, macro-prudential supervision, one hand micro-prudential, traditional supervision, other. in context, european commission propose new supervisory framework eu base de larosière proposals. the proposal new structure recognise explicitly need macro-prudential risk assessment order identify emerge vulnerability financial system issue risk warn also, crucially, necessity follow policy action appropriate. while detail propose new eu framework still need iron out, i strongly support direction proposed. i welcome also recent announcement provide full integration co-ordination within central bank responsibility financial stability micro-prudential supervision. these new domestic arrangement would fit well propose new european framework. the current crisis make clear risk management practice across part financial sector need improve significantly. one key aspect must address ensure regulatory

clearly, account standard play important part here, i welcome initiative undertake iasb basel committee improve report order reduce cyclicality. the restructure remuneration package another important

ifsc, whole withstand crisis reasonably well, i confident ifsc continue make significant contribution irish economy. 4 bi review 72/2009 economic assessment while huge effort put stabilise financial sector, also need act restore stability areas. more generally, vital act credibly quickly confront significant challenge face chart path time ensure sustainable recovery economic growth. over past two decades, ireland demonstrate strong ability exploit advantage – form flexible markets, competitive economy highly-skilled educate labour force – generate growth. in recent times, strength come mask increase cost fact economic activity become unbalanced. we become dependent largely construction-driven growth domestic demand. among things, pattern growth entail overdependence property-related transaction taxes. the inevitable downturn construction activity give rise extremely sharp severe deterioration public finances, scale exceed even downturn economic growth. the importance take effective immediate step improve cost competitiveness address fiscal imbalance cannot overstated. economy-wide productivity gain modest labour cost relatively high recent year compare main trade partners. this deterioration must address return sustainable growth path. a strategy restore competitiveness must encompass action number front include pay non-pay costs, infrastructure improvement support productivity growth, enhancement competition shelter sectors, continue encourage innovation r&d activity enhance skill level labour force. in particular, flexible approach wage development essential. more recently, face sharp contraction economic activity, many firm take action reduce cost include negotiation reduction wage rates, view protect employment. while undoubtedly painful concerned, nevertheless reflect encourage evidence flexibility realism need economy maintain maximum possible number job short-term place ireland favourable position benefit eventual recovery world demand. this type flexibility must embrace sector economy. the deterioration fiscal position cause serious concern. the government agree european commission correct excessive deficit position 2013. the government’s introduction public sector pension levy supplementary budget step take end. it important target agree european commission met. future low medium-term growth potential mean cyclical

good morning. thank opportunity speak congressional black caucus foundation's annual legislative conference. congresswoman waters, i appreciate invitation leadership area. let make brief comment federal reserve's effort respect diversity, i look forward dialogue afterward. a know, response financial crisis begin two year ago, federal reserve introduce various program improve function key financial markets, goal help restore flow credit economy needs. usage many program wind market improve, one program ongoing need still clearly exist term asset-backed security loan facility, talf. this program, implement year, help restart securitization market various type consumer small business credit. securitization market important source credit, virtual shutdown crisis reduce credit availability many borrowers. since inception, talf indirectly finance nearly 3 million loan household (excluding credit card loans) nearly 400,000 loan small businesses. investor participate talf

firm, firm participate investment low $500,000. there 121 borrower far, include investor sizes. since talf open investment firms, need agent work potential borrowers. in march, i participate tarp/talf access summit organized. at summit, hear diverse set talf agent would help bring diverse set talf borrowers. act good suggestion, recently announce inclusion four new talf agents, select increase diversity talf borrowers. three four own african americans. we expect new talf agent begin operation november. in area procurement, federal reserve us various method reach women- minority-owned

yam: reflection relevant bank profession hong kong speech mr joseph yam, chief executive hong kong monetary authority, joint hkab – hkib dinner honour mr joseph yam's retirement chief executive hong kong monetary authority, hong kong, 28 september 2009. * * * peter, friend colleague bank profession, not i deeply touch kind generous word say evening, i also greatly impress skit entertainment put evening. i always assume whatever surplus talent banker may always use golf course. now i know talent stretch other, cultural directions. thank enjoyable unforgettable evening. this convivial occasion, last thing want hear long earnest speech me. however, last formal event monetary authority. and i think know well enough expect word gratitude – however heartfelt – splendid event. i shall brief. much say write recently origins, progress implication global financial crisis erupt fury year ago. i shall therefore simply offer reflection i hope relevant bank profession hong kong. the first observation hong kong has, far, escape worst. we experience collapse financial system, nationalisation major banks, form government intervention burden taxpayer many year come. in fact, bank system resilient throughout crisis, measure take early reinforce confidence ensure liquidity effective minimal cost public purse. this observation make sense gloat complacency. we recall intense anxiety days, many community suffer loss result mistake mismanagement financial systems. nevertheless, well-capitalised bank well prepare shock. crisis management, particularly public confidence momentarily come strain, effective. the generally cautious approach bankers, refusal get carry away innovation, help minimise damage: vindication reputation prudence, great credit hong kong's bank system. we also seem achieve good balance relationship supervisor bank system. an excellent example balance contribute bank stability 70% loan-to-value policy residential mortgage lend banks. this policy, cornerstone prudential arrangements, pre-dates even foundation hkma evolve productive dialogue hkab supervisor. it survive strong political pressure relaxation market pressure innovative credit risk transfer securitisation. the policy – nearly two decade old – fit well macro-prudential approach which, particularly light recent crisis, supervisor jurisdiction consider essential bank stability. the fact policy exist advance financial system remarkable enough. but remarkable level initiative hong kong bank sector see importance systemic stability give precedence profitability individual institutions. we might therefore observe, light experience past year, hong kong get broadly right relationship supervisor bank system. however, lead u complacent conclusion nothing much need changing. and indeed, conclusion minds. both bi review 116/2009 1 carse report recent report financial secretary sale lehman-related product see room development improvement way carry work. quite apart hong kong-specific initiatives, movement reform international level, result different experience develop economies, cannot ignore. this point bring second observation: need move times. the past year see plethora idea proposal reform financial regulations, intervention government unprecedented nature scale. even economy le deeply affect late crisis, include hong kong, necessary deepen government involvement, example extensive deposit guarantee intense supervision banks' risk management – although gratify many tool able rely on, include apparatus contingency arrangement ensure liquidity, develop pre-emptive rather reactive way. on various emergency measures, i quite sure fullness time, either turn stand arrangement withdrawn, hopefully smooth exit strategies. but, current sentiment clearly demand much close regulation supervision bank long term. quite form take remain agree international forums, although think already seem towards improvement level quality banks' capital; new global standard measuring, manage supervise liquidity risk; macro-prudential supervision reduce pro-cyclical dynamic financial markets. no doubt detail take time work out. we might tempt hong kong respond demonstrate clearly last year already ability maintain bank stability. the measure contemplate internationally design repair renovate bank system effectively collapsed: measure may indeed go far. therefore, might conclude need consider hong kong. such attitude would, i think, mistake. a international financial centre, hong kong must adopt international standard best practices. we move times, although course mean blindly implement everything inflexible, straightjacket manner. hong kong is, fact, good position adopt participate various measure consideration g20, financial stability board stand committees, international agencies. our voice may loud strong large economies, still responsibility speak up, seek ensure come international forum balanced, realistic local regional conditions. the increase participation asian economies, include hong kong, international forum good sign rest world pay attention to, ready learn from, experience region. the task, hong kong jurisdictions, translate high-level principle universal standard local practice, develop skill carry out. this enormous challenge, reason confidence hong kong's case. we largely positive experience introduce basel ii supervisory system, thank small part hard work hkab hkib. regulatory reform drive objective circumstance also change public expectations. this bring third observation: bank financial institution (and, might added, regulators) operate sceptical, demanding, even hostile environment. we see around world, and, particularly aftermath lehman brother collapse, see hong kong. there also discontent anxiety locally pre-dates crisis – example, access bank services, risk new technology – result partly change business landscape partly change expectations. we must expect trend continue, necessary bank industry regulator take account wide public opinion, tackle area concern. a industry organisation, hkab 2 bi review 116/2009 already become quite deeply involve matters: example, play important coordinate think-tank role ensure safety efficiency e-banking, promote accessibility bank services, particularly among vulnerable groups; also one joint issuer code bank practice, reference-point relation bank customers. hkab can, i believe, contribute even future, consolidate role industry representative, strengthen resources, example create separate secretariat professional chief executive. one key cause recent financial crisis use – abuse – innovation financial intermediary short-term private gain expense longer-term stability effective work financial system whole. and one reaction call – loud call place – bank go “back basics” conduct business. if reaction lead return sort inflexible bank service many old among u remember, would pity. if, hand, result great reflection rethink true function bank society, would, view, healthy development. at heart think must view bank system exist provide financial intermediation support large economy: cannot abstracted, disembody realm activity intermediary compete dream ever complicate way make fast profit. but think rule innovation, long objective clear: main objective serve activity great economy, increase efficiency financial system without sacrifice safety. this lead fourth final observation. we many example innovation hong kong draw upon, one particularly appropriate even reminiscences. i refer introduction renminbi business bank hong kong – development seem revolutionary time, seem normal activity. it small begin gradual, cautious process: is, course, scope much growth development. this innovation clear practical us facilitate economic relation hong kong mainland, reinforce hong kong's role international financial centre, support liberalisation china's financial system. how many u here, i wonder, recall idea develop renminbi business hong kong first broach 2001, one annual hkab visit mainland i privilege joining? the development renminbi business hong kong, generally role hong kong serve need china international finance depend pace financial liberalisation mainland. it therefore much hands, involve policy allow great cross border mobility capital, financial instrument financial intermediaries. yet survival international financial centre depend prepare policy financial liberalisation. we also proactive offer advice policy make ready provide assistance technical support policy implementation. one practical way continue use financial system platform cautious experiment gradual liberalisation renmminbi – process benefit system nation whole. the basic law specify hong kong's status international financial centre maintained. there many policy programme train achieve this. but surely key future develop hong kong offshore renminbi market. there doubt renminbi become international currency one day. for hong kong unprepared this, u fail see opportunity build infrastructure make best it, would risk marginalisation. there shortage awareness point, whether policy technical level within government. at practical business level, bank also role make use channel open up: gratify note bank play role effectively enthusiasm. bi review 116/2009 3 lady gentlemen, monetary authority banker come go. but i doubt hkab hkib, spirit co-operation embody, go ever. i doubt continue promote prosperity hong kong wellbeing live many year come. i wish successor, norman chan every success, happiness i enjoy monetary authority. a myself, two days' time i shall move public role role private citizen, pleasure responsibility entails. this unfamiliar, possibly challenge position me. but i never know decline challenge, i look forward freedom plan day see family friends, many evening. i wish best health, happiness success. 4 bi review 116/2009 k c chakrabarty: global crisis – genesis, challenge opportunity unleash inaugural address dr k c chakrabarty, deputy governor reserve bank india, 21st anniversary convention association professional bankers, sri lanka, colombo, 25 september 2009. the assistance provide mr. s. pattnaik preparation address gratefully acknowledged. * * * mr. ajith nivard cabraal, governor, central bank sri lanka; mr. ajantha madurapperuma, president, association professional banker – sri lanka; distinguish guest member association professional bankers, lady gentlemen: it great pleasure privilege today 21st anniversary convention association professional banker sri lanka. at outset, i would like thank mr. ajantha madurapperuma, president association member extend invitation provide opportunity share view theme test competence conventional wisdom policy makers, banker market participant around world, complex nature severity global crisis truly unprecedented. it indeed hearten note sri lanka like many emerge markets, weather crisis without significant stress financial system, though, country’s growth outlook, like many countries, affect vary effect contagion crisis. in term financial outlook, accord imf, sri lanka’s economic growth 2009 could around 3 percent compare 6 percent 2008, even though estimates, include central bank suggest growth could remain range 3.5 4.5 per cent. inflation condition also improving, annual average inflation rate continue decline since november, 2008 record single digit level 8.5 per cent august 2009, low since 2006. the recent revision rat outlook s&p “negative” “stable” corroborate improve outlook economy. i optimistic sri lankan economy bank sector perform well high growth trajectory time come. in age globalisation, sound national policy pursue country alone may enough ensure sustainable high growth stability. understand opportunity risk associate globalisation develop national global architecture enhance benefit globalisation contain risks, therefore, represent major challenge policy makers. every financial crisis, notwithstanding associate ravages, also see term opportunity offer like expose limitation exist systems, cleanse financial system activity market entity work towards misuse system maximize personal returns, certainly process open new business opportunities. i would like share certain important aspect crisis, share indian experience term impact crisis way forward. the genesis crisis the sudden manifestation crisis 2007 result two important fundamental macroeconomic imbalance persist long; one, monetary policy feed reserve greenspan era second, grow global imbalances. both factor clear precursor unsustainable bubbles, ignore general pre-crisis phase high global growth low inflation. bi review 116/2009 1 grow bubble the fed’s monetary policy stance crisis create general impression time interest capital free market economy never risk. that encourage use high leverage source sustainable high profit bubbles. fed’s monetary policy widely highlight role support growth two unpleasant thing – speculation leverage – turn contain potential severe financial crisis. the global imbalance the safe appeal u dollar key international currency, assure high return financial investment capital market u greenspan era lead situation u continuously maintain large grow unsustainable current account deficits. country around world current account surplus large foreign exchange reserve keep invest us. despite crisis, resultant force correction imbalance extent, global problem could persist even crisis. the buildup crisis - role proximate factor leverage use leverage merge sure mean maximize income u economy. american household corporate debt increase significantly crisis. one recent university chicago study highlight size household debt house price move together us, every increase house price induce growth debt consumption purpose. for every one dollar increase house prices, increase debt-financed consumption rise 25 30 cents. the wealth effect asset price increases, thus, seem much significant perceive early policy makers. correction asset prices, thus, lead intense deleveraging process. asset price leverage represent two important variable must constantly monitored, risk financial system could significant. deterioration credit standard the deterioration credit standard facilitate sustain easy monetary policy stance deregulation induce opportunity shift credit risk securitisation, contribute growth credit sub-prime segments. it often argue easy access liquidity alone could lead deterioration credit standards. securitisation innovation link security open option shift credit risk sub-prime loan market thereby free pressure banks’ capital, turn lead significant weaken standard credit assessment. emergence shadow bank – tendency circumvent regulation many lead international bank started/sponsored off-balance sheet structure investment vehicle (sivs) freely undertake activity possible otherwise regulatory norm banks, like capital adequacy management liquidity risks. the sivs, turn, face constraints, could borrow freely short-term asset back commercial paper (abcp) market take large leverage position paper like cdos/clos whose valuation liquidity unknown. in pre-crisis period, sivs shadow bank generate good profit sponsor banks. once crisis started, sponsor bank take loss sivs. the tendency circumvent regulation still something perfectly legal (like sponsor sivs undertake 2 bi review 116/2009 certain activities) suggest regulation alone cannot address source risk financial systems. financial innovation earlier, easy securitise type loan, like sub-prime loans, create market them. the financial engineer wall street, however, find answer two things: first, create information asymmetry convert pool difficult market loan collateralised debt obligation (cdos), second, create market different tranche base “ratings”. thus, “aaa” rat cdo could create cash-flows link sub-prime loans. in post crisis period, question relevance innovation financial market. innovation need encourage enhance market efficiency, market efficiency cannot achieve without proper information. financial system become complex potential vulnerability escape supervisory focus the role complexity financial system cause crisis deftly explain landau (2009). complexity increase two sides, first, structure product (whose valuation could hard establish), second, rise interdependence financial institutions, market player counterparties. the nature interdependence complex monitor regulator, dynamic interaction also keep change constant search high return new innovation regulatory arbitrage. three point particularly important note context: (a) information critical advance efficient market, however “complexity” lead loss information; innovation effect destroy information; (b) complexity give rise high uncertainty, make financial system highly unpredictable (c) uncertainty lead “flight quality hoard liquidity”, precipitate crisis. when everybody run cover minimise loss, “collective action problem” accentuate market stress. pressure capital severe credit squeeze a price toxic paper witness free fall (in case value certain cdos fell 30 cent dollar, stock price also fell significantly), loss bank exposure paper rise significantly, capital buff turn increasingly inadequate, create concern insolvency. banks, give capital adequacy requirement, either raise fresh capital, contract balance sheet size, capital come pressure application mark-to-market (mtm) relate loss fall market financial instrument hold investment portfolio banks. in testimony william m isaac u sub-committee capital markets, insurance government sponsor enterprise date march 12, 2009 point “…mtm loss destroy $ 500 billion capital financial system. because bank lend 10 time capital, mtm loss destroy $ 5 trillion lend capacity”, lead severe credit squeeze. the sub-prime crisis, thus, ingredient deliver serious global recession. from financial crisis synchronise global recession in view strong interaction financial system real economy, financial crisis often give rise “adverse feedback loop”. a risk take capacity bank erode pressure capital, great risk aversion lead tight credit standards, flow money finance real activity become difficult. this see bi review 116/2009 3 money market credit market advance economies. when lead wall street bank fear fail, inter-bank market freeze, due generalise lack trust. the credit market, turn, witness severe pressure capacity lend; moreover, deleveraging process gather steam time, everybody want minimise losses. the real economic activity decelerate aggregate demand, particularly private consumption investment demand shrink pressure deleveraging, wealth loss associate fall asset prices, increase unemployment, deteriorate climate investment employment. a real effect financial crisis magnify time initial decouple perception turn myth, imf revise global growth outlook 2009 downwards repeatedly 3.9 per cent july 2008 -1.4 per cent july 2009. the volume world trade also project contract 12.1 per cent 2009. it serious real cost financial crisis lead large scale use fiscal monetary policy stimulus world. in view adverse feedback loop advance economies, policy aim address financial stress economic recession, since address one would weaken vicious loop. low interest rates, ample liquidity fiscal stimulus use contain adverse real effects; restore stability financial system, measure like raise capital bank financial institution address impair asset adopted. the indian economy global crisis india emerge lead emerge market economy (eme) time sub-prime crisis started. the average gdp growth 8.8 per cent 5 year period 2003-08 one high world recent period, also permanently raise india’s growth trajectory high level. there clear structural transformation, drive reforms, globalisation significant increase domestic save investment rates, help boost investment productivity drive growth system. more importantly, inflation india average 5.3 per cent high growth period. the macroeconomic environment remain stable resilient external shocks, despite rise degree openness significant reforms. sustainable current account deficit balance payment surge capital flow period lead increase country’s foreign exchange reserve usd 315 billion may 2008, significantly enhance capacity india face potential external sector vulnerability arise global crisis. domestic save rate increase 23.5 per cent gdp 2001-02 37.7 per cent 2007-08, facilitate step investment rate 22.8 per cent 39.1 per cent correspond period. because fiscal responsibility budget management (frbm) act, fiscal position also healthy consolidation path. give sound macro-financial conditions, india good place many emes face global crisis, even though time become evident perception decouple myth. the impact global crisis india three channel contagion – namely trade, capital flow deteriorate confidence – affect real sector economy. the immediate concern lehman bankruptcy, however, ass exposure domestic financial system fail institution fall asset price financial system advance countries. 4 bi review 116/2009 no direct limit indirect exposure indian bank system financial crisis the bank india direct exposure u sub-prime market. some banks, however, indirect exposure overseas branch subsidiary u sub-prime market form structure products, collateralised debt obligation (cdos). some banks, exposure credit derivatives, book mtm losses; impact though significant bank make adequate provision meet mtm loss exposures. moreover, bank general maintain high level capital adequacy ratio. once risk financial system assess limited, policy priority focus deal problem global illiquidity spiral ensure orderly well function markets. give strong interaction financial markets, financial institution real economy, ensure normal function market assume critical significance. the financial market - particular stock market, money market forex market – reflect heat global contagion. liquidity pressure global liquidity scare credit squeeze lead constrain access fund indian entities, corporates shift demand fund local markets. the pressure balance payments, lead net capital outflow third quarter 2008-09 associate intervention sale rbi forex market also imply correspond withdrawal domestic liquidity bank system, rbi offset expand liquidity domestic asset balance sheet. net capital flow decline

finance need bop. thus, le 10 per cent available stock forex reserves, balance payment pressure severe global contagion could contained. the liquidity demand, however, increase general lehman incident

attention money credit growth. the crisis also bring fore asset price significant role economy price buildup cannot ignore central bank. it important sub-sectors display incipient problem treat differently. preserve soundness regulate financial institutions, ensure orderly market condition contain pace deceleration growth warrant introduction adequate timely policy measure rbi. a wpi headline inflation decline sharply peak 12.9 per cent august 2008 (to 0.8 per cent end-march 2009 negative territory since june 2009), create enough space rbi pursue objective growth financial

financial system normally function markets, however, global contagion affect growth prospect economy. growth deceleration fiscal stimulus in last two quarter 2008-09, gdp growth india decelerate 5.8 per cent, drive sharp moderation private consumption demand weakness investment demand, primarily account impact heighten uncertainty consumer investment 6 bi review 116/2009 confidence. give capacity already create 9 per cent growth, decline aggregate demand widen output-gap (i.e. actual fell potential), warrant adequate expansion government demand moderate pace slowdown. this, though, involve deliberate temporary deviation fiscal consolidation process embody fiscal responsibility budget management (frbm) act. the deviation fiscal consolidation path evident revision centre’s fiscal deficit target 2.5 per cent gdp budget 6.2 per cent budget 2008-09. the combine fiscal deficit (centre states), include special security issue oil market fertiliser companies, reach 10.7 per cent gdp 2008-09. the net market borrow centre state jump rs.3.46 trillion (7.0 per cent gdp) 2008-09 rs.1.66 trillion (3.8 per cent gdp) 2007-08. the expansionary fiscal stance sustain 2009-10 support fast economic recovery, reflect increase budget net borrow programme (of centre state take together) rs.5.38 trillion 2009-10. the reserve bank, manager borrow programme government, ensure smooth completion large borrow far, accommodative monetary stance, give subdue demand credit private sector largely help regard. to help fast recovery, revival demand credit private sector would important, rbi highlight commercial bank need improve flow credit genuine productive activities, without compromise credit quality. certain counter-cyclical regulatory change also effect support objective, include reduction general provision requirement, relaxation risk weight certain assets, temporary restructure option certain loans. the emerge policy challenge balance risk growth outlook early return fiscal consolidation path, exit expansionary fiscal accommodative monetary policy remain key challenge. the challenge seen, however, context ultimate objective, fast durable recovery growth. the cost delay timely exit discuss now; cost delay economic recovery well. the policy choice become increasingly complex rbi, sign recovery growth still tentative, whereas inflation clearly firm up. in term recent sign improve growth prospects, one could see recovery industrial output april-july 2009, gdp growth first quarter 2009-10 6.1 per cent turn good 5.8 per cent experience last two quarter 2008-09, high relative growth core infrastructure sector april-july 2009, revival capital inflows, strong recovery stock market end march 2009 level, increase ipo large over-subscription. the downside risk include impact deficient monsoon agricultural growth, decline export 10th successive month july 2009 persistent global recession, decline tourist arrival august 2009-partly account swine flu fear, importantly rise inflationary pressure could limit scope sustain growth supportive monetary policy stance. the rbi’s current growth outlook remain 6 per cent upward bias. the medium-term objective, though, revert high growth path around 9 per cent. this growth trajectory also inclusive low stable inflation. opportunity post crisis period every major crisis expose limitation rigidity exist systems, thereby create compel pressure authority reform restructure. this global financial crisis provide trigger major revamp financial stability architecture around world, besides foster good governance globalization bi review 116/2009 7 process encourage relevant cooperation among national policy makers. the key area could strengthen financial stability architecture, agree recent g-20 meet london, include: • more good quality capital best first line defense financial crisis; introduction countercyclical buff good time strengthen resilience bad times; use leverage ratio element basel framework strengthen risk base capital requirement. • consistent coordinate implementation international standards, include basel ii, prevent emergence new risk regulatory arbitrage, particularly regard central counterparties credit derivatives, oversight credit rat agency hedge funds, quantitative retention requirement securitisation. • convergence towards single set high-quality, global, independent account standard financial instruments, loan-loss provisioning, off-balance sheet exposure impairment valuation financial assets. • strong regulation oversight systemically important firms. for country like india sri lanka, growth opportunity almost limitless, give current level development catch welfare income level advance economies. large section population contribute much potential lack opportunities, policy environment could recognize gap provide right opportunity appropriate incentives, growth prospect could improve significantly. a global crisis magnitude help create expand opportunity around 2 billion population world live abject poverty. that important reason country like india sri lanka must demand good global governance system manage challenge globalisation. moreover, ambitious fail-proof financial stability architecture may emerge post-crisis period also emphasize financial inclusion, since financial system potential key channel offer opportunity could make large section population realise potential. india opportunity reap demographic dividend, demography favour large young population; estimate suggest 2020 average age indian population could low 30. the demographic dividend, viewed, could become demographic curse, unless opportunity create everybody, sense participation development process. finance, therefore, key role address challenge, unlike role finance experience financial system advance economy could maximize individual return easily socialize cost actions. conclude observation we collective responsibility ensure sound stable financial system, able contribute good sustainable growth economic development. the link finance growth must strengthened, must realise finance mean economic growth development; end itself. the tendency among use financial system casino must curbed, strengthen regulation good management distort incentive among market participants. it easy draw optimal line right regulation andfree markets. no regulator would deliberately stifle financial innovation unless perceive risk outweigh benefits. in free market economy, however, financial innovation may drive market wants, rather may necessary economy. freedom increase scope misuse, freedom also necessary promote growth provide opportunities. financial crisis result action human beings, drive greed dangerous drive remain ahead peer 8 bi review 116/2009 financial market maximize return destructive financial engineering. no amount regulatory response, whether national global level, thus, could guarantee future crisis long human be manage run financial systems. way back 1936 keynes highlight role “animal spirit” human beings, i.e. spontaneous optimism, spontaneous urge action rather inaction. in 2009, book akerlof shiller title “animal spirits: how human psychology drive economy, matter global capitalism”, highlight role “non-economic motives” explain crisis. much prosperity market economy possible animal spirit, regulation suppress animal spirit, potential risk instability crisis. the excess financial system often create natural process creative destruction, surface form crisis ensure force clean-up systems. in process evolution financial systems, regulatory supervisory architecture help prevent crisis long sound principle generally adhere to. when unsound practice lead crisis, creative destruction process make system recover crisis also become robust full-proof. the global crisis offer opportunity revisit conventional wisdom many area future approach financial sector reform well supervision must guide primary objective make financial sector serve need real economy. i hope u take advantage opportunity unleash various sector move towards direction “inclusive growth”. thank you. reference akerlof,

that caution u steer clear ironclad policy prescriptions. nonetheless, i would hazard view prudent risk management suggest policy likely need begin normalization obvious necessary, possibly great force customary, take proper account policy institute authorities. allow elaborate three items. first, fed's extraordinary policy accommodation demand removal? the central banker's standard reply, i would associate here, fit bill: when condition warrant. the fomc state wednesday "economic condition likely warrant exceptionally low level federal fund rate extend period." although might central banker's rationalize excuse knowing, i genuinely believe precise time unknowable. in view, policymakers insist wait level real activity plainly substantially return normal – economy return self-sustaining trend growth – almost certainly wait long. a complication large volume bank system reserve create nontraditional policy responses. there risk, much debate magnitude, unusually high level reserves, along substantial liquid asset bank system, could fuel unanticipated, excessive surge lending. 6 see kevin warsh (2009), "defining deviancy," speech deliver institute international

household, business financial firm balance sheets. it trend level asset price inform policymakers. correlation asset price across market also provide important insights. in time panic, historic correlation break commonality predominates. those firm individual purportedly "well-diversified portfolios" go panic bore painful witness truth. during extreme conditions, sharp swing investor sentiment often dominate change relative valuation and, time, limit degree financial market effectively allocate credit. this breakdown historic correlation unique onset panics. it may predominate panic condition retreat. for instance, past couple months, u.s. stock market index corporate bond price move meaningfully higher, treasury yield foreign exchange value dollar fell. these movement difficult reconcile historical experience ascribe change modal growth path economy. rather, odd constellation movement asset price may indicate change investor preference distribution outlook inflation growth. it would reassure growth inflation prospect come month asset price signal clearer, reliable message. second, might policy response evolve? many program create panic design atrophy – due change relative attractiveness price term – market condition improved. this natural unwind prove largely successful. a result, federal reserve's balance sheet composition change recent months, even overall balance sheet size remain relatively constant. 7 see kevin warsh (2008), "the promise peril new financial architecture," speech deliver money marketeers new york university, new york, november 6, 2008. 4 bi review 115/2009 several fed's non-traditional program provide monetary stimulus establish section 13(3) federal reserve act, fed's govern statute. the congress authorize federal reserve lend non-depository institutions, program do, "unusual exigent circumstances." the judgment 13(3) standard long satisfy would cause unwind nontraditional policy tool fed, presage normalization policy.8 ultimately, decision make remove policy accommodation further, prudent risk management may prescribe accomplish great swiftness modern central bank custom. the federal reserve act preemptively provide monetary stimulus, especially early 2008 economy appear uneven, uncertain trajectory. if economy turn smartly durably, policy might need unwind resolve equal accommodation phase. that is, speed force action ahead may bear correspond symmetry path precede it. of course, economy remain mire weak economic conditions, inflation inflation expectation measure firmly anchored, policy could remain highly accommodative. "whatever takes" say maxim mark battle last year. but, cannot asymmetric mantra, trot time deep economic financial distress, discard cycle turns. if "whatever takes" appropriate arrest panic, refrain might turn equally necessary stage recovery ensure fed's institutional credibility. the asymmetric application policy ultimately could cause innovative policy approach introduce past couple year lose stand valuable addition arsenal central bankers. third, might u.s. monetary policy affect macroeconomic policies? monetary policy conduct vacuum. the federal reserve, monetary policymakers, keen observer judgment make fiscal authority around world. central banker necessarily take account judgments. financial markets' affection decouple – disassociation u.s. economic prospect rest world – tend wax wane. my view subject le ephemeral. our prospect economic growth highly correlate prospect large trade partners. and fiscal, regulatory trade policy diverge deteriorate, economic prospect globally could suffer. but good path prevail – bear past couple generation economic dynamism, positive-sum trade flows, fiscal sustainability regulatory best practice – emerge crisis stronger, integrate global economy resilient financial markets. monetary policy convergence prove remarkable, remarkably constructive, throughout crisis. when removal accommodation begin earnest, alert see trend continues. 8 this standard represent prudent framework responsibility delegate central bank. the grant authority congress standards-based clear limit bounds. it might serve useful model worthy broad application

old economics tutor – still teach “a level” economics – spend time meet current students. so real pleasure here. the economy appear turned. follow extraordinary fall output end last year begin year, output appear stabilised. and recent output data business survey suggest likely see positive growth second half 2009. these indicator prompt numerous headline declare end recession. in strict, technical sense may right – may move period positive growth resumed. but i would caution draw much comfort headlines. even output expand second half year, many family business may still feel like economic doldrums. unemployment likely continue rise period firm still face sluggish demand. the recovery may slow protracted. this caution often characterise bank gloomy. but i fear miss point. let clear, compare situation face six nine month ago, economic outlook improve significantly. output long free fall, bank system stabilised, confidence level improved, risk really bad economic depression receded. to repeat, economy appear turn important corner road recovery. but start along road. the level national output estimate fall around 5.5% past year – large four-quarter fall experience post-war period. employment also fall substantially. these fall result significant degree economic slack open economy. firm operate normal capacity; increase number people unable find jobs. this slack detract well-being. and, persisted, would pull inflation well 2% – target i colleague monetary policy committee mandate aim for. to meet target, need see sustain period robust growth bring level

increase household debt. spend, spend, spend? much say increase household debt, term role build financial crisis extent may dampen recovery. the theme much comment current economic difficulty payback past excesses. households, said, seduce easy credit rise asset prices, lead debt fuel spend boom. a result, face period retrenchment make amend former spendthrift ways. like much conventional wisdom, view contain kernel truth. but repetition lead exaggeration distortion. separate fact fiction vital form view economic outlook. consumer spend account two-thirds total demand economy; decision make consumer country critical determine strength sustainability recovery. a natural place start would “consumption boom”, often presume precede bust. but fact boom. between turn century onset financial crisis, consumer spend increase fast done, average, past 40 years.1 moreover, fraction national output consume household increase. the kernel truth consumption boom story change distribution national income mean stable growth aggregate consumer spend associate sharp decline household save ratio. the proportion income household set aside fell close 10% 1997 little 2% ten year later. although spend

make point concretely: household accumulate additional £1trillion debt 2000 2008, also acquire £750 billion financial asset period.2what go on? to caricature thing little, old household (or rather trade within house market) benefit sell home much high values. they winners. the big loser young household (or trade up), pay house accumulate high debts. the money borrow young family end bank account old households. that money wasn’t use fuel spend boom. rather, leave deposit use invest financial assets. the huge increase borrow one part population broadly match big increase save another part. the increase house price decade 2007 – massive financial flow associate appreciation – represent huge redistribution wealth different household within society. two important point draw episode. first, analysis increase household debt past decade pay equal attention record accumulation financial assets. they two side coin. second, change house price result significant change aggregate household wealth: every winner gain high house price loser face le affordable housing. but mean change house price significant implication macroeconomy. house price change may directly affect aggregate spend effect value house collateral, hence ability households’ access credit, different propensity winner loser spend “windfalls”. a debt hangover? even though accumulation debt drive excessive consumption spending, sharp fall asset price associate financial crisis lead mark deterioration households’ financial position – asset worth le debt still need repaid. the market value households’ financial house asset fall 10% past two years. doe mean form hole households’ balance sheet weigh recovery seek repair it? 2 this increase reflect purchase assets. it include return investments. bi review 114/2009 3 any real perceive need household rebuild balance sheet may play active role determine level spending.3 for example, cost finance debt uncertainty future employment prospect may make household reluctant exceed certain level net borrowing. in case, deterioration financial position household may cause spend le order repay debt increase savings. the “payback period” i mention earlier. this possibility focus much recent attention state households’ balance sheets. but standard measure households’ financial position – ratio debt asset – may exaggerate severity problem. that conventional measure suffer “missing” asset “missing” liability. let explain. the “missing” liability cost purchase house future. this argument directly relate redistribution argument i discuss earlier. measure conventional terms, mark decline house price see past two year lead pronounce deterioration households’ balance sheets: house price decline around 15% value outstanding mortgage debt largely unaffected. the low level house price eventually reflect low level mortgage debt otherwise first-time buyer (and trade house ladder) enjoy benefit affordable housing. but effect fully materialise entire house stock turn new low price level, may take considerable time. in meantime, take account miss liability exaggerate deterioration households’ underlie position. moreover, consider fall price house financial assets, could exaggerate extent people actually le wealthy. for households, form assets. this obviously case retired. but large asset own people measure all. it value expect earn future or, economist refer “human capital”. most estimate suggest value future earn significantly great sum net financial wealth gross house asset typically form basis balance sheet measures.4 the significance miss asset that, even though recent event may impair households’ future income prospects, scale reduction likely significantly le fall see financial wealth.5and important remember household may opt mitigate fall wealth great saving, also work more. labour demand has, course, weaken recession number hour work fallen. but even household able increase supply labour now, may plan future, perhaps delay eventual retirement. this may still help moderate extent spend fall near term. 3 simple textbook model tie consumption permanent income would predict sort behaviour. however, model recognise imperfection financial market often consistent type behaviour, particularly effect uncertainty explicitly considered. for discussion consumption save theory see berry, waldron williams (2009). for discussion interaction household debt, house price consumption, see benito, waldron, young zampolli (2007). 4 for example, bakhshi (2000) estimate value future earn (human wealth) represent around 80% household wealth, whereas net financial wealth gross house asset together represent around 20%. 5 the sum households’ net financial gross house wealth decline 10% since start crisis. in contrast, external estimate loss supply capacity result recession, fall human capital likely closely related, around 4-5% range. see, example, hmt (2009) imf (2009). 4 bi review 114/2009 none deny households’ balance sheet affect recent fall wealth. but extent deterioration hence pressure household repair balance sheet might exaggerate fail take comprehensive view asset liabilities. nevertheless, clear that, even put balance sheet one side, financial crisis affect household family way cause spend less. most directly, recession lead pronounce weaken labour market, employment fall income squeezed. the recession sharp rise unemployment may also lead household revise belief stability economy predictability incomes. the period early 1990s financial crisis dub economist great moderation. the uk economy enjoy 60 consecutive quarter positive economic growth accompany low stable inflation. it possible household plan basis increase economic stability would persist indefinitely. if so, event past two year would come substantial shock. households’ consumption slow sharply since begin 2008. indeed, consumption estimate fall past five consecutive quarters, first time happen since record begin 1955. relative average rate increase, level consumer spend fall around 7½% since start 2008, save rate increase sharply. there already considerable adjustment households’ spending. in near-term, prospect consumption depend importantly performance labour market. although substantial fall employment past year so, size adjustment date has, anything, le might fear give fall output. this may partly reflect great degree wage flexibility apparent recession compare either 1980s 1990s.6 this great flexibility mean burden firms’ adjustment recession spread workforce whole, rather lose jobs. this may help mitigate slow consumption, household may find easy borrow smooth consumption still job may limit extent household increase save precaution possibility future job losses. further out, prospect consumption depend importantly extent deterioration households’ financial position indeed cause scale back spending. a i argued, good reason think may happen. but also important remember already substantial adjustment consumption; conventional measure household balance sheet may exaggerate scale deterioration. policy let conclude remark policy. the current focus monetary policy ensure sufficient stimulus economy generate strong sustain recovery necessary bring demand good balance supply ensure inflation track meet inflation target. a i said, structural adjustment need occur – structure bank system; balance global trade flows, level public possibly 6 for information see box page 29 august 2009 inflation report. bi review 114/2009 5 household debt – potential delay derail recovery. but monetary policy – – seek prevent adjustments. they necessary long-run stability economy. rather job monetary policy – public policy generally – ensure adjustment occur orderly manner within economic environment consistent hit 2% inflation target. because new untested, understandably considerable nervousness monetary policy committee’s asset purchase programme – a.k.a. quantitative easing. how suppose work? will work? the essence asset purchase programme increase supply money credit economy. an important point stress success programme depend bank return position able lend normally. the policy work supply money directly economy, banks. much money inject purchase government bond institutional investors, insurance company pension funds. these purchase encourage investor switch portfolio away gild corporate bond equities, improve supply credit businesses. companies’ access credit enhance bank’s purchase commercial paper corporate bonds, improve function markets. but working? the objective asset purchase increase growth nominal spending. a change interest rates, take time see impact purchase feed high aggregate spend inflation. however, encourage sign medicine working. the growth underlie broad money pick recent months, especially relative weak growth rate might otherwise seen. interest rate fallen. corporate bond spread decline substantially. and amount finance raise company bond equity market record levels. not development attribute solely actions. but i doubt asset purchase play important role. at policy meet august, monetary policy committee vote maintain bank rate 0.5% increase scale asset purchase programme £175 billion. that level bank rate scale asset purchase maintain mpc meet early month. you may notice meet august split vote amongst committee. a majority committee – include – vote increase asset purchase programme £175 billion, whereas minority prefer large expansion £200 billion. it important make much difference; member view degree monetary stimulus need meet inflation target. my judgment uncertainty surround economic outlook effect asset purchase make difficult strong view relative merit increase asset purchase programme £175 billion £200 billion. indeed, inflation projection publish august inflation report suggest either policy consistent hit inflation target, depend future path interest rates. for me, decision come assessment risk much versus risk little. with regard potential risk little, main concern nominal demand would recover level consistent hit inflation target. my main worry much stem uncertainty associate use asset purchase policy instrument. we much experience conduct monetary policy via asset purchase risk effect transmit economy way predict want. for example, substantial injection liquidity might result unwarranted increase asset price could prove costly rectify. i place considerable weight risk think best balance expansion programme £175 billion. 6 bi review 114/2009 i hopeful start along road recovery. the journey likely long without difficulty. but monetary policy committee stand ready whatever take ensure economy move good balance inflation

the argument blame monetary policy current crisis claim low interest rate combine large current account surplus emerge economies, particularly asian oil-exporting ones, create abundance liquidity trigger excessive increase asset price (bubbles). this particularly acute house market. when bubble burst, crisis erupted. then, argument claim house bubble cause monetary policy, fail act opportunely permit severe imbalance accumulate. nonetheless, one must bear mind soar asset price necessarily end crisis like one. close attention must pay financial fragility accompany process, whose main culprit unrestrained financial innovation generate deep distortion neither market regulator able predict. an expansionary monetary policy undoubtedly induce excessive increase price asset credit. the ultimate role monetary policy smooth business cycle control inflation.1 therefore, possible think expansionary monetary policy, need reach inflation target, exacerbate economic boom. moreover, policy serious consequence output monetary impulse withdrawn. however, expansionary monetary policy could explain severity financial collapse global recession world see today. there country monetary policy expansionary, interest rate minimum, house bubble financial collapse occurred. a couple example canada chile, two inflation targeters where, consistently policy framework, interest rate hit low level different feed fund rate (figure 1). still, house price generally experience increase comparable economies, financial system remain sound. furthermore, case house price go high, clear indication bubble. however, financial system make remain stable and, 1 a flexible inflation target regime balance cost output fluctuation inflation instability, result decline both, output inflation volatility. for exposition framework relate definition inflation target parameter see de gregorio (2009a). bi review 113/2009 1 despite current difficulties, avoid acute financial crises. this case of, example, australia spain. naturally, face disproportionate increase house prices, increase credit boom construction symptom downturn severe. still, need result systemic financial meltdown. in case, monetary policy help creation bubbles, although much level interest rate monetary policy strategy financial turmoil deal with. in unite states, strategy turn blind eye period soar asset price then, bubble burst, reduce aggressively interest rate use fed’s strategy (the “mop-up strategy” accord blind reis, 2005). this approach first use “black monday” october 1987, breakdown long-term capital management (ltcm) late burst high-tech bubble. in occasions, asset price reverse down, abrupt relaxation monetary policy.2 this implicit insurance, popularly know greenspan put, certainly make creation bubble likely. this strategy, work early episodes, fail miserably big collapse decades. a monetary policy strategy use provide insurance speculation episode limit financial turbulence prove incapable confront financial crisis systemic proportions. this strategy deal bubble prescription derive inflation targeting, need insure financial stability. in view, financial stability must address first appropriate regulation financial system limit excess saw crisis. there may situation might appropriate deviate transitorily inflation target regime order ensure financial stability, must exception, normal time arise. i think first lesson conduct monetary policy avoid provide insurance speculators, create enormous moral hazard problems. in emerge country live this, much mild consequences, attempt manage exchange rate disconnect fundamental prolong period time. therefore, examination monetary policy financial dislocation around world suggest culprit current crisis relate closely function financial system monetary policy. one issue carefully examine future cause real estate boom house crisis, occur unite states. at point clear lend standard relax beyond reason, financial innovation go far.3 2. inflation target asset price a corollary blame monetary policy that, apart focus variation price good services, also take consideration asset prices, beyond direct impact project inflation. under inflation target regime, increase lend asset price repercussion inflation outlook, impact output gap. this would require monetary policy adjustment prevent persistent rise inflation. hence, inflation target regime, asset price level credit aggregate affect monetary policy decision extent affect inflation perspective (bernanke gertler, 1999). 2 interestingly and, accord blind real (2005), use taylor rule first quarter 1988, residual indicate mention episode federal reserve set interest rate significantly prescribe rule. 3 elli (2008) show u.s., household strong motivation increase leverage tax, legal regulatory incentives. 2 bi review 113/2009 however, argue monetary policy react directly asset prices, example, include taylor rule. cecchetti et al. (2000) perhaps best representative position, claim inflation-targeting central bank react asset price misalignment beyond implication expect inflation policy horizon. in view, three reason monetary policy, general, react asset price beyond impact project inflation: • first, clear increase interest rate capable stop increase asset prices. the require adjustment might large could end unnecessarily generate high unemployment undesired drop inflation. • second, matter safeguard stability financial system. an excessive interest rate aim control asset price could even trigger financial instability, precisely mean avoid, especially increase asset price accompany high financial fragility. • finally, inflation targeting, interest rate movement inconsistent inflation converge target may undermine credibility monetary policy, destabilize inflationary expectations, weaken effectiveness monetary policy. this particularly important case emerge economy short record monetary stability. another reason put forward try affect asset price monetary policy simply impossible determine price significantly misalign fundamentals. although i agree fact, i think strong reason. indeed, even though difficult determine price fundamentally misaligned, policymakers worry phenomenon. however, act monetary policy may best option, good look closely financial regulation limit procyclicality bank system build enough cushion downturn. this also reduce fragility generate upturn. 3. inflation targets, exchange rate intervention an inflation-targeting regime, policy instrument interest rate, must operate within context flexible exchange rate. this solve efficiently unambiguously well-known impossible trinity country financially open, allow control interest rate level consistent inflationary objective. add exchange rate objective weaken capacity control interest rate, affect ability meet inflation target. however, exchange rate generally effect monetary policy, since persistent movement affect inflation. in case, natural result lean wind. when exchange rate appreciate substantially, prompt fall inflation medium term, result reduction interest rate. this, turn, induce pressure depreciation. however, one must recognize significant effect because, float regime, pass-through coefficient exchange rate inflation limited.4emerging economy may feel tempted, long history crisis cause exchange rate misalignments, keep currency depreciated. manage exchange rate is, apart hardly feasible medium long term, risky. in first place, le flexible 4 for recent discussion chilean evidence see de gregorio (2009b). bi review 113/2009 3 exchange rate regimes, pass-through exchange rate inflation increases, level exchange rate may become coordinator price expectations, give policymakers’ commitment exchange rate stability. this, turn, fee back increase pressure keep exchange rate stable, thus aggravate problem. secondly, commitment authority exchange rate stability may create perverse incentive financial risk taking, artificially low cost borrow abroad. this reinforce fear float (calvo reinhart, 2002), create spiral towards exchange rate rigidity, derive currency mismatch exchange rate misalignment policy intend prevent first place. i say attention must pay exchange rate beyond effect inflation. the exchange rate important determinant resource allocation, hence, excessive deviation fundamental may create distortions. however, i think sensible way address sign severe misalignments, beyond lean wind monetary policy, sterilize intervention. but, order effective coherent inflation target framework, condition must met: • in first place, must consistent inflation target, order intervention jeopardize credibility monetary policy. • secondly, safeguard monetary policy independence, intervention announced, must implement mechanically. all shield conduct monetary policy, typically carry regular pre-established meetings, extraordinary decision buy buy foreign currency. in particular, sterilization intervention decision permit preserve credibility independent management monetary policy. • finally, sterilization requisite, cost intervention must properly considered, entail quasi-fiscal component could significant. the chilean experience last year line aforesaid principles. it do moment clear evidence misalignment respect level deem consistent long-term fundamentals. it also totally consistent inflation objective, start moment – april 2008 – rather benign inflation figure reveal small risk unwanted inflationary propagation. towards midyear even possible raise interest rate substantially tackle surprise rise inflation much deviate target. this thank fact purchase dollar carry mechanically, despite significantly depreciate exchange rate intervention. the purchase foreign currency conclude prematurely due global tension global liquidity dollar september last year. the capacity chilean economy subsequently deal significant exchange rate depreciation, monetary ease prospect reduce inflationary pressures, proof inconsistency decision intervene conduct monetary policy (figure 2). it also show flexible exchange rate regime adopt early decade economy well prepare absorb exchange rate fluctuation without turmoil use come past. 4. bubbles, exchange rate capital inflow emerge economy latin america go period large capital inflow first part 1990s (calvo et al., 1996). we cannot disregard possibility current crisis over, reemergence inflow emerge economies. therefore, could strong pressure sharp increase valuation domestic assets, potential bubble prices, bubble could take form exchange rate appreciation. 4 bi review 113/2009 to begin discussion, i emphasize capital inflow capital-scarce economy good thing. we know capital flow institutionally strong economy beneficial (prasad et al., 2002). therefore, role policy impede capital flows, avoid creation bubble domestic asset consequence resource allocation.5 in regard, place sound prudential regulation period abundance capital essential financial stability, remind crisis chile early 1980s, mexican crisis mid-1990s, asian crisis, recently, crisis eastern europe. even one could accept monetary tighten could appropriate response combat asset price bubble recent house price bubble, caveat i discuss before, problem acute small open economies. tighten monetary policy may perverse effects, since induce capital inflow strengthen currency. in case, interest rate adequate instrument burst bubble. indeed, perverse dynamic follows: high interest rate differential induce capital inflow arbitrage differences; policymakers strive avoid appreciation, general think transitory, since sustainability exchange rate management limited; incentive inflow increase interest rate differential large, also expectation appreciation; finally, appreciation take place, validate expectation arbitrageurs. this process go may accommodate gradually end sudden stop. in process “excess” inflow “excess appreciation”, issue avoid excesses. accord simple dynamic i describe first line defense avoid excess fluctuation capital flow maintain exchange rate flexibility. this prevent investor speculate authority defend parity transitorily. moreover, introduce volatility increase risk one side bet exchange rate. an inflation commitment may also help stabilize flows. a i discuss before, massive inflow appreciate currency result loosen monetary policy reduce incentive carry trade. in contrast, capital inflow generate boom activity, without inflationary consequence due appreciation currency, could temptation tighten monetary policy, aggravate problem massive inflows. to control expenditure without increase pressure exchange rate, fiscal policy help. a credible inflation target flexible exchange rate regime help avoid problem face 1990s. indeed, period large capital inflows, monetary policy latin america operate full-fledge inflation target regime, country form exchange rate rigidity. despite flexible exchange rate inflation target place, effect exchange rate could reflect domestic asset price could form bubble. in case, sterilize intervention, without explicit objective level exchange rate, also help. i already discuss principle guide sterilize intervention within inflation target framework. a much debate proposal use capital controls. the 5 in addition, traditional concern speed capital flow in, capital may flow out, generate costly adjustment processes. see cowan et al. (2007) review sudden start sudden stop around world. sudden stop inflow common develop emerge countries, former, sudden stop tend offset return domestic capital invest abroad, latter result severe squeeze capital account. accumulation reserve another form insurance help avoid large swings. bi review 113/2009 5 evidence effectiveness elusive.6 effectiveness also severely impair domestic financial market reach degree development integration rest world. with hindsight current crisis, one think rather controls, need prudential regulatory framework avoid speculation high risk take bank system. 5. the rise fall inflation in section i review inflation behavior chile, country sharp increase inflation among emerge economy run commodity prices, also large decline since crisis erupt (figure 3). the remarkable component inflationary process 2007-2008 strongly increase international food price transmit domestically. inflation rise y-o-y rate 2.6% december 2006 9.9% october 2008. then, decline -1.0% august 2009. what account steep rise inflation? it may partially due chile’s high degree commercial openness. there practically barrier imports, widespread protection agriculture, large-scale distortion market price mechanism, change external price quickly reflect domestic market. in fact, least great part 2007, grow inflation mostly cause increase food prices, rather widespread inflationary process (figure 4).7 the 2007-2008 food price shock partially consider one-off change global relative demand supply, increase use biofuels severe medium-term inflationary implications. however, inflation rising, monetary policy rate (mpr) raise 125 basis point second half 2007, order mitigate undesirable second-round effect supply shock (figure 5). 8by early 2008, inflationary situation still complex one, risk decreased, inflation expect reach target thank monetary policy action already place, low world growth strengthen peso. trend inflation temper monetary policy remain unchanged. during period decide initiate process reserve accumulation. nevertheless, halfway second quarter 2008, inflation path radically changed; inflationary trend resumed, unexpectedly, monthly inflation reach 1%. the risk inflation remain target beyond policy horizon also grow strongly. consistently, monetary policy also strong reaction. the mpr increase 200 basis point four months. by september 2008, collapse lehman brothers, central bank estimate would necessary raise mpr further, even market expectations. finally, inflation reach 9.9% peak october. it still early determine great degree certainty strong sudden propagation foreign shock domestic 6 for review chilean experience, see cowan de gregorio (2007). the empirical study find effect reduce extent appreciation edward rigobon (2009), however magnitude effect small, since elimination capital control maximum would appreciate exchange rate 2 2.5%. in case, useful remind appreciate real exchange rate last 20 year chile occur 1997, year capital controls, massive reserve accumulation, exchange rate band high interest rates. 7 another factor underlie inflation pressure deceleration growth high cost energy. not thermoelectric power plant operate costly inputs, also unfavorable hydrological condition shortage natural gas imply efficient source generation replace diesel. 8 for simulation monetary policy response oil shock see desormeaux et al. (2009). they conclude response moderate shock transitory policy credible. a much strong response suggest batini terenau (2009). 6 bi review 113/2009 inflation. inflation propagate prices, core inflation also increase sharply. the output gap increase slightly third quarter,9 although domestic demand grow strongly (figure 6). the exchange rate add significant inflationary pressures. perhaps, sharp increase oil price – come close 150 dollar per barrel – cause generalize rise domestic prices. a strong demand large cost shock may induce unusual fraction price-setters adjust prices, despite fact output gap change significantly. however, case, price remain stable rather experience sharp fall commodity price start falling. a world economies, financial tension severe collapse lehman brothers. interest rate peso dollar market post substantial increase stressful time mid-september mid-october 2008 (figure 7). the central bank act quickly, provide peso dollar liquidity facility financial system ensure resource availability would foreign loan become scarce. these facilities, place throughout 2009, use extensively financial institutions, reflect sustain access external markets. this example monetary policy react mitigate financial turbulence without affect path monetary policy consider consistent inflation target. beyond stressful episode local money markets, world financial crisis aftermath real sector cause significant drop domestic demand economic activity. lend standard certainly tightened, chilean economy far suffer problem country facing. accordingly, inflation outlook change significantly, monetary policy react change large magnitude swift implementation. october 2008 month y-o-y inflation peaked. november bring relief, largely determine drop fuel price world markets. by then, break inflationary trend foreseen. nonetheless, give weaken outlook activity inflation, central bank raise mpr – likely path monetary policy discuss september’s monetary policy report present congress – also communicate likely course action would ease policy early 2009. in january 2009, clear assessment reduce inflationary pressures, mpr low 100 basis points. later, evidence alleviate inflationary pressure drastic increase downward risk growth inflation, central bank decide cut mpr 250 basis point meet february march. the monetary ease process continue complete 775 basis point seven monthly meetings, bring mpr 0.50%, minimum level deem adequate normal function money markets. in addition, central bank adopt non-conventional monetary policy measures, extend overnight liquidity facility bank mpr 180 day tenor cut issuance 1- 2-year central bank bonds. it also announce mpr hold constant minimum level prolong period time, use flexibility monetary policy tool hand, go way beyond set mpr every month. several lesson challenge arise chilean experience. first, volatility inflation large. this could explain severity shock hit economy, clear compare countries. although argue indexation could resume inflation would stay high, turnaround impressive, hence, clear persistence evolved, difficult 9 the output gap actual output minus potential output; hence, increase refer rise potential output. bi review 113/2009 7 explain simple linear adjustment. it could argue change inflation due impact inflation widen output gap. however, output gap change little inflation rising, current decline cannot explain current narrow output gap.10 we use think output gap, proxy marginal cost, affect inflation, chilean experience large swing growth domestic demand rather output. however, connection domestic demand inflation le clear output gap. finally, degree openness competition chilean economy may increase sensitivity price demand conditions. more work would do fully understand dynamic inflation, still inflation target framework useful conduct monetary policy stabilize inflationary expectations. 6. conclude remark although often not, central bank explicit financial stability objective, many years, within context strong gdp growth sound balance sheet bank firms, second-class issue. now thing change dramatically. a last year, financial stability become protagonist monetary policy management develop countries.11 central bank need oversee price stability financial stability. to pursue two objectives, one instrument, namely interest rate, enough. indeed, well function financial system strengthen transmission mechanism monetary policy. there may exceptional occasion objective may collide, example monetary policy require increase interest rate, financial stability call reduction. another example could bubble exchange rate high inflation. in context monetary policy inflation target regime, situation could accommodate escape clauses. but, general objective address one instrument. the overall purpose financial stability ensure proper function market avoid arrive degree turbulence dislocation witness past year. for reason, financial regulation play major role grant financial integrity. at beginning, regulation focus strength individual institutions. however, tension see show individual fragility may quickly evolve systemic problems. the interrelationship among financial institution proper operation market liquidity trade essential ingredient market economy, characteristic also channel financial contagion, recently seen. so crucial systemic vision, perspective different institution relate other, also different type financial operate risk intertwined, create potential vulnerabilities. regard price stability, conduct monetary policy within inflation target scheme appropriate, recent experience show may provide ample room expansionary policy face global recession current one. there long debate number research paper proper mechanism secure financial stability combine monetary policy management. however, current 10 for example, output gap fell 8 10 percentage points, could explain, without lags, decline 3 4 percentage point inflation, apply textbook phillips curve complex estimation (brayton tinsley, 1996) us, different chile. the actual decline inflation chile 10 percentage points. 11 the feed explicit financial stability objective, although role matter widely known. see, example, plosser (2007). 8 bi review 113/2009 experience many emerge market demonstration objective financial stability price stability preserve even extreme tensions. in sum, conduct monetary policy inflation target regime, flexible exchange rate, clear mechanic exceptional sterilize intervention clear sign misalignments, countercyclical fiscal rule, strong financial regulatory framework work quite well mitigate effect bad crisis world face several decades. reference batini, n. e. tereanu (2009), “what

josé de gregorio: macroeconomics, economist crisis speech mr josé de gregorio, governor central bank chile, annual meet society chilean economy (sechi), antofagasta, 4 september 2009. i thank luis felipe céspedes, eduardo engel, pablo garcía mariana garcía valuable comments. * * * this certainly great opportunity speak subject trigger reflection recently, probably best say queen elizabeth’s famous question, make visit london school economics last year: why nobody notice it? a someone dedicate professional life academic activity policy making, question surely unsettling. the current global financial crisis recession, whose depth unprecedented recent decades, cast doubt work macroeconomists, usefulness theories, capacity anticipate deal crises. these issue i discus today. macroeconomics over past decades, macroeconomic theory evolved, one hand, discipline whose purpose solve problem similar engineering, and, hand, whose purpose explain phenomenon embody economic reality, similar science (mankiw, 2006). in fact, macroeconomics create solve problem great depression. in beginnings, devote build large model evaluate macroeconomic policy tradition engineering. it recent decade focus drift toward scientific dimension. in case, i prefer think economics close medical science (harberger, 1993), diagnoses, analyze evidence propose treatments. it different physic physic deliver prescriptions, least directly. hence importance interaction science practice. economics additional complication, social science try explain human behavior. the emphasis put rigor solid theoretical fundamental positive development, make policy recommendation require good accurate diagnosis reality. like past, could extensive, complex models, many sectoral interrelations, base statistical estimation calibrations. but model aren’t conceptually well-formulated base statistical patterns, usefulness limited. this great contribution economics rational expectation revolution and, policy field, lucas critique. only preference technology invariant policies, result behavior agent not; therefore, policy ideally evaluate model specify preference technologies.1 nonetheless, current crisis reveal model limit deal complexity real world. however, i believe reduced-form models, caveat regard potential misuse, still help design policy, particularly 1 this must interpret caution, productivity, part technology, depend policy changes, especially long term. the central point lucas’s critique one must specify core characteristic economy study base research relationship change policies. bi review 112/2009 1 rigorous and, especially, realistic model available.2 for reason, always tension rigor, realism flexibility. the tendency base model ever rigorous grind also undesired effects. the incentive young academic – one suppose push border knowledge, must publish perish – limit capability innovation. the require rigor end necessarily threaten realism. nobody expect model explain completely economic reality, problem overlook element crucial understand prevent disaster like one face today. it may reward academic standpoint write equilibrium model explain particular phenomenon, try formulate model formalize distortion say phenomenon. it hard le reward academic formulate distortion – real world plenty – use tidy competitive model explain important stylize fact minimum new ingredients. scientific advance model help u think interpret world; provide u way think specific problems, scope limited. we must avoid temptation think theoretical simplification full description reality. but must also avoid extreme, totally dismiss theory teach “reality much complex”. this true, imply learn theoretical exercise without practical use reality. model must take realistically, recognize capture small portion reality. a future, current crisis certainly provide material many research study try figure fail avoid make mistake again. still, i think difficult develop simple, manageable model make substantive progress complete description reality. some interest effort likely made, easy become part heart macroeconomics, since necessarily complex. many model currently available mathematically sophisticated, result obtain computer-based calibration whose essential mechanism lack transparency come reveal arrive results. hence, difficult ass consistency. we often come across complicate model apparently innocuous condition end determinant results. complexity also jeopardize capacity move scientific research economic policy proposals. for academic idea useful economic policy, must persuasive. perhaps virtue is-lm model use many year macroeconomic policy discussions, solow’s growth model day remain cornerstone economic growth research. fortunately, time prescription take policy maker without scrutiny – late label orthodox – therefore, capacity intuitively explain result essential. the bulk theoretical research continue proceed area result good chance published, often expense realism. it may profitable academic point view incorporate element irrational behavior, confidence crisis anomaly general equilibrium model use policy design. nor easy include element political economy, particular influence interest groups, u financial system relevant understand evolution regulation cause crisis. 2 in case central bank chile, two model mainly use forecast, within tradition forward look rational-expectations models. one build many econometrically estimate reduced-form equation (mep, see central bank chile, 2003), general equilibrium intertemporal model (mas, see medina soto, 2007, application). although latter strong fundamentals, calibration le flexible analysis short-term dynamics. 2 bi review 112/2009 emphasis undoubtedly place capacity researcher explain complex phenomena, study realistic degree complexity allow. therefore, important insist: model part reality allow u organize idea diagnose prescribing. the arguments’ logic good deal judgment also critical come make economic policy decisions. general equilibrium model finance there two category model commonly use macroeconomics require specific references, namely real business cycle model (rbc) new keynesian model (nkm). both share characteristic general equilibrium intertemporal model complete market rational expectations.3 under rbc model traditional versions, economy fully flexible role macroeconomic policies, whereas nkm sticky price result money neutral, assign role monetary policy. these provide conceptual basis formulation inflation-target regimes. it important place type model right dimension. the strategy rbc model try replicate economic fluctuation simplest, least distort model possible. it originate attempt use neoclassical growth model explain business cycle result productivity shocks, surely interest effort theoretical consistency. these elegant models, difficulty solve analytically result solve use calibrations. a result, often doubt regard value parameters, general unobservable. to extent model free distortions, role active monetary policies, since economic fluctuation socially optimal. certainly attractive theoretical proposition, absurd think world works. it difficult explain financial collapse type model, friction provide limit policy implications. the new keynesian model feature realistic friction financial market either, least generate problem severe current ones, nothing say origin crisis.4 these model widely use central bank calibrate monetary policy consistent inflation target.5 in sense, useful tool establish well-specified, well-estimated transmission mechanisms, certainly limited, unrealistic believe provide full description economy. economy expose many shock cause deviation – sometimes significant deviation – projection scenarios. however, help understand alternative course action monetary policy shock hit. actually, much praise aggressiveness interest rate cut around world, unprecedented level many cases, largely justify sharp drop inflationary pressures. it likely that, without commitment bring inflation back normal rates, monetary policy action could attain part expansion. this practical demonstration wrong criticism inflation-targeting central banks, concern level activity. drop activity downward pressure cost factor open room monetary policy, avoid repeat mistake make 1930s. this 3 due similarities, goodfriend king (1997) call general equilibrium model price rigidity new neoclassical synthesis. 4 significant effort add financial frictions, particularly financial accelerator amplify cycle, make bernanke et al. (1999). see also christiano et al. (2007). although model analyze financial channel throughout cycle, originate financial meltdown like one observe last year. 5 for detail introduction, see galí gertler (2007). bi review 112/2009 3 nkm remain useful, different type model find address issue financial stability, together extension yet formalized. this bring theory finance. if ever one discipline anticipate vulnerability build financial markets, finance. have origin problem inflationary, problem would macroeconomics, origin financial. the origin crisis closely relate financial innovation creation instrument diversify risks. low interest rates, search yield monetary policy promise rescue severe fall asset price prompt creation house bubble.6 enormous effort make price many extremely complex financial instruments, even academic effort fail build valuation model realistically consider instruments’ insolvency probabilities. no evidence necessary assert method fail extreme event strike everything. these failure exacerbate severe liquidity shortage widespread panic markets.7broadly speaking, theory finance two branches: asset price theory corporate finance theory. it paradoxical asset price theories, application real world, base existence complete market full arbitrage (consider, example, capm), corporate finance theory explain firms’ financial decision essentially dominate information asymmetry plague friction principal (owner)-agent (executives) problems. this dichotomy correct time ensure realistic model financial market work become available, model shed light economic policy recommendations. crisis prevention a current crisis, one pending issue whether could anticipated. once question arises: “where profession, academic authorities, fail foresee severity problem?” it tautological say crisis unpredictable, else would never occur. history plague crises. moreover, crisis become frequent recent decade compare bretton wood period, although severity duration change significantly (bordo et al., 2001). important effort make identify early warn indicator could anticipate crisis (berg et al., 2004). the recent episode clearly show successful, say least. in current crisis hard find clear regularity respect early warn indicator (rose spiegel, 2009). furthermore, small, open economies, crisis trigger external event policy maker control. crisis costly, also result innovation risk taking, important progress. obviously must try avoid them, especially propagation amplification, good economic policy cushion impact large global crisis, certainly cannot eliminate altogether. in extreme, prevent global financial crisis, economy would totally isolate world, forbid risk-taking completely, close financial market altogether. naturally best way progress. make analogy car accidents, best way avoid would ban 6 de gregorio (2009) argue low interest rate responsible bubble financial meltdown, number country neither bubble financial instability (e.g., canada chile), others house bubble financial system much resilient (e.g., spain). 7 it note important warn risk incubated. worth single work raghu rajan present jackson hole 2005 (rajan, 2006). 4 bi review 112/2009 existence cars. however, seem reasonable build safe cars, buckle drive prudently. crisis continue happen, proper way act strengthen financial system macroeconomic policies, order minimize consequence probability occurrence. we must remain notion crisis cannot prevent thus nothing it. go back car analogy, fact accident always happen mean must allow drive speed regulation. quite contrary, know crisis especially severe affect financial system, reasonable improve regulatory mechanisms, particularly allow financial innovation keep vulnerability control. meanwhile, necessary continue devote effort detection early alerts, although, i already point out, unambiguous indicator impossible find. but symptom fragility, common emerge economies. high persistent current-account deficits, misalign exchange rates, currency mismatch financial corporate sectors, excessive increase price asset credit, signal potential problem, although result necessarily crisis.8 therefore, look indicator enough, important put together detect fragilities. this precisely try financial stability reports, allow u gain overall vision vulnerabilities, although, again, provide final verdict. finally, new financial reality require new set information examine, compile available.9crisis management that bad financial crisis since great depression nobody disputes. moreover, initial shock global economy differ much one hit 1930s. there many similarity initial condition effect two (eichengreen o’rourke, 2009; imf, 2009). worth note initial fall manufacture output trade, collapse stock price credit, increase bond spreads. in origin also rapid expansion credit financial innovation increase leverage financial intermediaries. these remarkable similarity first month crisis alarming. however, differ subsequent evolution global economy.10 between 1930 1932, world activity (measured ppp) drop average 4.8%. in particular, u.s. experience average annual fall 9.9%. the current situation different, pace recovery yet seen, forecast three-year period 2009-2011 point world economy grow average 2.1% per year, 0.8% u.s.11 in 1930s, u.s. unemployment soar 25%, much high 10% project time. also, world face severe deflation early 1930s, case sink 8 although evidence show financial development good economic growth, excessive credit expansion exacerbate crisis, happen debt crisis latin america (de gregorio guidotti, 1995). 9 one example new households’ financial survey central bank chile, seek strengthen analysis sector become ever important financial system. 10 evidence provide eichengreen o’rourke (2009) show first month current crisis pretty similar great depression, although recent month seem diverge, current episode begin show sign recovery great depression fall continued. 11 for 1930s, data come maddison (2009), current growth projection come consensus forecast investment banks. bi review 112/2009 5 -10%. we see today, inflation fall dramatically around world, remain far level see great depression. another aspect make big difference performance emerge economies. latin america, exclude chile, post average annual fall 4.2% 1930 1932, chile, crisis compound downfall nitrate industry, fell average 17.6%. for three-year period 2009-2011, private forecast indicate latin america grow average 1.2%, chile grow 2.1%. these projections, definitive figures, data release far year indicate effect crisis, although far negligible, much mild 1930s. this encourage fact. usually, whenever develop country go recession, effect amplify region. that case time; contrary, region today outperform develop economies. that current crisis turn great depression prof lesson learned. economy much stronger, also policy apply go proper direction mitigate tremendous financial shock last year. for one thing, task stabilize financial system assume decisively, prevent collapse. uncertainty remain, focus le dramatic end last year. also, lesson friedman schwartz (1963) monetary policy role central bank lender last resort, keynes (1935) role expansionary policies, bernanke (1983) role financial channel transmission policy actions, essential policy decision adopt since onset current crisis. many subsequent study shed additional light characteristic good policy provide base aggressive monetary fiscal policy apply around world, also illustrate way stimulus must withdrawn. finally, use gold standard account largely depth great depression (bernanke james, 1991; eichengreen, 1992). moreover, midst crisis 1931, u.s. raise interest rate defend dollar parity, aggravate crisis cause deflationary pressures. in latin america, thank lesson learn mistake past, understand macroeconomic stability, monetary fiscal terms, foreign exchange flexibility, well regulate financial system crucial mitigate effect external scenario adverse one. this reflect major progress economic policy, benefit important practical lesson advance research follow debt crisis. final remark there plenty time continue analyze profession warn magnitude crisis. a i discuss here, multifaceted issue must consider crisis predictability, management, role research provide rigorous framework – albeit incomplete one – analyze reality. nonetheless, macroeconomic theory fail overstatement. in particular, comparatively good performance emerge economy – exception case eastern europe remind u mistake past – demonstrate economic research teach u something. in particular, majority macroeconomic policy seek replicate past mistakes. now necessary analyze carefully role financial markets, virtue and, utmost importance, vulnerabilities. this crisis admonishment professional arrogance. we must recognize real world much complex model explain. this so-called 6 bi review 112/2009 professional orthodoxy discredited. however, must also avoid arrogance come ignorance, lead abandon learn fundamental good macroeconomic policies. reference berg, a., e. borensztein c. pattillo (2004), “assessing early warn systems,” imf work paper, 04/52. bernanke, b.

bocconi university. found 1902, bocconi first italian university offer degree economics. a one old economics department europe, bocconi lead way intellectual think economic progress innovation. it therefore seem perfect place host today’s conference bank business model discus future. give bad financial storm since 1930s gradually calm down, topic choose conference apt. bank take centre stage ongoing financial economic crisis, definitive resolution crisis essentially hinge bank regain financial health public confidence basis sustainable welfare-enhancing business models. however, bank equally affect crisis, equally responsible it. the main player mostly large international investment bank bank move away traditional retail bank activities. this movement towards presumably “modern” business model rely principally origination, distribution trade often complex securities, fee-income generate activities, well fund structure dependent wholesale markets. many factor contribute current financial crisis, namely excessive risk-taking, emergence shadow bank system, exponential growth innovative financial products, inadequate corporate governance incentive structure banks, lack proper regulation environment abundant liquidity low interest rates. but speech today go focus excessive risk-taking banks’ creation innovative financial products, lead transformation business models. to large extent, shift towards new business model base innovation structure credit market, particularly respect securitisation instruments, credit default swaps, asset-backed security collateral debt obligations. a common feature financial innovation transform, transfer trade credit risk. one main consequence use instrument large amount credit previously predominantly illiquid (such bank loans) become liquid could potentially trade financial markets. however, must blame credit risk transfer instrument vehicle per se . i confident instrument generate real economic value survive crisis, albeit

financial stability, financial innovation generally tend make financial system efficient without necessarily increase fragility. 1 i would like thank florian heider, manfred kremer david marqués ibañez valuable input. bi review 112/2009 1 at point, worth ask main bank business model could look like policy-maker’s perspective, take account implication financial efficiency stability. i limit remainder speech main point argument also point early lesson learn crisis. what special business banking? i start standard definition “bank”, recall main function bank suppose perform explain function important special warrant relatively close public intervention oversight. a bank “an institution whose current operation consist grant loan receive deposit public”.2 this definition refer core activity commercial banks, namely simultaneous acceptance deposit offer loans, distinguish financial intermediaries. however, bank typically conduct broad range activities, subsume follow three functions:3 • first, bank provide public liquidity (money) payment service deposit-taking business. • second, bank transform asset term denomination, quality maturity, well manage associate risks. • third, bank process information monitor borrower use specialise technologies. in doing, often establish long-term relationship clients, may mitigate negative impact adverse selection moral hazard resource allocation process. change bank business model before i turn question traditional bank model change past years, i go take brief look financial market history. glass-steagall: investment bank versus commercial bank look specifically history financial market unite states, bad bank practice public outcry stock market crash 1929 bring glass-steagall act 1933. interestingly, act follow enquiry whether commercial bank sell unsound security customers, thus convert potential bad loan security issues. the act therefore prohibit commercial bank underwriting, hold deal corporate securities, either directly security affiliates.4 in view, concern prompt act similar currently voice – particularly relation concern banks’ business model sale unsound security unsuspecting investors. the act global impact competitive conditions. for instance, large presence major u investment bank europe trace back implementation act, separate investment bank commercial banks. the act also impact

hence importance financial stability – commercial bank regulate accordingly. in contrast, investment bank expect le need close monitor regulation, see le important financial stability perspective. the current crisis vividly illustrate action commercial bank investment banks, also financial players, major impact part financial system economy large. i like focus two major factor change way bank business. first, i discus change banks’ business model relate source revenue. and, second, i focus change fund bank talk unintended consequence expansion securitisation activities. diversification source revenue with regard change source banks’ revenue, repeal glass-steagall act 1999 prime example deregulation relation banks’ business models. if compare regulation place today 20 year ago, see unprecedented process deregulation across region financial sectors. one consequence deregulation global trend towards diversification banks’ income sources, i.e. towards high brokerage fee commission – generally call “non-interest income”. the increase non-interest income provide bank additional source revenue therefore provide diversification overall income. at time, non-interest income usually much volatile source revenue interest rate income. investment banks, example, high dependence non-interest income. typically, profitable traditional commercial banks, also much leverage earn volatile (see chart 1). the volatility earnings, combine close tie investment bank financial players, call high level monitor systemically important players.5 5 in addition, recent evidence suggest indeed conflict interest bank anticipate public. investment bank affiliate financial conglomerate take position takeover target conglomerate announce bid. moreover, appear inside trade profitable, m&a deal wealth-creating. see a. bodnaruk, m. massa a. simonov (2009), “investment bank insider market corporate control”, review financial studies, forthcoming. bi review 112/2009 3 chart 1: bank profit volatility earn (median value return equity standard deviation 2000 2007) source: bankscope. in addition, one problem relate banks’ risk management apply mostly investment banks, also large financial institutions: risk management technique neglect correlation risk across securities, banks, also rat agencies, sufficiently internalise grow systemic, market liquidity risks. moreover, bank underestimate tail risk. the exist risk-management technique work well predict small day-to-day loss middle distribution fail anticipate severe loss much rarer. but clearly, exactly severe loss matter most. this mispricing risk relate deficiency risk management techniques, also, perhaps importantly, exist incentive bank system orient towards short term profitability banks. diversification source fund turn second factor, change banks’ fund sources: time change source banks’ revenue, wide change relate banks’ liability side balance sheet.6 in particular, refer shift banks’ business model away traditional model financing. in traditional model, heavy reliance retail deposits, replace increase reliance market-based source funding. the significant recourse specific fund instruments, mortgage bond securitisation, make bank increasingly dependent capital markets, time, course, le dependent deposits, expand loan base. this evident upward trend total asset deposit ratio large euro area bank

securitisation. securitisation activity indeed increase substantially year prior financial crisis (see chart 3). a know, securitisation financial innovation credit market generate significant changes, particularly financial structure banks, and, generally, financial market activity euro area. it become clear change banks’ business model “originate hold” bi review 112/2009 5 “originate, repackage sell” also significant implication financial stability. securitisation mean disperse credit risk good able will bear it. but, current crisis shown, work envisaged. this stem fact instrument use hedge risk also potential undermine financial stability – facilitate leverage risk, example. moreover, major flaw actual interaction among different player involve securitisation process. these include misalign incentive along securitisation chain, lack transparency regard underlie risk securitisation business, poor management risks. there dramatic increase complexity securitised product prior crisis, owe largely misalign incentive investors’ search yield, which, particular, make valuation risk assessment product extremely complex difficult. chart 3: securitisation issuance europe (in eur

market transparent, valuation risk assessment easier. cover bond also much strict regulatory framework. overall, problem securitisation market relate opacity misalign incentives, – look ahead – need address market participant regulator order restore securitisation market health. money market problem symptom have go major factor affect condition bank current crisis, i conclude recall exceptional speed crisis hit financial sector, also unprecedented size impact. consider, example, interbank markets. in normal times, interbank market among liquid financial sector. in 2006 daily turnover euro

financial crisis the recent financial crisis illustrate banks’ business model incentive major impact financial stability. in regard, recent international evidence suggest bank strategy rely primarily

strategy prior crisis, also risky strategy. their research find also suggest may additional policy tool could contribute contain future threat financial stability. in particular, bank country strict capital requirement independent bank supervisor seem perform significantly good crisis. also, bank tier i capital country restriction banks’ activity also do relatively well recent quarters.12the way forward what learn sustainable bank business model event past two years? first, important structure banks’ liability appropriate structure asset hold. bank excessively leverage relative risk taking. second, still know little different bank hold different level equity.13 we know, however, that, ultimately, equity robust buff realise losses. although hold equity costly, bank capital regulation also take account macroeconomic implication bank capital requirements. third, bank large extent ignore role deposit stable source funding. more asset fund non-deposit liabilities. bank turn excessively wholesale market order finance growth. rely wholesale market fund liquidity prove exceedingly precarious. fourth, owe potential benefits, innovation financial sector continue. however, serious evaluation possible implication financial innovation financial stability warranted. in case securitisation, sharp reduction level complexity leverage instrument issue expected, high level transparency align incentive crucial efficient securitisation market. fifth, i would like say word macro-prudential aspect financial stability. it important develop proper framework macro-prudential supervision banks, also financial institutions, market instrument systemic nature, irrespective whether regulate not. for that, need deep understand major trend financial sector, include new business models,

lesson learn financial crisis. with view strengthen resilience bank sector, regulatory reform agenda launch agree internationally will: • introduce leverage ratio, measure curb banks’ excessive

economic upturn use downturns, well promote forward-looking provisions; • establish minimum global standard fund liquidity include stress liquidity coverage ratio requirement longer-term structural liquidity ratio. these measure introduce end year, phase financial condition improve economic recovery assured. measure address misalignment lack transparency incentive securitisation market include strengthen capital requirement exposures, well introduce risk management practice disclosures. these measure already agree implement course 2010. a improve economic condition may lead resumption securitisation activity, measure take ensure relaunched sound sustainable basis. finally, work way ensure systemically important institutions, market instrument subject adequate regulation oversight. a first step, report issue november imf, fsb bi provide guidance identify systemically important institutions, market instruments. i start speech briefly describe bank special. the last two year painfully stress special important really are. when financial system fails, whole economic system affected. the financial sector undergo unprecedented wave innovation, change, consolidation crisis. we good understand business model may sustainable, still many open questions. for example, future capital requirement provide bank good loss bear capability economic system le procyclicality? how future compensation corporate governance principle support long term value creation banks? and, risk management practise risk price model good represent possible gain losses? overall, seem simple answer banks’ best practise business model. therefore, need contribution academic community future design banks’ business model policy support them. i – course - already look forward conference provide answer important question stake. bi review 112/2009 9 mallam sanusi lamido sanusi: development bank system nigeria address mr mallam sanusi lamido sanusi, governor central bank nigeria, lagos, 14

today, i intend tell little early experience explain i view monetary policy consideration relevant current economic situation. i also say something view monetary policy period ahead extent need take factor inflation account. monetary policy practice the inflation target lie centre riksbank's monetary policy. the state target annual change consumer price index (cpi) 2 per cent. a far target monetary policy concern difference theory practice. both theory practice show low stable inflation create favourable condition development economy long term. there also broad agreement academic central bank possibility limitation monetary policy. we know monetary policy influence average level inflation much vary time. monetary policy not, hand, significantly affect average level real quantity production, employment unemployment. the average level quantity determine factors, demography, competition tax policies, research development education training. there therefore good reason monetary policy focus inflation inflation target. flexible inflation target policy a strict interpretation possibility monetary policy easily perceive central bank affect inflation. however, although monetary policy affect average level real factors, mean ineffectual stabilise bi review 111/2009 1 fluctuation factors. i mean monetary policy contribute stabilisation resource utilisation normal level. in practice, central bank inflation target conduct call flexible inflation targeting. this flexibility mean – alongside long-term inflation target – central bank also strive ensure fluctuation inflation real economy keep reasonable level. strike right balance factor riksbank call well-balanced monetary policy. the flexibility inflation target become particularly important situation conflict arise objective reach inflation target objective stabilise real economy. in situations, inflation target call certain type monetary policy resource utilisation call another. one example situation prevail 2008, year i join executive board. energy food price increase dramatically. this push inflation unexpected levels. at time, economic activity appear decline – decline eventually become severe economic downturn. if, situation, interest rate substantially increase order rapidly bring inflation back target, economic situation could undermine even more. however, riksbank work flexible inflation target choose bring inflation back target quickly possible. this flexibility also give u scope stabilise fluctuation real economy. how long take return inflation target depends, among things, type shock occurred, size shock long expect affect economy. an almost obvious question exam paper macroeconomics i help set spring 2008 was: what monetary policy central bank conduct flexible inflation target expect pursue prevail condition why? full mark go answer something like: "such central bank expect make relatively moderate interest rate increase accept level inflation exceed target short term fall back target". this also large monetary policy conduct riksbank. however, difficult achieve right balance in theory, balance need achieve inflation target need stabilise real economy seem relatively simple, even conflict objective 2008. however, come conduct monetary policy practice, achieve right balance always easy. one problem i probably underestimate past simple unambiguous measure much economy's resource utilise consider normal level call resource utilisation. in theory relatively easy define so-called production gap. it often define difference actually produce could produce resource available use full. but i really think possible measure gap great degree precision. one problem difficult measure much could produce resource use full. this, sometimes call potential production, observe directly must estimated.1 at time, great deal uncertainty best way perform estimate. get idea resource utilisation thus require we, like forecasters, look many different type measure ass conclusion regard resource utilisation seem 1 for detail discussion potential production define measured, see palmqvist, s. (2007), ”flexible inflation target – central bank take real economy consideration?”, sverige riksbank economic review, no. 2, page 91-105, sverige riksbank. 2 bi review 111/2009 reasonable. develop analysis area important work underway riksbank. however, i think expect possible find measure reliable use mechanical way situation determine exactly monetary policy design also stabilise real economy. another practical problem forecaster difficult identify turn point economic activity. here rely different type indicator. we monitor, example, new orders, stock, purchase managers' index, confidence indicators, business tendency survey and, least, riksbank's company interviews. at present, confidence indicator particularly important. the downturn begin general crisis confidence affect financial sector publics' expectation concern development economy. it therefore reasonable believe turnaround require restoration confidence. however, difficult find exact stable link confidence indicator actual economic development. so, context scope different assessment come interpret economic situation consequence monetary policy. new difficult monetary policy consideration recently no long conflict objective when i take post member executive board, long really conflict uphold inflation target stabilise real economy. energy food price begin fall already summer 2008. the global financial crisis hit full force autumn 2008 contribute dramatic economic downturn sweden abroad. this reinforce rapid fall inflation. at monetary policy meet i participate spring summer easy make decision direction change repo rate. both inflation economic situation justify reduction interest rate repo rate indeed cut, first 0.5 per cent april all-time low 0.25 per cent july. any textbook macroeconomics would prescribe cut situation. however, monetary policy decision spring autumn still complicated. the difficult question, least point view, much repo rate reduced. because cut repo rate quickly substantially autumn 2008 early 2009, scope pursue traditional monetary begin shrink repo rate begin approach low limit. determine level repo rate's low limit also prove difficult. can repo rate cut way zero, even negative level? there clear answer questions. however, line majority executive board, assessment july repo rate cut beyond 0.25 per cent. the reason concern financial market would find difficult function normally low interest rate level could negative impact profitability banks. my view economic situation principle call even great cut. at time, i think risky reduce repo rate even really know financial market would function low interest rates. one note event cut repo rate 0.25 per cent carry without apparent problems. in perspective, fear i july would seem somewhat exaggerated. on hand, i believe worthwhile central bank act caution area previous experience draw on. this i feel justify reduce repo rate small stage already record-low level initial position. bi review 111/2009 3 measure interest rate close zero what central bank policy rate low level justify state real economy? many central bank struggle question crisis. one possibility allow policy rate remain low possible level long period would otherwise required. the effect decision also reinforce several ways. the central bank can, example, lend money bank fix interest rate maturity correspond period policy rate expect remain low level. this increase credibility forecast rate remain unchanged year ahead. it also push interest rate long maturities. we decide implement measures. since monetary policy meet february, forecast comprise low repo rate relatively long period time. at monetary policy meet july september 2009, also decide lend money bank one year fix interest rate. the riksbank's current monetary policy characterise highly expansionary. such policy may lead fear high level inflation future. personally, i think fear justified. the inflation target is, usual, focal point repo rate decisions. however, long target threaten contribute stable development production employment. this believe need keep repo rate exceptionally low level unusually long period time. it appear inflation major problem, various measure resource utilisation indicate remain low year ahead. monetary policy financial stability the financial crisis lead discussion whether monetary policy also take account sign development financial bubble aim counteract tendencies. this important discussion i others world central bank reason return to. one explicit task riksbank promote stability efficient payment system. the riksbank therefore, whatever circumstances, take measure stability system threatened. this task has, example, reason crisis measure riksbank take since autumn. however, need discus whether situation arise flexible inflation target conflict aim promote financial stability. if so, interest-rate policy modify appropriate use instrument to, example, counteract development financial bubbles? i ready answer question today. they partly relate question cause current financial crisis. ha monetary policy contribute crisis low interest rate cause lie entirely different factors, global imbalance and/or inadequate regulation supervision financial markets? the analysis cause crisis begun, still far soon draw clear conclusion contribution different factors. the current economic situation but prospect economy period ahead challenge face now? the financial crisis reinforce international economic downturn. it therefore natural expect recovery come situation international financial market normalised. stabilisation financial sector the situation financial market continue improve summer. this reflect fact risk premium interbank market, example ted basis spreads, fall level close apply outbreak 4 bi review 111/2009 financial crisis sweden abroad (see figure 1). the stock market also recover strongly. swedish company gradually find easy find fund international capital markets. but situation still strained. the interest rate offer swedish company high comparison interest rate government securities, credit spread still high. in addition, corporate demand export guarantee much high present case previously. this indicate fund situation company still strained. international economic activity show sign recovery since monetary policy meet july, sign emerge slowdown economic downturn abroad. in countries, even sign recovery. this seen, example, look world trade, begin stabilise follow collapse start year (see figure 2). both outcome indicator future economic growth stabilise show upturn regions. in asia, particular, growth clearly pick second quarter year (see figure 3). this domestic demand china increased, turn stimulate export asian countries. nevertheless, although positive sign recovery could already see july strengthened, still uncertainty future developments. in usa, suffer prolong recession since 1940s, sign light end tunnel. the house market improve statistic indicate fall house price come halt (see figure 4). after four quarter fall gdp, growth third quarter expect positive (see figure 5). the labour market continue weaken, however, unemployment reach almost 10 per cent, unusually high figure usa. development euro area somewhat good assessment early july. it appear fall gdp come halt. several major economy even report positive gdp growth. however, situation labour market deteriorate further. unemployment almost level usa. the fall sweden's gdp slow development small open economy like sweden highly dependent development economic activity abroad sweden also hit hard severe international downturn. gdp fall five quarter row. however, since begin second quarter year fall slow gdp even increase somewhat first second quarter (see figure 6). furthermore, indicator development third quarter, purchase managers’ index economic tendency survey, point recovery come slightly sooner previously believed. we therefore revise forecast growth 2009 upwards slightly. but recovery begin low level. sweden’s gdp expect fall 4.9 per cent year compare last year. this large decline swedish gdp individual year since 1940. the labour market still show weak development despite slightly bright picture economic growth, situation labour market expect gloomy time come (see figure 7). this labour market improve long company unutilised resource still need reduce workforces. unemployment therefore expect increase year next year. our assessment unemployment increase 2011. bi review 111/2009 5 inflation currently low inflation fall rapidly since end last year believe negative large part year. the fact inflation, measure term consumer price index, cpi, fall quickly primarily due fall energy price mortgage costs. inflation measure term cpif, mortgage rate keep constant, stable expect 2 per cent forecast period (see figure 8). my view situation at late monetary policy meeting, i advocate unchanged repo rate repo rate forecast. this also decision make majority. a july, also decide offer monetary policy counterparties loan fix interest rate one year. a i mention earlier, strengthen expectation repo rate remain decide level throughout maturity loan also contribute low interest rate household company ways. many analyst felt decision leave repo rate unchanged self-evident. the decision retain repo rate path adopt july perhaps unexpected. i explain reason lead conclusion constitute well-balanced monetary policy. there several factor take account decision. perhaps obvious factor change economic prospects. a i mention earlier, forecast gdp growth sweden revise upwards somewhat. irrespective indicator look at, resource utilisation still low sweden abroad development employment expect weak throughout next year. there also great uncertainty strong stable recovery be. it positive clear improvement situation financial markets. this reduce risk serious setback. on hand, situation market completely normalised. central bank around world continue use various measure help bank find funding. the extensive fiscal policy stimulation measure implement major economy likelihood help dampen fall gdp. but, also lead increase national debts. this create anxiety among household thus entail risk recovery stop short. nevertheless, situation look bright today couple month ago. this justify somewhat tight monetary policy regard well-balanced monetary policy july. however, also factor opposite effect thus represent argument expansionary monetary policy. the development krona strong expected. just difficult explain early weaken krona term development swedish economy, difficult explain recent appreciation krona. the best explanation might question adjustment towards normal level exchange rate strongly deviate long-term reasonable rate. however, strengthen krona weaken inflation. a inflation expect slightly target come year – i refer inflation adjust effect interest rate change house cost – something could argument expansionary monetary policy. the bright economic prospect thus point towards tight monetary policy, strong krona point towards expansionary monetary policy. i believe uncertainty development krona period ahead development economic activity. i therefore attach relatively little importance krona assess would well-balanced monetary policy. 6 bi review 111/2009 this mean i instead place great importance improve economic prospects. however, despite fact prospect seem little brighter, still case resource utilisation expect significantly normal next years. this mean still need monetary policy stimulation stabilise real economy. nor appear stimulation conflict inflation target. inflation measure term cpif expect slightly target 2 per cent next years. all all, therefore nothing moment call tighten monetary policy fast rate assessment july. nor i see, economic activity improved, weighty reason make monetary policy expansionary reduce repo rate even further. the adopt line, repo rate 0.25 per cent expect remain unchanged several quarters, represent expansionary monetary policy. my view policy change inflation and/or economic situation change considerably compare current forecasts. conclude remark i share experience early month member executive board riksbank. i realise already i accept job would easy. however, fact monetary policy decision-making straightforward appear theory serf make job even exciting. a well-balanced monetary policy presuppose arrive reasonable balance achieve inflation target stabilise real economy. a reasonable balance require turn effectively measure much inflation deviate target resource utilisation relate normal level. we fairly good measure inflation, although problem recently main measure inflation, cpi, highly affect repo rate decision effect house costs. consequently, recent monetary policy meet almost exclusively focus alternative measure house cost excluded. the problem concern measure resource utilisation relate normal level are, however, greater. it difficult enough measure resource utilisation, even difficult measure normal level is. instead weigh together different measure indicator reasonable way. this course provide great scope wide range assessments. the financial crisis has, least, also raise question extent monetary policy take financial stability account. this important question analyse further. let conclude say appear fiscal policy monetary policy stimulation measure implement throughout world begin desire effects. the situation financial sector improve economic recovery discernable. but still uncertain whether recovery stable whether risk come halt soon fiscal policy monetary policy stimulation measure phase out. decide appropriate time begin phase-out extensive monetary policy stimulation measure major challenge. if phase-out begin early risk recovery come halt. if wait long, risk need increase repo rate quickly order meet inflation target. this balance much easy achieve theory practice! however, i explain today, assessment late monetary policy meet still necessary keep repo rate low level long time come.

goeltom: opportunity indonesian investment sharia finance – experience challenge keynote speech prof dr miranda s goeltom, act governor bank indonesia, international seminar islamic finance bank “opportunities indonesian investment sharia finance – experience challenges”, new york, 17 july 2009. * * * distinguish speaker participants, lady gentlemen, may i ask join thank god beneficent merciful his unbounded grace enable u gather today important occasion, international seminar islamic finance banking, entitle “opportunities indonesian investment sharia financing: experience challenges”. i thrill see many distinguish speaker participants, prepare contribute insightful experience expertise. in opinion, seminar paramount importance midst effort discus alternative solution avoid repeat current economic global financial crises. in deep global crisis must seek way survive and, subsequently, return previously hard-earned growth stability. this precisely time collective action require most, order u survive global financial tsunami emerge side strong wiser. give depth systemic nature crisis, wait-and-see approach simply hop recovery take place utterly unacceptable. the crisis current global financial system lady gentlemen, a number analysis argue ongoing global financial crisis inseparable effect global financial system. in past decade, financial product become diverse, advance complex. this attributable effect innovative development term information technology, deregulation support financial system favorable global macroeconomic environment, include low real interest rate. bi data show global financial asset stock increase sharply 100% global gdp 1980 300% 2005. this development accompany expansive growth amount scope derivative financial instruments. the position interest rate swap derivative reach usd600 trillion end 2007 (11 time annual global gdp) compare usd75 trillion 1997 (2.5 time global gdp). the position credit default swap (cds) also reach five time global corporate bond 2007, different picture compare condition 2004, share cd 85% corporate bonds. on hand, however, development also carry fatal side effects. financial instrument become independent underlie transaction serve foundation. risk assessment type asset own also become difficult complex. we witness phenomenon escalate activity global financial market turn permanent. bi review 109/2009 1 a noticed, bubble burst bring terrible impact global economy since mid 2007. the commonly use adjective describe current financial crisis “unprecedented”. it unprecedented term speed event unfold trigger series domino effects; scale impact become global; truly unprecedented term panoply unconventional measure take authority around world. this clear see policy response take overcome crisis, incredibly complex certainly costly. the imf project global economic growth would contract 3.2% 2008 -1.3% 2009, whereas economic growth develop country expect even worse, shrink -3.8%. imf also predict total loss due current global financial crisis top us$4 trillion, two-thirds stem bank sector. the crisis sharia financial system lady gentlemen, the lesson glean crisis sound resilient economy base speculative activity. furthermore, financial sector activity must found business activity produce real benefit public. this condition, opinion, imply behavior current financial system need reset; go back basic (khittah) intermediary institution distribute fund surplus unit deficit units. one alternative potential bolster back-to-basics principle would expand role sharia financial system. this relate structural advantage sharia economic system, permit speculative transaction product without real underlie transactions. a traditional sharia financial system focus conservative product avoid exposure high-risk financial instruments. consequently, dependence financial instrument comparatively low investment financial instrument must identify clearly accurately. the key characteristic sharia finance system also align role bank consistent primary function, namely collect fund owner distribute borrowers. to precise, main function bank facilitate finance activity associate supply good service people; specifically “real” activities. therefore, finance activity sharia bank closely link real sector development. moreover, speculation gambling, main culprit behind on-going crisis, tolerated. thus, design, islamic financial system instill great stability economy. and, implement correctly, islamic financial system provide optimal risk management system. sharia financial system performance lady gentlemen, the potential role sharia financial institution economy discuss numerous occasions. accord the banker magazine 2007, sharia-compliant asset worldwide grow almost 30% per annum recent years. such growth outstrip business segment financial services. in 2008, sharia financial asset worldwide reach $643 billion expect

change? introductory statement professor dr franz-christoph zeitler, vice-president deutsche bundesbank, conference "the future bank regulation", organise imperial college london deutsche bundesbank, frankfurt main, 24 september 2009. * * * i roughly speaking, crisis split three phases: • follow problem u subprime mortgage market, player lose market confidence many securitisations refinancing, primarily affect money markets. • the crisis peak lehman insolvency 15 september 2008. the crisis confidence engulf money, capital credit market throughout world make necessary central bank government launch massive support measure worldwide safeguard liquidity supply ensure solvency. • the financial crisis spread real economy towards end 2008. since then, government combat massive fiscal stimulus measures. ii the crisis reveal series weakness financial system. a lot recommendation proposal individual measure currently put forward discuss issues, always appear completely devoid institutional self-interest. all proposal therefore measure yardstick whether strengthen sustainability international financial system. sustainability, term originally coin ecology, define development seek short-term success detriment long-term success. if translate financial industry, find number practice comply principle: • sustainability questionable, example, case business model base short-term, variable-rate loan subprime borrowers, immediately securitised tranched. the business model base hope value collateral would increase steadily market liquidity securitisations would prove inexhaustible. • moreover, quantitative risk measurement methods, value-at-risk expected-shortfall models, could figuratively speak describe “looking rear-view mirror” whose use increased, prove necessary inadequate supplement forward-looking instrument stress test scenario analyses, also take account change third party behaviour. • in retrospect, total – time blind – faith rat agency assessment cannot justify massive downgrade entire vintage securitisations demonstrate instability rat across cycle highlight inadequate scrutiny asset underlie securitisation products. • sustainability also question accounting, base large extent current market value: firstly, valuation allow shoot good times, bi review 116/2009 1 nosedive downturn. it well-known fact hangover day bad wild party even before. and secondly, compass market value fail market function disrupted. iii likewise, would sustainable regulator respond numerous individual problem intervene equally large number individual measures. rather, strengthen international cooperation emerge crisis opportunity devise close coherent regulatory framework set right incentives. • the scope supervision set right incentives; here, g20 make important policy decision back autumn last year: financial market player – include near bank shadow bank – must regulated;1 • the issue “incentives” also comprise past practice arbitrage bank book trade book, new basel regulation aim avoid. • ultimately, include review rule allow crisis emerge; eg legal construction non-recourse mortgage loans, use country instrumental promote borrowers’ willingness take subprime loans; rule need review capital requirement liquidity facility favourable capital requirement securitisation tranches; major progress already make field regard great transparency risk-oriented capital charges. however, practice measure leverage ratio solely on-balance-sheet item – happen jurisdiction – also create incentive establish off-balance sheet special purpose vehicles. iv in order avoid get mire detail, need keep eye big picture term effect many proposal new rules. i would like illustrate example relate regulatory capital; whole range measure currently discussed: • definition regulatory capital, • general increase minimum capital requirements, • capital add-on large institutions, • introduction anticyclical capital buffer, • introduction leverage ratio • great capital back certain complex securitisation position trade book (largely completed). the big picture keep mind evaluate impact measure capital situation institutions; final decision taken, in-depth impact 1 guide principle replacement ia 39; nr. 10: to delink partially valuation process certain aspect income profit recognition. 2 bi review 116/2009 study therefore necessary (and actually plan accord current documents) ass individual proposals’ interdependence. even origin crisis (commercial paper market) climax (lehman) represent liquidity crisis, capital debate essentially right. for strengthen institutions’ capital base make financial system robust. high capital requirement make difficult build excessive balance sheet leverage increase caution towards risky business models, owners' liability gain great weight. therefore, debate represent important step towards prevent next crisis. however, end shorten current crisis. although encourage sign recovery emerging, crisis yet take year come back previous level output. rise unemployment, scarcity private capital pressure deleverage exert market rat agency dampen business earn possibilities. at time, deteriorate creditworthiness many borrower – euphemistically call rat migration – hurt banks’ ability lend. in term securitisations, effect aggravate “cliff effects” basel framework (sudden increase capital requirement trigger rat fall certain threshold). the grow use fair value accounting, strong rat migration cliff effect basel framework render financial system extent procyclical. regulator wish avoid knock-on effect banks’ ability lend therefore implement capital measure crisis safely resolved. v the crisis provide historic opportunity anchor principle social market economy internationally; provide global “guard rails” markets' innovation dynamism ensure system stability shock-absorb destructive excesses. the key objective establish guard rail • strengthen sustainability, • steer incentives, • avoid procyclicity. for financial sector regulator supervisors, principle encourage reversion role service industry. on one hand, supervision intend protect creditors, hand, however – come standard regulation – also serf real economy indirectly create framework allow financial industry fulfil role intermediary. bi review 116/2009 3 axel a weber: the future bank regulation dinner speech professor axel a weber, president deutsche bundesbank, conference "the future bank regulation" organise imperial college london deutsche bundesbank, frankfurt main, 24 september 2009. * * * 1 introduction lady gentlemen, i would like extend warm welcome conference dinner conclude first day scholarly exchange future bank regulation. in light financial crisis, subject deal major priority and, agenda shows, broad topic term issue covers. under discussion question effect bank regulation well institutional aspect bank regulation organised. above all, keep mind bank regulation reflect state development financial markets, imply expose constant change. this revealed, least, history bank regulation, i would like go briefly turn prevail deficiency bank regulation main challenge strengthen financial stability. 2 a brief history bank regulation safeguard financial stability – prerequisite macroeconomic growth prosperity – main driver behind bank regulation. consequently, call good bank regulation typically emerge wake financial instability. in post-war era, collapse bretton wood system early 1970s combine oil shock 1973 1974 raise first severe concern global financial stability. this prompt central bank governor g10 establish basel committee bank supervision 1974, eventually lead creation capital adequacy standard basel i basel ii. the initial task basel committee, however, harmonise international bank supervision, rather promote education, information share research field. the need convergence supervisory standards, namely capital measure capital standards, emerge result debt crisis erupt 1982. in particular, fiscal burden cause recapitalisation international bank imf support economy severely affect debt crisis lead call good bank regulation convergence international standards. in 1988, basel committee publish basel capital accord agree members. the two aim 1988 accord international financial supervision ever since present day: first, strengthen stability international bank system, and, second, eliminate mitigate distortion international competition among bank due difference national regulation. undoubtedly, main achievement first basel capital accord represent significant step towards international harmonisation bank regulation – late apply 100 country – that, first time, put focus relationship capital bank hold weight risk bank take. after implementation, long basel i come increase criticism. first, adequately cover risk bank exposed. second, risk weight present crude form inadequate reflection actual underlie risks. despite early warn signs, long road lead implementation basel ii. in interim, financial turbulence, namely mexican crisis bi review 115/2009 1 (1994-95) asian crisis (1997-98) heighten awareness among g10 country need great international cooperation financial market oversight. a consequence, financial stability forum found 1999 first work group entrust draw appropriate measure financial regulation. out process basel ii framework three pillar aware bear finally publish june 2004. basel ii schedule implementation end 2006. however, owe complexity – especially regard different approach assess minimum capital requirement – timetable allow fairly long transition period change supervisory regime. a result, basel ii yet fully implement credit institution subprime crisis emerge summer 2007. in particular, many bank – include eu one – apply new basel ii capital rule first time 2008. consequently, still restrict knowledge, base real data, basel ii work practice. and, notably, cannot blame basel ii recent financial crisis. nevertheless, financial crisis highlight deficiency financial regulation within beyond supervisory framework basel ii address base thorough analysis. 3 challenge strengthen financial stability 3.1 bank regulation the search underlie cause financial crisis intense. although definitive assessment still outstanding, widely agree seed crisis sow whole range development micro macro economic levels. for reason, address identify deficiency bank regulation supervisory process build block, albeit important one, enhance resilience global financial system. the prominent shortcoming reveal financial crisis fall within scope credit risk transfer expansion “originate distribute” business model accompany it. these deficiency concern insufficient capital back securitisations well inadequate risk management within financial institution lack transparency whole transfer process. consequently, necessary modification affect three pillar basel ii. the basel committee bank supervision respond promptly light insights, many reform already way. more specifically, capital requirement securitisations already raise strict disclosure requirement published. both measure implement 2010. moreover, basel committee strengthen guideline supervisory review process pillar two basel framework thus address key lesson crisis regard governance, management risk concentrations, stress testing, valuation practice exposure off-balance sheet activities. 3.2 procyclicality in addition measure already taken, number quite fundamental aspect basel ii framework subject review, also discussion conference. however, aspect concern hitherto uncharted field regulation. for reason, research need calibrate adequately. most notably, ongoing debate design adequate capital ratio order increase banks’ resilience ability absorb losses. this debate focusing, particular, institution build capital buff good economic time 2 bi review 115/2009 order cushion loss incur poor economic periods. closely connect endeavour debate possible procyclical effect basel ii. undisputably, basel ii act risk-sensitive manner therefore respond cyclically economic developments. however, deliberate important feature basel ii abandoned. the question is, however, whether basel ii act procyclically sense increase capital requirement time financial stress economic downturn result decrease bank lend threaten cause downward spiral credit crunch. in whole discussion procyclicality, advantage risk-sensitive capital requirement basel ii forgotten. this also one main find paper repullo suarez, present conference. assess procyclical effect basel ii dynamic equilibrium model, identify procyclical tendency risk-sensitive capital requirement basel ii. however, effect pay-off term long-term solvency bank system, much great basel i regime situation without capital requirements. although already exist ample research question, enough find yet appropriate evaluation whether basel ii act procyclically current crisis. this due fact new basel ii capital requirements, i mention earlier, come effect 2008 country that, consequently, little experience work practice. before take decision possible countermeasures, wait result basel work group currently examine potential procyclicality basel ii. nevertheless, possible option limit procyclical effect basel ii already compile research field way. this reasonable, least owe complexity issue enable u respond quickly necessary. possible option action tend towards refinement risk-sensitive irb approach basel ii. for example, capital requirement could adjust counter cyclically use credit growth indicator state economy. in time high credit growth surcharge capital requirement would prescribed. slightly different proposal repullo suarez make paper. they suggest calibration confidence level use basel formula calculate capital requirements. the propose calibration long-term risk constant confidence level relax situation basel ii tend act procyclically. what two mention approach common risk-sensitivity basel ii retain – prerequisite sensible adaption basel ii. 3.3 systemic risk control apart observe stress single financial institution market segments, financial crisis systemic global dimension highlight fact enough safeguard stability bank individually. if want address cause financial crisis full, supervision take one step further. in particular, systemic risk identify guard against. this raise new questions, systemic risk identify whether systemic relevance institution consider introduce capital surcharge systemically important banks. once issues, enter new field financial supervision, address researchers, different approach discussion. when try identify systemic risk, crucial point find adequate measure indicate economic stress. the paper huang, zhou zhu present conference contain approach measure systemic risk financial system use financial market data. compare indicator derive banks’ balance sheets, financial market data advantage available timely basis forward-looking. however, market-based risk measure much influence market movement balance sheet relate data. consequently suitability review often. bi review 115/2009 3 whereas huang, zhou zhu concentrate paper identification systemic risk potential downside risk group major financial institutions, adrian brunnermeier go one step paper present today. in approach systemic risk financial institution first identify directly incorporate regulatory framework. a justify intention regulate bank financial institution accord contribution systemic risk may be, even difficult design implement rule put practice. here, too, crucial identify appropriate indicator contribution systemic risk. the attendant risk – never eliminate entirely – regulation focus mechanical manner prominent risk indicator overlook other, le obvious ones. last least result necessity permanent revision regulatory framework allow supervisory authority respond flexibly market developments. this mean organisational aspect global financial regulation key role play strengthen systemic risk control safeguard global financial stability. in respect, initiative action take european global level enhance macroprudential supervision welcomed. in eu, plan foundation european systemic risk board (esrb) – consist representative central banks, supervisors, european commission among others – step right direction. however, esrb contribute effectively systemic risk control unpoliticised open analysis discussion ensured. therefore, central bank sufficient representation board give adequate weight. there two argument central bank play key role bank supervision. first, interdependence monetary policy financial system mean central bank strong natural interest financial stability. second, central bank country strongly involve bank supervision therefore bring expertise bear field. have say that, i want skim fact central banks, too, lesson draw financial crisis. one lesson certainly learn stability financial system essential condition right take account conduct monetary policy. in context, paper borio zhu present conference point important link monetary policy perception risk economic agent – something has, far, neglected. although research undoubtedly need speak risk-taking new channel monetary policy transmission process, major lesson monetary policy draw find paper. in particular, conclusion support call symmetric monetary policy try look financial cycle stabilise monetary policy. 4 conclusion lady gentleman safeguard financial stability paramount objective bank regulation. unfortunately, usually painful experience financial crisis catalyst implement necessary regulatory changes. from history least current financial crisis learn bank regulation expose permanent change, debate future bank regulation must go on. thank much attention. 4 bi

lehman brother mid-september, imminent collapse global financial system become distinct possibility. to avert outcome, bold unprecedented international policy response need promptly initiated. in u well europe, several world’s large financial institution require public capital injections, nondeposit liability guaranteed. a number country force expand deposit insurance programs. in cases, government central bank purchase guarantee bank assets.1 in spite rapid policy response aim stabilize global financial system, broad economy heavily hit. trade industrial production literally fell cliff. in fourth quarter 2008 first quarter 2009, global economic activity record weak performance decades. today, situation improve significantly. the unprecedented global policy response intend effect. the financial system show clear sign stabilization. incoming economic data last couple week suggest global economic activity improving. the economic rebound come month may even exceed expectations. at time, look beyond near term horizon, economy financial system continue face considerable uncertainty challenges. yet, certain part financial industry appear tempt go back business usual. industry statement comment make bank regulatory reform reflect trend. lady gentlemen, i deeply convince common responsibility duty let happen. let begin lay three hopefully compel reason must secure fundamental regulatory reform financial sector. the first reason much risk take financial sector ultimately reside taxpayers. the rescue significant part global financial system near-certain collapse public authority come substantial risk cost taxpayers. accord data collect bank international settlements, unite states, example, total potential cost various support measure take – capital injections, asset purchases, guarantee bank debt – amount 40 per cent gdp. for european countries, number even higher. while case government central bank able reduce exposures, sometimes even profit, involvement public sector remain important. the ultimate outcome involvement uncertain. moreover, consequence crisis term job 1 ben s. bernanke give thorough overview various measure take worldwide

again. this neither desirable realistic. a long want financial system perform meaningful useful function real economy, live financial cycles. moreover, current crisis clearly demonstrate limitation complex regulation models. even complex model never infallible. what limit likelihood fallout future crises. it would inexcusable mistake miss opportunity see fundamental regulatory reform. we address vulnerability root crisis likely root future. for purpose, need simple, effective measure implement rapidly crisis over. there intensive effort way increase resilience financial system. with support g20 leaders, financial stability board (fsb) initiate impressive number reform projects.3 good progress make many measures. in important areas, however, decision yet taken. in line proposal fsb, i believe need pursue dual-track approach reform global financial system, combine preventive measure measure facilitate orderly resolution large international bank event future crisis. an ounce

cepr/esi 13th annual conference “financial supervision uncertain world”, european bank center venice international university, venice, 25-26 september 2009. * * * introduction1the recent financial crisis produce broad consensus analysis policy action least three areas, namely need: i) gain good understand systemic risk; ii) strengthen macro-prudential aspect financial supervision; iii) deepen central banks’ involvement it. the establishment new body conduct macro-prudential supervision eu level – european systemic risk board (esrb) – one element comprehensive set initiative response field. my remark today focus future work body consist four parts. i’ll first consider origins, purpose structure esrb. in second place, i’ll discus concept systemic risk, monitor assess effectively. i’ll examine analytical tool systemic risk analysis eu look task could organise context esrb. in third part, i’ll cover ecb’s experience conduct financial stability surveillance euro area reflect vulnerability (and authorities) identify crisis. i’ll ask communication risk build insufficient prevent crisis. the fourth part if? what risk board exist early 2000s – could factor lead crisis identify averted? the answer point key advantage (and reason for) eu’s new macro-prudential function. 1. the setting-up european systemic risk board the idea establish body monitor ass systemic risk european level first moot late 1990s.2 it take decade financial crisis implement it. let recall milestone setting-up esrb institutional framework. follow recommendation de larosière report, february year, main feature institutional framework macro-prudential supervision define communication publish european commission 27 may well conclusion approve ecofin council 9 june european council 18 19 june. the european systemic risk board responsible macro-prudential oversight financial system within european union. it seek prevent mitigate systemic risk within financial system, avoid widespread financial distress, contribute smooth function internal market ensure sustainable contribution financial sector economic growth. it task identify ass risk systemic stability eu, issue risk warn risk appear significant 1 i would like thank l. cappiello, i. cabral, p. hartmann, f. recine contributions, d. clarke review document. i bear responsibility view express errors. 2 see, example, european shadow financial regulatory committee (1998), “emu, ecb financial supervision”, statement no. 2, 19 october, propose “european observatory systemic risk” initial step towards european-wide supervisory structure. aglietta scialom (2003), “the challenge european integration prudential policy”, fmg special paper, no. 152, october, provide elaborate discussion body. bi review 115/2009 1 and, necessary, give recommendation measure take contain risk follow implementation. the risk board 33 full members: 27 eu central bank governors, ecb president vice-president, commission member three chair new european supervisory authorities. to ensure close cooperation supervisors, representative one national supervisory authority eu country may attend meet esrb, vote rights. in addition, president economic financial committee (efc) participate, likewise vote rights. the ecb request ecofin provide necessary analytical, statistical, administrative logistical support, draw technical advice national central bank supervisors. this clear recognition important role central bank gain time monitor financial stability. the commission proposal specify detail new institutional arrangement concern establishment esrb involvement ecb. the ecb/eurosystem provide view formally consult accord treaty provisions. indeed, work need clarify optimise detail institutional framework esrb well new european supervisory authority micro-prudential supervision. sound institutional arrangement crucial pre-condition effectiveness supervisory reform general establishment risk board particular. in context, let mention two key element define forthcoming legislation. one arrangement exchange micro-prudential information among national supervisors, new european supervisory authority esrb (subject specific confidentiality agreements). in order esrb perform functions, power request information deem necessary (for example, exposure large complex financial institution structure products).3 the key element risk warn need translate appropriate supervisory action. an institutional mechanism exist ensure recommendation adopt esrb regard action address systemic risk identify macro-prudential assessment would follow competent national authorities. however, recommendation binding, institutional mechanism ensure implemented. and implemented, explanation provided. the esrb may decide make recommendation public. a recommendation aim address systemic risks, publication increase pressure member state implement recommendations. a peer review mechanism set up. in particular, ecb, behalf risk board, would closely monitor implementation recommendation member state national authorities. case non-compliance could report council and, relevant, european supervisory authority appropriate follow-up. 2. the concept systemic risk analysis esrb how well institutional framework enable esrb perform task depend understand systemic risk, amount relevant information disposal, analytical tool available ass risks, framework use distil 3 this was, example, clear conclusion de larosière report (2009), “high-level group financial supervision europe”, brussels. 2 bi review 115/2009 important result elements. let comment four aspect touch intend fulfil mandate support esrb. conceptual issue systemic risk systemic risk analysis nothing new central bank community, include ecb. one reflection fact series triennial central bank conference hold g10 committee global financial system mid-1990s early 2000s. even european monetary institute, forerunner ecb, contribute systemic risk work context, alongside u federal reserve, bank england, bank japan many central banks.4 for instance, outset, ecb draw research agenda financial stability systemic risk.5 in addition, 2004 start publish financial stability report (fsr) twice year. the main objective report help identify, early stage, potential vulnerability raise awareness among market participant view promote preventive remedial policies. each issue also contain several special feature offer wealth insight financial stability systemic risk. this background suggest ecb logical choice provider analytical support esrb, obscure two major challenge facing. first, phenomenon systemic risk extraordinarily complex. second, despite step report lively academic literature financial contagion last two decades, systemic risk analysis research far le advance monetary policy, example. there establish framework take “straight shelf”. have say that, let describe briefly concept systemic risk. systemic risk define g10 2001 “… risk event trigger loss economic value confidence in, attendant increase uncertainty about, substantial portion financial system serious enough quite probably significant adverse effect real economy.”6 in simple terms, risk failure distress significant part financial sector reduce availability credit, turn may adversely affect real economy. interestingly, notion systemic risk quite similar definition financial stability ecb us financial stability report, underline fact financial stability work always macro-prudential orientation. our work definition describe financial stability “condition financial system – comprise financial intermediaries, market market infrastructure – capable withstand shock unravel imbalances, thereby mitigate likelihood disruption financial intermediation process severe enough significantly impair allocation save profitable investment opportunities”. 4 see, example, de bandt hartmann (1998), “what systemic risk today?”, risk measurement systemic risk, proceed second joint central bank research conference, host bank japan, tokyo, 1997. 5 in regard ecb output (partly collaboration academic researcher central bank international organisations) include: fell schinasi,

bandt, hartmann peydró-alcalde (forthcoming), distinguish three broad interrelate way systemic risk materialise.7 the first one commonly call contagion closely study research literature. for example, supposedly idiosyncratic failure financial intermediary lead failure intermediaries. the second one emerge imbalance build time, credit boom concentration lend certain region sectors. these “bubbles” go profitably participant “ride” quite while. then relatively small event change expectation lead breakdown, simultaneously bring wide range intermediary markets.8 the third way systemic risk materialise relate economic downturn aggregate shock cause collapse wide range intermediary market simultaneously.9 other important element systemic risk include strong information intensity financial contract transactions, high degree connectedness financial intermediary market well strong reliance debt finance (leverage) maturity mismatch asset liabilities. these factor imply feedback mechanism amplify shock lead non-linearities financial system easily transmit real economy. systemic stability, absence systemic risk, see public good, thereby legitimise role government authority address it.10 like pollution, systemic risk involve externalities, sense financial intermediary manage risk consider impact risk system whole. the financial crisis contribute considerably good understand phenomenon systemic risk, also reflect aspect regulatory reforms. in particular, possibility align capital requirement measure firms’ systemic risk contribution contemplate regulators, e.g. basel committee bank supervision.11how could esrb structure supervisory work systemic risk? in broad terms, systemic risk analysis break two core components: i) surveillance, risk detection, ii) risk assessment, i address turn. risk detection financial stability surveillance concern risk identification. this kind surveillance mainly aim detect potential source risk, especially financial vulnerability – weakness which, unearthed, could lead disruption failure part financial 7 de bandt, hartmann peydró-alcalde (2009), “systemic risk banking: an update”, forthcoming ecb work paper series, berger, molyneux wilson

boom-bust cycle go back, example, work minsky (1977), “a theory systemic fragility”, altman sametz, financial crises, wiley. notably, observer bank international settlements, bill white claudio borio, warn 2007 imbalance build up. 9 for example, gorton (1988), “banking panic business cycles”, oxford economic papers, 40, observe u bank crisis national bank era could predict simple business cycle model. 10 see, example, acharya, pedersen, philippon richardson (2009), “regulating systemic risk”, acharya richardson (eds.), restore financial stability: how repair fail system, wiley; lo (2008), “hedge funds, systemic risk, financial crisis 2007-2008”, write testimony prepare u house representatives, committee oversight government reforms, hear hedge funds, november. 11 basel committee bank

risk discuss early – contagion, imbalance macro shocks. risk monitor identify source risk vulnerability come within financial system – i.e. stem financial institutions, market market infrastructure – also present macroeconomic environment non-financial relate events. these would include vulnerability result global imbalances, growth prospects, development house markets, creditworthiness borrowers, name few. the monitor involve process large amount (often disparate) information statistical nature base market sources. in addition, continuous market intelligence effort essential effective risk monitor early detection new financial instruments, practice business strategy could create vulnerability risk financial markets. in case risk board, market intelligence complement could call “institutional intelligence” “policy intelligence”, give qualitative information expert knowledge available central bank supervisory authority represent esrb. the board’s independent, impartial status could prove invaluable surveillance identification risk view material. risk monitor facilitate large set tools, include contemporaneous financial stability indicator forward-looking early warn indicator models. these tool need regularly revise update order capture innovation financial markets, fuel new product business models. macro-prudential indicator comprise vast set indicator – macroeconomic environment, financial markets, financial institution financial system infrastructures. more specifically, include macroeconomic aspects, finance conditions, monetary conditions, asset valuations, risk appetite, market liquidity, fund liquidity, credit risk, financial strength institutions, others. some indicator may contain information relevant early warn may draw attention rapidly increase exposure specific asset classes, broad-based increase financial leverage dynamic maturity profile financial institutions’ debt could indicate roll-over problems.12in esrb context, early warn indicator early warn signal (ews) model play important role risk surveillance phase lead-up risk warn phase. ew model design indicate financial system, market intermediary reach “danger zone”, usually point crisis ahead. in past, number forward-looking stability indicator use central banks, necessarily comprehensive framework develop ew model cover financial systems. one reason may old generation model perform well sample typically fail predict future crises. recent research suggest out-of-sample performance improved, particular respect credit cycle asset price bubbles.13 a caveat remain seem difficult improve prediction time credit boom asset-bubble bursting. 12 see, example, ecb financial stability review, december 2007, box 16 “a market-based indicator probability adverse systemic event involve large complex bank groups”; ecb financial stability review, june 2006, special feature b “assessing bank systemic risk extreme value analysis”. 13 see, example, alessi detken (2009), “‘real-time’ early warn indicator costly asset price boom/bust cycles: role global liquidity”, ecb wp series no 1039, march; borio drehmann (2009), “assessing risk bank crisis – revisited“, bi

evaluation relevance potential severity risk identify material surveillance phase. it therefore include quantitative evaluation likelihood potential risk scenario could actually materialise, well evaluation ability financial system absorb shock (for example, exist capital buff potential increase buff future profit retention). it also include cost estimate term failure institutions, cost derive

previously available, capture good large number adverse feedback loop play role amplify transmission instability financial system. these feedback loop could include contagion effect across banks, market liquidity fund liquidity problems.14 another difficulty model whether extend also capture feedback real economy outcome financial stability variables. the assessment task currently much le develop surveillance one. this involve considerable analytical sophistication, also mainly significant gap information financial intermediary inter-linkages various part financial system. view financial system network, information need key network nodes, well link nodes.15 the degree interconnectedness system may determine common exposure specific asset classes, specific sector economy, example, commercial property, specific region emerge europe, via grant loan security holdings. inter-linkages may also derive intra-bank intra-group exposure, well trade correlate position financial

external source funding, example. while unrealistic think would possible characterise degree interconnectedness financial system take account possible channel contagion, great deal invaluable information exist scatter form (at disposal supervisors, trade platform institution themselves). at present, information gap imply model technique risk assessment, include macro stress-testing

haldane (2009) “rethinking financial system network”, speech deliver financial student association, amsterdam, april. 6 bi review 115/2009 infer data base stock price credit default swap spread that, particular, might behave reliably time turmoil stress financial markets. it important note complexity systemic risk macro-prudential supervision state current research allow analytical tool kit limit one two major models. give framework macro-prudential analysis early stage development compare area economics, need look wide range model thereby include relevant risks, imbalance transmission channels. systemic risk analysis need support suite state-of-the-art analytical model tools, conceptual framework use them. the complex intertwine economic financial linkage call constant cross-check several indicator measures. in addition, evolve nature finance pace innovation also require set tool systemic risk detection assessment constantly adjust revised. many central banks, include ecb, past develop model tool order support regular financial stability analysis reports. the experience crisis decision establish macro-prudential stability function europe suggest that, even build exist structures, significant effort call order extend improve model tools. while would desirable risk assessment exercise increasingly quantitative, never become mechanistic fully model-based. expert judgement qualitative assessment always crucial understand message come various analytical tools, also take account overall intelligence efforts. comprehensive information base irrespective level sophistication, model need feed appropriate data order produce result that, addition analytical interest, support policy messages. a comprehensive information base also key risk surveillance phase precede actual risk assessment. this establishment wide radar screen support rigorous monitor possible critical information available. the current crisis convincingly show significant part credit intermediation channel outside bank sector regulate financial sector. the non-regulated “shadow” bank system almost totally surveillance radar screen. not enough know special investment vehicles, conduits, securitisation market instruments, financial intermediation take place outside traditional bank system. moreover, little know direct indirect exposure shadow bank system regulate one, turn substantial. information non-banking institutions, potentially systemic importance, hedge funds, scattered, quality-checked typically provide voluntary basis. a tendency create bias towards best performer result. even bank sector, data abundant – and, what’s more, substantial expertise conduct risk assessment – information available body entrust financial stability function without supervisory mandate far satisfactory. the information degree interconnectedness i previously mention critical, even identify key node financial system network would need closely monitored. so far, case ecb, systemic risk analysis conduct solely basis publicly available information, mostly gather individual financial reporting. the failure lehman brother year ago illustrate well relevance inter-linkages financial institutions. they may matter size balance sheets. and linkage impaired, affect function entire financial system. in fact, crisis increase amount overall risk economy perceive exist, little certainty risk lay. few bi review 115/2009 7 suspect vast majority would hold directly indirectly key node financial system network. the spectacular growth securitisation credit risk transfer market year crisis increase discussion potential vulnerabilities, particular ultimate holder risk originate bank system, capacity withstand shocks. these risk transfer originator various investor outside bank sector, institutional investor hedge funds, also within bank sector itself. in fact, weakness so-called originate-to-distribute model follow large banks, fragility fund special investment vehicle conduit result risk backfire end consolidate banks’ balance sheets. the eruption turmoil leave bank sit unwanted risks, leverage loan relate leveraged-buy-out transactions, (often refer warehouse risk financial jargon), intend sell market. likewise, structure collateralised debt obligation (cdos), extremely profitable business bank year summer 2007, bank system end accumulate considerable proportion cdo tranches. a crisis broke, tranche rapidly become significant fraction banks’ impair so-called toxic assets. risk warn let’s get back european systemic risk board. in addition risk surveillance risk assessment, esrb entrust third task – issue risk warn policy recommendations. this somewhat new central bank community. the issuance risk warnings, context safeguard financial stability – analysis centre downside risk thus highly improbable event – differ substantially type analysis focus central, probable, baseline scenario (such one support monetary policy). the translation systemic risk assessment proposal concrete policy action – prudential supervisory nature – also, large extent, new central bank community. 3. what go wrong? confront question whether central bank international body financial stability competency saw financial crisis coming, would fair answer “yes, extent”. prior summer 2007, number official publications16, attention draw number grow vulnerability potential risk as: • (then incipient) crisis u sub-prime mortgage market potential deepen spread markets; • fact financial market liquidity could vanish abruptly investor uncertainty risk aversion rose; • role hedge fund key players, years, fuel liquidity financial markets, imply shock hedge fund industry would severely affect smooth function markets; • excessive reliance investor risk assessment structure product make rat agencies; 16 see ecb financial stability review, june 2007; bi quarterly review, june 2007; bank england financial stability report, april 2007; imf global financial stability report, april 2007. 8 bi review 115/2009 • concentration risk financial system, become increasingly difficult identify due proliferation structure finance product credit risk transfer instruments; • risk-bearing ability ultimate risk-holders chains. however, would fair say few, – include market participant public authority – able foresee magnitude severity crisis. in retrospect, become clear crisis greatly intensify myriad unknown connection interdependency financial intermediaries, within outside bank system, include non-regulated financial sectors. sophisticate market participant investor also apparently unaware degree interconnectedness financial system. otherwise, behaviour month lead summer 2007 might show anticipation development (e.g. might seize contrarian investment opportunities). in particular, • magnitude large off-balance-sheet exposure bank u sub-prime-related structure finance product widely unknown; • little information exist extent implication activity new financial entity – conduit structure investment vehicle – link management liquidity arrangement banks; • probability various intertwine vulnerability could materialise simultaneously combine way eventually perceive close zero; • extent inter-linkages financial intermediary across market fully appreciated, possibility tension one specific segment credit market spread rapidly market continent foreseen. for two year now, discuss need major improvement supervisory regulatory framework respond weakness come light crisis unfolded. i address issue today. i approach question point view central bank ask: influence ability raise market awareness respect build vulnerability within financial system? and rely esrb repair problem future? the information disposal central bank body financial stability competency enable point grow risk vulnerabilities, allow deep understand interconnection financial system potential magnitude detect risks. a result, discussion risk public communication publication tend mostly qualitative nature, generally involve clear risk prioritisation exercise, therefore potentially small impact market behaviour. another important element risk assessment generally make specific aim suggest appropriate remedial policy action term prudential policy regulation. recommendations, mostly formulate broad terms, tend target market participants’ behaviour (e.g. propose mitigate actions), mute regard policy measure could take prudential regulatory area. one reason is, again, information base. the formulation concrete policy recommendation (e.g. respect capital buff funding-related issues) would need back rigorous quantitative assessments, publicly available information generally sufficient. along lines, perhaps result deficient information base, limit research analytical effort pool central bank community view support policy suggestion prudential regulatory area. bi review 115/2009 9 4. turn clock back but let turn question around ask: risk board exist 2006-07? would prevent financial crisis? this difficult question modus operandi esrb still defined. it also difficult know whether agree framework operational process prove effective. however, esrb give appropriate information base, combine central bank supervisory expertise support sound analytical framework produce solid risk assessment policy recommendations, answer positive. policy-makers, regulators, academic market participant learn enormous amount crisis. a turmoil spread, learn function financial system link financial system real sector. in particular, crisis highlight importance shadow bank system fuel credit economy, indirect link bank insurance sectors, well fragility securitisation market, name few. however, seem appropriate ask: would pre-crisis esrb closely monitor asset back commercial paper (abcp) markets? would fully aware conduit special investment vehicle (sivs)? against background, financial crisis trigger number initiative improve monitor shadow bank system. these include call mandatory report financial institution (e.g. hedge fund significant volume asset management) well report amendment account treatment conduit sivs ensure great transparency respect link sponsors, example. these initiative expect contribute good coverage non-regulated financial sector, couple great awareness business model topic overlook past. this information would available pre-crisis esrb. the crisis also stress importance develop way measure systemic risk, clearly show – market participant regulator – without proper measurement proper management. a comprehensive strand work relate complementary measure risk, capture element leverage, liquidity, correlation positions, concentration exposures, initiate private public sectors. prior summer 2007, le emphasis need target adequate measurement variables, include critical stance systemic risk, supervisory financial stability purposes. the crisis also show firm-level data financial intermediaries, include supervisory nature, might critical identify institution potential systemic relevance warrant close monitor understand interdependency among firm market – interdependency which, impaired, could strong impact overall stability financial system. the key data requirement relate to: i) possibility joint failure institution result common exposure single point time (these exposure could derive shock come outside financial system inter-linkages among intermediaries), ii) fact that, time, dynamic financial system real economy reinforce other, increase amplitude boom busts, undermine stability financial sector real economy. the financial crisis show monitor aggregate data insufficient may accurately indicate vulnerability hide financial system need link micro data macroeconomic risks. a such, firm-level data (as oppose to, example, estimate base country sector aggregates) recognise essential accurate assessment potential impact risk materialising, e.g. estimate amount loss financial 10 bi review 115/2009 sector, well conduct system-wide stress testing, contagion analysis, assessment feedback loop real financial sectors. in pre-turmoil period, supervisory authority concern overburden institution report requirement enforce adequate disclosure. a such, esrb establish summer 2007, access information base one available central bank time, might make substantially different systemic risk assessments. in addition importance comprehensive information base, crisis lead significant revamp research systemic risk great input formulation relate policy recommendations. a i mentioned, addition improvement macro stress-testing technique early warn signal literature, attention pay contagion spill-over models, especially bank sector, macro-financial risk-based flow-of-funds approach use contingent claim analysis, research tool support regulatory supervisory policy recommendations. one area pre-crisis esrb could make difference conduct country-specific analysis. generally, ecb financial stability assessment focus euro area whole rarely make distinction euro area countries. they mainly consider risk vulnerability common euro area countries; little analysis, let alone formulation, policy recommendations, country level. while help distil element analysis relevant euro zone, country-specific vulnerability might end receive insufficient attention. the esrb clear mandate pursue country analysis provide country-specific policy recommendation deem necessary. if task kind carry independent impartial body crisis, could signal grow vulnerability eu countries. risk warn fragility relate foreign currency lending, particularly highly leverage sector countries, overvaluation number eu house market could louder. i would add, though, none element trigger financial crisis – rather, intensify crisis spread eu financial system. the crisis also call improve coordination cooperation international body responsible safeguard financial stability level analysis. cooperation esrb, financial stability board imf, example, probably fruitful future, help raise awareness grow vulnerability global level could surface prominently eu-focused financial stability surveillance exercise. cooperation risk detection risk assessment task would involve, example, share technical expertise find market policy intelligence efforts. in addition, esrb may use international body sound board risk assessments, risk warn policy recommendations. an esrb eu-wide focus establish prior summer 2007 would access stepped-up co-operation global level wealth information analysis global environment disposal soon start function 2010. final remark while esrb good chance achieve mandate would early decade, task difficult challenge considerable. in particular regard issuance risk warnings, credibility esrb rest upon minimisation balance so-called type i error type ii errors. type i error entail possibility identify risk subsequently materialise, type ii error relate possibility fail identify risk subsequently materialise. identify long list potential systemic risk financial stability could minimise bi review 115/2009 11 probability make type ii error may lead accusation “crying wolf”. the opposite could lead important risk eu financial system overlooked, materialised, could harm esrb’s reputation. both rigour check potential source risk vulnerability, quality risk assessment (based information make available esrb) substantive influence credibility effectiveness board’s work. address type i-type ii error trade-off select risk merit risk warn do combine comprehensive strict monitor potential source risk well-informed detail risk assessment. expertise analysis financial sector issues, market public intelligence provide eu authority represent esrb consider invaluable. however, assessment qualitative nature should, extent possible, complement quantitative impact assessments, also facilitate task prioritise risk decision issue risk warnings. in short, european systemic risk board really strengthen macro-prudential supervision europe, four condition need fulfilled. first, clear legislative framework must create underpin work esrb support role ecb. it note last june european council clearly indicate ecb provide secretarial, logistical, administrative analytical support esrb. second, party involve preparation esrb risk assessment potential risk warn need necessary analysis research bring understand systemic risk macro-prudential regulation new level, find common

the bank's mandate promote canada's economic financial well-being. clearly, important mandate, determine demonstrate excellence work fulfill it. we conduct leading-edge research analysis, and, so, aim "second none" among world's central banks. to fulfill mandate, work four main area responsibility: currency, fund management, financial system, monetary policy. for areas, bank's approach much same. first, clear objective. second, tend take longer-term view things. third, make accountable transparent tool use, action take, outcome actions. and, finally, keep big picture mind. in remark today, i'll talk area responsibility, particular emphasis last two – financial system monetary policy. currency bank note bank's tangible product, and, despite prevalence credit debit card mean payment, demand cash continue grow. the objective currency function provide canadian bank note readily accept secure counterfeiting. in fact, quantify goal few 100 counterfeit note detect annually per million note circulation, meet standard. but intend make progress, new goal few 50 counterfeit detect annually per million note circulation. for time, bank develop canada's next bank note series, expect start issue late 2011. plan new series bank note complex job, necessitate take long view. our anti-counterfeiting strategy also long-term proposition. it contain four elements. the first develop bank note ever-more difficult counterfeit. the second increase routine verification bank note retailer – regional staff play important role help train retailer cash handlers. the third element strategy maintain high quality bank bi review 113/2009 1 note circulation. and fourth promote deterrence counterfeit law-enforcement officer prosecutors. regional staff also play key role support last two element strategy liaise financial institution law-enforcement agencies. a part deterrence work, bank establish annual "law enforcement award excellence counterfeit deterrence." this year, award present charlottetown rcmp's national anti-counterfeiting bureau conference canadian association chief police. transparency also important currency work. in addition report incidence counterfeit vis-à-vis targets, communicate regularly public retailer security feature bank notes, publish cost currency program annual report. a keep big picture mind – well, currency one several mean payment. the bank conduct research factor influence choice mean payment, monitor trends. this help u understand role bank note transactions, forecast demand. i'll say word bank's second area responsibility: fund management. fund management the bank canada federal government's banker, fiscal agent, adviser fund management. the objective work provide service effectively efficiently. the responsibility include manage canada's foreign exchange reserves, government's cash, and, collaboration department finance, public debt, include canada save bonds, go sale year october 5. a part responsibility, bank also give advice department finance issues, well issue arise context financial crisis. for example, advice feed design insure mortgage purchase program, allow federal government buy pool insure mortgage canada mortgage house corporation, well design canadian secure credit facility, set purchase asset-backed securities. manage provide advice debt reserve also require take long view. generally

public money. the bank discus various tool us report operation action carry manage financial asset outstanding stock federal debt. it via website, department finance's website, bank's annual report. finally, funds-management work, always look big picture. the range complexity operation need carefully manage risk require u consider broad picture develop framework governance fund management formulate policies. now i'll turn bank canada's third area responsibility – financial system. financial system a recent event make clear, sound financial system essential well-functioning economy. the objective bank's work promote stability efficiency financial system, domestically globally. 2 bi review 113/2009 to achieve objective, take long view. together policy-makers canada abroad, bank strive develop, contribute to, policy help sustain stable efficient financial system time. this long-term focus aid create maintain environment risk properly assess sound investment decision effectively made. that said, also nimble, react quickly market developments. for example, since onset financial crisis, provide considerable liquidity canadian financial system, variety forms. we currently auction liquidity three time week. it extremely important central bank transparent financial system work. in financial system review communicate, regular basis, assessment key risk vulnerabilities, well analysis certain policy issues. we also provide clear information operations. for example, bank provide liquidity, communicate clearly timely fashion, relevant policy principles, facility using, scale operations, well status key markets. financial market improve extent demand term liquidity facility waning. of three facility offer, currently demand term loan facility, demand facility private sector instrument recently half auctioning, even demand term purchase resale agreements, "workhorse" facility, decline condition fund market improved. against background, bank announce yesterday first two facility expire end october, auction third facility hold bi-weekly instead weekly. of course, financial system many interdependent elements, must keep big picture mind. this especially true monitor financial system, assessment risks, policy analysis. in current context, two aspect policy work worth noting. first, time financial crisis liquidity dry almost financial markets. however, market critical proper function financial system, bank work identify "core" markets, market that, appropriate policies, would strive keep operate without interruption, even shock. second, regulatory system tend focus individual financial institution interdependency systemic risk, bank canada, like many central banks, look way strengthen financial regulation add "macroprudential" orientation – is, focus system whole. i'll turn bank's fourth final area responsibility: monetary policy. monetary policy monetary policy get complicated, objective straightforward: foster confidence value money keep inflation low, stable, predictable. in agreement government canada, bank inflation target 2 per cent, make objective explicit. by nature, monetary policy work necessitate long view. the bank achieve inflation target raise low target overnight interest rate which, turn, influence interest rates, and, ultimately, overall demand good services. this sequence event take time, monetary policy typically try influence inflation 6 8 quarter future. put differently, monetary policy work significant lag, so, make interest rate decisions, rely various indicator future inflation, take medium-term view economy. low, stable, predictable inflation bring real benefits. it allow consumers, businesses, investor read price signal clearly, thus make financial decision confidence. it allow business make long-term investment which, turn, bi review 113/2009 3 contribute sustain job creation. and, importantly, help make economy resilient shocks. many remember day high variable inflation, therefore appreciate progress we've made. since 1995, total cpi inflation average 2 per cent per year. that's good record, bank always look way strengthen tool outcome monetary policy. in response global financial crisis recession, bank's monetary policy aggressive, since april year, target overnight rate one quarter one per cent – that's effectively low go. in words, cannot low policy rate provide economic stimulus. recognize possibility additional stimulus might required, research identify three additional monetary policy tool could use. the bank use first two tool – quantitative credit easing, involve purchase asset – remain available us. we have, however, employ third tool identified, use "conditional statements" future path monetary policy. in april monetary policy decision, say that, conditional outlook inflation, target overnight rate could expect remain current, low level end second quarter 2010. this longer-term guidance help influence interest rate long maturities. the bank also examine whether inflation-control framework might improved. specifically, advance next agreement we'll sign federal government 2011, we've study whether 2 per cent best target, whether target (as currently is) rate inflation path price level. all say, monetary policy work really take long view things. now word transparency monetary policy. i've speak tool use achieve inflation target. with regard actions, make policy rate decision eight time year fix schedule, issue press release time, and, four time year, explain analysis projection detail monetary policy reports. the outcome monetary policy – total cpi inflation – measurable, performance transparent. i add word "core" inflation. the volatile price component cpi – fruit, vegetables, gasoline, well effect change indirect tax – cause good deal temporary movement total cpi inflation, bank canada us core measure inflation, exclude volatile components, useful guide policy. the core measure inflation help u "see through" short-term volatility make policy decisions. a keep big picture mind: monetary policy focus canadian economy whole, aim achieve national inflation rate. of course, get sense national economy, need closely monitor regional developments. we five regional office across country, include atlantic region office halifax, staff go visit business gather information issue relate economy. we communicate highlight information quarterly business outlook survey, available website. so four area responsibility bank canada work carry mandate. before i conclude, i'll say word economic outlook monetary policy decision announce 10 september. the press release accompany announcement note that, follow deep, synchronous, global recession, recent indicator point start recovery major economies, support aggressive policy stimulus stabilization global financial markets. in canada, stimulative monetary fiscal policies, improve financial conditions, 4 bi review 113/2009 firm commodity prices, rebound business consumer confidence support growth domestic demand. combine recent information inventory adjustment automotive production, suggest gdp growth second half 2009 could strong project back july. total cpi inflation expect trough current quarter return 2 per cent target second quarter 2011 aggregate supply demand return balance. the bank say that, conditional outlook inflation, target overnight rate could expect remain current level end second quarter 2010 order achieve inflation target. the underlie macroeconomic risk projection judge roughly balanced. we also note persistent strength canadian dollar remain risk growth return inflation target, bank retain considerable flexibility conduct monetary policy low interest rates. finally, would timely mention that, early week, bank launch new medium-term plan. the plan set key priority bank next three years, discus relevant trend challenges, list measure gauge performance make accountable. this plan, soon post website, guide work medium term. it show clear objectives, take long view, transparent, keep big picture mind, continue approach year ahead. conclusion the past two year difficult many canadians. the

target the riksbank inflation-targeting central bank conduct flexible inflation target rather strict inflation targeting. flexible inflation target mean monetary policy aim stabilize inflation around inflation target real economy, whereas strict inflation target aim stabilize inflation only, without regard stability real economy, mervyn king (1997) describe “inflation nutter”. by stabilize real economy i mean stabilize resource utilization around normal level, keep mind monetary policy cannot affect long-term level resource utilization. because time lag monetary-policy action effect inflation real economy, effective flexible inflation target rely forecast inflation real economy. flexible inflation target describe “forecast targeting”: the central bank choose policy-rate path forecast inflation resource utilization “looks good.” by forecast look good i mean forecast either inflation already target resource utilization already normal, inflation approach target resource utilization approach normal level appropriate pace. more precisely, mean forecast inflation resource utilization effectively possible stabilize inflation around inflation target resource utilization around normal level. in event conflict objectives, achieve reasonable compromise stability inflation stability resource bi review 112/2009 1 utilization.1 different central bank express slightly different words. the riksbank often use term “well-balanced” monetary policy.2the forecast inflation real economy conditional central bank’s view transmission mechanism, estimate current state economy forecast important exogenous variables. the central bank us relevant information impact forecast inflation real economy. in framework, central bank take financial condition credit growth, asset prices, imbalances, potential bubble account extent impact forecast inflation resource utilization. inflation resource utilization target variable here, is, variable argument central bank’s loss function. hence, financial condition target variables. instead, indicators, provide information state economy, transmission mechanism exogenous shock central bank. financial condition affect policy rate extent impact forecast inflation resource utilization.33. financial stability rarely bind constraint – pre-crisis view what role financial stability pre-crisis view flexible inflation targeting? maintain financial stability, include well-functioning payment system, is, explicitly implicitly, important objective central banks. in overview best-practice monetary policy svensson (2002), long crisis ongoing debate monetary policy asset prices, i briefly discuss objective reconcile flexible inflation targeting, conflict arise could handled.4one question whether financial stability belong loss function central bank, together inflation resource utilization. i argue good way handle additional objective constraint monetary policy rather separate target variable appear loss function. the idea financial stability normally pursue different instruments, supervision regulation, normally concern monetary policy. under normal circumstances, least industrialize countries, financial stability good impose constraint monetary policy. only rarely, financial crisis occur, financial stability impose constraint monetary policy force central bank modify decisions. the typical constraint i mind monetary policy would temporarily modify expansionary direction, instance, order improve situation fragile financial sector, perhaps win time financial sector clean- 1 2 the idea inflation target imply inflation forecast see intermediate target introduce king (1994). the term “inflation-forecast targeting” introduce svensson (1997), term “forecast targeting” svensson (2005). see woodford (2007a, b) discussion analysis forecast targeting. 3 several central bank call inflation targeters effectively conduct flexible inflation targeting, although may quite transparent inflation target, role stability real economy, etc. 4 see goodfriend (2007) presentation conventional wisdom pre-crisis monetary policy. see bean (2003) detail pre-crisis discussion inflation targeting, financial imbalance asset prices. 2 bi review 112/2009 reform. interestingly paradoxically, constraint financial stability impose monetary policy recently rather opposite direction one i anticipate prevent central bank low policy rate way zero, even below, concern financial sector. the financial crisis deep recession follow motivate large cut policy rate. at time, concern possible problem financial market apparently make bank england decide go low 50 basis point initially, april 2009, prevent riksbank go 50 basis points, although riksbank late july low policy rate 25 basis points.5how central bank know whether constraint bind not? i think would know continually monitor state financial sector. in countries, central bank publish regular financial stability report type pioneer bank england riksbank. these report include analysis indicator state financial sector, particular early-warning indicator potential future problems. they serve assure general public economic agent everything well financial sector case. they also serve early warn agents' concern financial-regulation authority problem show horizon. early action could prevent financial instability materializing, thus limit probability future threat financial stability future bind constraint monetary policy. the idea consider financial stability possible constraint monetary policy rather target consistent general idea see financial stability, monetary-policy point view, aspect transmission mechanism monetary policy, reduction financial stability typically change transmission mechanism make le efficient. asset price bubble the previous discussion focus central bank face ongoing crisis, receive signal crisis underway. a relate issue extent central bank take account asset price and, particular, potential asset-price bubbles. in forecast target framework describe above, asset price affect policy extent deem affect forecast central bank's target variables, is, inflation resource utilization. suppose, however, large asset-price increase deem fragile possible bubble, significant risk future collapse. suppose future collapse deem undesirable consequence future inflation resource utilization. then bank face delicate situation. it possible policy-rate path high policy-rate near future deem dampen asset-price increase near future also reduce risk size collapse distant future, thus undershoot inflation target near term provide stable development inflation resource utilization medium long term. these example situation central bank may choose respond asset-price developments. however, reason response central bank concern repercussion inflation resource utilization, asset price such. that is, asset price target variables; enter loss function. it go without say realistic situation difficult judge whether particular asset-price movement bubble ground expectation reasonable 5 see box “monetary policy low interest rates” february 2009 inflation report (bank england 2009, p. 44). my view “zero interest-rate mystique” may somewhat exaggerated, see discussion riksbank’s minute september 2009 policy meet (sveriges riksbank 2009). bi review 112/2009 3 fundamentals, whether repercussion inflation resource utilization motivate adjustment policy-rate path.6 this obviously area good judgment crucial. there scope mechanical adjustment asset price bubbles. the central bank's reaction stable shift judgment and, counter substantial part literature, i believe productive discus issue directly term central bank's reaction function, instance modification taylor rule (svensson 2003b, 2005). asset-price movement asset-price bubble may directly threaten financial stability cause financial-stability constraint monetary policy bind. thus, central bank may want respond asset price development increase risk financial instability future. again, many realistic situations, difficulty make judgment great insufficient information take preemptive action many cases. now, reason modify view monetary policy financial stability give experience financial crisis far? let approach question ask cause financial crisis are, role monetary policy cause crisis whether different monetary policy warrant could prevent reduce size crisis. 4. the role monetary policy financial crisis a i see it, crisis mainly cause condition little monetary policy mostly due regulatory failure and, extent, specific circumstances, include u.s. house policy support home ownership low-income households.7 the macro condition precede crisis include low world real interest rate due global imbalances, well great moderation long period stable growth stable low inflation, lead systematic underestimation risk low risk premia financial markets. there distort incentive commercial investment bank increase leverage make possible lax regulation supervision lack appropriate bank resolution regime, well distort incentive exercise le due diligence loan origination securitisation conduct regulatory arbitrage set off-balance-sheet entity various specific reason end still effectively remain balance sheet. there also distort incentive trader fund manager take excessive risk myopic asymmetric remuneration contracts. there eventually enormous information problem assess risk extremely complex asset-backed securities, huge underestimation potential correlate systemic risks. none cause anything monetary policy, except monetary policy may contribute great moderation. so potential role monetary policy contribute crisis? the main argument blame monetary policy crisis policy rate u.s. keep 6 kohn (2006, 2008) specify three condition fulfil central bank take “extra action” deal possible asset-price bubble: “first, policymakers must able identify bubble timely fashion reasonable confidence. second, somewhat tight monetary policy must high probability help check least speculative activity. and third, expect improvement future economic performance would result curtailment bubble must sufficiently great.” he concludes, also 2008 thorough considerations, condition would rarely met. 7 see bean (2009) extensive excellent discussion crisis, include credit expansion house boom, macroeconomic antecedents, distort incentives, information problems, amplification propagation crisis real economy, policy response lesson monetary policy economics generally. 4 bi review 112/2009 low period 2001-2005, would contribute build-up excessive credit growth house-price bubble (taylor 2007). there two relevant question context u.s. monetary policy 2001-2005. first, low interest rate reasonable give information available time? second, could different monetary policy high interest rate prevent crisis? the first question, whether low interest rate reasonable give available information, relevant one evaluate monetary policy. it relevant evaluate policy take account information available ex ante policymaker rather information ex post unknown policymaker (see svensson 2009 evaluate monetary policy ex ante ex post).8 during time, give information available, genuine well-motivated fear u.s. fall japanese-style deflationary liquidity trap, optimal policy situation expansionary monetary policy.9 it may that, retrospect, risk deflation exaggerated, impossible know ex ante. hence, i consider expansionary policy appropriate and, add ex post evaluation, one note lead ex post high inflation overheat economy. the second question, whether different monetary policy could prevent crisis, relevant assess extent monetary policy blame cause crisis, notwithstanding reasonable exante perspective. the credit growth house boom u.s. elsewhere powerful. however, i believe somewhat high interest rate would make little difference. in order stop credit growth house boom, interest rate would probably raise high cause considerable damage real economy. they could throw u.s. right japanese-style deflation eventually liquidity trap. certainly high interest rate would impact regulatory problems, distort incentive information problem mention (although could end great moderation deep recession deflation).10however, perhaps possible fed’s emphasis readiness relax monetary policy aggressively wake sharp fall asset price (greenspan 2002) may induce expectation floor future asset price contribute asset-price boom (the “greenspan put”; see miller, well zhang, 2002). arguably, communication issue rather one actual policy, le emphasis readiness clean sharp fall asset price might preferable alternative. 5. conclusion: flexible inflation target need modify light crisis? what conclusion draw financial crisis far conduct monetary policy need modify framework flexible inflation targeting? 8 i remember period vividly, i fortunate opportunity discus debate problem current monetary policy, deflation liquidity trap group great economist princeton university include ben bernanke (before leave governor federal reserve board), alan blinder, paul krugman, chris sims michael woodford. 9 see svensson (2003a) discussion policy option liquidity trap. 10 kohn (2008), extensive discussion, conclude insufficient evidence low interest rate would contribute much house-price boom high interest rate would much dampen effect it. del negro, marco, christopher otrok (2007) find small effect feed monetary policy house price 2001-2005, whereas iacoviello, matteo, stefano neri (2008) find large effects, although include regulation-q period sample may increase apparent monetary policy effect housing. bi review 112/2009 5 one obvious conclusion price stability enough achieve financial stability (carney 2009, white 2006). good flexible inflation target achieve financial stability, anyone ever believe that. specific policy instrument need ensure financial stability. another conclusion interest-rate policy enough achieve financial stability. interest rate blunt instrument that, attempt use interest rate financial stability purpose would cause considerable collateral damage inflation real economy. instead, best instrument achieve financial stability supervision regulation, include appropriate bank resolution regimes. in many countries, responsibility instrument rest authority central bank. generally, extent financial instability depend specific distortions, good regulation aim attack distortion close source possible. to counter observe procyclicality exist regulation, macro-prudential regulation contingent business cycle financial indicator may need introduce induce good financial stability. possible macro-prudential regulation include variable capital, margin, equity/loan requirements. a express bean (2009), “the best approach likely involve portfolio instruments”. what specific conclusion flexible inflation targeting? one old conclusion consideration impact financial factor forecast inflation resource utilization may require long forecast horizons. several inflation-targeting central bank (including bank england, norge bank riksbank) reason already extend forecast horizon previously common two year three years. there nothing principle prevent inflation targeter consider forecast beyond three-year horizon, practice usually little information anything long horizon except tendency revert long-term average. what “leaning wind” (as advocate by, instance, borio white, 2003, cecchetti, genberg wadhwani, 2002), idea central bank raise interest rate appear warrant inflation resource utilization counter rapid credit growth rise asset prices? it sometimes quite clear whether advocate lean wind mean credit growth asset price consider target enter explicit implicit loss function alongside inflation resource utilization, whether mean credit growth asset price still consider indicator emphasize credit growth asset price may potential negative effect inflation resource utilization long horizon. in latter case, lean wind way improve stability inflation resource utilization long run. then completely consistent flexible inflation targeting. however, line previous discussion, instrument interest rate likely much effective avoid excessive credit growth asset-price booms, since interest rate high enough noticeable effect credit growth asset price may strong negative effect inflation resource utilization, central bank probably rarely sufficient information likely beneficial longer-horizon effect inflation resource utilization trade-off worthwhile motivated. one important lesson financial crisis financial factor may strong deteriorate effect transmission mechanism, make standard interest-rate policy much le effective. this motivate research incorporate financial factor standard model transmission mechanism use central banks, rapidly increase volume research produce academic central-bank researcher present increase number conference financial factor monetary policy. important question include potential output neutral real interest rate affect financial factor financial distortion (curdia woodford 2009, walsh 2009), impact financial factor general equilibrium effect 6 bi review 112/2009 alternative policy-rate path inflation resource utilization forecasts.11 before extension model framework operational, policymakers staff improvise apply unusual amount judgment effect financial crisis transmission mechanism. even much good analytical foundation concern role financial factor transmission mechanism, course, always, considerable scope application good judgment monetary policy. in end, main conclusion far crisis flexible inflation targeting, apply right way use information financial factor relevant forecast inflation resource utilization horizon, remain best-practice monetary policy before, during, financial crisis. but good theoretical, empirical operational understand role financial factor transmission mechanism urgently require need much work, work already underway academia central banks. the outcome might well financial factor consider large role affect transmission mechanism indicator future inflation resource utilization. if so, central bank would end respond financial indicators, sense adjust policy rate policyrate path give change financial indicator. however, would mean financial factor indicator become independent target besides inflation resource utilization explicit implicit central-bank loss function. instead, would matter respond appropriately financial indicator order time best stabilize inflation around inflation target resource utilization around normal level.12references bank england

* * * mr. martin oduor-otieno, chairman, kenya banker association; mr. john wanyela, executive director, kenya banker association; chief executive commercial bank present; distinguish guests; lady gentlemen: i please join morning important occasion launch bank credit information share project. allow therefore extend gratitude kenya banker association facilitate project invitation. the importance function cannot overemphasise i delight excellent turnout bank fraternity. the bank (credit reference bureau) regulation 2008 publish july 2008 launch venue september 2008. the regulation pave way license surveillance credit reference bureau (crb) central bank kenya. these bureau collate credit information institution license bank act. i please report since regulation become operational february 2009, considerable interest potential investors. i believe interest cherish importance development information capital. the central bank far receive three application crb licenses, two local investor (credit reference bureau africa metropol) one south african base regional player – compuscan. accordingly central bank week issue letter intent first applicant, credit reference bureau africa. this approval principle conduct credit reference bureau business. the bureau commence operation completion independent third party system security audit onsite inspection cbk. the letter intent grant detail due diligence application ensure statutory prudential requirement met. the central bank wish reassure kenyan shall rigorously ass application ensure integrity envisage credit information share mechanism. lady gentlemen: the launch project today bank sector therefore timely. the overarch objective project coordinate effort player build sustainable holistic information share mechanism. the central bank render full support project expect bank also commit implement agree milestones. credit information share offer kenya opportunity promote access affordable credit kenyan information low risk premium search costs. there indeed clear direct linkage access credit economic development. allow highlight four key benefit central bank see accrue initiative. first, credit information share facilitate development information capital. the risk premium associate information asymmetry search cost decline. second, information capital change current collateral technology. credit bank sector kenya large extent underwrite physical collateral land. borrower without access collateral constrain access credit. credit information share enable borrower build track record use access credit. this especially pertinent borrower informal bi review 111/2009 1 small medium enterprise (smes) track record good performance use access credit. the sme sector important industrial development country vision 2030. lady gentlemen: the third benefit enhance information symmetry support financial development. the exist state information asymmetry borrower bank constraint innovation. two important outcome information asymmetry: moral hazard problem borrower adverse selection banks. these two problem could punish economy low provision credit. we also see adverse selection among bank well. fourth, segment market like ours, segment remain untapped bank adequate information price suitable products. in part also contribute high cost credit. borrower bear “risk premium” lack information. it therefore central bank’s expectation save arise increase credit information shall translate low cost credit. in turn, kenyan able access credit banks. the current level interest rate combination cost (like information search costs), risk premium course banks’ profit margin. high interest rate also give rise default risks. the risk premium search cost minimize information symmetry reduce non-performing loans. a recall kenyan bank sector saddle huge non perform loan portfolio 1980s 1990s. part burden occasion “serial defaulters” inadequate incentive good credit history. the day “serial defaulters” definitely number advent credit information sharing. more importantly, expect incentive good credit behaviour attract competitive price credit facilities. the message kenyan ever before, certainly benefit accrue adhere contractual term loans. i sure institution kenya deal appropriate definition property right contract enforcement reduce risk premium. lady gentlemen: in nutshell, credit information share increase vibrancy market borrower lenders. borrower able access enhance facility grow credit history track record. conversely credit provider able develop new competitive product tap previously unserved underserved market niche power available information. this impact positively bank sector kenyan economy whole. a i draw close, let recognize bank sector credit information share initiative serve model credit providers. we must move speed mechanism run begin rope financial non financial credit providers. this allow full benefit credit information share whole economy. i therefore urge bank support initiative central bank unreservedly commit to. it distinguish duty officially launch bank credit information share implementation project. thank you. 2 bi review 111/2009 caleb m fundanga: improve financial inclusion zambia remark dr caleb m fundanga, governor bank zambia, celpay mobile bank conference, lusaka, 16-17 september

supervise crisis environment address mr v k sharma, executive director reserve bank india, annual regulators’ roundtable, organize international credit union regulators’ network, barcelona, 30-31 july 2009. * * * i thank international credit union regulator network invite regulator roundtable share experience supervise crisis environment. i greatly appreciate selection topic, relevance cannot emphasize today. urban cooperative bank (ucbs) india akin credit union member-driven essentially community-based. however, unlike credit unions, ucbs also permit accept deposit non-members part payment systems. a banking, include urban cooperative banking, sector india affect recent global financial crisis, i share today distinguish august audience learn curve experienced, long ago, deal kind crisis. however, i would presently demonstrate reserve bank, instead adopt well-trodden course action, customize response, keep view sector-specific problems. i would review impact rbi’s approach strategy ucbs also discus ongoing effort strengthen sector. but i must admit regulate supervise ucb sector far formidable challenge regulate supervise commercial bank sector. background in year 2004, 38% approximately 1926 urban cooperative bank india assess weak sick. the deposit sector begin show decline trend 2005 non perform asset rise 23.2%. in order address rather critical situation, several measure initiate short term well long term far-reaching nature also i propose discus today. genesis crisis a. rapid growth sector in period 15 years, 1991 2004, ucb sector witness unprecedented growth. from 1306 urban cooperative bank 1991, number bank increase 1926 year 2004, represent growth 47 percent i.e. 620 bank add 15 year (not count bank collapse period). a this, previous 25 year i.e. 1966 1991 200 new bank come up. this spectacular growth ucbs since 1991, result increase penetration, ironically, also lead certain weakness sector adversely affect public perception thereby, competitiveness. the weaken public confidence ucb sector begin crisis 2001 face large multi-state bank prosperous state gujarat, sudden “run” bank, follow rumour large exposure lead stock broke suffer huge loss stock market. the large-scale withdrawal deposit within short time result severe liquidity problem bank time hold u $ 160 million equivalent inter-bank deposit 200 ucbs state states, obviously pose systemic risk. the gujarat episode follow another major crisis state andhra pradesh 2002, bi review 111/2009 1 one large bank state face run, follow newspaper report inquiry affair bank state registrar cooperative societies. the bank weak position, ultimately, attempt revival failed, license cancel reserve bank 2004.the decline public confidence ucb sector deepen aftermath crisis gujarat andhra pradesh concomitantly, position ucbs generally deteriorate reflect rbi’s on-site assessment banks. in context, i may mention part on-site inspection, reserve bank system categorize bank four grade base parameter capital adequacy, asset quality, earnings, compliance crr/slr requirement adherence rbi guidelines. while grade i & ii bank major supervisory concerns, two grade indicate presence supervisory concern vary degrees. a june 30, 2004, 732 1919 ucbs categorise grade iii iv, signify weakness sickness. the deteriorate position ucbs reflect public perception deposit sector decline first time since document history 2004-2005 4.7%. in addition impact rapid growth, discuss above, certain structural aspect sector cause concern supervisor i discus these, notice, also, unique india. b. heterogeneity there significant degree heterogeneity term size, geographical distribution, performance, financial strength also it human resource endowment ucbs. while one hand, number small neighbourhood unit bank function mutual interest members, several large ucbs wide network branches, large number depositor borrower other, many medium/large corporates. in latter, cooperative structure exist organizational arrangement, business model goal like commercial banks. the extent heterogeneity gauge fact 30.7% ucbs hold 2.2% deposit top end, 16 bank account 28.8% total deposit sector. incidentally, despite difference size, “one size fit all” approach regulation supervision exist ucbs subject regulatory supervisory framework commercial banks. c. dual control another feature ucb sector india duality control. ucbs regulate supervise state governments, registrar co-operative societies, reserve bank india. while state registrar exercise power regard incorporation, registration, management, amalgamation, reconstruction liquidation, case bank presence one state, central registrar co-operative societies, behalf central government, exercise powers. the bank relate function issue license start new banks, branches, matter relate interest rates, policy loan investments, prudential norm etc. regulate supervise reserve bank india. it often experience effectiveness regulatory supervisory measure get dilute inadequate response state government. reserve bank’s requisition state government supersede board bank, example, would get act upon inordinate delay registrar cooperative societies, case state government share rbi’s perception competence board. there thus doubt another issue need address part strategy effectively handle crisis sector. 2 bi review 111/2009 d. business model – corporate governance issue most problem face sector arise lack good governance ucbs, indeed, incidentally, significantly, also case, recent global financial crisis, large global banks. besides, india, unlike company, shareholders/members ucb, generally debtor bank. while would appropriate framework governance cooperative society, accept deposit members/shareholders, lead distortion business model apply cooperative bank, solicit deposit non-members well. a majority share holder borrower ucbs, elect management would incentive pursue policy borrower orient may always best interest depositors. also, unlike case companies, share list stock exchange change hand without affect capital base, case ucbs, shareholder withdraw contribution capital shrink capital bank thereby limit ability increase risk weight asset expand business. response strategy keep view characteristic ucb sector, reserve bank initiate series measure resolve structural problem strengthen banks. in follows, i set initiative reserve bank deal crisis. a. withhold new bank branch license license norm ucbs ease may 1993 within 8 year i.e. june 2004, 800 bank mushroom close one third newly license ucbs become financially weak within short period 2-3 years. there was, thus, need moderate pace growth sector was, therefore, decide june 2004 stop issue license new bank branch suitable framework regulation supervision place already large number ucbs. b. vision document ucbs recognize systemic risk concerns, reserve bank review entire gamut legislative, regulatory supervisory framework banks, march 2005, bring draft “vision document ucbs”. the vision document, discuss characteristic sector, analyze problem afflict bank propose follow regulatory supervisory strategy deal problem affect sector: a) nuanced granular approach supervision regulation highlight heterogeneity sector, vision document observe “one size fit all” approach regulation supervision ucbs need abjure multi-layered regulatory supervisory approach adopt keep view heterogeneity sector. accordingly, decide bank deposit le rs.1 billion (equivalent u $ 20 million), whose branch limit small area i.e. tier-i bank closely epitomize cooperative spirit, place simplify prudential regulation time order enable gradually gain strength period 3 year could bring par bank purpose regulation. accordingly, tier-i bank place 180-day delinquency norm tier ii bank 90-day norm applicable commercial banks. the tier-i bank are, however, require make adequate provision intervene period enable migrate 90-day norm future. further, low provision requirement stipulate tier-i compare tier-ii bank also intend provide measure relief small ucbs, low provision would bi review 111/2009 3 translate high profit could, turn, used, transition period, shore capital base banks. b) consultative approach supervision – tafcub in order address problem dual control, reserve bank 2001-2002, suggest new apex supervisory body constitute ucb sector, comprise representative central / state governments, rbi expert field. however, since materialize, reserve bank propose amendment bank regulation act provide power rbi ucbs similar available respect commercial banks. when even 2nd suggestion materialise, reserve bank vision document ucbs propose adoption coordinate approach decide future set weak sick bank state. to end, memorandum understand (mou) sign rbi respective state government central government, case multi-state urban cooperative banks, achieve great convergence approach two agency task regulation supervision ucbs. a part mou, decide set state level task force urban co-operative bank (tafcubs) comprise representative rbi, state government national state level federation/association ucbs. tafcub task responsibility identify potentially viable non viable ucbs state provide revival plan former, non disruptive exit route latter, set banks. the exit route could include merger/amalgamation strong banks, conversion societies, ultimately, last resort, liquidation. base recommendation tafcubs, supervisory action initiate include merger unviable bank financially strong ucbs, cancellation license unviable bank rejection license application unlicensed cooperative banks, allow conduct bank business pending rejection license application rbi, per bank regulation act, 1949 (as applicable cooperative society (aacs). significantly, number unlicensed bank dramatically drop 1066 1977 mere 58 date! the access consolidate information local national level federation banks, also regulator supervisors, make tafcub effective instrument consolidate sector quick non-disruptive exit unviable bank revival viable ones. a recommendation tafcubs, consent stakeholder include reserve bank india, lend speedy implementation concerned. the first tafcub set june 2005 success take difficult decision transparent manner consequent turn around banks, lead adoption practically states. c) information technology a part mou sign states, rbi commit facilitate it human resource development initiative ucbs. on technology front, begin make rbi development software facilitate compilation submission supervisory regulatory return ucbs rbi, electronically. the software also allow bank analyse data is, therefore, use powerful management information tool many banks. the data submit bank subject analysis supervisors, inter alia, objective track incipient stress face bank also identify outlier banks. this off-site surveillance mechanism also act decision support system, data present analyse form facilitate inform decision-making addition facilitate technology-driven system focus continuous supervision ucbs, one important objective set vision document. i understand presentation off-site surveillance system ucbs also make group july 2008 hongkong. recognise vast scope use it, reserve bank constitute work group comprise member state government, ucb sector rbi examine “the various 4 bi review 111/2009 area it support could provide ucbs reserve bank.” the report group examine implementation i hope would give major fillip competitiveness strength ucbs extensive use it. d) human resource initiative in order upgrade skill official ucbs enhance professionalism, train program conduct rbi important area bank directors, chief executive officer official ucbs. train programme organize regional centre train impart local/regional language enable local staff absorb train without difficulty. these program ucbs conduct free cost 2000 official far train major initiative. c. measure improve corporate governance while extend necessary support up-gradation professional skill directors, reserve bank also advise bank induct least 2 professional director boards, view ensure board requisite skill competence review ass management performance. in state sign mou reserve bank, guideline adopt “fit proper” criterion appointment ceo also implemented. these emphasize track record integrity candidate apart certain eligibility criterion like minimum qualification age ceo urban cooperative bank. an indicative list do don’ts also formulate serve guide director enable play role effectively. the need director maintain “arms” length day-to-day operation bank also highlight do don'ts prescribe reserve bank. connect lend directors, family member associate business firms, ucbs banned, except loan security like fix deposit etc. the reserve bank also circulate list best practice follow well-run bank others emulate. further, bank also advise constitute audit committee board state governments, per mou sign rbi, commit get statutory audit large ucbs conduct charter accountants. in order ensure financial statement reflect true fair picture banks’ financial position, rbi emphasize professionalization audit, also provide train state government auditors. d. consolidation ucb sector consolidation sector process merger weak entity strong one set motion 2005 provide transparent objective guideline grant no-objection merger proposal strategy provide non-disruptive exit weak banks. a four-member external expert group set vet merger proposals, view provide transparent mechanism impartial inputs. tafcubs representative sector also provide local level input bank lookout take weak bank part inorganic growth strategy. in 82 merger proposal approve far, 71 merger already materialize last 4 years. e. problem bank resolution: customize solution apart encourage voluntary mergers, various strategy adopt problem bank resolution. restructure liability involve conversion part deposit equity do recently case systemically important banks. bi review 111/2009 5 in one case, depositor bank encourage convert entire interest credit deposits, date place bank restrictive directions, equity. a result, extent outside liability reduce bank become solvent. a conversion include amount eligible insurance cover deposit insurance corporation, also agree allow capital contribution small depositor add back deposit reckon insurance cover need arise liquidate bank attain full solvency. in another case, part deposit allow convert equity/ perpetual debt instruments. also, ensure net worth bank turn positive re-structuring liquid asset adequate meet statutory pre-emption, cash pay out suitably adjust different level sacrifice depositors. another strategy problem bank resolution draw scheme acquisition weak ucb strong ucb explore possibility fund gap valuation accept acquire bank actual deposit liability deposit insurance credit guarantee corporation. in certain cases, ucbs also able turn around take advantage property boom dispose surplus land buildings. f. incentive good bank while tackle weak bank one part response strategy, felt encourage strong bank incentive way newer/additional business opportunity could complement effort build strong sector. with objective view, reserve bank encourage financially sound well manage ucbs state sign mou, business development opportunities, open new branch (including offsite onsite atms), currency chests, opportunity forex, insurance, mutual fund businesses, extension area operation entire state, besides provide train i.t support upgrade human resource bank mou states, include strong ones. g. new initiative strengthen ucbs in india, ucbs work stand-alone basis grassroots level financial system. be comparatively small, difficult entity compete commercial bank establish market share. look various successful federal model exist internationally, especially europe usa, need felt strong inter-cooperative bond co-operation centralize apex institution position channelize resources, aggregate need also lend credibility mutual support financial markets. besides, federate model give option ucbs raise capital subsidiary etc. the reserve bank examine prospect arrangement may act bulwark crisis situation strengthen supervision self regulatory organizations. impact recent initiatives: restoration public confidence a quick analysis impact measure show positive change public perception ucbs. consequently, large depositor also good quality

role transparency communication" speech mr jan f qvigstad, deputy governor norge bank (central bank norway), conference "ten year riksbank independence", stockholm, 11 september 2009. * * * introduction it great pleasure accept invitation discus professor fellow central bank deputy governor lars svensson’s lecture connection tenth anniversary riksbank independence. in lecture, lars svensson discuss communication, credibility monetary policy evaluation. he look general issue central bank seek influence key rate expectations, use riksbank example.1 i venture remark riksbank’s assessment offer comment issue light norge bank’s experience interest rate forecasts. there number similarity communication strategy riksbank norge bank. and underlie strategy model develop by, among others, lars svensson. in lecture today, describe arrive interest rate path “looks good”. he showed, many previous occasions, formalise find interest rate path minimise give loss function. when interest rate “look good”? svensson raise issue whether monetary policy well balanced, ex-post also ex-ante. in presentation today, present system evaluate rank different policy alternatives, show taylor diagram use evaluate whether one interest rate forecast result low volatility inflation output gap another. if forecast result inflation close target narrow output gap forecast period, forecast selected. on occasions, choice two forecast problematic. the forecast select depend preference consideration give weight. i completely agree lars svensson policymakers must rank different policy alternative base preferences. in cases, policymakers may wish keep interest rate high others low interest rate may preferred. however, equally important take account preference time, i.e. system check whether preference underlie baseline scenario one report previous report. and preference formalise loss function, relatively simple find optimal interest rate path give model. the choice path depend policymakers’ preferences. a policymaker’s preference may course change time, i favour base analysis set preference previously. this approach contribute consistency communication time. 1 cf. woodford’s (2005) formulation: ” for expectation matter, […] little else matters.” bi review 110/2009 1 criterion “good” interest rate path inspire svensson, norge bank develop set criterion “good” interest rate path. the intention make easy others understand think, although criterion also define agenda internal discussion.2the first criterion good interest rate path set interest rate view bring inflation back target medium term follow shock. the primary objective achieve inflation target. the second criterion reflect flexibility inflation targeting. there many route objective. which one choose? accord criteria, emphasis place find interest rate path also stabilise output employment. so far, approach track svensson’s theoretical approach fairly closely, deviation analytical method present article. the important difference choose focus directly target, use loss function describe monetary policy. the approach propose article primarily rely description policy different rule follow calculation loss use loss function. because model primarily model reality primarily reality, tailor require connect model reality. some additional criterion therefore formulated. these criterion necessary model uncertain confidence monetary policy cannot always take granted. the criterion conflict svensson’s monetary policy research, regard bridge model reality. allow show criterion use work march monetary policy report outline think process involved. although chart i present simplification , serve illustrate work methods. norge bank’s assessment current situation forecast – below-target inflation considerably negative output gap – might, criterion 1 2, indicate isolation interest rate set low even negative towards end 2009. this illustrate green line. however, executive board choose take le drastic course action basis criterion take consideration. criterion 3 state previous method operation take account interest rate normally change gradually. with emphasis interest rate smooth loss function (i.e. criterion 1+2+3), result black line. this interest rate path still low, low path fact chosen. criterion 4 state monetary policy robust criterion 5 cross-check carry out. in turbulent economic situation, uncertain whether model right one norwegian economy want guard model misspecifications. in economy unemployment around 3 per cent inflation target, set interest rate low zero regard go far. a practical approach model uncertainty cross-check use simple monetary policy rule taylor rule (criterion 5). in addition basic taylor rule, usually employ variation rule involve external interest rates, rule output gap replace gdp growth. a mechanical application taylor rule would result forecast approximately indicate blue line diagram, i.e. considerably high interest rate path chosen. a high interest rate path would also result negative output inflation gaps. achieve inflation target would take ten years. 2 see holmsen et al. (2008) discussion implementation communication optimal monetary policy. 2 bi review 110/2009 an interval interest rate determine base criteria, optimal policy (with interest rate smoothing) define low boundary taylor rule yield upper boundary. after overall assessment, interest rate forecast indicate red line selected. the interest rate decision, norway elsewhere, base discussion board. criterion 3, 4 5 introduce condition cannot easily observed. we apply judgement. the criterion contribute consistency structure discussion. the riksbank also apply judgement select interest rate path. but svensson discus possible shortcoming macroeconomic model. in chart 10, show various interest rate paths, differ around ½ percentage point period summer, could result difference inflation rate close 4 percentage point early next autumn. monetary policy seem strong impact. it would interest hear whether think rely heavily model interest rate set robust, possible error model guard against. we also know experience market participants’ perception differ ours, particularly somewhat ahead. there variety reason difference svensson discus number them. it would also useful study volatility surround publication key macroeconomic variables. we would prefer see low volatility around monetary policy meetings, surprise postpone time close publication new macroeconomic data. solberg johansen (2008) – winner bertil ohlin prize best thesis international economics stockholm school economics – examine volatility yield curve. her find provide support decrease volatility around monetary policy meetings, strong evidence suggest financial market volatility around publication new data change norge bank begin publish interest rate forecasts. another study might provide useful input ehrmann fratzscher’s (2007) analysis development u market rate period monetary policy meet two different communication regimes. i close concur blind colleague (2008) write that: “… publication project path central bank’s policy rate appear “new frontier” central bank communication. but practise country year little empirical knowledge effect yet. a data accumulates, high-priority area future research.” it reassure know

central bank worth salt ever tolerate high inflation. price stability may sufficient condition i maintain necessary condition solid foundation sustainable growth prosperity. i would like believe steve biko would gratify fairly contain pace inflation past 15 years, know dire consequence inflation poor – usually least able hedge inflation – particular. since 1994 average headline inflation amount approximately 6,5 per cent per annum. over 1 steve biko, i write i like, a select writings. bi review 109/2009 1 precede 15 years, 1979 1994, average almost 14 per cent per annum. inflation uneven period, though, induce typically significant change key exogenous driver inflation, oil prices. secondly, recent upsurge strike action lead commentator describe wave “winter discontent”. in regard, i would like comment worry trend settlement reached. wage settlement project rate inflation excess productivity gain tend undermine fight high inflation. they lead labour cost increase way trade competitor and, therefore, loss competitiveness. though i discus labour market much depth later, i need refer briefly labour laws. many commentator describe labour market rigid inflexible. a country’s first post-1994 minister labour, blame point direction. i first admit thing could do differently. hindsight, however, useful improve foresight. i would like take opportunity espouse theoretical philosophical underpinnings behind labour relation act. the labour movement regard hero then. social ill the break tradition, however, cannot complete address establish forum. i will, therefore, digress slightly venture opinion matter relate economics central banking. the shameful xenophobic tendency witness last year cause south african exclaim: “oh, beloved country, would steve biko said?”

funds. mindful need structure national finance sustainable way, government decide right thing rather go macroeconomic populist route. government expenditure debt keep control, capacity south african revenue service collect tax efficiently enhanced, environment conducive economic growth fostered. progress make fronts, grow economy expand tax base formidable revenue service ensure fiscus receive due it. the buoyant tax revenue growth past 15 year bi review 109/2009 5 make possible raise government expenditure transfer quite substantially while, time, keep budget deficit small enough reduce ratio government debt gross domestic product 24 per cent second quarter 2009. this prudent approach pay recently international economic crisis lead contraction economic activity south africa. low level government debt make possible adopt much expansionary fiscal policy stance circumstances, despite subdue tax revenues. although set raise government debt ratio next years, increase warrant interest support economic activity employment. while expansionary fiscal policy stance bolster economic activity, crucial simultaneously ensure expenditure incur productive. much must still do area. for instance, highlight anc secretary general gwede mantashe address 2 september, micro-organisation school education leaf much desired, actual teach township rural school average three-and-a-half hour per day. to correct rocket science, would need sustain good organisation discipline. throw money problem would helpful. financial sector development in area finance period 1994 onward bring numerous opportunities, major impediment majority population’s interaction financial system removed. the demise racially-based restriction ownership real estate, instance, open avenue borrow towards home-ownership farming, use fix property collateral. however, removal legal impediment alone enough move rapidly satisfactory state affairs. a say goes, place one would find “houses” “jobs” dictionary. while considerable progress make extension home land ownership government programme initiative private financial sector, enough job (and accompany remuneration flows) forthcoming support sustainable home-ownership large scale needed. this also hold back extent deposit investment with, borrow from, financial sector. nevertheless, extent job create previously “unbanked” person become “banked” sufficient raise considerably amount money bank credit economy relative nominal gross domestic product. for instance, 1994 broadly define money supply, m3, amount around 47 per cent annualised nominal gross domestic product. currently ratio approximately 83 per cent. the many south african get job frequently find that, wake new salary wage flows, receive numerous offer take credit. many become overextended, suggest increase overall ratio household debt annualised disposable income 56 per cent 1994 76 per cent mid-2009. so much friction generate dispensation government introduce national credit act 2007 improve consumer protection. this accomplish measure enhance disclosure credit contract thorough screen prospective borrowers’ ability repay debt grant new loan. fix capital formation it gratify note considerable strengthen fix capital formation south african economy. in 1994 capital expenditure barely 15 per cent gross domestic product. it take long time gain

this say much self-confidence gain south african forward-looking focus society – characteristic steve biko would embrace promote tireless energy. socio-economic trend south africa come long way term rebuild heal legacy apartheid past. we recognise lot still need done. however, learn replicate evidently work review not. a clear message emerge socio-economic trend post-1994 period pay close

review 109/2009 njuguna ndung’u: tame inflation food security open remark prof njuguna ndung’u, governor central bank kenya chairman monetary policy committee, monetary policy committee seminar “taming inflation food security”, the kenya school monetary studies, nairobi, 14 august 2009. * * * permanent secretaries: ministry finance; ministry planning, national development vision 2030; ministry agriculture; ministry trade; ministry special programmes; representative development partners; chairman head government parastatals; representative private sector; distinguish guests; lady gentlemen; it give great pleasure today important seminar “taming inflation food security”. let take opportunity onset warmly welcome kenya school monetary study (ksms). a may aware, bank’s principal objective formulate implement monetary policy direct achieve maintain stability general level prices, well support economic policy government include objective growth employment. price stability important signal economy provide stable plan horizon predict future price perhaps returns. most coordination failure occur due inability forecast future price calculate, example, return investment. this seminar come time country recover effect high inflation arise supply side factor cause several shocks. these shock international well domestic dimension. they include volatile oil prices, commodity price drought condition continue pose challenge achievement bank’s core mandate price stability. give outcome – shock tend affect domestic price upwards domestic output downwards, simultaneously – rethink appropriate measure inflation target contain it. but also, appropriately compute report inflation become critical – information process report number inflation lead directly cost live adjustment (cola) request even cbk! usually, cbk must inflation target. but also consistent inflation experience profile general public well create require consistency monetary framework economic growth profile. this workshop help define appropriate inflation indicator. the emphasis seem converge come single measure inflation easily explained, analyze relate economic outcomes. but course different economic constituency understand term affect them. alternatively may want focus measure say exactly mean. these include: a) food inflation. b) “core” inflation – (define core). c) inflation (takes care above) – national inflation indicator. bi review 109/2009 1 d) for cbk, would prefer non-tradable good price index compute inflation index respond affect monetary policy directly also link exchange rate issue competitiveness. for information, lady gentleman, many country currently publish statistic tradable non-tradable inflation part dissemination inflation data. this allow central bank easily compute profile real exchange rate. e) finally, want inflation index come close measure reflect cost living. the question is, do least cost knbs player process partner. but want several indicator inflation developed? at outset, money demand side one factor drive force inflation. the one supply side. monetary policy become passive supply side factor drive domestic price inflation. this mean several indicator also bring wealth information processed. the experience; achievement inflation target constrain increase volatility food price exogenous shocks. in particular, overall month-on-month inflation increase 9.67 percent january 2007 11.1 percent june 2007, 31.5 percent may 2008 decline gradually 17.79 percent july 2009. on hand, cbk underlie inflation decline 5.15 percent january 2007 4.90 percent june 2007 rise 7.90 percent july 2009. the issue question raise volatility one measure inflation thus attract policy debate action. it important note rise overall inflation rate period attribute mainly food price account 50.5 percent overall consumer price index basket. the rise food price attribute mainly drought, supply constraint lack cultivation farmer kenya’s grain basket rift valley displace follow post poll crisis january 2008. food inflation quite volatile erratic since january 2007, increase 11.8 percent 15.9 percent december 2007, 44.2 percent may 2008 decline 24.4 percent july 2009. the volatility food inflation high period use measure volatility stand 10.72 percent compare 8.98 percent 6.19 percent fuel transport & communication inflation rates, respectively. the monetary policy committee bank concern prevail famine drought country result spike inflation appropriate policy response required. the solution; study advocate improve agricultural productivity effective way address food crisis associate high international price food security concerns. but support appropriate infrastructure processing, storage transportation food. in regard, hope seminar seek achieve follow objectives: a) agree best report inflation. b) review sources, magnitude structure inflation kenya, gain good understand dynamics. c) come feasible solution food supply problem. d) deliberate possible action plan among key stakeholder keep inflation low stable. this seminar therefore expect come resolution would form basis long term policy domestic price food security kenya. we still contend three-dimensional solution: food production; food processing; food storage transportation. 2 bi review 109/2009 let underscore important role partnership stakeholder-institutions represent today address challenge inflation. it hope partnership involve regular consultations, share information strategy gear towards seek solution supply constraint challenge food production distribution overall objective achieve price stability. this workshop re-define strengthen future partnership responsibility institution. on behalf central bank kenya monetary policy committee, let express sincere gratitude presenters, discussant participant respond invitation grace u presence seminar. i sure provide good platform share information discus feasible solutions. lady gentlemen, i take opportunity declare seminar officially open. i wish fruitful deliberations. thank you. bi review 109/2009 3 jürgen stark: monetary fiscal policy – criterion time phase crisis measure speech mr jürgen stark, member executive board european central bank, 80th kieler konjunkturgespräch, berlin, 15 september 2009. * * * lady gentlemen, a year ago today investment bank lehman brother file bankruptcy protection. this dramatic event adverse effect world economy, include euro area. it lead severe synchronise economic downturn since 1930s. but recent information encouraging. the massive response crisis part government central bank seem bear fruit. available data suggest free fall economic activity come halt global recession bottom out. however, uncertainty remain high, data economic activity likely remain volatile. the key challenge period ahead unwind timely manner extraordinary unprecedented measure take response crisis. the criterion time phase crisis measure main topic speech today. but first, i start give brief overview current economic outlook basis govern council’s assessment. i describe measure implement ecb fiscal authority detail. the economic outlook give recent developments, reason cautious optimism regard outlook economic activity. economic activity turn good expect second quarter 2009. a regard future, economic recovery likely gradual. the revival global trade, rebuild inventory positive impact policy stimulus liquidity support measure expect main driver economic activity, may see positive quarter quarter growth rate already third quarter year. but quarterly growth pattern might uneven, uncertainty surround outlook remain unusually high, give factor support growth temporary nature. this outlook broadly line september 2009 ecb staff macroeconomic projection growth euro area, revise upwards compare june 2009 eurosystem staff projections. this first upward revision since march 2007. in view govern council, risk outlook remain broadly balanced. on upside, positive impact policy measure implement may strong expected. confidence may improve fast assumed. on downside, financial sector still strained, cannot rule possibility strong protract negative feedback loop real economy financial sector may develop. concern also relate renew increase international commodity prices, intensification protectionist pressure disorderly correction global imbalances. a regard prices, annual inflation rate turn negative summer. however, temporary phenomenon, largely drive past development energy prices. annual inflation rate expect turn positive within next months, remain relatively subdued. this confirm economic monetary analysis. bi review 109/2009 1 this inflation outlook consistent september 2009 ecb staff projections, revise slightly upwards compare june projections, mainly owe high energy prices. the govern council consider risk outlook broadly balanced. on downside, downward pressure price could strong expected, due sharp contraction economic activity past year modest scale recovery foreseen. on upside, renew increase oil price strong expect increase administer price indirect tax wake fiscal consolidation effort cannot rule out. the ecb’s policy response let briefly recall ecb respond intensification crisis year ago. first all, inflationary pressure recede rapidly since last autumn, reduce rate main refinance operation 325 basis point low level see since start monetary union. the govern council regard current rate appropriate. in addition, take number non-standard measure order to: • first, support orderly function money market; • second, ease fund condition bank thereby enhance flow credit economy beyond could achieve policy interest rate reduction alone. • third, improve market liquidity important segment private debt security market. these measure come know “enhanced credit support approach”. it focus banks, main source fund euro area economy. overall, approach comprise five main build blocks: • first, full accommodation banks’ liquidity request fix rate. • second, expansion list asset eligible collateral. • third, lengthen maturity long-term refinance operations. • fourth, provision liquidity foreign currencies. • and finally, financial market support outright purchase cover bond order stimulate market traditionally important source fund banks. this decision take directly affect market segment money market, total sum allocate programme – €60 billion – may appear modest compare asset purchase perform central banks. our plan purchase amount 5% eligible outstanding cover bonds. let emphasise deliberately refrain buy government bonds, safeguard independence political influence. for reason, implement measure without form government guarantee. the implementation non-standard measure lead significant increase size eurosystem balance sheet. by end august 2009, simplify balance sheet eurosystem stand around €1,500 billion – 16% euro area gdp. compare size july 2007, shortly outbreak financial turmoil, balance sheet currently two-thirds larger. it difficult ass impact measure precisely, satisfy spread money market decline significantly since last autumn back 2 bi review 109/2009 level see bankruptcy lehman brothers. together policy rate cuts, contribute substantial decline lend rate household firms. for example, interest rate offer monetary financial institution (mfis) loan household house purchase float rate initial rate fixation one year halve since october last year. the subdue development lend attract attention, particularly give measure design support lend activity. however, consider credit develop economic downturn past, recent development credit appear broadly line recent development economic activity current outlook. in particular, past loan firm tend lag turn point business cycle. one explanation may firm tend use fund first afterwards resort external financing, lead low demand credit around turn point. base past experience, current levelling-off loan household would normally associate contraction loan firm least early 2010. have say this, course continue monitor development credit closely period ahead, especially view assess extent supply-side constraint potential limit availability credit. fiscal policy response crisis let move fiscal policy response crisis. fiscal policy play important role contain adverse impact financial economic crisis. euro area government demonstrate ability take rapid coordinate step support financial system stimulate economic activity. government support bank sector represent key element stabilisation whole financial system prevention detrimental impact real economy. the measure adopt response financial crisis consist various type financial assistance, include government guarantee interbank lending, recapitalisation financial institutions, increase coverage retail deposit insurance asset relief schemes. a well address source crisis support systemically important financial institutions, fiscal policy provide extensive stimulus aggregate demand. a first line defence, significant fiscal impulse been, continue be, deliver via automatic stabilisers, relatively strong euro area. at time, european government agree adopt expansionary fiscal measure order mitigate effect economic downturn. the past decade characterise considerable degree scepticism towards effectiveness fiscal policy go beyond operation automatic stabilisers. in respects, recent call academic policy-makers alike fiscal activism represent shift paradigm. this also lead re-emergence old dispute academic macroeconomists. it must stressed, however, government measure adopt response economic crisis carry considerable fiscal costs. the effectiveness fiscal stimulus crucially depend expectation reaction economic agents. in context, perception measure temporary trust sustainability fiscal policy crucial. so far, fiscal activism seem reasonably well coordinated, timely targeted. but challenge ensure measure temporary remains. the determination euro area government avoid fiscal stimulus welcome. however, current support measure cannot sustain forever. timely credible exit strategy withdraw exist fiscal stimulus must develop communicate soon possible. bi review 109/2009 3 to end, central bank fiscal authority prepare unwind extraordinary support measures. the phasing-out crisis measure let clear: fact discuss exit strategy mean imply implement them. but effective, need transparent. otherwise, investor may become fearful inflation concern sustainability public finances. this would doubt push long-term interest rates. for reasons, household might expect high tax future raise share income would rather save spend. all effect would, course, jeopardise gradual recovery undermine effectiveness policy stimulus. monetary policy a regard area responsibility, well prepare phase measure take response crisis. the way measure implement provide u reasonable flexibility unwind them. for example, unless decide otherwise, maturity size operation automatically decrease, start next year. consistent mandate maintain price stability, apply certain criterion implement credit support measure interest rate decisions. in unwind support continue apply criteria. not least thank political independence credibility, well equip act timely manner need arises. two element appear key. first, course, need goal mind. second, need think manage transition towards goal. a regard decision parameters, first area concern withdrawal monetary policy stimulus term key ecb interest rates. the criterion withdraw stimulus assessment risk price stability. the second area relate phasing-out liquidity credit support provide banks. in case instrument size maturity composition liquidity-providing operations. the criterion phase operation assessment financial situation and, specifically, fund risk evolves, without compromise price stability mandate. these two area interrelated. however, interest rate decision guide exclusively assessment risk price stability. our credit support measure addition drive goal alleviate fund risk thereby forestall wide systemic crisis would jeopardise primary objective price stability. the interest rate instrument size maturity composition liquidity-providing operation instrument use independently other, certain extent continually different purposes. specifically, concern fund support must come dominate monetary policy considerations. the level key interest rate will, always, adjust response change outlook price stability. but, non-standard measure target specific problem money market, decision unwind also depend fund risk evolves. we would expect gradual recovery fund market improvement credit condition non-financial sector go hand hand establishment sustain economic recovery. but impossible forecast development certainty. 4 bi review 109/2009 a scenario cannot entirely rule upside risk price stability emerge problem money market persist. we might maintain structure size balance sheet. but, time, would raise interest rate counter upside risk price stability. we would confront need steer money market interest rate high level excess liquidity continue prevail money markets. it therefore crucial monitor source fund constraint banks. we need judge whether fund constraint relate individual bank rather function money market bank system whole. our operational framework design counter fund problem individual bank level. rather, fund support design alleviate fund risk extent systemic. therefore, would seek re-establish key feature operational framework place crisis revert situation one-week main refinance operation main tool steer short-term money market rate “rate-takers” longer-term money market. base economic monetary analyses, continue monitor closely development period ahead. we ensure measure take unwind timely fashion liquidity provide absorb order counter effectively threat price stability. to sum monetary policy considerations: monetary policy measure non-standard measure take financial crisis effective alleviate fund concern banks. but need aware that, measure maintain long, negative side effects. both central bank fiscal measure may contribute weaken incentive bank clear trouble asset balance sheet monitor credit risk carefully. this, turn, may reinforce problem currently impair function financial system. in low interest rate environment foster lend unprofitable business. that, turn, would harm growth potential economy thereby prepare grind weak growth persist. very low interest rate also hamper function money market: the low money market interest rate are, low incentive bank trade fund market rather deposit safely central bank. market participant might change behaviour get accustom non-standard measures, would detrimental recovery money markets. on part, soon upside risk price stability emerge, view avoid contribute emergence another asset price bubble, would act accordingly. for reasons, paramount clear exit strategy place. fiscal policy the ecb’s exit strategy follow naturally mandate independence political influence. the credibility enjoy illustrate fact long-term inflation expectation remain firmly anchor line govern council’s definition price stability throughout crisis. fiscal authority position. one indication widen government bond spread euro area vis-à-vis german ten-year bunds since last autumn, signal market doubt fiscal authorities’ resolve bring fiscal policy back onto sustainable path. let therefore briefly elaborate important government commit clear exit strategies. in principle, unsustainable fiscal policy represent upside risk price stability possibility cannot rule debt-burdened government may resort monetary bi review 109/2009 5 financing. but let clear: option government euro area. however, high inflation country would also make difficult preserve price stability here. second, government bolster private confidence via financial economic support crisis phase, exit phase confidence must preserve via timely credible withdrawal unsustainable stimulus measures. exit strategy may reduce market concern fiscal sustainability, may help limit ricardian behaviour part consumers, could otherwise offset impact fiscal stimulus. third, recent call persistently great role government owe failure market system must rejected. historical experience show market principle remain far best basis economic system, although know market need rule exist regulatory supervisory framework enhanced. the role government scale crisis. no matter serious current crisis is, government ultimately cease perform non-government task private sector step again. fourth, fiscal position euro area country represent challenge stability growth pact. any weaken peer pressure mechanism fiscal framework rest must avoided. full compliance treaty stability growth pact necessary order preserve confidence whole framework contribute credibility fiscal exit strategy individual countries. fifth, fiscal cost crisis measure expect considerable. government support financial sector give rise government debt extensive contingent liability owe government guarantees. the effect automatic stabiliser discretionary fiscal stimulus lead sharp deterioration fiscal balances. all factors, together expect adverse fiscal impact population ageing, pose considerable risk fiscal sustainability. it appear unlikely country able rely strong gdp growth reduce debt burdens. in respect, unwind fiscal stimuli, necessary, clearly insufficient restore sustainable public finances. the structural adjustment fiscal policy new economic environment needed. moreover, potential cost stem guarantee provide bank sector take account. finally, phasing-out non-standard monetary policy measure highly predictable withdrawal communicate due time. the level transparency apply fiscal policies. government provide clear credible medium-term timetable fiscal exit strategy order help maintain predictable environment, economic agent conduct monetary policy. general principle fiscal exit strategy base considerations, government develop communicate ambitious realistic fiscal exit consolidation strategy soon possible. structural adjustment implement order reduce high debt ratio return public finance sustainable path. the timing, pace sequence exit strategy start major challenge. let summarise main criterion fiscal exit strategy main principle based. first, regard involvement financial sector, primary criterion exit strategy condition bank sector. give vital role bank system, time sequence withdrawal assistance provide financial sector utmost importance and, short medium run, even challenge task unwind fiscal stimuli. a balance need safeguard financial stability need restore market principle must maintained. the stability bank sector must put risk. however, over-long involvement government change 6 bi review 109/2009 behaviour market participant may detrimental effect competition bank sector lead ineffective allocation resources. second, regard exit high government deficit debt, government ensure withdrawal fiscal measure start late economic recovery. part job do automatically via fiscal stabiliser fiscal stimulus measure design temporary. additional fiscal adjustment is, however, needed. the phasing-out stimulus support demand closely link pick-up economic activity. give current economic outlook project public deficit debt developments, euro area government decide refrain additional expansionary measures. this decision welcome. however, far commit clear fiscal exit strategies. exit strategy set context current forthcoming excessive deficit procedure within next round stability programmes. otherwise, persistent high deficit debt would contribute high risk premia government bond interest rates. high sovereign real long-term interest rate may transmit rest economy crowd private demand. third, time pace consolidation take account additional criterion growth prospect crisis, size government deficit debt prospect long-term sustainability. give substantial effort needed, structural adjustment significantly ambitious benchmark 0.5% gdp per annum would suggest differ across countries. debt simulation show no-policy-change scenario imply explosion government debts, even 0.5 percentage point structural adjustment would sufficient bring debt ratio level 60% gdp acceptable time horizon. in particular, highly indebted country sharp deterioration fiscal balance therefore make consolidation effort least 1 percentage point per annum. fourth, consolidation strategy design line treaty stability growth pact, constitute appropriate credible framework fiscal policy coordination euro area. the pact provide degree flexibility sufficient current circumstances. any loosen framework beyond level warranted, may pose risk erode incentive mechanisms. fiscal strategy respect deadline correction excessive deficit set ecofin council line stability growth pact. fifth, case, fiscal consolidation cannot limit correction excessive deficits. the pace consolidation need maintain step good time medium-term objective achieved. the crisis clearly demonstrate country fail build safety margin good time little capacity counter economic downturn. in respect, medium-term objective must sufficiently ambitious order create room manoeuvre fiscal term next economic downturn prepare public finance future expenditure associate population ageing. all effort make ensure opportunity consolidate public finance forthcoming good time miss countries. before concluding, i would like emphasise institutional framework euro area leaf room coordination single monetary policy ecb national fiscal policies. the treaty set clear allocation responsibility monetary policy national fiscal policies, view ensure smooth function monetary union. the institutional framework grant eurosystem full independence political influence interference assign ecb primary objective maintain price stability. at time, fiscal authority responsible safeguard sustainability public finances. this mean interactions. the govern council always welcome constructive open exchange information current economic bi review 109/2009 7 situation structural reform body institution european level. the outlook fiscal policy play key role projection economic activity assessment risk price stability. in way, policy decision exclusively base assessment risk price stability, response predict fiscal authorities. the channel exchange information fiscal monetary authority also well developed. but cannot pre-commitment particular course monetary policy action. this would undermine ecb’s independence therefore violate mandate. from fiscal policy point view, note although exit monetary measure uniform across euro area, likely asymmetric fiscal impact give current substantial heterogeneity fiscal positions. a potential increase market interest rate much strong impact highly indebted countries, particular outstanding government bond short maturities. the need fiscal flexibility single monetary policy place clear premium timely credible fiscal consolidation euro area member countries. conclusion to conclude, response crisis, government central bank across globe take immediate unprecedented measures. government implement measure rescue bank sector stimulate economy. central bank low rate low level response recede inflationary pressure risks; provide ample liquidity bank system, support transmission mechanism monetary policy. the key question phase measure overall situation start return normal. this challenge task government central banks. but i confident ecb’s broad-based monetary policy strategy, show robust forward-looking, continue serve u well handle challenge. the fact risk assessment root economic monetary analysis ensure relevant information take account. the crisis yet over. the time exit yet come. but i assure continue monitor closely development period ahead, order best possible position continue deliver task maintain price stability medium term, thereby support purchase power euro area citizens. 8 bi review 109/2009 bi

start explanation concept “macroprudence,” order so, useful first explain concept “microprudence,” contrasts. it could say microprudence describe conventional idea behind policy approach ensure

approach incorporate term “macroprudence” seek capture. in order see mean specifically, let u consider background recent financial crisis. background global financial crisis the recent financial crisis may reach global scale involve new financial product players, essentially classic example rise collapse economic bubble.3 in period precede recent crisis, especially around mid-2000s, unite state european economy experience large-scale credit bubble. it burst credit bubble trigger financial crisis, aggravate failure lehman brother autumn 2008. during bubble period, risk-taking excessive. look behavior financial institutions, example, involve accumulation excessive leverage maturity mismatch asset liabilities. typically, excessive leverage take refer increase debt beyond point appropriate balance capital debt. more generally, however, excessive leverage take mean excessive risk-taking, include off-balance transactions, relative capital base. at time financial crisis, excessive leverage show capital shortage solvency problem suffer financial institutions. on hand, term “maturity mismatch” refer finance long-term asset use short-term debt, run-up recent financial

reveal variety issues. one remarkable increase leverage take place traditional bank business outside bank business. for example, financial institution hold securitized product trade books, risk weight capital adequacy regulation small, although late turn highly risky financial products. while size trade book le 10 percent total asset japanese financial institutions, financial institution unite state europe, reach 40 percent. consequently, risk-asset base capital ratio use yardstick, major financial institutions’ leverage, least superficially, seem excessive, capital base appear sufficient. investment securitized product major financial institution carry sivs set up, fund sivs provide credit parent financial institutions. a result, late revealed, risk shoulder parent financial institution themselves. in case this, necessary regulatory supervisory response would accurately gauge risk carry financial institution necessary capital, require individual financial institution hold capital. can problem solve microprudence alone? such regulatory supervisory response base microprudence necessary importance underestimated. a i explain detail later, bank also conduct on-site examination off-site monitor financial institutions, carry various examination financial institutions’ capital, liquidity, risk management, give necessary advice. however, i believe recent global financial crisis show difficult achieve financial system stability contribute sustainable growth economy, ultimate aim financial system stability, rely regulation supervision base microprudential principles. the first reason without consider relationship economic financial activities, essentially impossible determine optimal level capital liquidity requirements. if absolute priority give financial system stability, capital liquidity requirement inevitably raise significantly, inherent role expect financial institution engage leverage maturity mismatch asset liabilities. financial institution carry financial intermediary function certain amount capital, raise fund short-term debt instrument invest long-term assets, provide value add provision liquidity settlement services. if financial institution cannot properly fulfill financial functions, economy grow. of course, reality, capital adequacy ratio 100 percent required, highlight here, conventional regulation supervision also fact base sort macroeconomic assessment relationship financial system economic activity well interaction financial systems. however, i believe effort take macroeconomic perspective account systematic manner insufficient. 4 bi review 168/2009 the second reason i think microprudence alone insufficient financial institutions’ incentive greatly affect macroeconomic factors. on point, i recall famous remark make surface subprime mortgage problem ceo major financial institution “while music playing, dance.” if, future, benign economic condition similar time, namely high economic growth, low inflation, low interest rates, low market volatility continue long time, would manager financial institution investor choose different management investment strategies? moreover, even one choose different strategy oneself, strategy would one expect competitor take? follow line reasoning, become clear always someone take risks. ultimately, risk financial system whole affect micro-level incentive great extent also macro-level incentives, is, economic financial environment. if follow line reasoning, order ensure stability financial system, microprudence, secure soundness individual financial institutions, macroprudence, pay attention risk financial system whole, equally necessary. ii. macroprudential perspective there various way ass risk financial system whole macroprudential perspective, is, perspective pay attention interconnectedness economic activity, financial markets, financial institutions’ behavior. recently, two perspective “dimensions” recognize important: first concern cross-sectional risk particular point time, second concern evolution risk future. the cross-sectional dimension the “cross-sectional dimension” concern risk financial system whole particular point time particularly focus interconnectedness risk financial institution’s portfolio financial products. when loan investment financial institution concentrate specific industry, financial institution assume large risk. the concentration loan real estate industry classic example. and go specific financial institution go also financial system whole. even exposure individual financial institution concentrate specific industry, many financial institution take similar positions, financial system whole assume large risk. if shock affect value specific type exposure, example, value real estate, financial institution try reduce exposure asset time, financial institution take action, reduction exposure difficult. under circumstances, market liquidity asset question fund liquidity decline significantly, exacerbate losses. such herd behavior call “crowded trade” arise variety reasons. while typically arise convergence market participants’ view economic prospects, also spur convergence risk management methods. a financial technique advance, management risk also become complicated. in situation, incentive financial institution sufficient resource develop risk management method adopt risk management method develop financial institution increases. when kind situation become widespread, financial institutions’ exposure type asset become similar, market swing also become volatile time transaction become synchronized. bi review 168/2009 5 the time dimension the second macroprudential dimension, “time dimension,” concern dynamic change risks, focus risk inherent financial system change time. in run-up crisis, see period prior recent crisis, benign economic condition continue time, economic actor become optimistic risk assessment, risk tolerance increases. a result, economic actors’ risk-taking stance become aggressive, asset price rise leverage increases, lead even aggressive risk-taking stances. our understand endogenous change risk-taking stance, is, risk-taking channel, extremely limited. what clear, however, change greatly influence economic financial environment, i mention earlier. financial imbalance accumulate process risk-taking cannot sustain indefinitely eventually balance sheet adjustment take place. such adjustment proceed gradually beginning. however, trigger kind shock, crisis emerge form fund liquidity shortage become severe confidence among market participant collapses. this phenomenon profit-seeking behavior financial institution amplify financial economic cycle refer “procyclicality” another important dimension assessment apart aforementioned cross-sectional network perspective. iii. approach take account macroprudence with importance macroprudence recognized, sort approach central bank regulatory supervisory authority take protect stability financial system? monetary policy first, necessary central bank take macroprudential perspective conduct monetary policy. needle say, purpose monetary policy contribute sustainable growth price stability. look back price development past quarter century, inflation gradually decline say many central bank successful term achieve price stability. however, term financial system stability, frequency bubble financial crisis increase past quarter century, major episode include japan’s financial crisis follow burst bubble, east asian financial crisis, credit bubble unite state europe, recent global financial crisis. moreover, ironically, bubble arise environment low inflation. while cause bubble complex, one major cause case emergence sense, amid continue benign economic condition high growth, low inflation, low interest rates, liquidity always available drop hat. while i think accommodative monetary condition alone lead bubble, seem also cannot deny expectation prolong accommodative monetary environment lead excessive leverage maturity mismatches, thereby accelerate generation bubble. price stability extremely important policy objective central bank, central bank conduct monetary policy watch short-term price developments, may induce large economic fluctuation result harm price stability medium- long-term. although frequently use phrase context “a trade-off price stability financial system stability,” fact understand sense true trade-off lie “current economic stability future economic stability.” the intensify discussion follow recent financial crisis appropriate monetary policy framework, include discussion country adopt inflation targeting, reflect considerations. therefore, conduct monetary policy, necessary get habit assess economy lens price development lens financial 6 bi review 168/2009 imbalances. this exactly bank japan assessment monetary policy “two perspectives” aim at. financial supervision base risk assessment financial system whole second, i would like emphasize importance proper supervision. the experience recent crisis reconfirm behavior financial institution sometimes become excessive, proper supervision necessary prevent happening. in context, course important supervisory authority ass soundness individual financial institution focus risk unique financial institution provide appropriate supervision. in addition, also important assess, note “dimensions” i explained, risk financial system whole utilize information gain conduct supervision individual institutions. this may typical example “easier say done,” represent unavoidable challenge. design financial regulation supervision the third point concern design financial regulation supervision take account macroprudential perspective. various discussion issue go moment one focus review capital adequacy requirement perspective mitigate procyclicality. concern capital adequacy ratio banks, one issue identify procyclicality cause decrease credit risk economic boom increase credit risk recession, profit loss relate financial market transaction show similar procyclical tendency. when benign financial economic condition continue certain period, market risk estimate use data obtain period likely underestimate actual size risk. a result, economic boom, financial institution lend aggressively capital base increase due high profits, lead increase lend through, example, rise asset prices. similarly, reverse occur recession. discussion therefore underway mitigate procyclicality, idea include lengthen period asset include risk account avoid excessive fluctuation risk-weighted asset whether introduce framework countercyclical capital buffers. the underlie idea framework implement capital adequacy rule countercyclical manner require financial institution build capital economic condition favorable, could draw economic condition deteriorate. i believe proposal use capital adequacy regulation mitigate procyclicality reinforce capital base go right direction likely contribute financial system stability. however, macroeconomic perspective, must avoid strengthen regulation impair economic stability. for reason, important secure flexibility, example, procedure time implementation new capital adequacy rule take financial economic condition country around world account. in regard, also articulate consultative proposal review rule recently release basel committee, new rule implement financial condition improve economic recovery ensured. the account system the account system also element affect behavior financial institution addition monetary policy financial regulation supervision. the account system directly affect assessment profitability asset hold financial institutions. for instance, autumn 2008, function market declined, price securitized product fell once, lead concern capital shortage financial institutions. this paralyze market function intensify downward bi review 168/2009 7 spiral. this course event illustrate method assess financial product account system overall affect financial institutions’ behavior financial system. therefore, various international discussion take place design system field account could contribute financial system stability. for example, show market liquidity appear dry up, possible value financial asset price calculate models. there also proposal regard revision loan loss provisions. the reason current accrual basis account method tend reinforce procyclicality banks’ profit rapidly squeeze economic condition deteriorate bank increase provisions. while provision method basis expect losses, allow early recognition future losses, currently discussed, view necessary consider proposal variety aspects, degree would fulfill intend goal mitigate procyclicality, whether put practice, whether able ensure transparency, primary role accounting. iv. the role bank japan have explain role macroprudence, i would like explain role bank ensure stability financial system. i would like emphasize follow five point particular. the first point bank japan aim price stability also financial system stability. the bank japan act clearly stipulate one bank’s institutional objective “to ensure smooth settlement fund among bank financial institutions, thereby contribute maintenance stability financial system.” the fact bank japan recent financial crisis decide implement measure extraordinary central bank, purchase stock hold financial institution provision subordinate loans, ultimately achieve objective stipulate bank japan act. the second point bank play role “lender last resort.” the bank japan “the bank banks” contribute ensure financial system stability provide fund lender last resort judge necessary prevent materialization systemic risk. to avoid provision fund give rise moral hazard, bank clarify basic think form so-called “four principle special loans.” the third point bank collect various type information financial institution secure objective ensure stability financial system. while macroprudence important, prerequisite that, microprudence also critical. a long bank extend loan financial institution “lender last resort,” need sufficient knowledge financial institutions’ business performance quality assets. for reason, bank japan act grant bank right conduct on-site examination financial institution deposit account bank. of course, conceivable situation arise where, time financial institution come bank, already late. therefore, conduct on-site examinations, bank carry inspection also provide various kind advice guidance need arises. in addition conduct on-site examinations, bank also strive gauge business performance risk management, liquidity management, wide range financial institutions, include security companies, daily off-site monitoring. at time financial market undergo substantial changes, important channel obtain information directly financial institution – something strongly reaffirm phase autumn 2008 onward. the fourth point bank conduct risk assessment financial system whole. the bank analyze ass financial system whole macroprudential perspective make use information individual financial 8 bi review 168/2009 institution well information obtain daily monetary policy operation operation payment settlement system. at time, bank strive use macro-assessment obtain way inform on-site examination off-site monitoring. however, although everyone would agree integrate macro micro perspective important task, properly, research indispensable. because charge conduct monetary policy, necessary organizational culture ass economic situation base macroeconomic analysis well establish within central banks. a u bank japan, continue attach great importance information insight gather on-site examinations, off-site monitoring, bank’s bank business, strive accurately gauge risk financial system whole macroeconomic analysis research activities. the fifth point bank participate international discussion regulation supervision engage review regulation supervision. reflect globalization finance, grow tendency broad framework financial regulation supervision determine international discussions. the bank, together financial service agency (fsa), take part discussion financial regulatory supervisory reform various international forum basel committee bank supervision financial stability board, i attend many forums. give robust global financial system common interest countries, i believe critical country contribute construction internationally consistent rule establish regulatory supervisory framework properly reflect difference countries, financial structure. the bank continue make contribution areas. when compare system ensure financial system stability immediately recent crisis central bank’s point view, country divide two groups. in one, include unite states, italy, netherlands, many asian countries, regulation supervision carry central bank, either alone cooperation authorities. in group, include unite kingdom australia, central bank involve regulation supervision. japan could regard fall two groups: bank japan regulatory authority financial institutions, but, mention earlier, base provision bank japan act, conduct on-site examination financial institution provide various kind advice guidance need arises. financial regulatory supervisory system around world decide upon reflect difference countries’ financial structure, stage economic development, historical background, thus uniform set-up correct countries. be may, recent crisis show clearly indispensable central bank involve one form another ensure stability financial system central bank play significant role area macroprudential supervision. here japan, system fsa, charge financial administration deal regulation supervision, bank japan, central bank, cooperate fulfill respective function ensure stability financial system. while seem fair say japan’s financial system remain relatively stable compare unite state europe recent crisis, bank will, cooperation fsa, continue strive ensure stability financial system. close remark in closing, i would like say word importance information infrastructure ensure financial system stability. in order analyze financial system whole, essential information accessible investor market participants. on point, disclosure regard risk inherent individual financial institution specific bi review 168/2009 9 financial product critical. in addition, macroprudential perspective importance statistic cover financial market whole need underscored. at beginning, i point one cause recent global financial crisis widen maturity mismatch financial institution regard liquidity lack habit check development macro basis. although, crisis erupted, benefit hindsight, locational bank statistic release quarterly bank international settlement show remarkable increase u.s. dollar maturity mismatch financial institution advance economies, particularly european economies, recent years.4 moreover, although experience past bubble clearly show fluctuation real estate price great impact financial system, japan, example, little price information real estate transaction gather statistic field far satisfactory. although compilation statistic place burden provide data, data represent one critical part information necessary ensure stability financial system. while i point importance disclosure information statistic concern financial institution financial products, go without say ultimately require proper analysis base information. during recent crisis, trust credit rat information declined. regard credit ratings, various problem highlighted.5 but indeed important issues, would balance criticize credit ratings. i mention think macroprudence, two dimension important, is, cross-sectional dimension time dimension, properly reflect two dimension analysis security seem like particularly difficult challenge. however, challenge addressed, value micro analysis also declines. at rate, go without say role play security analysts, expert kind analysis, substantial. one major element underpin liquidity financial market variety, regard role security analyst provide variety analysis base independent judgment quite important. information give mean knowledge, experience, philosophy experts, regard, too, high hope expectation security analysts. thank you. 4 for detail discussion issue, see march 2009 issue

review 168/2009 create good mutual knowledge economy foster long-term cooperation financial issues. we consider experience relevant montenegro scale economy, also similarity supervisory structures. in accession process learn several major lessons. bulgaria ask transitional period derogation concern bank sector acquis communautaire. furthermore, eu directive sector transpose time long deadlines. this approach turn success since early adoption eu rule financial supervision contribute smooth function financial market foster stability financial system. one main key smooth transition accession process cooperation institution involve financial regulation supervision. the respect independence financial supervision authority cooperation important indicator preparedness eu accession. i would like emphasise particular requirement institutional financial personal independence central bank stipulate article 130 lisbon treaty. let turn challenge ahead project. first all, eu response crisis envisage fundamental change legal institutional framework financial regulation. most eu directive regulation currently changed. (mr. simeonov talk later) this challenge project, i would like suggest take consideration late eu acquis communautaire joint work. that include team expert member eu committee work group area financial supervision, include committee european bank supervisors, economic financial committee, financial service committee, committee european security regulators, novelty constructed. this help

foundation association foreign bank italy, milan, 20 november 2009. * * * 1. introduction i happy participate seminar mark quarter century since foundation association foreign bank italy. i witness begin association encouragement guido rosa, vittorio foroni lo faro remigio saracino, always ready bring problem foreign banks, mainly present branch back then, encounter italy. these twenty-five intense year see succession phase growth recession, enormous change finance real economy, open national markets, steady integration main financial system introduction euro. the last two year particularly difficult, mark deep far-reaching crisis that, financial sector, make evident distort incentives, opportunistic behaviour widespread vulnerability often fully perceived. the crisis seem loosen grip. the main international institution agree, basis late cyclical indicators, economic activity stop contracting; improvement indicator consumer business confidence suggest come month bring recovery, though slow one. the state financial system also improved; wholesale retail markets, fundamental procurement fund exchange financial products, appear gradually get back gear. but far pre-crisis level output employment. in many countries, include italy, magnitude crisis effect real economy year rapid growth need return levels. the weak international recovery see mainly drive support measure put place government main countries. the expansion proceed fast pace emerge countries, particular asia, show great capacity resist react – perhaps part lesson learn crisis end last millennium. hopefully, careful consistent economic policy enable wave recovery extend fully advance economy italy. in financial field, major item agenda two: swiftly put place new regulatory supervisory framework remedy deficiency bring crisis, make financial system fully operational ensure, italy elsewhere, flow resource need accompany sustain economic recovery. the process stabilize strengthen financial system rewrite rule proceed accord calendar set leader g20 financial stability board (fsb). the set reforms, enacted, increase financial system’s resilience shocks, encourage development model intermediation orient long-term results, eliminate incentive excessive risk-taking stimulate far-sighted behaviour base sound prudent management intermediaries. concern bank system unable provide sufficient support economy particularly strong italy, least financial structure small medium-sized enterprises, heavily dependent bank credit historically skew towards short-term debt. the crisis – must – opportunity resolute action 2 bi review 168/2009 rebalance structure firms’ liabilities. in selection activity, bank must able ass firms’ long-term growth potential, assist development. in context, contribution foreign bank significant, especially segment economy. in italy today, branch subsidiary foreign intermediary account one fifth bank intermediation, share comparable many advance economies. an analysis past useful identify contribution foreign bank make host market – term competitiveness, innovation quality quantity service provide – also outline possible future contribution. this several determinants: type foreign intermediaries, business model, objectives, result impact prices. the bank italy follow matter closely; indeed, could otherwise. i therefore retrace stage success story foreign banks’ expand role italy highlight difficulty must overcome progress may continue benefit italian economy, implication bank italy. 2. internationalization there several reason bank may decide enter foreign markets: i) take advantage host country’s growth potential thereby tap new profit opportunities; ii) follow customer abroad; iii) diversify activity. a recent survey european central bank driver international expansion large european bank group highlight two main factors. some 80 per cent respondent declare expansion abroad aim exploit growth opportunity host market thereby increase profit margins, 59 per cent cite need provide service customer operate abroad;1 business diversification le important goal. in past decade integration international financial system intensify extend bank system. in many country number market share foreign intermediary grow result expansion bank groups’ activity beyond national border increase cross-border merger acquisitions. the process, initially involve financial market emerge countries, spread mature economies, albeit limit extent.2 in european union, cross-border bank merger

europe, nature benefit risk generate integration bank system similar scale smaller. within european union see reduction interest rate differential convergence towards competitive levels. 3. foreign bank italy i say foreign bank spur enter country growth prospect specific market segment host-country’s intermediary enjoy locational advantage lag adapt supply. our history provide one example this. the number foreign intermediary italy rise continually last twenty-five years, thirty mid-1980s one hundred today. their market share significant. in 2007, late year data international comparison, share total bank asset 17.4 per cent, high correspond figure germany, france spain (11.1, 12.9 11.6 per cent, respectively). it decline slightly first half year, 16 per cent, owe international financial crisis exit intermediary italian market. foreign banks’ reason enter italy change years. a first substantial inflow date late 1970s early 1980s, parallel growth world trade business expansion multinational corporations. many foreign bank begin operate italy branches, mainly order serve prime customer spot. another factor small importance objective take advantage administrative constraint burden operation italian banks. in particular, foreign intermediary could exploit parent banks’ foreign currency funding, use make foreign currency loan non-bank customer italian banks, possibility raise fund moderate cost interbank market. foreign bank account 4 per cent total assets, high market share loan non-bank customer commitment contingent liabilities. the profit margin achieve loan investment substantial, especially compare obtain home countries. in first phase, mark strong regulatory constraint activity italian banks, foreign intermediary help decisively expand range services, especially financial services, offer customers. on hand, scant presence retail bank market limit contribution growth competition. start mid-1980s italian bank system undergo progressive liberalization modernization whose milestone removal ceiling growth bank lending, abolition security investment requirement lift restriction branching. all affect activity foreign banks, contract – significantly several instance – business segments. by 1990 share total asset fall 2.6 per cent loan non-bank customer 3 per cent. 4 bi review 168/2009 in response developments, foreign intermediary move increasingly wholesale financial markets, relatively backward time good potential growth: quickly expand presence security business, asset management services, correspondent bank (cash management customers, well hedge foreign exchange transactions) investment bank (in particular raise fund directly capital market place equity bond issue syndicate loans). in mid-1990s, foreign banks’ off-balance-sheet transaction exceed 42 per cent system’s total, mainly owe large volume forward business security derivatives. throughout phase, popular type establishment still branch,

heavy loss substantial rise allocation provisions. the reason good performance italian subsidiary focus retail banking. cost-cutting measures, include downsizing, also contributed. the difference type business branch subsidiary reflect recent performance lend two categories. in case branches, long period, summer 2008, rate growth lend 20 per cent, owe sharp expansion syndicate loan medium-large

competition lead drop interest rate medium long-term mortgage loan households. the annual reduction average 15 basis point period 1997–2006 18 basis point last five years. more recently, average collateral medium long-term loan also decreased, presumably result rise loan-to-value ratios. the entry foreign bank appear, however, affect interest rate apply firms, either short medium-to-long-term

systems. effort must continue make activity even effective secure customers. derivative business expose bank major legal reputational risks, numerous ongoing legal dispute testify. for time intensify activity front, remind bank need proper conduct careful risk assessment, monitor phenomenon, include via target on-site controls. we must low guard. one aspect condition supervisory activity availability full information activity foreign branches, extent also subsidiary present italy, bi review 168/2009 7 role merely distribute product develop abroad, often london. in case become difficult obtain, even on-site examinations, documentation need reconstruct operation foreign intermediary italy; case transaction question complex, expose bank high operational, legal reputational risk difficult quantify. in accordance division responsibility community legislation, need great cooperation foreign intermediary authority country offer services. improvement transparency necessary: foreign intermediary must also comply advertise obligations, follow rule contract and, general, set customer relation completely correct basis. it essential, particular, careful selection make agent responsible distribute credit cards, sector several foreign bank active. a qualitative leap also call sensitive issue money laundering, great commitment top management, intensive staff train stringent controls. at time find phenomenon underestimate foreign parent bank set programme organize reorganize italian units. the supervision foreign bank must reconcile requirement control institution systemic importance national territory power supervisory authority country parent company established. this delicate process, require balance pragmatic approach. the bank italy step activity perform college supervisors. in addition validate internal risk-measurement systems, colleges’ activity gradually – without difficulty – extend broad issues, concern stability cross-border bank groups. 5. development regulation supervision the integration market broad process internationalization facilitate spread instability, even localize first, require coordinate response. this essential proceed rapidly introduce new common rule financial sector, aim reduce risk systemic crises, also achieve great homogeneity actual application strengthen cooperation national supervisory authorities. the proposal reform rule touch numerous issues: capital adequacy banks, size regulatory perimeter, plan measure attenuate pro-cyclicality bank activity, capital buffers, introduction limit financial leverage intermediaries, improvement corporate governance executive compensation mechanisms, role systemically important intermediaries, integration macro-prudential micro-prudential supervision, international coordination authority supervise cross-border institutions. effective supervision international group institution truly integrate monitor process require overcome divergence still find approach various authorities, especially definition scope consolidation bank groups, application basel pillar 2, treatment liquidity risk, report off-balance-sheet vehicles, account standard prudential reporting. the fsb, leadership governor bank italy, conclude international college supervisor suitable instrument strengthen cooperation information exchange among national supervisory authority involve oversight cross-border groups. this instrument, already current within european union amply utilize italy, reinforce near future extend cross-border groups. to make action effective, clear legislative framework precise definition power duty college necessary. for part, work well place information exchange develop real 8 bi review 168/2009 capability joint assessment risk group component effective coordination supervisory action. colleges’ decision-making power need reinforced, machinery settle dispute powerful coordinate role consolidate supervisor. this process complement great recognition role parent company community legislation bank group establish proper distribution cost benefit among component group. the italian law bank group offer useful point reference here. in addition, college need become forum integrate risk assessment group main components, order plan supervisory action corrective intervention. this require development common methodology share information, include central database accessible authority within college, favour joint monitor main risks. there problem management crisis involve cross-border groups. in particular, lack agreement method share cost intervention. in practice, government support go exclusively national member trouble group sustain group whole. supervisory college play central role group crisis occurred, would desirable. even case cooperation think produce good degree uniformity regulatory approaches, national need practice prevailed. the “too-big-to-fail” syndrome currently discussion international fora, various propose remedies, include imposition additional capital requirement other, radical proposal reduce size interdependence group structure global systemic relevance. the debate still beginning, eventual result could considerable impact market integration. the european commission work set proposal improve cooperation among national supervisors, harmonize crisis management resolution measure clarify standard share cost bank crisis among countries. the significant proposal for: enhance quality quantity information home host supervisor exchange, normal time crises; host supervisors’ participation colleges, include case involve important branch subsidiaries; create new european system financial supervisor (esfs) group three sectoral agency (the european bank authority, european insurance occupational pension authority european security market authority), effective supervision major european groups; form new european systemic risk board, order sharpen macro-prudential focus supervisory policy. a week ago commission release consultation document set project enhance supervisory authorities’ early intervention ail banks, crisis management resolution. the idea revise european company bankruptcy law, together compulsory deposit insurance schemes, and, generally, finance crisis intervention measures. the set regulatory change consideration, implemented, significant impact conduct bank supervision national foreign intermediary alike role responsibility various authorities. there period intense dialogue intermediaries, whose organizational business model could affected. 6. conclusion i believe italian experience past twenty-five year positive whole. foreign bank significantly enlarge presence italy help spread bi review 168/2009 9 new business models, different even home markets. these foreign intermediary contribute substantially growth italian bank industry term innovation, service quality quantity, stiff competition. italian saver investor benefited. the contribution great market segments, le noticeable others. during recent crisis, italy – unlike country – presence foreign bank cause strain inflict loss italian saver investors. however, highly diversify line business rapidly evolve external environment increase risk exposure, especially segments. the bank italy accordingly adjust supervisory approach instrument guarantee continue effectiveness action, adapt evolution risks. in recent year chief focus liquidity, operational, legal reputational risks. the close integration financial market heighten danger contagion. the debate effectiveness supervision major cross-border groups, often over-complex organization, still way. obviously, question range beyond national confines. if crisis – unquestionably – global, review reinforcement supervisory architecture need internationally coordinate possible. the regulatory response cure financial system prove borderless highly interconnect cannot mark divergent national emphasis approaches. it must follow common guideline method application base share principles. otherwise, would leave open regulatory arbitrage opportunism part large global players. in new framework cannot must room supervisor favour financial marketplace light regulation. there broad international consensus need common rules, uniform supervisory measures, severe cogent enforcement, enhancement role supervisory college cooperation among authorities. hopefully, consensus translate rapidly practical action. the bank italy convince stepped-up cooperation collaboration best way minimize risk new crisis avoid recurrence severe damage sustain last two years. a authority responsible prudential supervision italy, scrupulously apply rule agree internationally europe, tandem especially careful severe controls. this every day. recent experience show necessary maintain course. 10 bi review 168/2009 annex (tables figures) table 1 presence foreign bank eu country (with reference end 2007)

philipp hildebrand: review international financial system introductory remark mr philipp hildebrand, vice-chairman govern board swiss national bank, end-of-year medium news conference, zurich, 10 december 2009. * * * 1. introduction at news conference june year speak gradual calm general financial market environment, although outlook remain uncertain. since see majority bank return profitability. the horror story report almost daily year ago disappeared. it tempt go back business usual. however, must forget – year ago – international financial system brink collapse. support package unprecedented size put together banks. exceptional monetary fiscal measure require combat dramatic plunge global economy – measure keep place current time. only narrow margin complete collapse financial system avoid danger major depression averted. this experience clearly show u principle sustainability need much dominant element development international financial system previously. this serf interest government taxpayers; also fundamental interest financial system itself, since impossible future crisis could outstrip resource monetary fiscal policy, thus render impossible rescue systemically important banks. 2. international approach consequently, broad international consensus relevant authority objective future regulatory measure be. the financial stability board (fsb), switzerland active participant, clearly formulate objectives. the financial system must bring point contribute sustain economic growth. never must allow combine high risk minimal safety buffers. moreover, step must take avoid profit privatise loss bear public large. in essence, two way achieve goal. the first approach adopt preventative measure aim reduce probability bank collapse systemic crisis. this do increase safety buff – example, impose high capital liquidity requirements. the second approach take step design reduce cost crisis already occurred. 2.1 prevention at international level, implementation preventative measure already well advanced, basel committee bank supervision – coordination decision g20 fsb – decide important measure field capital liquidity regulation. the consultation package matter publish early 2010. the measure design strengthen capital include strict calibration risk weight determine regulatory capital, improvement quality capital buff direct limitation level debt (leverage ratio). the combine effect measure 2 bi review 167/2009 analyse basel committee course 2010 order calibrate overall capital requirements. liquidity regulation measure aim secure financial institutions’ flow liquidity, particularly time crisis. the basel committee propose global minimum standard liquidity regulation. this ensure financial institution build liquidity buff allow remain liquid short-term medium-term stress scenarios. in line decision basel committee, already implement strict risk-weighted capital requirement switzerland, supplement leverage ratio. the capital requirement design anticyclical, i.e. good times, bank require build capital buff excess give minimum level. by contrast, bad times, capital buff permit fall level. a new liquidity regulation currently test calibration phase. this regulation take account balance-sheet off-balance-sheet item relevance liquidity considerations, base – far possible – internal bank liquidity management principles. it make big bank resilient disturbance interbank market larger-scale withdrawal deposits. it promote longer-term finance well higher-rated security capable generate liquidity even stress market environment. the new regulation due come force second quarter 2010. these advance broad consensus achieve international level certainly regard positive achievements. however, far apply preventative measures. a mention previously, measure serve reduce probability crisis, cannot always prevent occurrence. another crisis inevitable must prepare it. 3. resolution measure needed; “too big fail” big challenge consequently, need tool substantially reduce cost crisis. the legacy current crisis bank system large international institution enjoy virtual state guarantee. the fact systemically important bank enjoy guarantee openly recognise problem bank sector, too. a guarantee kind contradict basic principle market economy present u situation cannot tolerated. it must possible financial institution, even large one, fail, without threaten future either financial system real economy. in last two years, risk present systemically important bank stability financial system economy general become evident. first, principle, systemically important institution incentive enter excessive risk (moral hazard). should risk materialise, lead loss unimaginable dimensions, indeed occurred. second, potential cost support systemically important bank enormous. third, large systemically important institution compare size country’s economy, great likelihood cost question exceed capacity individual country bear (the “too big rescue” issue). the leader g20 country quick recognise significance risk ask financial stability board elaborate proposal end october 2010 “too big fail” “too big rescue” issue could addressed. in interim report matter publish begin november 2009, fsb focus three elements. at time, closely monitor development additional proposal national international level. from point view fsb, possibility conduct orderly resolution fail cross-border financial institution important element find solution “too big fail” “too big rescue” issues. effective communication relevant bi review 167/2009 3 supervisory authority well forward-looking elaboration emergency procedure indispensible process. internationally recognise regulation dissolution systemically important institution enforce jurisdiction doubt splendid objective. in real world, however, different national regulation continue exist field. from point view, reciprocal recognition national regulation mutually compatible, associate adjustment structure processes, realistic objective. the second element propose fsb supplement increase capital liquidity requirement various measure address organisational structure systemically important financial institutions. measure kind could, instance, create possibility extract operation important economy liquidate remain operations. the third element solution envisage fsb financial market infrastructure whose design ensure that, far possible, minimise destabilise effect event bank collapse. central counterparties play special role respect. thus, market clear central counterparty, market participant one single counterparty, rather numerous bilateral business relationships, complexity financial system significantly reduced. what even important, however, fact that, event bank collapse, central counterparty guarantee fulfil commitment enter respect market participants, thereby eliminate traditional domino effect. that why, together central bank supervisory authorities, snb support banks’ ongoing effort clear large part enormous over-the-counter derivative market central counterparties. these central counterparties come cost, since go without say must run sound risk management system. for even central counterparty could threaten failure. since consequence event would catastrophic, central counterparties need command sufficient financial resource ensure withstand failure large market participant, even extreme market conditions. 4. political responsibility the snb invest substantial resource actively carry forward approach solve “too big fail” “too big rescue” issue outline – international body like fsb basel committee, also national level, conjunction finma. the reason obvious. give particular importance bank sector, two big bank hold key position domestic loan deposit market, “too big fail” “too big rescue” issue particular significance switzerland. consequently, need conscious fact measure may need international standard. for reason dependent upon political support order make financial system resistant stable regard “too big fail” “too big rescue” issues. if succeeds, competitive position swiss bank sector reinforce long-term result increase safety, reliability credibility. the fact swiss federal council appoint commission expert subject “too big fail” important step, welcome. the willingness big bank participate actively elaborate solution “too big fail” “too big rescue” issue also welcome. these late development clearly show urgent problem are. lady gentlemen, manage fundamentally reform financial system, fear future crisis even great dimension trigger strong protectionist regulatory reaction damage do extend even market economy owe prosperity. we owe future generation take action danger. do nothing option. bi review 167/2009 1 norman t l chan: the risk asset-price bubble speech mr norman tl chan, chief executive hong kong monetary authority, hong kong economic summit, hong kong, 14 december 2009. * * * introduction 1. i honour opportunity speak today hong kong economic summit. potential risk asset bubble 2. recently, many people hong kong become concern emergence asset-price bubble. a know, interest rate low due extremely loose monetary policy around world. attract promise outlook economic recovery, large amount fund flow asia, include hong kong. from october last year now, hk$640 billion flow hong kong dollar. this certainly exert upward pressure local asset markets. i sure aware hong kong asset market become active again. in particular, price residential property rise 10 consecutive month begin year, price turnover return level saw financial crisis. many people ask whether already bubble. 3. bull market normally occur time rapid economic growth, abundant liquidity strong investment sentiment. however, far bull market develop become bubble, easy answer. there view international community difficult identify asset bubble materialise even already formed. this true certain extent. for example, property price hong kong increase nearly 20-fold past 30 years. flat taikoo shing, large residential estate hong kong island, sell $300-400 square foot 70’s built. the price spiral upwards $1,000 square foot 80’s reach peak nearly $10,000 square foot 1997. although up down property price hong kong past 30 years, trend basically up. during upward leg, ordinary middle-class household usually felt price high difficult afford, always question whether bubble develop property market. however, benefit hindsight, rise 70’s 80’s result bubble support economic fundamentals, include growth productivity household incomes. a real massive bubble occur 90’s result bull market. however, many people time try explain irrational surge price part “hong kong miracle”. the bubble subsequent burst third quarter 1997 deal severe blow hong kong. we experience economic contraction five consecutive quarter property price plunge 60%. many family find trap “negative equity”, unemployment rate 8%. hong kong begin recover 2003 six years’ hard struggle. i sure experience still fresh memory. 4. japan another good example. it enjoy rapid economic development world war ii, quickly become powerful industrial nation. during late 80’s stock property market booming, huge bubble created, realise afterwards. few people spot emergence bubble time, extraordinary irrational exuberance interpret “japanese miracle”. we know disaster “japanese miracle” people. twenty year on, nikkei index still hover around 10,000 level, quarter peak 39,000, average residential land price six major city equivalent third level two decade 2 bi review 167/2009 ago. of course, structural problem prevent japanese recovery long period. 5. the current global financial crisis cause burst property bubble us, leave many financial institution stress. for take view asset bubble cannot identify certainty, neither appropriate necessary government take action burst them. support view come stock market crash 1987 collapse it bubble 2000. in cases, central bank able stabilise financial market rapidly aggressively cut interest rate inject large amount liquidity market, economy employment quickly resume upward paths. but situation may different time. because property financial market closely inter-locked, risk disperse bundle sub-prime security financial derivatives, large bubble formed. the burst bubble cause great damage european u economy people europe america pay unprecedented price. the u government use us$700 billion bail bank car manufacturers, uk government spend gbp 76 billion rescue royal bank scotland lloyd bank alone. many european government also bail bank systems, include injection capital large bank dutch belgian governments. 6. base experience asia past two decades, i believe asset-price bubbles, rather inflation, pose great risk financial stability. my reason think many complex, may discus another occasion. i say inflation concern asia. but i believe important address harm might cause asset-price bubbles. although i agree difficult predict occurrence asset-price bubble, i certain bubble created, grow immense power suppress difficult. the big bubble, great devastation cause bursts. the best way avoid damage heavy cost prevent occurrence bubble contain it’s late. to this, make decision early stage bubble’s formation, later. more importantly, bubble take shape, take appropriate effective step stop get big. prudent risk management 7. the current extremely loose monetary policy around world large inflow fund provide ideal environment provide nourishment formation asset-price bubble asia. so risk asset-price bubble small. but hong kong cannot raise interest rate wishes, even could, would attract hot money undesirable consequences. so hong kong, like many small open economies, resort mean prevent bubble grow large. 8. so method tool use? for property market, obvious bottleneck imbalance supply land, deal it. but factor affect demand, supply price property complex. sometimes property price rise shortage residential flat satisfy house demand, people expect market continue rise make good buy reap short-term profit hold big gain long run. currently hong kong, rapid surge luxury-property price may necessarily cause insufficient supply high-end residential flats, since rental move proportion prices. actually, increase cause fact many investors, include mainland china, optimistic outlook future prices. 9. apart regulate supply land, another method long use hong kong reduce risk bubble property market bank act gatekeeper prevent sharp increase mortgage lending. the regulatory measure implement hkma 23 october tighten loan-to-value ratio luxury bi review 167/2009 3 property price hk$20 million 60% serve purpose. some may argue since many buyer luxury property wealthy, may need apply mortgage therefore hkma’s measure may expect effect. i agree would case property buyer use save need borrow banks. however, i believe none purchaser luxury property borrow banks. some buyer approach bank mortgage still time complete transactions, intend hold flat long time. i also believe market small medium-sized residential flat could become active without abundant credit banks. i therefore believe prudential measure take good risk management bank help stop asset-price bubble forming. 10. while bank help control risks, member public corporation hong kong also need alert. they consider afford borrow much time interest rate low avoid get financial difficulty interest rate rise again. but i see easy. a hot money continue flow hong kong, push market higher. if continues, people may get mistake mindset market go overlook risk capital hot would might one day reverse course without warning. 11. finally, i would like share article i read last week. the article point difference asset-price bubble bull market. the author view people don’t manage enter stock market time don’t dare market go regard bubble support government take measure cool thing down; investor enter market see increase bull market. price increase interpret many ways. well, non-mainstream view like may merit and, right wrong, illustrate difficulty deal asset-price bubbles, particularly courage need make decision critical moments. whether decision correct difficult say total confidence certainty beforehand, mistake may made. but cannot avoid mistake make decision damage society asset-price bubble great ignore. and rely government stop bubble expanding. it require involvement banks, corporation individual – need risk-conscious self-disciplined. my colleague hkma i best, i invite everyone work hard together meet challenge bring global financial tsunami. bi review 167/2009 1 ewart s williams: prepare enhance insurance regulation trinidad tobago speak note mr ewart s williams, governor central bank trinidad tobago, “public consultation draft insurance bill & accompany regulations”, port-of-spain, 10 december 2009. * * * introduction good morning lady gentlemen. my role make introductory remark get main discussion going. obviously would like serious work session opportunity speech-making. let start say delight i morning today’s public consultation mark final phase process start roughly five year ago. a would recall regulation insurance sector transfer office supervisor insurance ministry finance, central bank 2004. the process prepare new insurance act collaborative approach central bank stakeholders’ committee, comprise member attic, broke association industry consultants. this collaborative approach bear testimony firm commitment central bank ensure legislation sector strike right balance international best practice local market condition circumstances. prior april 2004, central bank oversight 6 commercial bank 15 non-banks. after shift regulatory authority, bank take responsibility 51 insurance companies, 256 register pension plans. this major undertake necessitate significant increase staff infrastructural requirements, include training. the insurance sector, know, major contributor domestic economy. it account close $40 billion, second $88 billion commercial banks. the sector major repository private save cover risk unexpected developments; facilitate private public sector activity. in short, industry one enormous economic social value critical developmental efforts. the legislation underpin insurance activity trinidad tobago grossly outdated. the basic act date back 1966 modify 1980. a know good i, insurance industry today bear little resemblance 1966 even 1980. a i sure know, inadequate financial regulation regulatory failure widely cite one factor behind international financial crisis 2008–2009. a consequence global financial crisis comprehensive reform underway address weakness expose regulatory regime develop countries. on domestic front, event early 2009, saw central bank intervene two insurance company investment bank group, serve reinforce need enhance regulation sector. these event propel enactment amendment insurance act february 2009. these amendment need treat urgent immediate issue covered: (i) quarterly reporting; 2 bi review 167/2009 (ii) ensure statutory fund sufficient provide policyholder protection ongoing basis, rather end year require previous legislation; (iii) timely corrective action replace cumbersome, time consume intervention regime flexible effective process allow issuance compliance directions, (iv) authorize share information regulators. it absolutely vital law regulation keep abreast wide market developments. indeed, even absence problem always need legislative review. in develop jurisdictions, periodic review write legislation ensure remain current since financial innovation eventually outpace weaken legislative provisions. a note earlier, bank engage extensive consultation stakeholder insurance industry. this process begin october 2004 major departure way legislation formulate past. the close collaboration consultation industry serve enhance quality draft legislation discuss today. lady gentlemen, important emphasize first instance, important reason upgrade insurance legislation protect policy holder. that why, example, draft legislation require increase capital insurance companies. obviously, something must wrong company require hold $1–3 million capital, mobilise policy-holders’ fund total hundred million billion dollars. we recognise many company hold way beyond statutory minimum capital. the draft legislation also seek ensure insurance company correctly value liability could hold adequate reserve protect policy-holders. currently prescribe actuarial standard insurance trinidad tobago. this result serious under-estimation liability reserve also make difficult make inter-company comparisons. the draft legislation recognise insurance company would content traditional safe mode operations, others would engage risky activities. for reason, draft propose risk-based capital regime. the great level risk, large capital requirement. and importantly draft legislation seek give authority central bank promote compliance. thus propose central bank give authority require timely corrective action impose sanction include fines, deem appropriate. conclusion lady gentlemen, regulation continuously evolve process. the reform insurance legislation, propose discus today, bring regulatory framework close line international standard promote transparent reliable regulatory structure. it long journey reach point journey pave great deal healthy dialogue “give take” insurance industry central bank. i believe possible end day, share common goal strive towards robust good regulate industry. similar past consultation i anticipate today’s dialogue fruitful occur bi review 167/2009 3 atmosphere mutual trust respect end process, result would legislation proud. i pas back moderator introduce mr. carl hiralal, inspector financial institutions, discus highlight draft bill great detail. bi review 166/2009 1 jean-pierre roth: the financial crisis recede – future bring? summary speech mr jean-pierre roth, chairman govern board swiss national bank, centro di studi bancari, vezia, 15 december 2009. the complete speech find french swiss national bank’s website (www.snb.ch). * * * after financial crisis, global economy enter phase weak economic growth. unemployment level industrialise country comparatively high. public finance country heavily depleted, crisis need arise age populations, need consolidated. in monetary terms, inflation remain control, least country whose central bank enjoy strong level independence. switzerland comparatively well equip meet challenges. it public finance healthy state sufficiently open world participate dynamic markets. with tradition high quality cutting-edge technology, switzerland well position react specific market requirements. moreover, draw considerable financial resource and, thank openness labour market, also easy access labour resources, without growth would possible. switzerland’s major drawback fact lightweight geopolitical arena, make almost impossible defend protectionist tendency discriminatory measure take big countries. the swiss government must therefore take strong stand behalf free trade, also ensure private sector operate within best possible framework development. ultimately, future welfare depend vitality private sector, state intervention. bi review 166/2009 1 patrick honohan: regulatory policy development new regulatory activity introductory statement mr patrick honohan, governor central bank & financial service authority ireland, joint oireachtas committee economic regulatory affairs, dublin, 15 december 2009. * * * mr patrick honohan accompany martin moloney, secretary financial regulatory authority, joe doherty, head central bank’s legal unit. i would like highlight number key area currently dominate regulatory policy development new regulatory activity. 1. resolve crisis first foremost magnitude impact resolution current bank crisis. the weaken financial position bank extensive government guarantee provide depositor claimant clearly call exceptional measure here. there greatly intensify and, indeed termed, “intrusive” supervision operation main bank cover guarantee. this involve on-site presence daily basis several regulatory staff institution cover government guarantee. they sit observer key decision-making committee bank well conduct number specific investigation reviews. the government’s crisis resolution strategy involve clean large block trouble property-related loan banks’ balance sheet replace nama bond guarantee government. this ease banks’ ability mobilise fund ongoing operations. at time, since loan purchase nama “long-term economic values” (not far current market prices), purchase serve crystallise loss banks’ book amount likely excess provision already taken. this likely give rise need measure increase banks’ cushion capital, need absorb future losses. to extent need capital cannot source bank themselves, government indicate prepare make necessary investments. quantify need possibility important task regulatory staff centrally involved. 2. ensure safe sound finance quite apart problem crisis management, ongoing task ensure safe sound operation financial firm ireland, deal domestic market primarily concern export financial service ifsc. some safety soundness work routine character, require precision, predictability efficiency: example authorisation investment fund prospectuses. many thousand fund give standardise vet staff listed, way degree protection provide investor funds. other part i call safety-and-soundness work qualitative judgmental. regulation attempt limit reckless self-dealing behaviour financial firm (i) ex ante advance vet person charge fitness propriety, check compliance

skill talent country want retain national interests. affordability one key solution retaining, attract clever skilled professional affordability one major problem pacific island public service commissions. skilled talented professional scarce resource like resources, skilled talented professional u pacific scarce resource, require proper management. despite fact train talented professional outcome government strategic plan budgets, unfortunately, government public service commission matter, control individual exercise right freedom market skill talents. we also know company organization outside public service look skilled talented professionals. these organization know success failure achieve business goal deliver product service depend employ right skills. a consequence competition among organization skilled talented professionals. and prepare pay skill talent require. so challenge face pacific public service commission able compete skill market best people talent enable delivery government services, need citizens. 2 bi review 166/2009 management skilled talented employee difficult undertake management skilled talented employee easy task. a rob goffee gareth jones article title –“leading clever people” (harvard business review, march 2007) observed, talented people difficult manage please. they restless; easily bored, want solve problem interest please boss lead them. they resent bureaucratic bottleneck slow delay achieve results. skilled talented people know employer cannot go without them. they know much skill worth market; member professional body supply market information skills. they cannot fool fancy title position come attractive remuneration packages. lastly, skilled talented employee always hunt company organization prepare pay skill currently pay them. our experience central bank solomon island demonstrate difficulty manage clever people. for year spend good portion budget directly sponsor officer receive master degree level education university australia meet skill gap identify enable bank meet legal mandate conduct monetary policy responsibilities. unfortunately, lose individual organization offer talent offer. indeed good feel invest million dollar train officer leaf without due regard do individual. but challenge cost freedom mobility educate individual choose best deal skills. a note world health organization (who) presentation minister health pacific country hold samoa 2005 examine pacific health personnel migrate, unless condition favorable, skilled professional leave low pay, poor work conditions, shortage supply equipment; lack limit educational opportunity professional development advancements. in solomon islands, currently special parliamentary commission inquiry look quality health service provide national referral hospital. what obvious hear shortage skilled doctors, health professionals, equipment instrument cause poor health service delivery unfortunately directly link question affordability. the challenge affordability this lead second challenge face pacific public service commission regard skill talent management. it challenge affordability. it ability public service commission able match market will pay attract skill talent want retain workforce. unfortunately, question affordability easy option some, not, pacific island country resource constraint economies. the amount money available government tax base sufficient offer attractive remuneration package compete skill market meet press social service population large. furthermore, public service already large employer many pacific island countries, reduce number public service employee order make save hire need skilled worker counterproductive, especially deal public servant member strong influential trade union. bi review 166/2009 3 the effect global economic recession country region experience since last half 2008 also compound difficulty face small island country question affordability. until global economy recovers, small island economy region grow; tremendous pressure raise tax revenue finance human resource need operational cost countries. the asian development bank (adb) pacific monitor report release august year, project five pacific economics experience negative growth year one country grow all. what mean government region continuously pressure raise revenue provide need social service population. economy grow overnight impact global economic recession project negative growth affect affordability pacific island government compete best skill talent require public services. what public service commission manage problem? so, public service commission pacific island country resolve question brain-drain really question affordability? if government pay remuneration package like competitors, might find answer question. otherwise government region need creative find way manage issue. i offer follow suggestion considerations. first, public service commissioner must break rule set remuneration package skilled talented professional employee public service must employ deliver service need community. the public service commissioner respective government must remunerate need talent skill equal market remuneration package others prepare pay skills. in words, pay structure talent skill identify essential effective delivery government service policy goal must different general public servant pay structure. (may good “break rule” option apply george orwell’s famous line book animal farm…“all animal equal animal equal others.” so restate “all public servant equal, public servant equal others”.). whilst sound possible, i must warn easy option take environment strong union represent interest member affordability easy come by. but social service delivery public suffer specialize skill available country cannot afford pay them. the second consideration public service commissioner creative create employment environment would attract skilled talented people want work public service. i call non monetary factors, although fund must spend make happen. public service commissioner must provide clean attractive office environment officer work in. this include provision proper equipment enhance productivity. shorten length time take hire successful candidates: skilled talented people cannot wait month receive letter acceptances. they find employment somewhere else slow process engagement. ensure newly recruit worker wait month put payroll pay services. it demean professional family member wait month pay processed. talented skilled worker 4 bi review 166/2009 cannot tolerate inefficiency bureaucratic procedure unfortunately require adhere to. public service commissioner support technical team must continuously scan market ensure remuneration talent require within market price skill talents. this mean actively involve communicate professional body represent interest public service employee ensure concern address honest professional manner. public service commissioner must actively ensure officer reward performance, benefit organize train would enhance officers’ abilities. these challenge issues, certainly mean secure finance change procedures. but public service must compete best talent market necessary change tackle part strategy talent management public service. conclusion in conclusion, challenge face pacific public service commissioner address brain-drain manage mobility talented skilled professional make difficult affordability key barrier. graeme dobel abc radio australia sum issue state “a free person skill still free person”. we deal free individual whose choice market skill bring maximum benefit cause leave public service employment. public service commissioner must therefore creative find solution attract retain talented individuals. this mean must make necessary change manner handle remuneration package work condition skilled talented professional want attract retain. thank listen i wish success conference. reference asian development bank, 2008. pacific monitor, www.adb.org/pacific monitor. dobel, g. 2006. “australia confront it pacific taboo: pacific workers”, pacific economic bulletin, volume 21, no. 3 november 2006, p.128. goffee r. jones g. 2007. “leading clever people”, harvard business review, march 2007. world health organization, 2005. “migration health personnel”, paper (wpr/icp/ecp/7.2/001/ecp(11) 2005.4) present minister heath pacific countries, samoa, 2005. bi review 166/2009 1 ric battellino: some comment bank fund remark mr ric battellino, deputy governor reserve bank australia, 22nd australasian finance & bank conference, sydney,16 december 2009. * * * i would like thank michael davies, anna brown tegan hanrick, undertake research talk. one widely draw lesson financial crisis bank source fund deposit le short-term debt markets. i want spend time today talk this, focus particular on: • significant benefit shift? • feasible bank shift fund sources? • impact banks’ cost funds? • implication level interest rates? bank fund bank australia reasonably diverse fund bases: deposit account 43 per cent funding, split fairly evenly household businesses; domestic capital market provide 19 per cent funding; foreign capital market 28 per cent. securitisation equity account 3 per cent 7 per cent fund respectively (graph 1). graph 1 since mid 2007, share banks’ fund come deposit rise 5 percentage points, increase household business deposits. bank use fund replace short-term capital market debt. the increase use deposit fund evident major bank regional banks. the foreign-owned banks, contrast, experience fall proportion fund come domestic deposit (graph 2). 2 bi review 166/2009 graph 2 how stable bank deposits? assess relative stability banks’ various fund source straightforward, significant variation even within category funding. for example, government-guaranteed deposit “stickier” non-guaranteed deposits, household deposit tend stickier corporate institutional deposits, internet deposit le stable at-call deposits. deposit corporates financial institution unlikely much stable short-term debt, particularly crisis. offshore capital market fund le stable domestic capital market funding, crisis investor often strong home bias. the behavioural maturity give fund source also different contractual maturity, especially financial crises. it behavioural maturity matter most, severe crisis shorten significantly many fund sources. this bank come pressure allow term deposit redeem early buy back short-term capital market debt. while bank could try enforce contractual maturity funding, reality that, unless bank already great difficulty, could draw attention accentuate problems. another issue behaviour new depositor attract competitive price may also different exist depositors. these new deposit likely price sensitive le stable. the benefit, term fund stability, come increase deposit competitive pricing, may therefore somewhat illusory. how australian bank compare internationally? there common perception bank australia make le use deposit fund bank countries. however, difference australian bank overseas peer sometimes exaggerate inconsistency data across countries. table 1 contain data reserve bank put together deposit fund major bank australia, canada, germany, japan, unite kingdom unite states. we try make data consistent possible although probably still long way fully consistent. the data show that, contrary popular bi review 166/2009 3 perception, share fund deposit major bank australia similar major bank germany, japan, unite kingdom unite states.1 table 1 share domestic foreign deposit total funding1 december 2008, per cent major bank australia 61 canada 77 germany 56 japan 69 unite kingdom 60 unite state 56 1 data base major bank country. deposit include cds. total fund equal total liabilities, exclude derivative liabilities. sources: central banks, national statistical agencies, banks’ financial statements, standard poor’s, rba. another commonly quote metric use support case australian bank underweight deposit relatively high ratio loan deposit australia. the ratio major bank australia around 130 per cent, whereas overseas country ratio vary 80 per cent 100 per cent (table 2). however, i noted, due australian bank low deposit funding. the high ratio loan deposit reflect difference asset composition. bank australia mainly loan asset side balance sheet, whereas bank overseas often large hold debt securities. this result high ratio loan deposit australia. but, rather weakness, i would regard strength australian banks, event past couple year show hold security risky loans. table 2 ratio loan deposits1 december 2008, per cent major bank australia 131 canada 91 germany 97 japan 79 unite kingdom 89 unite state 96 1 data base major bank country. foreign domestic loan deposit (including cds). sources: central banks, national statistical agencies, banks’ financial statements, standard poor’s, rba. 1 the figure deposit share table high figure quote early talk definitional differences. to allow international comparisons, figure deposit table include cd bank group, hence include overseas well domestic operations. the denominator use measure total fund on-balance sheet liability (excluding derivatives) rather total fund include equity securitisation. 4 bi review 166/2009 how far bank lift deposit ratios? an individual bank large amount discretion way fund itself, bid aggressively type fund want compete away banks. the bank sector whole, however, much le flexibility. for bank sector whole increase use deposit funding, need able induce shift structure financial system away finance capital market on-balance sheet fund bank sector. put another way, bank system whole, share deposit total fund increase extent investor reduce hold security place proceed deposit banks. there limit extent happen since range structural, economic cultural factor shape composition financial system, change quickly. in fact, trend economy save time move away simple instrument bank deposit towards debt security equities. to try shift save back deposit would require reversal trends, must doubt feasible would be. there also question whether would sensible point view overall function economy financial system. a i note earlier, past year australian bank whole manage increase share fund come deposits. however, bulk occur period high risk aversion late last year early year, investor perception bank deposit safe debt security unit trusts. over past six months, risk appetite among investor returned, deposit fund share bank stop rising. it would seem bank largely exhaust available opportunity induce investor increase hold bank deposits. the so-called “deposit war” among bank produce attractive interest rate depositor little net benefit bank system whole term increase deposit funding. what happen cost deposits?

in context natural environment, threat action million individuals, act pursuit interests, cause breakdown world’s ecosystem, global catastrophe ultimately damage 1 stiglitz, j.e. a. wei (1981), “credit ration market imperfect information”, american economic review. 2 bi review 165/2009 everyone. this, course, topic international climate change negotiation week next copenhagen. similarly, context economic environment, threat development financial system cause seizing-up breakdown system trigger massive damage real economy. such development stem failure large interconnect institutions, endogenous imbalance add time, sizable unexpected event. a seizing-up financial system ( large part ( experience last autumn. the consequence economic freefall, surge unemployment massive increase public debt. so financial system make prone systemic risk? the financial system compose intermediaries, market infrastructure payment, settlement trade mechanism support them. intermediary connect direct transactions, interbank markets, similar investment finance decision third party intermediary end investors. financial markets, turn, connect trade activity financial intermediary end investor active one market. systemic risk within financial system relate risk inter-connections similarity render emerge financial instability widespread system. even original problem seem contained, important amplification mechanism work. this complex network financial connection extend save finance need economic sectors, notably non-financial firms, household government. by reallocate save individual sector surplus fund individual sector need funds, financial system play central role economy. so, systemic risk, broad sense, relate risk widespread instability financial system translate adverse effect growth welfare economy large. how financial instability trigger initially self-contained events, transmit widely fallout ultimately reach systemic dimensions? ecb research philipp hartmann others, investigate systemic risk least decade, suggest three particularly important way happen.2 the first contagion. the failure one financial intermediary lead failure financial intermediaries, even latter invest risk subject original shock former.3 second, widespread financial imbalance build time unwind abruptly. hyman minsky describe good time consumption investment increase, generate income, fuel finance consumption investment also neglect increase risks. even small event lead re-pricing risk 2 see de bandt, o. p. hartmann (2000), “systemic risk: a survey”, ecb work paper, no. 14, november, de bandt, o., p. hartmann j. peydro (2009), “systemic risk banking: an update”, forthcoming ecb work paper berger, a., p. molyneux j. wilson (eds.), oxford handbook banking, oxford university press, 2009, reference therein. 3 allen, f. d. gale (2000), “financial contagion”, journal political economy; freixas, x., b. parigi j.c. rochet (2000), “systemic risk, interbank relation liquidity provision central bank”, journal money, credit banking; chen, y.

czech national bank, europe sixty: 1949–2009, metropolitan university, prague, 20 november 2009. * * * lady gentlemen, let first express deep gratitude organiser invite give keynote speech today. and take standard, politically correct open sentence. i really mean it. for quite rare opportunity speak frankly openly important topic, process european integration certainly is, speak scholar policy-maker. so i try best outspoken enough provoke question comment i finish. therefore, usual disclaimer relevant ever time: opinion necessarily opinion employer. i think european integration process provide lot food think many social scientists. i try approach topic point view economist, also citizen mere mortal, share concern process european integration evolve far likely heading. these concern support fact member eu’s economic financial committee, i watch integration process every day on-line insider, say. the title conference stress fact european integration start 60 year ago. you know exactly 60 year ago completely different project, originally aim build something “brand new”, also appear quite far away europe – china. what irony fate sixty year chinese seem way up, run fast, european union stagnate even descend economically. what bitterness, one realise way up, china still desperate crazy communist regime allow citizen bite freedom area economic life. of course, part explanation lie fact simple economic convergence. but without doubt, eu lose momentum. not now, crisis; long process. in eu seem start concentrate conservation preservation exist wealth, rather wealth creation. the question european union economically powerful efficient would like be, certainly complex. however, suspicion one answer eu start concentrate much – many area almost exclusively – process deep deep political integration. it almost mainstream ideology state answer solution virtually problem eu integration. whenever discus problem colleague brussels, mainstream view typically argues: need eu integration solve this. and integration bring hop for, mean need even integration. we probably enough it. well, i doubt approach, least regard impact political integration economy. the concept base simple idea big state, big economy, big also wealth citizen state economy. this idea fail terribly compare simple statistic facts. if take look correlation size economy measure well-being gdp per capita, see average bigger, populous, economy world generally rich economies. rather, small open economy (including europe) tend richer, exception rule unite states. so big mean richer. 2 bi review 165/2009 my hypothesis instead integration jurisdictions, competition might sometimes beneficial economic growth. country compete investors, capital labour force make tax systems, legal framework condition efficient friendly possible. competition sometimes useful markets, also among jurisdiction states. political integration can, point, become obstacle competition, sometimes even intentionally. i think eu is, unfortunately, right stage. what shame. and that? well, choose path political integration, watch carefully certain pitfall – i sure careful enough respect. a major pitfall effect observe whenever group people institution hire someone else job them. in economics, call principal-agent model, say group principal hire agent. the idea agent follow direction principals. a simple example: shareholder company choose manager run company. but sometimes happen model agent try turn power structure around switch one simply follow direction one deliberately set agenda. this effort often successful agent relatively small group people hold relevant information share similar motivation, principal tend much numerous le inform objective often highly differentiated. and so, corporate manager often able push even go interest many shareholders; international organisation often take step found member like see; token eu administration able shape integration process way differ many member state previously intended. to give one banal illustration process: remuneration employee international organisation eurocrats invariably high remuneration would able earn similar position home. therefore, principal watch – little joy, course – brain-drain favour agent. thus, agent get dominance principal principal even contribute dominance. the observation agent try become powerful principal usually consider beyond boundary political correctness, rarely hear it. the hold another hindrance proper execution european integration idea, namely asymmetry among different principals, is, among different member state eu. in itself, difference weight small state large state may make sense; certain eu member state much big informal impact others position eu take international political economic forums, big-impact state may tempt “nationalise” voice eu. many attempt nationalisation eu position due might call “french complex”: some leader big country still fully absorb fact country long superpower use long lead world, often try abuse eu-wide voice support national interests, position agenda. when call europe speak “one voice”, often seem expect single voice 500 million eu citizen voice national leaders, articulate national taste priorities. of course, agent, european commission executive arm eu, also sometimes temptation define steal voice eu. needle say, risk proper integration derail particularly high two effect mention combine – eu administration cease behave agent le powerful principal remain spell strong principals. it fairly understandable certain eu member state support current, rather non-transparent way modify institutional set-up: way maintain even strengthen draconian mix i described. bi review 165/2009 3 give european integration take place “european” way (in bad sense word), wonder standard democratic politics leave national level: formally eu-wide idea always translate individual member state local political context; true eu-wide political parties, true eu-wide politicians, true eu-wide media. the debate eu institution rarely follow line use standard political debates, whether want freedom redistribution. instead, time spent, i said, procedure institutions. the official effort gradual political integration thus give impression square circle. these awkward trait politics eu level lead perverse implications. on one hand, measure would help europe retain strong economic position – i mean especially liberalisation market trade – take year even decade implement: single market service still exist even single market labour still fundamental exemptions. the celebrate lisbon strategy turn farce; many structural reform outline would beneficial economically, realise least enforce agent, european commission. on hand, eu institution repeatedly show ability produce bizarre piece legislation would hardly ever pass national level give member state. the famous czech writer milan kundera would probably call “unbearable lightness legislating”. so suspicion eu position easy integrate liberalise. and two different thing term long-term economic growth, i argued. what shame eu us. thank attention. bi review 165/2009 1 deepak mohanty: global financial crisis monetary policy response india speech mr deepak mohanty, executive director reserve bank india, 3rd indian council research

central banks, take number conventional unconventional measure augment domestic foreign exchange liquidity, sharply reduce policy rates. in span seven month october 2008 april 2009, unprecedented policy activism. for example: (i) repo rate reduce 425 basis point 4.75 per cent, (ii) reverse repo rate reduce 275 basis point 3.25, (iii) cash reserve ratio (crr) reduce cumulative 400 basis point 5.0 per cent, (iv) actual/potential provision primary liquidity order rs. 5.6 trillion (10.5 per cent gdp). 16. there are, however, key difference action take reserve bank india central bank many

serge quoidbach 4 december 2009 publish 10 december 2009. * * * be euro area definitely recession? if so, expect recovery sufficiently strong create jobs? jean-claude trichet: the second quarter year saw end period free fall term growth. this difficult period last two full quarter follow intensification crisis mid-september 2008 (editor’s note: follow collapse lehman brothers). a third quarter 2009 experience positive growth again. this case fourth quarter, too. accord projection eurosystem staff, average growth next year also positive, albeit still modest. and level uncertainty – i like stress point – remain high. this relate number factors, primarily international. a regard employment, take account “lags” usually observe period recession, could see increase unemployment even growth rate return positive territory. we must therefore act determination strengthen confidence. indeed, confidence dramatically lack follow event september 2008. all action today within govern council ecb aim strengthen confidence household firm medium term. be aware confidence would difficult establish? in cycle this, decline often much steep recovery, slower. hence importance, us, of: (i) assure fellow citizen able ensure price stability thereby defend purchase power; (ii) convince firm financial environment continue incorporate low level inflation year come, reflect medium long-term market interest rates. last thursday ecb announce progressive phasing-out extraordinary measures. doe mean market condition completely back normal? moreover, analyst view detail announce 12-month refinance operation signal regard interest rates. we always say non-standard measure – i.e. measure adopt order take account highly irregular situation market – would unwind naturally situation improved. the measure announce last thursday reflect improvement observe markets. on question signal regard rates, i want extremely clear. the intention govern council give signal interest rates. we consider current level interest rate appropriate. it therefore appropriate index rate 12-month operation. we consider best way confirm intention give signal interest rate today. i believe market understand message well. be bank sector sufficiently good health, view? be bad behind us? in respect, too, experience dramatic period. i first like stress fact europe whole – governments, national parliaments, european institutions, etc. 2 bi review 164/2009 – overcome unprecedented challenge since second world war. we manage avoid kind dramatic event experience side atlantic. in intense period stress, european apparatus, extremely complex, prove resilient. this rarely acknowledged. and yet, must say european ship succeed weather storm. this way self-evident. say that, must allow become complacent. we still much order strengthen balance sheet financial institution – commercial bank particular. we encourage act determination strengthen balance sheets. those institution turn market. but also retain profit reserve instead distribute them. i believe, moreover, high degree caution demonstrate regard remuneration award bonus – ethical reasons, avoid excessive risk-taking, reason relate need bank sound finances. all considerable step take central bank government – thus taxpayer – one single objective: allow bank continue perform function, finance real economy. the bank live responsibilities. paradoxically, haven’t banks, bnp paribas, become big result crisis? doe pose new threat? the question know whether certain institution europe part world large interconnect represent additional systemic risk important question consider international level. there various idea subject. but nobody deny financial institution find situation pose high risk whole system, necessarily question size, appropriate take measure limit risks. we also act way financial system whole le fragile. we work towards this, line guidance g20. from point view, i quite reassure see global consensus, include among emerge economy china india. it matter increase resilience financial system without call question market economy. we want market economy, produce wealth, much le fragile le subject formation subsequent burst bubbles. so consensus reassuring. but succeed also. we obligation obtain results. i think taxpayer would accept take major risk take rescue system. isn’t risky announce already gradual withdrawal exceptional liquidity measures? the govern council – make twenty-two member include guy quaden, governor nationale bank van belgië/banque nationale de belgique – must time carefully ass risk situation. there risk associate unwind quickly non-standard measure taken, risk involve unwind slowly. i could say thing monetary policy fiscal policy. in event, carefully ass risk take without priori bias one direction another. experience show u dangerous focus short-term concern detriment economic stability prosperity medium long term. this central bank independent. in regard, begin 2004, week, three head state government ask ecb low interest rates: german chancellor, president french republic italian prime minister. the govern council ecb refuse this, clarify warrant reduce interest rates, level 2%, without put risk price stability medium term. similarly, ten twelve euro area government publicly criticise interest rate rise end 2005. today, long anybody suggest wrong bi review 164/2009 3 take decision took. this show strong tendency around u concentrate short term. at last thursday’s govern council meeting, confirm level interest rate appropriate, take

lose sight medium long-term objective concerns. weren’t expect bank support economy more? everything done, continue do, facilitate refinance banks, course bank perform best possible way function finance real economy. our message clear: must significant finance difficulty result supply credit financial institutions. this said, demand credit sluggish moment, always case serious recession. overall, see decline outstanding amount loan non-financial corporations, owe particular decrease credit demand firms. with regard households, outstanding credit rise recent months. aren’t concern see that, one hand, bank hurry back markets, fuel people consider financial bubbles, and, hand, strongly urge lend more? one beware make overly simplistic judgements. the sector look homogenous. some market player seem completely forget month ago, entire financial system process collapsing, speed scope decision central banks, well government parliaments, allow u avoid catastrophe. these player fortunately minority. the financial system whole understand essential everything possible increase robustness global financial system. be please agreement among finance minister strengthen bank,

swedish presidency, act basis relevant proposal european commission. a well-known, propose solution necessarily best eye party involved. it precisely suggest initially. however, advantage represent consensus government themselves. the european parliament consider matter i every confidence efficacy efforts. will indeed president systemic risk board, suggested? a know, president european systemic risk board elect member board set up. the question little premature. in unite states, great deal debate concern federal reserve act. there talk end federal reserve system’s supervision large banks. be concern this? well eruption crisis 2008 govern council european central bank say important establish close link central bank prudential bank supervision. i think event past two year confirm accuracy position. generally speaking, i note fairly widely hold belief europe worldwide good quite close association 4 bi review 164/2009 central bank prudential supervision. i find particularly evident belgium – show confidence place nationale bank van belgië/banque national de belgique governor – also great many countries. i would amaze current debate unite state lead federal reserve system long close link micro-prudential supervision, since appear lesson draw crisis all. i would add ecb close confident relation federal reserve system. the imf warn still many toxic asset banks’ balance

perhaps important question face u today. second, problem provision must set loan grant bank customer repay due, owe crisis. i confident european commercial bank equal new challenge thank profit also thank reserve provision already accumulated. but one reason urge take every opportunity strengthen balance sheets, period ahead also difficult. for financial assets, gold, see return risk-taking part investors. be parameter ecb take account strategy? i make specific comment regard gold. generally speaking, one fundamental lesson crisis underestimate financial risk focus short term, set stage future catastrophe. the new principle bank remuneration, international community agree within framework financial stability board, establish precisely order ensure incentive operator trader particular favour risky attitude decisions, lead illusory profit short term expense long-term interest financial enterprise concern stability financial system whole. we know much banks’ balance sheet affect provision bad debt link toxic assets. since market structure product still difficulty, bank fear write-down structure products? that good question, i believe important problem face european commercial bank today. with regard toxic assets, bear mind account rule play major role enter balance sheets. the rule differ side atlantic. the question harmonise account rule europe unite state important one must also address perspective fully harmonise global market financial services. the dubai crisis cause large disparity term country risk euro area. greece ireland currently face long-term rate

government fully restore confidence ability manage public finance sound sustainable manner long term. this confidence important factor recovery. a regard greece, mentioned, i shall simply reiterate i say european parliament: “given severity situation, i confident greek government take necessary courageous measure near future.” the euro remain relatively robust u dollar despite fact u authority say favour strong dollar. be happy u behaviour currency markets? a regard euro, particularly regard relationship u dollar, i repeat i say press conference follow last meet govern council european central

stability prosperity global economy. finally, help manage crisis? what goal? i believe all, ecb entire eurosystem, team spirit. the govern council, executive board, ecb staff national central bank prove solidarity unity exceptionally difficult circumstances. it able, since begin period financial turmoil, make prognosis turn right take appropriate decision challenge faced. we take decision quickly to, without ever lose course: say price stability medium term, primary goal. i believe ability govern council strictly maintain medium long-term price stability strategy, whilst take quick and, necessary, unconventional decisions, best summarise management crisis. but cannot afford complacent. we still difficult situation mean must always guard. i situation many times, important strictly maintain long-term strategy time manage crisis. for example, country 1992 1993, secretary treasury governor banque de france, i pursue long-term strategy competitive disinflation time face

british chamber commerce invite tonight. it pleasure join prominent annual gathering. last year fruitful discussion “what determine future thai economy”. if may recall, i impart audience word wisdom policymakers, smooth short-term pain, achieve long-term gain. last year’s speech take care latter part, key message call collective effort raise economy’s potential output order achieve sustainable long-run prosperity. we, however, spend much time former part yet witness complete fallout collapse lehman brothers. today, know get-together last september onset great economic contraction last 60 years. the collapse lehman brother sep 15, 2008 create gigantic shockwave world financial market ripple subsequently evolve economic tsunami wipe much economic well-being world. it consequence still

despite weakness back home, uk’s net fdi thailand still manage register positive number approximately 48 million usd first three quarter 2009. it is, therefore, mutual benefit bcct good understand outlook challenge thai economy policymaking standpoint. this mission speech today i would like proceed follow sequence: first, i would like start give update current economic development; second, i would attempt draw outlook thai economy year 2010; third, i outline key challenge await thai economy go forward. lady gentlemen, a know, thai economy hard-hit sharp drop external demand cause global financial crisis. the spillover large decline export far-reaching affect sector domestic economy, manufacture sector hard hit. consequently, sentiment turn gloomy worker start lose jobs. to make matter worse, escalation internal political tension adversely affect private consumption investment. with timely implementation accommodative fiscal monetary policies, world economy see quick turnaround originally expected. the recent economic data indicate world economy stabilized. this show fact recession end several country positive quarter-on-quarter growth second quarter onward. more importantly, financial institution origin crisis appear become much stable, though yet return normal. this reflect index measure concern liquidity credit risk financial 2 bi review 164/2009 market 3-month libor spread external debt market spread continue adjust downward. for thailand, green shoot start emerge second quarter, owe primarily pick-up world’s demand, large government’s stimulus

quarter grow 2.6 percent, capacity utilization rate rise low 54.8 first quarter reach 62.4 percent end third quarter. in addition, domestic demand also boost accommodative monetary policy rise public spending, cause private consumption investment grow 1.0 percent 3.7 percent respectively third quarter. a result, overall gdp growth quarter come 1.3 percent quarter-on-quarter basis. lady gentlemen, in 2010, thai economy expect stay course gradual recovery due two important factors. first, continue world recovery, second fiscal stimulus. let go briefly. first, imf market consensus expect world economy return positive growth next year, owe primarily monetary fiscal policy industrialize economy expect remain accommodative. emerge market economy include asia expect rebound fast strong develop economies. this asia’s financial sector directly affect current crisis. bright prospect global economy next year mean export sector continue main growth engine go forward. secondly, government spend sp2 strong thai scheme also continue support nascent recovery. a aware, cannot indefinitely rely fiscal stimulus keep economy go hope public spend eventually crowd private demand recovery continue stimulus taper off. now let turn risk associate outlook. despite several good signals, recovery world economy still subject number downside risks. in particular, fact unemployment rate remain high despite pick-up economic activity lead many people worry might “jobless recovery”. this high unemployment, prolonged, could deep last impact consumption potential growth u economy. moreover, consumption u adversely affect decline household wealth well increase personal save rate. other issue may exert downward force world recovery include high level public debt may put upward pressure long-term interest rate u advance countries’ financial sector still weak may able support recovery economy. on domestic front, downside risk come ability government swiftly execute sp2 investment projects. in words, disbursement may proceed expect due lack capacity effectively implement many project simultaneously. more importantly, political unrest affect stability coalition government may distract, disrupt, bad case, discontinue disbursement process. take upside downside risk consideration, bank thailand’s monetary policy committee assess thai economy expect recover gradually, support good global economic outlook accommodative monetary fiscal policies. meanwhile, inflationary pressure continue subdue time being. the mpc, therefore, decide maintain policy interest rate 1.25 percent per year bi review 164/2009 3 recent meeting. at time, bot expect thai economy return positive growth 3.3–5.3 percent 2010. lady gentlemen, i believe consensus bad global economic crisis already behind us. at juncture, policymakers business start look beyond crisis gauge lie ahead. at bank thailand, envisage follow three challenge post-crisis era. first, outlook thai export market good pre-crisis period. this global financial crisis likely reduce purchase power potential growth thailand’s major trade partners, especially industrialize economies. moreover, unemployment rate continue increase g3 countries, protectionist sentiment may intensify attempt protect job home. it common knowledge that, since 1997 financial crisis, thailand rely export primary engine growth. this dependency expect continue quite time domestic demand large enough substitute purchase power abroad. therefore, exporter need adaptive, policymakers need ensure supportive policies. have say that, mean abandon effort rebalancing growth engine towards domestic demand go forward. this also do balance sheet private sector still good shape. now i would like turn second challenge: a world economic recovery begin find solid footing, exit unconventional measure return monetary policy towards normal level become increasingly important issue. israel, australia norway already lead way. however, great challenge policymakers exercise exit strategy appropriate pace time ensure exit create unwarranted impact economic recovery. on one hand, premature exit derail recovery. on other, delay exit lead rise inflation asset price bubbles. on top this, coordination exit policy among country also important. for instance, removal deposit guarantee simultaneously implement order avoid disruption may cause shift deposit country lift guarantee another country not. on balance, expect emerge economy include asia likely recover first economic fundament remain sound bank system position support economic recovery. a result, interest rate emerge market economy expect raise fast industrialize countries. these interest rate growth differential backdrop ample global liquidity breed carry-trade behaviour usd fund currency time. this lead u third challenge, prevent surge capital inflow create unwarranted instability excessive volatility currency market asset price bubbles. in response challenge, begin see country hong kong, korea, singapore china tighten prudential standard cool speculative pressure real estate sector. in addition, brazil recently impose measure slow inflow fund stock market. in case thailand, net capital flow turn positive july continue remain so, cause thai baht strengthen current account also surplus. nevertheless, thai baht move line regional currency bank thailand remain vigilant ensure continue case. in order make capital flow balanced, process further liberalization capital outflows. this would also increase flexibility business financial management. a issue asset price bubbles, sign accelerate asset price observe many country asia apparent thailand time, risk 4 bi review 164/2009 neglected. a matter prudence, bank thailand continue closely monitor asset price ensure financial stability prevail long term. lady gentlemen, i would like conclude speech tonight reiterate economic recovery thailand expect continue go forward. nevertheless, risk aftershock negligible due fragile global domestic environment. hence, business policymakers alike need remain vigilant, time, overcome unreasonable fear. one important factor help speed process recovery return investment trade within country. with economic resilience strong economic fundamentals, i would like assure thailand remain lucrative place invest. despite difficult

(neighborworks) reduce impact foreclosure low- moderate-income communities. clearly, much remain do stabilize community hard-hit foreclosure crisis, encourage work partnership, second year. we leverage resource federal reserve, particularly data resource network regional reserve bank across country, assist neighborworks' activity respect training, foreclosure counsel resources, build capacity local community organizations. federal reserve board chairman bernanke ask chair board's committee consumer community affair represent federal reserve neighborworks board. a former community banker, i come new assignment understand role financial institutions, partnership local stakeholders, play create healthy sustainable communities. but i want see first-hand economic crisis impact communities, neighborworks responding, reserve bank assist community stress organization serve them. so, community affair staff twelve reserve bank district community organization work – include many neighborworks organization – arrange tour several stress community across country. and i must say, visit enrich understand vital work do local communities, importance nation's economic future. so i think best way i could kick conference would tell little bite i learn visits, particularly lesson relate community stabilization efforts. i know i say come surprise work issue every day. but i want recognize significant work express profound appreciation, especially share experience tour city learn work. regional economic condition matter the first lesson i learn travel one-size-fits-all strategy community stabilization. the downturn house affect community variety ways, depend underlie economics each. because variations, stabilization strategy effective industrial city face high unemployment unlikely suit suburban community employment remain relatively stable. community weak underlie economy characterize long trend population loss, gradual impoverishment, strain municipal resources. for city like cleveland, detroit, indianapolis increase foreclosure last year 2 bi review 164/2009 exacerbate pre-existing vacancy problem.1 the increase rate foreclosure relate economic downturn hasten cycle decrease property values. decline state local property sale tax revenue result even vacant home deteriorate neighborhoods. many community organization homeowner frustrate difficulty work mortgage lender servicers, problem even exaggerate weak market cities. in devastate neighborhoods, lender even complete foreclosure process record outcome foreclosure sale cost foreclose exceed value property. anecdotal evidence suggest "toxic titles" place significant number property difficult state legal limbo.2 a result high rate abandonment, many city flint, michigan, cleveland, ohio, youngstown, ohio pursue plan "right size" demolish vacant property create land banks. these strategy effectively align house supply demand create open space parkland promote community health sustainability. several community organization detroit, instance, join together promote urban farm initiative reclaim abandon property capitalize grow popularity locally grow food. detroit's garden resource program provide hundred home, school, community garden access resource information empower resident grow, harvest, prepare, preserve food backyard neighborhoods. in 2008, program supply 169 community gardens, 40 schools, 359 family seeds, plants, train produce thousand pound food inside city detroit.3 even community strong underlie economy immune destabilize effect high foreclosure rates. i visit california's inland empire los angeles, well area atlanta, recently economically vibrant. many coastal city – even job grow population – distress high rate foreclosure. for instance, florida city cape coral, miami, orlando, tampa, sarasota among high rate foreclosure – 3.8 10 percent. these areas, others west, la vega phoenix, experience high rate new home construction speculative investment result unsustainable price escalation throughout early part decade.4 vacant property create different kind problem california markets. indeed, investor sense home price bottom out, approach servicers cash offer bulk purchase properties. in fact, community organization area california complain investor interest heat point qualify first-time homebuyers local community organization crowd market. foreclosure rescue scam take residence nearly every community appear even prevalent strong market area retain title home economically feasible. one counselor los angeles

stabilize communities: a federal response secondary impact foreclosure crisis. brook institute. february 2009. bi review 164/2009 3 in addition economic dynamic particular city, clear that, even within metropolitan areas, community stabilization issue vary neighborhood neighborhood. for example, cleveland's high vacancy rate primarily urban core, atlanta, problem high foreclosure rate find urban core, also out suburban community experience significant growth recently. for city like atlanta, strategy address high foreclosure rate must take account wide variation local capacity across within metropolitan areas. new suburb not, part, time develop community resource technical expertise exist urban centers. another lesson i learn travel need understand community dynamics. in end, success community stabilization plan depend dedication expertise local leader like today. cleveland's detroit shoreway neighborhood, example, clearly demonstrate right vision, leadership, plan even highly distress community regain position dynamic attractive neighborhood maximize natural cultural assets. holistic approach key foreclosure mitigation activities, necessity, focus individual house mortgage attempt resolve legal economic issue borrowers, servicers, investors. nonetheless, visit community organization see work first-hand, clear effective community stabilization approach look beyond home mortgages. successful community stabilization require broad vision community, one factor many element make neighborhood desirable place live. the bottom line house alone sufficient create sustainable economically resilient communities. i see several compel example kind multi-faceted approach community development. atlanta's development efforts, example, include creation center work families. the center serf people seek employment eager learn new skill help support families, build wealth, start business. the center also offer client individual coach help hurdle barrier keep

reserve bank australia, annual dinner australian business economists, sydney, 8 december 2009. * * * the financial crisis engulf global capital market bring number important international bank close brink last year follow good deal soul search among regulatory community. in several countries, though australia, regulatory structure and/or practice see inadequate. work proceed try establish good arrangement prevent next crisis, or, realistically, least make le costly – seek avoid thing make hard recover one. i propose offer today information observation development associate issues. i won’t go cause crisis per se; cover length before. the material offer set global context, rather australia-specific one. just clear, follow paragraph i say something australia, i make explicit. lesson crisis what conclusion government regulator around world draw episode? there many. but important one organise five relevant headings. first, capital: enough. in case global banks’ trade books, lot risk accumulate well measured. capital hold complex structure product particular seriously insufficient. a good deal risk also suppose “off balance sheet”, return quickly major institution liquidity dry up. moreover, instrument consider “capital” could really absorb losses, least bank remain operating. second, liquidity: enough attention pay risk that, event market shock, fund liquidity could become much difficult. comfortable assumption market instrument would remain liquid prove unfounded. third, so-called “shadow bank system”: systemically important activity go outside “regulatory perimeter”. this include activity investment banks, hedge funds, finance companies, money market mutual fund institution often close tie banks, special purpose vehicle (spvs), structure investment vehicle (sivs) conduits. these entity typically le closely supervise unregulated, case risk-taking behaviour subsequent travail systemically significant impact core financial system. fourth, cross-border arrangements: globally active bank entity operate apparently seamlessly across national border legal jurisdictions. but structure allow actually quite complex, legal, supervisory crisis-management arrangement remain nationally based. so come time manage process deleveraging wind institutions, degree complexity increase cross-border nature issues. finally, pro-cyclicality: episode demonstrate – – financial system impart dynamic reinforce natural cyclical tendency economy. in good times, lender investor tend confident act le caution. standard decline bank come pressure either use “surplus” capital return shareholders. 2 163/2009 backward-looking risk metric present risk low reach dangerous level high everyone already become much risk averse. this serf fuel boom bust. many commentator argue account standard contribute pro-cyclicality. fair-value account buoyant market make strong valuation boost record profit, problem emerge bank mark-to-market security whose market effectively cease function. the incurred-loss basis provision – event occur provision make – promote transparency one sense. but arguably inhibit build-up buff good time cushion future losses, prompt provision turmoil, harm profitability confidence. other incentive also see add cyclical behaviour. remuneration package financial institutions’ executive employee appear structure way may encourage trader manager take excessive risk activity appear profitable short term lead large loss late on. people also point role early regulatory changes, credit ratings, complexity instrument weakness market infrastructure, mention long period low global interest rates, “global imbalances” play role. i don’t want underplay factors, five big theme i want focus today. what done? much already done, underway, respond weakness various standard-setters, financial stability board within g20 process. many response organise five headings. first among capital regulation. now worth point out, go on, something stretch suggest, commentator have, so-called basel ii framework blame crisis. in fact build-up crisis occur old basel i capital rules: global bank even implement basel ii crisis begun. u bank still use it. basel ii perfect address shortcoming basel i identify financial crisis. it allows, example, great differentiation different type risk, introduce capital charge off-balance sheet exposure structure investment vehicle conduits, create neutral incentive hold asset balance sheet securitising them. have basel ii place, might prevent crisis would probably help matters. nonetheless, basel ii improve light experience crisis. the basel committee bank supervision process implement numerous changes, essentially require capital higher-quality capital. it already finalise change risk weight certain exposure relate securitisation, issue new supervisory guidance compensation, governance, risk management concentration risk.1 it change rule around disclosure valuation practices, come effect end next year. the committee currently rethink amount high-quality capital bank hold, specify instrument include definition, develop non-risk-weighted simple leverage ratio supplement risk-weighted capital adequacy measures. the committee intend finalise latter set new capital 1 specifically relate to: securitisation exposure trade book; sponsorship off-balance sheet vehicles; re-securitisation exposures; pipeline warehouse risk regard securitisation exposures. bi review 163/2009 3 rule end year calibrate 2010 detail “quantitative impact assessment” gauge effects. second, effort bolster liquidity management underway, basel committee plan introduce new global standard fund liquidity soon. this likely require financial institution focus adequate fund liquidity long time horizons, well resilience demand stress scenarios. in line this, apra recently release consultation proposal enhance liquidity risk management authorise deposit-taking institution australia. third, regulatory perimeter extended. some relatively le supervise institution problematic prior crisis long exist – example, u investment bank failed, convert into, assume by, regulate banks. but institution whose action could occasion systemic importance, hedge funds, subject oversight. fourth, attempt make help cross-border issue creation supervisory “colleges” large institutions. these design promote good share information across countries. agency financial stability board also work protocol cross-border crisis management. regard pro-cyclicality, proposal develop use capital regulation would require bank increase capital good time run crisis. the proposal involve introduce target counter-cyclical capital buffers, re-designed minimum capital requirements. the basel committee also work promote use forward-looking provision policy base expect losses, rather current arrangement base provision loss already incurred. account standard-setters continue work international convergence clarity regulation. they issue guidance emphasise need judgement value mark-to-market asset market asset inactive, work simplify valuation rule financial instruments, seek close loophole generate incentive off-balance sheet activities. some observation all worthwhile work. it form part comprehensive set response conclusion draw crisis. implement present demand schedule regulators. i want offer observation might realistically expect time. these criticisms, rather nuance are, view, worth noting. the first right balance need strike regulation effective enforcement exist regulation. there doubt regulation improve event like this. yet jurisdiction end serious problems, others not, even though all, less, operate internationally agree framework bank supervision. why remain question interest. secondly, assumption regulatory change go ahead, one effect presumably make process financial intermediation costly. the intention, all, lender operate capital risk taking. but capital free; shareholder induce supply it, pay for. high-quality liquid asset typically carry low yield too, mandate high liquidity (modest) cost well. admittedly argue shareholder financial institution le risky investment prepare accept low returns. but customer financial institution – depositor borrower – also pay via high spread lender pay fund charge loans. that is, 4 163/2009 pay ex ante use safe financial system, oppose taxpayer pay large cost ex post re-capitalise risky system run trouble. now course protect interest taxpayer important, doubt certain type behaviour need back much capital, severely curtail even stop altogether. it appropriate price play role achieve that. we try ensure, however, cost necessary. the egregious behaviour mainly 30 40 large, globally active banks. they impose large cost bank systems, economy taxpayers, global economy. but thousand bank world whose risk appetite get control, remain solvent, need public capital injections. so sensible ensure, far can, propose measure act effectively constrain bad excess former without unnecessarily shackle latter. i personally persuade intellectual basis simple overall leverage ratio. it go whole thrust idea capital allocate economic risk – all, basel risk weight sophisticate leverage ratio already. i see persuasive evidence bank country leverage ratio place systematically outperform not. nonetheless, already agreed, australian official join basel committee, device would introduce “back-stop” prevent extreme leverage instance basel rules, reason, may not. provide suitably calibrated, leverage ratio probably great harm. that is, however, important provision. be calibrate way unnecessarily constrain common garden variety commercial bank, could unduly costly. so calibration important regard critical adequate time allow completion technical work assess quantitative impact measure. that take least another year. a far propose counter-cyclical capital buff concerned, appeal idea, base notion precisely moment capital appear abundant, profit high economy boom true risk approach peak. require capital put aside time, support balance sheet cycle turns, sound desirable. but think easy achieve. the proposal appear involve balance degree mechanical linkage particular variable – credit – appropriate degree short-term flexibility. those familiar old debate rule versus discretion monetary policy might notice echo here. base experience monetary policy, i sceptical durability hard rules, familiar difficult deliver genuinely counter-cyclical policy. there reason think really easy use prudential tool “macro-prudential” purposes. that say can’t devise framework combine certain rule-like behaviour sensible degree discretion, might take while. in case monetary policy, take couple decade more.2 if one incline place good deal importance quality supervisory judgement – i think – much may achieve adjustment account arrangement 2 we end form constrain discretion: reasonably clear medium-term objective combine short-term operational flexibility, independence decision maker day-to-day political process (with accountability legislatures). the counterpart framework counter-cyclical capital management will, successful, require similar elements, include independence relevant decision-maker – political process market institution affect decisions. bi review 163/2009 5 provision complex set variable capital ratios. what need allow bank easily make forward-looking provision either supervisor think should. this important area work regulators. one also realistic use balance sheet regulation macro-prudential tool may attractions, panacea. of course may occasion set monetary policy right economy desire calm over-exuberant borrow behaviour particular sector. in cases, kind temporary regulatory measure may well useful. but recollection australian experience 1960s 1970s know, fundamental problem actually financial condition easy – is, interest rate low – balance sheet regulation won’t ultimately constrain credit growth. over time, private market find way business outside regulate sector. then authority face question whether expand scope regulation sector – 1970s. a possible outcome that, hard regulate set institution result last crisis, likely become next crisis occur hitherto unregulated part, perhaps even among institution yet exist. if condition people want take risk gear up, find way. of course, acceptable provide relevant private party allow fail without bring core part system. caveat emptor apply outside regulate net spillovers. but risk-taking activity go long enough, sufficient leverage may well accumulate somewhere make ensue deleveraging generally disruptive, place policy-makers awkward situation. too big fail and bring u difficult issues, namely too-big-to-fail institution. here term “big” might mean large balance sheet, refer interconnectedness complexity. or three above. in countries, debate issue quite active. one potential response tax size: much high capital requirement “systemic” institution low greatly probability failure really large firm, either make large firm much le risky, give incentive long large. another approach would simply much intensive – intrusive – supervision entities. either measure could complement requirement large firm compile “living will”, write break-up/wind-down plan ahead time – process, hopefully, highlight bite complexity ought remove still alive. before regulator even get possibilities, would grapple practical difficulty set threshold constitute “systemic”. expect furious lobby finance sector that. nor issue domestic nature. it go heart mean globalise financial system. in absence clearly articulate rule burden sharing, potential failure one institution complicate framework global governance crisis resolution keep process globalisation itself. it hard so. even region europe six decade continuous effort build collective structures, resolution problem entity like fortis has, accounts, difficult. one response would unwind globalisation financial institution go back local bank local business. that seem absurdly costly, though – general, capital flow tremendous force high live standard long run. it would surely retrograde step shut off. a le radical response would subsidiarisation – foreign bank presence form locally capitalise govern structures, local authority could intervene event shock another country affect viability parent. that still entail cost term efficiency, albeit one country might prepare tolerate. to succeed 6 163/2009 approach, country would need capability resource ensure viability local subsidiary fail major global institution, take control necessary. this would time tremendous damage relevant global brand. for many small country might big ask. in crisis itself, too-big-to-fail issue present simply imperative number government prevent failures. but crisis recedes, global financial system gradually nurse back health, issue go leave big linger challenge. the financial stability board direct particular attention come year. it likely amenable simple solutions, easy ones. in mean time, enormous moral hazard, perhaps great ever before, exist global financial system result action – albeit essential one circumstance – 2008. conclusion a year ago, i wish audience much le interest 2009. that wish partly fulfil 2009 le “interesting” 2008, though still quite bore enough view. a 2009 draw close, thing global financial system look much le worry year ago. with sense immediate crisis much reduced, regulator devote focus job design implement change regulatory framework – work good do outside period crisis anyway. realistically, task reconfigure regulatory framework low probability, cost, future crisis assist recovery recent one. that every bite difficult challenge get immediate crisis itself. it require careful judgment strike right balance cost benefit revise regulatory structure practices, due regard possibility unintended consequences. it also take great deal determination part regulator enforce arrangement adequately future booms. and little doubt boom occur because, ultimately, cycle greed fear cannot regulate away. to assume unrealistic optimism again, point, overwhelm sober instinct investors, bankers, commentator others would triumph hope experience. but can’t beyond u achieve worthwhile reform area 2010 year hope make progress. i wish merry christmas prosperous stable new year. bi review 163/2009 1 rundheersing bheenick: positive development

bi review 163/2009 3 bank never hit headlines. now bank seem daily front page news. and last fortnight bank mauritius contribute fair bite well. you know i’m really one conspiracy theories. but last year, make another jam bond film, i remind advice goldfinger bond, eponymous thriller: “mr bond, say chicago – once happenstance; twice co-incidence; the third time it’s enemy action.” obviously, must become paranoid see enemy conspirator everywhere. but, maybe banker heed advice, flak jacket re-examine, economic partners, bank about, future role real world. what exactly business in? i think crisis give useful pointers. a bankers, business make money: go astray, give much latitude young man barings, young man société générale, army bonus-seekers play hard fast peoples’ money like leeson kerviel. the business bank business. it business you, operator real economy, promote business, secure economic social welfare sustainable development. the money end itself. the bottom line matter … top line. that i keen explore another model bring money close action real economy – islamic banking. some may know i last week. a pity, tell bite street theatre i missed. last week, i away gulf states, time i

african archbishop’s depiction church: “like train take sharp turn” now point, i must confess, i hear mutter that, sometimes events, i tend drift little beyond allot time! so let reassure two things. first insomniac full version take year letter stakeholder issue weeks’ time. it website. which mean i shall soul brevity now. second, echo word lord birket, i object people look watch i speaking. but i strongly object start shake make certain still working! briefly, then, i take hat tonight response, innocent bystanders, financial crisis shake world beyond shores. government fiscal policy bold, effective. we bank adjust 4 163/2009 monetary step dance perfect cadence. to applause fund world bank, i must add. our bank prudent safe harbour storm. the private sector sanguine people market place manage business business well. i think tonight take collective bow! for unlike general crash, abroad, mauritius last two year definitely bad years. indeed, thing considered, shine best, show fortitude good judgment weather storm. for mauritius is: • no crisis credit, • no crisis housing, • no collapse banks, • regulation sound, just, timely respected. what more, mauritius: • inflation come down, • public debt declining, • the economy buoyant, • revenue increasing, • growth remain positive • you (at least) pretty safe jobs. here, i remind difference recession depression, define harry truman: “it’s recession neighbour lose job; it’s depression lose yours.” now, may guess, i preoccupy day i certainly depressed. for are: • improve forecast methods, • establish transparency, • already roll add support enterprise distress smes, • see efficiency customer-friendly services, stimulate smart fresh high street entrant show old timer new trick two, • move towards regional role clear house comesa. total asset bank continue grow well, deposit advances, scarcely whiff toxic fume beset distant neighbours. thus, appreciate brief remarks, stewardship bank negative recent press coverage might lead uninformed observer believe. let give strong positives. first, management foreign exchange reserves. our net international reserve increase nearly rs18 billion stand rs96 billion october 2009. that’s increase nearly 23% since december 2006. this constitute 40 weeks’ imports, 38 week import december 2007, notwithstanding rise value import period. still topic, tiny mauritius become 2nd

dollar, spite “theatre de boulevard”. the bank also act lender last resort foreign exchange time last year trade credit line dry up. i sure grand daddy central banking, bagehot, would approved. third,

finally, i must observe, core problem business, fiscal monetary policy, know whether success. last time i offer maradonna theory interest rates; tonight may i close offer albert einstein theory

another successful conference bahrain. bi review 168/2009 1 mark carney: current issue household finance remark mr mark carney, governor bank canada, the national forum (canadian club toronto empire club canada), toronto, 16 december 2009. * * * introduction a holiday season approaches, attention turn naturally home front. accordingly, comment afternoon focus households. i would like concentrate particular implication canadian household finance financial stability country. i speak toronto year ago, almost day. then, global financial sector crisis buffet real economy. business postpone large investments, household hesitate major purchases. it clear 2009 would difficult year, proved. with 400,000 job lose $30 billion fall output, canadian economy suffer deep, albeit brief, recession. today, outlook improved. while significant fragility remain, global economic recovery support several factors. first, feedback financial market real economy reverse direction. in major economies, inventory cycle turn house sector stabilizing. in addition, considerable fiscal expansion monetary stimulus support domestic demand. nonetheless, bank expect underlie private demand many economy recover slowly, significant balance sheet structural adjustment yet run course. in particular, rebound u.s. consumption project moderate previous cycles. this direct implication canada. while canadian economy likely grow fast g-7 country next year, bank expect recovery protract reliant domestic demand usual (chart 1). in near term, canada grow despite – – pace external activity. the behaviour canadian household thus particularly important. before turn detail, i would like briefly review challenge face u.s. households, direct impact canada insight offer financial stability. u.s. household sector for generation, u.s. household increasingly “saved” capital appreciation rather current income. over last three decades, u.s. consumer spend grow substantially fast national income, drive ratio consumption gdp 62 per cent record 70 per cent (chart 2). in period, personal save rate fell 11 per cent disposable income 1 per cent, household debt double 84 per cent disposable income 165 per cent.1 financial innovations, include home equity loan securitization, drive trends. initially, increase financial system efficiency, diversify risk, smooth consumption. over time, however, financial technology apply increasingly indiscriminately. prudence give way exuberance extent subprime-mortgage 1 household debt include liability households, non-profit organizations, unincorporated businesses, debt latter ultimately claim household sector. 2 bi review 168/2009 market become mainstay expansion.2 when u.s. house bubble collapse weight, household least resilience hard hit. an important lesson american experience cost confine vulnerable households. in now-familiar chain, problem subprime quickly spread prime mortgages, structure product general, core fund markets, and, ultimately, capital base major financial institutions. eventually, virtually every financial asset world repriced. financial stability much linkage specific risks. shock large, unanticipated consequences. a lengthy period adjustment u.s. consumer begin (chart 3). a decline roughly 30 per cent wealth promote quadruple u.s. personal save rate 4.5 per cent. nonetheless, household debt level fall substantially, consumer spend share gdp actually rise new high 71 per cent third quarter.3 give historic decline net worth need save retirement, appear clear u.s. household save need remain elevate extend period time. the new equilibrium household save depend multiple factors, include wealth effects, risk aversion, evolution financial system, employment outlook, credibility fiscal policy.4 the bank currently project u.s. personal save rate average around 5.5 per cent next two years. this judgment consistent ultimately stabilize u.s. net foreign liability position rebuild u.s. household wealth.5 this sustained, high save rate produce historically weak recovery u.s. consumer spend account bank’s relatively subdue forecast overall u.s. economic growth (chart 4). canada’s household sector canadian household finance good shape go crisis americans. the canadian personal save rate high household debt low (chart 5). the ratio consumer spend gdp, 55 per cent, longer-term average canada. a consequence, crisis struck, canadian household le vulnerable. moreover, throughout downturn, canadian labour house market hold good (charts 6 7), mean income net worth canadian hard hit american (chart 3). so, doubt financial crisis accompany recession painful here, canadian le need increase save restore balance sheets. still, canadian save more. the personal save rate country rise eight-year high 5.5 per cent second quarter. the bank project rate moderate slightly medium term. we view sharp increase household save 2 residential investment account roughly 14 per cent gdp growth 2003 2005, inclusive. subprime mortgage account 20 per cent new mortgage origination 2005 22 per cent 2006. 3 it worth note environment rise unemployment, save rate u.s. household work rise even sharply aggregate number suggest. 4 for example, ricardian equivalence predict household would save response high government deficits, anticipate future tax liability require address rise public debt. 5 to 2002–04 average next five years. bi review 168/2009 3 largely precautionary, is, reflect uncertainty economic outlook financial conditions. a economy begin grow confidence gradually restored, expect precautionary save unwound, consumer take advantage unusually low borrow rates. indeed, current stimulative monetary policy meant, part, encourage behaviour. strong growth domestic consumption necessary offset weak external demand order restore canadian economy balance inflation target. recent data consistent expectations. go forward, risks, upside downside, outlook canadian personal save rate. canadian household could remain cautious, chasten recent financial economic trauma, lead durably elevate savings. some issue bring fore crisis, retirement funding, could also alter household save behaviour near term. over next days, federal, provincial, territorial finance minister meet discus issues, recognition importance canadians. finally, protract u.s. global recovery could restrain canadian households, affect confidence economic prospect canadians. on hand, risk that, growth returns, resilience canadian household crisis could lead decline save rate sharper, increase household borrow larger, bank projected. whatever happens, bank’s monetary policy reaction consumer behaviour always drive implication – take conjunction relevant factor – inflation medium-term horizon. household financial stability canada household finance also important financial system stability. a painfully learn u.s. experience, stable financial system fundamental effective function economy financial welfare citizens. in regard, two important considerations. first, financial price stability share common determinant different time horizons. inflation continuously reflect real shock and/or policy responses, financial vulnerability much le predictable. they develop time persist long expected. simply put, behaviour consistent price stability medium term could simultaneously build financial stress long horizon. second, evaluate financial condition canadians, need look beyond aggregate possible change distribution debt among households. the financial system review (fsr) semi-annual bank publication examine development financial system provide analysis policy direction sector. in recent fsr, judge risk stability canadian financial system ebb recent months. at time, assessment risk relate household balance sheet increase further. a note fsr, vulnerability canadian household adverse wealth income shock grow recent years. aggregate debt level rise sharply relative income. those debt level continue grow fairly rapidly year, unusually recession.6 for households, additional indebtedness translate increase 6 real consumer credit, include home equity line credit, grow 7 per cent pace past year, contrast outright decline recession early 1980s 1990s. 4 bi review 168/2009 financial stress. personal bankruptcy canada rise 41 per cent third quarter period year ago, leave number bankruptcy proportion population high level since 1991. delinquency rate loan rise well, proportion mortgage payment arrears three month increase half past year. stress test canadian household sector to understand good vulnerability canadian households, consequence financial stability, bank undertake regular stress tests. the june fsr report potential impact severe economic downturn households. the result illustrate hypothetical increase unemployment could produce loan loss financial institution represent 10 per cent tier 1 capital.7 while near-term risk sharp deterioration labour market diminished, bank belief overall risk financial stability arise household sector continue increase. in particular, combination sustain growth household debt relative income rise interest rate environment could increase vulnerability household adverse shock. in current fsr, bank conduct stress-test scenario examine potential impact grow debt rise interest rate debt-service ratio canadian household (table 1). we look scenario these, think likely outcome, rather provide assessment downside risk could potentially generate stress canadian financial system. the simulation generate scenario indicate that, middle 2012, almost one ten (9.6 per cent) canadian household would debt-service ratio great 40 per cent, threshold household consider financially vulnerable (table 2). moreover, percentage debt owe vulnerable household would almost double. both metric well recent peaks.8 while simulation result purely illustrative, give pause reflection. it would healthy almost 20 per cent household debt extend vulnerable households. nor necessary secure recovery. the risk isolate vulnerable. a shock economic condition could transmit broad financial system deterioration credit quality loan households. in event, increase loan-loss provision reduce quality remain loan could lead tight credit condition broadly and, turn, mutually reinforce decline real activity health financial sector. while broad effect difficult anticipate precision, sectors, retail housing, would likely affect others. such shock would also affect certain segment capital markets, credit card securitization. more fundamentally, strain household sector could also cause generalize rise risk premia, attendant negative implication variety asset prices. 7 this direct impact exclude indirect effect induce stress business financial markets. 8 both metric peak 2000 7.4 per cent canadian household debt-service ratio great 40 per cent, percentage debt hold household reach almost 14 per cent. data available go back 1999. bi review 168/2009 5 conclusion at present, risk arise canadian household sector relatively low. indeed, measures, canadian household finance appear quite healthy. the current rate mortgage arrears, example, remain one-third peak early 1990s. go crisis, canadian household carry considerably le debt american counterparts. that remain true today. data release monday show rebound house financial market increase canadian household net worth 589 per cent disposable income end third quarter, 10-year average. while asset price rise fall, debt endures. moreover, linkage real economy financial sector complex, non-linear, often opaque. that cannot afford complacent. indeed, one objective use fsr profile risk canadian financial system help prevent risk materializing. when risk still manageable precisely best time act. we must vigilant, party must fulfill responsibilities. responsibility start individual. our advice canadian consistent: we weather severe crisis – one require extraordinary fiscal monetary measures. extraordinary measure mean end: return ordinary. although expect recovery gradual protracted, measure working. ordinary time eventually return and, them, normal interest rate cost borrowing. it responsibility household ensure future, recovery take hold extraordinary measure unwound, still service debts. similarly, lender responsibilities. financial institution actively monitor risk stem household take false comfort derive mortgage insurance past performance household credit. a simulation suggest, overall credit profile canadian household could well shift debt continue grow current rates. the bank expect canada’s financial institution continue apply high standard risk management, justly laud world over. policy-makers regulators, include bank canada, responsibilities, well. the bank work intensively office superintendent financial institution (osfi) basel committee design new international capital liquidity standards. the bank collaborate closely department finance discus federal agencies, required, monitor evolve risk take appropriate actions. the bank’s ongoing research analysis financial

ecb financial stability review open remark mr lucas papademos, vice president european central bank, press brief occasion publication december 2009 ecb financial stability review, frankfurt main, 18 december 2009. * * * i. introduction my colleague i would like welcome today’s press brief occasion publication december 2009 edition ecb financial stability review.1 the primary objective review consider main source risk stability euro area financial system provide comprehensive assessment capacity financial system absorb adverse disturbances. a usual, review integrate interdepartmental work ecb bank supervision committee (bsc) escb. it contain 14 box five special feature article address topical financial stability issue focus analytical manner. a past, prepare summary note highlight key message analysis assessment. over past 12 months, extraordinary policy measure take central bank government succeed restore confidence in, strengthen resilience of, financial system around world. in particular, financial system support measure address fund problem key financial institution bolster capital positions. these measures, combination sizeable macroeconomic policy stimuli, set motion mutually-reinforcing process financial system condition real economic performance, foster improve economic prospect fade systemic risk. one important reason low systemic risk abatement tail risk, primarily due downside-protection government financial institutions’ balance sheets. a recovery risk appetite, underpin reduce systemic risk, contribute remarkable turnaround financial market since march 2009. the improve financial condition steep yield curve sufficiently strengthen profitability many financial institutions, especially large ones, extent able absorb considerable write-down security loans, still, average, report material improvement profitability three consecutive quarters. in presentation, i highlight main risk identify assess review associate financial stability challenges. i start certain source risk stem global macro-financial environment. ii. risk global macro-financial environment over past six months, adjustment global current account imbalance continued, drive global economic slowdown overall fall commodity prices, especially energy, peak mid-2008. the current account deficit u project fall 2.6% gdp 2009, almost 2.3 percentage point low previous year. the major counterpart adjustment u current account balance continue surplus economy eastern asia oil-exporting 1 the cut-off date data include december 2009 fsr 27 november 2009. 2 bi review 168/2009 countries. the current account surplus japan project narrow 1.9% gdp 2009, china’s current account surplus forecast decline 2 percentage point 7.8% gdp 2009, robust domestic demand underpin import growth exceed exports. however, ongoing adjustment global imbalance rather fragile, remain largely drive cyclical factor relate financial crisis rather structural factors. look ahead, risk re-emergence sizeable global imbalance stem various sources, include possible widen u current account deficit economy recover substantial fiscal stimulus persists. turn external risk stem directly u economy, positive developments, vulnerability also remain. the u house market show sign stabilisation recent months. both home sale house construction appear bottom since early year, decline house price cease july 2009. the case-shiller future price index ten major u city indicate house price expect remain broadly flat next three year (see chart 1). nevertheless, risk renew deterioration u house market and, therefore, possible loss households’ net worth u financial sector disappeared. while pace increase delinquency mortgage foreclosure slow down, excess stock vacant home remain considerable might continue exert downward pressure house prices. in addition, demand house spur tax credit first-time home buyers, incentive limit time horizon. in u commercial property sector, development lag residential property market, regard price activity. the recent steep fall price raise risk bank financial institution directly expose commercial property market investor u commercial mortgage-backed securities. the outlook u corporate sector stabilise since may 2009, quarter-on-quarter profit growth turn positive first half 2009. this mainly due turnaround profitability domestic financial industry (see chart 2). a consequence, corporate sector default rate expect peak. notwithstanding improvement total corporate profitability, risks: increase non-financial corporate profitability largely due cost-cutting measures, could continue indefinitely, weak demand prospect expect constrain revenue growth. the macroeconomic outlook non-euro area eu country improved, although still unusually high degree uncertainty. in many central eastern european (cee) country eu, vulnerability reduce since may, economic financial situation remain fragile. in particular, economic contraction forecast number country next year. in environment, combination rise unemployment fall household income could expect raise credit risk consumer loan residential mortgages. corporate default rate likely high context well. give fragilities, possibility resurface risk aversion towards region excluded. in several cee economies, vulnerability stem fact sizeable proportion outstanding bank loan denominate currency currency borrower’s income denominated. such mismatch foreign exchange currency position mostly affect households. in country flexible exchange rates, currency depreciation early year mean household would repay large amount expected. recent development serve underline risk exist large stock foreign currency credit outstanding. the share foreign currency lend many country rising, owe wide interest rate differentials. this leave increasingly vulnerable renew weaken currencies, could trigger significant deterioration banks’ asset quality. bi review 168/2009 3 the general recovery risk appetite benefit hedge fund sector. by end october 2009, hedge fund investment strategy already recoup substantial part, even all, loss suffer 2008. cumulative average year-to-date investment return end october 2009 hedge fund investment strategy almost sign opposite report whole 2008 (see chart 3). at time, significant investor outflow early quarters, preliminary estimate third quarter 2009 suggest second quarter 2009 may mark end sector-wide investor outflows. iii. risk euro area non-financial sector let focus risk vulnerability identify non-financial sector euro area economy. despite considerable heterogeneity country level, overall macroeconomic environment euro area improve past six months. the decline euro area economic activity sharp historical standard since third quarter last year, quarterly real gdp growth recently turn positive (see chart 4). in addition, late eurosystem staff macroeconomic projection show gradual recovery 2010, although road ahead likely uneven. among risk stem euro area non-financial sectors, i highlight main vulnerability corporate sector, specific fragility commercial property market, certain risk associate household sector. over past six months, corporate profitability remain low leverage ratio generally increased, intensify balance sheet vulnerability non-financial corporate sector. in addition, bank continue apply conservative lend standards, albeit moderate degree. improvement financial market condition allow large firm partly substitute bank loan market-based debt equity. look forward next months, overall balance sheet condition expect remain challenging, firms’ access external finance likely improve significantly come months, profitability likely remain low. low profitability high leverage put severe strain firms, make le resilient adverse shocks. a consequence, measure corporate credit risk, unconditional expect default frequencies, remain high industry although decline recently sectors. (see chart 5). condition euro area commercial property market deteriorate past six month continue potential source risk many financial institutions. capital value – i.e. commercial property price adjust capital expenditure, maintenance depreciation – prime property decline average 12% (year-on-year) third quarter 2009. all euro area country record decline capital value compare third quarter 2008. the outlook commercial property price rent uncertain largely depend future path economic activity development commercial property market follow business cycle rather closely (see chart 6). some forecaster expect continue decrease capital value rent throughout 2009 2010. turn next household sector, although household indebtedness stabilise past six months, balance sheet sector remain potential source risk financial stability. a relatively negative outlook labour market household income expect offset, least partly, ongoing positive effect past decline interest rate ability household service debts. the annual rate growth loan household sector, especially house purchase, moderated, line weakness economic activity, uncertain income prospect mark slowdown house price (see chart 7). indeed, several euro area country record decline house price first half 2009. 4 bi review 168/2009 iv. risk euro area financial system let turn main source risk euro area financial system. investor appetite risk begin return first quarter year, bring improvement market liquidity decline asset price volatility. the turnaround underpin government-provided downside protection financial institutions’ balance sheets, reduce tail risk, improve macroeconomic news good expect earnings, especially financial institutions. against background, equity market rebounded, lead financial stocks. at time, historically low level money market interest rate induce hunt yield among investors, trigger outflow bank deposit money market fund risky assets, include corporate bond issue lower-rated borrowers. euro area bond equity market over past six months, euro area long-term bond yield declined. however, late november 2009, slope euro area yield curve remain steep point time since launch euro, due past decline short-term market rate (see chart 8). intra-euro area sovereign spreads, well euro area sovereign cd spreads, narrow further, case pre-lehman levels, recently, widen again. look ahead, prospect euro area government bond continue surround persistent uncertainty future macro-financial developments. upward risk yield could stem unwind flight-to-safety flight-to-liquidity flows. in addition, slow expect growth might increase finance need euro area government bond market might face difficulty absorb high government bond issuance. euro area equity market continue recover severe decline experience financial crisis, support market optimism economic recovery diminish risk aversion. valuation measure base price/earnings ratio use long-term trail earn figure suggest market particularly overvalue (see chart 9). alternative valuation measures, base expectation future earnings, provide different signals. moreover, risk stock market price remain, particular associate economic recovery could turn weak expect markets. the euro area bank sector let turn euro area financial institutions, start large complex bank groups. condition euro area bank sector improve markedly first three quarter 2009, account better-than-expected macroeconomic news concomitant rebound financial markets. the euro area bank sector also benefit various financial system support measure macroeconomic policy stimulus. the earn profitability euro area major bank recover significantly, across board, first three quarter 2009, dismal performance second half 2008. nevertheless, dispersion profitability across lcbgs continue wide (see leave side chart 10). the examination individual revenue category shed light factor explain euro area lcbgs’ recent favourable performance (see right side chart 10). net interest income important driver improve bank performance, account steep yield curve wide operate margins. the tighten credit standards, gradual pass-through low policy rate lend rate decline competitive pressure credit market contribute high revenue core bank business. trade income increase even strongly financial market bi review 168/2009 5 recover first quarter 2009 main

growth rate risk-weighted total asset increase capital contribute slight increase regulatory capital ratio median institutions. even institution low regulatory capital ratio comfortably exceed present minimum requirement (see leave side chart 11). provision impair asset serious drag euro area lcbgs’ income 2007 2008. to large extent provision still relate securitised loans, although share loan impairment start grow. most institution report sharply high provision loan loss (see right side chart 11). moreover, express percentage total loans, loan-loss provision high third quarter compare five

euro area bank system, remain reliant temporary support measure extend eurosystem governments. box 11 summarise government measure support bank sector discus implication fiscal balances. regard implementation measures, several conclusion drawn: first, take-up rate generally low across measures, substantial variations: use recapitalisation measure relatively widespread, take-up rate issuance bank bond government guarantee considerably low expected. second, large part financial support provide relatively small number institution (see chart 12). indeed, half extend support absorb large three recipient institution category support. the various measure support financial sector amount considerable actual contingent liability euro area governments. although expect small direct impact government deficit short medium term, potential fiscal risk form high refinance cost sizeable country provide significant financial system support, measure seem negative effect market perception

increase somewhat. while lcbgs seem gradually get valuation loss suffer security holdings, sizeable provision loan loss see lately underscore significant challenge bank manage distress loan

the result show euro area bank could face cumulative total loss eur 198 billion exposure security loss eur 355 billion loan book exposure period 2007–2010. the total potential write-down security loan

interest income account steep yield curves. the significant strengthen profitability many lcbgs enable absorb considerable write-down security loan still, average, report profits. some even able return capital receive governments, thus exit financial support. despite recovery financial market improve financial performance euro area lcbgs, several grind caution assess outlook financial stability euro area. let elaborate key risk vulnerabilities: the main risk identify outside euro area financial system include possibility of: • vulnerability reveal non-financial corporations’ balance sheets, high leverage, low profitability tight finance conditions; • greater-than-expected household sector credit loss unemployment rise expected; • surge government indebtedness raise concern sustainability public finances, well crowd private investment; • adverse feed-back financial sector public finance result government financial system support measures, fiscal stimulus weak economic activity. within euro area financial system, important risk include possibility of: • renew financial strain recent recovery bank profitability prove durable; • vulnerability financial institution associate concentration lend exposure commercial property market central eastern european country unearthed; • setback recent recovery financial markets, macroeconomic outcome fail live optimistic expectations. all all, challenge face euro area bank sector period ahead call caution avoid time error disengage public support. in particular, exit decision government need carefully balance risk exit early exit late. exit underlie strength key financial institution sufficiently well establish run risk leave vulnerable adverse disturbances, possibly even trigger renew financial system stresses. late exits, hand, entail risk distort competition, create moral hazard risk come downside protection – include possibility excessive risk-taking – well exacerbate risk public finances. to cushion risk lie ahead, bank need especially mindful ensure adequate capital liquidity buff place. if circumstance require it, bank may need raise new high-quality capital. in addition, banks, especially receive state support, may need fundamental restructure order 8 bi review 168/2009 confirm long-term viability support long available. this could involve shrink balance sheet shed

swiss national bank, end-of-year medium news conference, zurich, 10 december 2009. * * * by large, assessment economic monetary situation september 2009, economic financial development run accord expectations. risk remain significant, reason maintain expansionary monetary policy. global economic outlook before i address outlook swiss economy, allow briefly examine economic development international level, since affect outlook switzerland. sign recovery global economic activity gather strength second half 2009. the ongoing normalisation condition interbank financial markets, together monetary fiscal stimuli, support recovery production, especially manufacture industry. however, legacy crisis still weigh heavily. the economic rebound past month largely result public sector intervention, yet anchor firmly enough. except emerge asia, rebound partly redress loss sustain 2008 early 2009. capacity utilisation rate still generally low, access bank lend remain difficult countries. moreover, labour market situation need restore save level weigh household consumer spending. therefore, still hold view return global equilibrium slow uncertain usually case end recession. swiss economic outlook the swiss economy also road recovery: swiss gdp growth turn positive third quarter. however, value add continue contract manufacture industry. overall, demand labour still fall unemployment number rise. we project moderate recovery 2010. private consumption growth hold back weak household income growth. export benefit gradual return strength external demand. this allow manufacture production recover, albeit unevenly across different segments. in particular, new order equipment good segment probably continue suffer excess capacity international level. in switzerland, too, increase manufacture production enough allow excess production capacity reabsorbed. consequently, equipment investment unlikely see improvement several quarters, could fall number manufacture jobs. in construction industry, hand, degree resource utilisation satisfactory, demand stabilise. for 2010 whole, snb expect real gdp growth 0.5% 1%, follow decline around 1.5% 2009. change monetary financial condition overall, monetary condition reflection expansionary policy, especially respect interest rate monetary aggregates. 2 bi review 167/2009 the libor currently level target since march year, i.e. 25 basis points, level regard floor. the fact impossible bring rate low lead us, march, introduce instrument order make monetary policy expansionary circumstance demanded. monetary condition become expansionary via interest rate channel particular. indeed, credit premia capital market decline steadily since begin year. a yield confederation bond remain low, long-term yield also trend downwards. it thus become cheap company raise fund borrow capital market. in addition, figure show finance form bank loan also become attractive follow decline libor. in real term – i.e. factor expect inflation – interest rate even lower. the swiss franc appreciate slightly trade-weighted terms, result recent weaken dollar. however, remain stable euro, show monetary policy follow since march effective. an appreciation swiss franc euro would run counter relaxation monetary condition bring interest rate channel. this snb continue act decisively prevent excessive appreciation swiss franc euro. an assessment monetary condition mislead base prices, which, like currently libor, reach bound. for reason, assessment base quantity – money credit – particularly important current circumstances. the monetary base increase substantially since october 2008, financial crisis enter new phase follow collapse lehman brothers. we supply interbank market sufficient liquidity meet burgeon demand climate uncertainty, order prevent increase money market rates. since then, precautionary base money demand decline reabsorb liquidity accordingly. the monetary base thus fall 28% compare peak record april 2009. the level sight deposit is, however, still almost ten time high crisis. there thus risk excessive money creation confidence restored. monetary condition judge term bank sector liquidity, rather basis liquidity available household firm – i.e. monetary aggregates. m3 growth, modest long time, accelerated. in october, reach annual rate 7.7%. m1 m2 show strong growth. the significance growth rate limit uncertainty link crisis reinforce general public’s preference liquidity, interest rate extremely low levels. it therefore useful analyse transmission monetary stimulus lend channel well. mortgage loan provide particularly good reflection effect monetary policy. why? essentially, mortgage loan use finance real estate projects. but yield investments, nature long-term, heavily dependent level interest rates. this relationship confirm again: sooner cut interest rate growth rate mortgage loan begin increase strongly. have hit low 3.2% november 2008, growth rate begin accelerate steadily, reach 5.1% october 2009. in month, lend swiss franc decline rate –0.3%, normal period weak economic activity. all all, lend household firms, large small, continue grow past months, growth mortgage lend largely offset drop lending. accord late snb bank lend survey, phase tighten lend condition could come end. the share bank report slight tighten condition corporate lend fall considerably, 40% time previous quarterly survey 3% quarter. household appear benefit similar trend, bank announce tighten lend condition households, bi review 167/2009 3 whereas previous quarter 50% bank report slight tighten lend condition non-mortgage loan 20% mortgage loan households. the survey also suggest demand loan stabilised. the share bank experience increase household demand mortgage fall 40% begin year 10%. the situation switzerland thus different observe economies. not credit crunch, also witness substantial increase volume mortgages. there also sign relaxation lend condition mortgage loans. we would like sound note caution, bank firm households, regard risk inherent relaxation discipline real estate financing. inflation outlook monetary policy influence medium long-term inflation outlook. by contrast, little effect short-term developments. the past two year perfect illustration this. inflation peak 3.1% july 2008, plummet –1.2% july year. this reflect extreme movement oil prices, reach usd 145 barrel july 2008, fall usd 35 december year. the temporary nature fluctuation inflation correctly anticipated, evidence previous inflation forecasts. since take time impact monetary policy fee through, would futile attempt counter movements. the path inflation near term largely dictate recent movement oil price associate base effects. inflation already return positive figure end year. this mainly due base effect link usd 35 low reach oil price december 2008. inflation tend decline thereafter, despite recovery growth. in fact, economic activity remain subdue return gradually normal. inflation nevertheless remain positive throughout 2010. assume monetary policy remain unchanged, new forecast show inflation begin increase begin 2011, reach 2% first half 2012. our expansionary monetary policy cannot maintain indefinitely without incur inflation risks. considerable uncertainty remain attach inflation forecast. global economic development could le favourable i describe first section remarks. the financial crisis could reappear. monetary policy decision the inflation outlook change since september assessment. it confirm expansionary monetary policy cannot maintain next three year price stability compromise long term. however, swift correction monetary policy would precipitate since inflation outlook still associate downside risks. if risk materialised, could face threat deflation. the uncertainty relate global economy level recovery within financial industry. these factor persuade snb opt cautious stance, leave monetary policy course unchanged time being. strengthen snb’s equity capital on 4 december, snb bank council decide strengthen snb’s equity capital double allocation provision next five years. this decision prompt growth market credit risk snb’s balance sheet (creation snb stabfund increase currency reserves). give high level distribution 4 bi review 167/2009 reserve result expect 2009, decision

167/2009 1 thomas jordan: swiss monetary policy provision introductory remark mr thomas jordan, member govern board swiss national bank, end-of-year medium news conference, zurich, 10 december 2009. * * * introduction tension global financial market begin abate spring, continue ever since – though despite talk recovery, still far pre-crisis levels. whereas initial price rise mostly correction previous excessive falls, market currently drive mainly improve economic outlook, companies’ predominantly positive earn report expansionary monetary fiscal policies. however, still considerable uncertainty financial markets. in course crisis swiss national bank aggressively relax monetary restraints, sometimes tread new path implementation monetary policy. i shall briefly summarise instrument use connection financial crisis, highlight effect snb’s balance sheet. the risk exist snb’s balance sheet snb could potentially require take onto balance sheet demonstrate importance strengthen equity capital. i shall therefore, already indicate chairman govern board, jean-pierre roth, briefly explain new regulation govern policy provisions. one monetary policy crisis measure snb’s stabilisation fund (stabfund), i shall deal later. i shall conclude remark comment change term admission swiss franc repo system. deployment monetary policy instrument crisis trend snb balance sheet from october 2008 march 2009 carry massive reduction libor target range several steps. the important instrument expand liquidity phase repo transaction currency swaps. since reduction repo rate 5 basis point december 2008, pursue de facto zero interest rate policy. begin october 2008, heavy foreign demand swiss franc influence level libor – make necessary conduct swiss franc/euro currency swaps. swap agreement central bank give foreign bank access swiss francs, thus bring libor faster. a march 2009, order loosen monetary rein room interest rate reductions, adopt so-called unconventional measures. these take two forms: intervention foreign exchange market purchase bond issue domestic borrowers. in addition conclude long-term repo transaction term 12 months. so far measure take achieve objective set ourselves. the three-month libor close target range 25 basis point since middle september. foreign currency purchase prevent swiss franc rise euro, addition exchange rate euro swiss franc significantly le volatile. chart 1 show substantial increase hold foreign exchange reserve result interventions. positive conclusion also draw regard bond purchases, help reduce risk premia swiss capital market. to date, bond purchase total around chf 3 billion. however, hardly make purchase since mid-september due substantial improvement swiss franc bond market. 2 bi review 167/2009 these measure accompany substantial expansion balance sheet (charts 1 2): around chf 110 billion crisis, snb’s total asset reach peak chf 245 billion april year. the figure begin decline, reach around chf 210 billion november. on asset side balance sheet, fall foreign currency swap mainly responsible drop. on liability side, domestic banks’ sight deposit play important role. these fall weekly peak chf 81 billion end april chf 47 billion end november. however, liquidity bank system still high. before crisis, sight deposit amount average chf 5 billion only. the use unconventional measure also change nature part liquidity created. liquidity result repos currency swap temporary: flow back automatically transaction renewed. liquidity create acquire foreign exchange swiss franc bonds, conversely, permanent. we expect keep foreign exchange bond purchase snb’s balance sheet extend period. a part impend normalisation monetary policy, snb bill – introduce year ago – therefore play central role. liquidity absorption mainly conduct issuance snb bills. consequently, part balance sheet future fund interest-bearing debt capital. moreover, expansion balance sheet substantially increase snb’s credit currency risks. strengthen snb’s provision the financial crisis highlight important snb solid equity capital buffer. without it, snb would unable carry risk currency reserve internally – would position take measure stabilise financial system prove essential financial crisis. equity capital, furthermore, central independence credibility snb. in spite extensive crisis measure taken, snb’s balance sheet robust ever – though financial stress resistance heavily dependent distribution reserve, high present. like provisions, form part snb’s equity capital. in short term help absorb losses, long term transfer confederation canton distribution profits. if distribution reserve, snb’s resilience could guarantee limit degree. there two reason this: one thing, need measure safeguard system could arise unexpectedly, greatly increase risk face snb suddenly; another, risk significantly high permanently expand balance sheet. the snb therefore decide additionally strengthen equity capital, thus balance sheet. the snb’s ability long term respond crisis must dependent distribution reserve. this possible snb increase provision current level. in past, increase provision year rate equal average nominal gdp growth previous five years. the snb intend double allocation financial year 2009–2013: instead approximately chf 1.5 billion, chf 3.0 billion allocate provision 2009. strengthen provision reduce potential future profit distribution confederation cantons. on current view, however, annual profit distribution chf 2.5 billion expect maintain 2017, current agreement profit distribution lapses. this view substantiated, particular, fact distribution reserve increase considerably result profit expect year 2009. a collapse gold price heavy currency loss snb, however, would increase risk profit distribution would adjust 2017. the snb point risk considerable time, regardless current plan strengthen provisions. bi review 167/2009 3 the snb stabfund it year since package measure support ubs announced. over period, risk snb stabfund significantly reduced. two key indicator spotlight: amount snb’s loan stabfund, snb’s overall risk exposure, include non-funded assets. the stabfund take asset usd 38.6 billion 30 september 2008. of total, usd 8.8 billion consist contingent liability need fund time. the remainder fund equity capital pay ubs (10% total assets, i.e. usd 3.9 billion) debt capital advance snb, thus initially amount usd 25.8 billion. risk exposure snb, i.e. total portfolio le equity capital, thus equal usd 34.7 billion end-september 2008. the snb’s loan stabfund stand usd 20.8 billion end-october 2009, reduction usd 5 billion – almost one-fifth – initial figure. the fund repay loan come repayment earn assets, proceed asset sales. the stabfund come market first time june 2009. the market’s positive performance make possible occasional sale total value usd 1.5 billion conduct end october 2009. contingent liability decline usd 4.7 billion, mainly credit default swap (cds) expire prematurely terminated. at end november 2009, non-funded asset total usd 4.1 billion. total risk exposure fell usd 10.2 billion usd 24.5 billion. change snb’s risk exposure respect stabfund summarise table 1. one effect recovery financial market begin spring trigger rise market value investment category hold stabfund. this development, together result comprehensive cash flow projection entire portfolio, confirm snb view unimpaired prospect receive repayment loan full. however, calculation bedevil great uncertainty – risk snb remain substantial. a stabfund value much portfolio amortise cost, recovery financial market modest effect financial reporting. the cumulate loss end third quarter (since 1 october 2008) usd 4.4 billion. equity capital report thus remain negative, though loss entirely cover time secondary loss protection – warrant purchase 100 million ubs share nominal value. by end stabfund’s first financial year largely complete build-up operate activities. in last months, follow asset transfer phase december 2008 april 2009, asset management process set up, risk monitor financial report expanded, internal control system operational risk management introduced. these process improve next year, asset management take key role. while intrinsic value asset represent key element manage portfolio, process must merely mechanistic. now possible sell liquid asset last months, attention focus closely two tasks: minimise large concentration risks, ensure – portfolio dispose – best possible equilibrium maintain various respects, include degree liquidity holdings. broaden participation swiss franc repo market the unsecured money market collapse financial crisis break august 2007 properly recover day. the repo market, conversely, money lend securities, emerge crisis-resistant mainstay financial system. the efficient swiss repo system – snb conduct normal monetary policy transaction – prove especially robust. 4 bi review 167/2009 the snb depend liquid swiss franc money market efficient implementation monetary policy. this why, addition domestic banks, foreign bank admit swiss franc repo market long ten year ago. from 2010, snb open repo market financial market participant switzerland (including liechtenstein) enjoy status banks. however, new participant supervise finma (or regulatory authority liechtenstein), must genuinely active swiss franc money market. furthermore, guarantee business transact professional manner. the initial candidate likely insurance company significant treasury activity swiss francs, possibly manager swiss franc money market funds. in expand participation repo market, snb seek increase liquidity swiss franc repo market. in way plan promote secure money

pass since last aaoifi-world bank conference, strike profound change financial landscape since then. the last time conference take place shadow bankruptcy lehman brothers. this cast dark cloud world financial system global economy. for period several week appear institution strong, large, prospect failure unthinkable. there widespread risk aversion financial market reluctance bank lend risk create vicious downwards spiral. the interbank market frozen. bank unable raise wholesale fund force cut back lending. this reduce availability credit otherwise sound borrowers. rise default rate turn feed perception lend bank risk. and cycle take another downward turn. in response downward spiral many government – especially advance economy – take series extraordinary measures, include provision liquidity unprecedented amounts, provision recapitalization support, government guarantee deposits. these measure successful break psychology lead vicious downward spiral. although global economy yet fully recovered, sign recovery situation immeasurably good 12 month ago. there many might say event global financial system little relevance islamic finance. many islamic finance industry point shelter impact crisis part shari’a prohibit excess leverage speculative financial activity root. they also take comfort fact many participant conventional finance, well regulators, policy-makers begin ask whether lesson learn principle islamic finance might help avoid future crises. recent event certainly create great opportunity islamic financial industry. at time, however, room complacency industry make opportunity arise need ensure lesson crisis fully learned. some lesson quite general apply equally conventional islamic finance. central banker regulator learn must pay attention risk common throughout entire sector industry. these risk might immediately apparent review balance sheet financial statement individual institution. 2 bi review 167/2009 an example risk bank assume exit speculative position time. this require assume financial market always remain liquid normal times. but every financial institution operate assumption, point everyone try rush exit point financial market cease function. there seller buyers. this happen conventional finance bank invest structure financial instrument like cdos clos find couldn’t sell price. now people might believe islamic financial institution cannot invest cdos clos, must immune problem. but think exposure many islamic bank real estate market. it might reasonable assumption individual institution could exit profitably property development funding. but many institution make similar assumption project funding, industry whole may find difficult exit investment without substantial loss within reasonable time-frame. a lesson crisis specific work account standard setter thus aaoifi. this lesson relate importance disclosure transparency. good disclosure ensure risk clearly identify market counterparties able form consider view value financial instrument investments. the financial crisis involve multiple failure disclosure transparency. for example, conventional bank move asset structure investment vehicle (sivs) “conduits” form part normal financial report disclosures. because entity regard off-balance sheet opaque regulator counterparties bank sponsor them. similarly, know, risk disclosure various structure financial instrument inadequate permit purchaser instrument perform proper assessment risk/reward trade-off. many investor purchase asset believe different risk profile turn case. again,

system, mortgage foreclosure policy conference, chicago, 10 december 2009. the original speech, contain various link document mentioned, find u federal reserve system’s website. * * * good afternoon. i want thank federal reserve bank chicago opportunity offer perspective house market – topic paramount importance u all. the conference theme suggest i take retrospective journey homeownership past, bring present day think current challenge conditions, leave insight future state mortgage finance house policies. with holiday season upon us, i must admit i find trip reminiscent ebenezer scrooge’s journey a christmas carol. the ghost homeownership past might, retrospect, remind u seemingly idyllic time nation’s history, high rise homeownership rates, ghost homeownership present would likely describe one bleak period nation’s economy. but i hope ghost homeownership yet come would much cheery dickens’ spectral visitor would show u future house mortgage finance system function efficiently provide adequate safeguard consumers, lenders, investor go forward. i’m afraid i cannot describe you, assuredly dickens might, future market look like, i share think general principle that, i would argue, look new market structure practice may emerge. responsible home ownership house finance let establish outset i believe responsible homeownership has, many years, prove good business good public policy. the benefit derive sustainable homeownership – include robust local investment household financial stability – bring value community. homeownership principal mean many family build wealth financial stability time, use wealth investment education entrepreneurship, transfer wealth future generations. lender engage safe, sensible underwrite help ensure borrower match loan product repay. in turn, borrower use debt buy productive asset could otherwise purchase. although leverage gain bad name recent crisis, responsible sustainable leverage normally help individual become homeowner sooner. the scarcity available mortgage lend present – especially lack relatively low-down-payment product beyond veteran administration (va) federal house administration (fha) market – hurt modest-income household lack assets. this make especially difficult first-time minority homebuyers enter market. go forward, challenge encourage responsible, well-underwritten loan product segment market ban lend activity unfair deceptive. homeownership past depend far back walk ghost homeownership past, might reach seemingly idyllic world mortgage simple contract make local institution lend portfolio consumer could make substantial 2 bi review 167/2009 payment excellent credit. but ostensibly happy place, many responsible consumer exclude benefit homeownership, fund lend limited, lend institution ultimately find unmanageable interest rate risk. in 1990s early part decade, financial engineer secondary market mortgage lead development flexible products, efficient underwrite systems, alternative new borrower enter market – good outcome do right. experimentation, technological advances, data model allow development niche mortgage product could good meet need particular subgroup potential borrowers. these tools, couple risk mitigants, allow great number american buy, stay in, home could afford. but innovation prove positive, either borrower investors. the market overheated. mortgage become increasingly complex opaque, mortgage-backed security offer investors. risk innovation become risk layering. a speculative mentality take hold among investor consumer expect limitless house price appreciation. borrower overreached; risk mitigation peel away niche product mass marketed; lender make purchase mortgage loan lax underwrite standards; investor rely heavily turn faulty rat poorly structure securities. all contribute house price bubble that, aware, eventually burst. in response, survive lender severely curtail credit availability. homeownership present the linger effect recent history continue felt today’s house market. we see high delinquency rate every category mortgages. while default 2007 2008 elevate poor underwrite practice use inappropriate mortgage products, current deterioration reflect great degree job loss low house prices. in addition, reduce home equity impair borrowers’ ability refinance mortgage sell home cope income loss, unexpected expenses, adverse life events. numerous public, private, nonprofit effort underway keep delinquency become wave foreclosures. for example, federal reserve’s program purchase government agency mortgage-backed security significantly reduce mortgage rates, which, combination administration’s home affordable refinance program (harp), enable million family reduce mortgage payment year. hundred thousand homeowner make reduce payment trial modification home affordable modification program (hamp). while number encouraging, real success number foreclosure actually avert successful permanent modifications. at board governor washington, regional federal reserve bank across country, provide data bring together different party private, public, nonprofit sector encourage strategy refinance, loan modifications, short sales, alternative preventable foreclosures. the federal reserve system also support local regional initiative address negative effect large number foreclosure individual consumer surround communities. neighborhood house service chicago probably one fine example efforts. in mid-1990s, nh chicago identify predatory lend threat neighborhood served. in collaboration city chicago many others include – i proud say – federal reserve bank chicago, nh form home ownership preservation initiative (hopi). a community across country experience similar problems, initiative become model foreclosure prevention neighborhood stabilization effort elsewhere. this important, tireless work much remain done. bi review 167/2009 3 with respect new lending, data collect home mortgage disclosure act (hmda) 2008 tell story fracture market house finance private mortgage lend come standstill new lend depend heavily government support. the number active mortgage company fell 25 percent 2006 2008, part warehouse line credit mortgage company depend fund loan contract significantly. in addition, overall demand house slow appreciably. indeed, number mortgage application 2008, 14.2 million, half 2006 level low decade. such low level application suggest potential borrower wary enter house market fear turn loan. the 2008 hmda data also show dramatic increase loan make fha va, whose share total mortgage origination high time 19-year history hmda reporting.1 these government-backed loan characterize alternative borrower weak credit record absence subprime market. in addition, presumably attractive moment among affordable option buyer strong credit record modest save available payment. in recent past, borrower would use so-called “piggyback” mortgage – effectively borrow part payment – secure private mortgage insurance compensate high loan-to-value (ltv) ratio. accord data national association realtors, typical first-time homebuyer past several year payment le 10 percent purchase price home.2 secure even much historically barrier home purchase, especially among lower-income, younger, minority households.3 yet high ltv loan help overcome barrier also pose high credit risk. strike right balance loan underwrite critically important prove difficult. the development flexible underwrite standard originally hail potential help million family become homeowners. but point, line obviously crossed, standard dangerously lowered, loan underwrite without regard borrower’s ability repay. when home price fell job lost, borrower asset tap leave exposed. so question is: how market re-emerge enough flexibility allow family achieve homeownership responsible way, avoid mistake recent past? achieve credit quality availability some would argue really risky behavior market. but, unfortunately, backlash restrict lot perfectly responsible lend well. bank reluctant put low possible risk loan portfolios. and market new private mortgage loan securitizations essentially closed. thus, borrower face tight underwrite requirements, even risk profile look relatively “safe” historical standards. moreover, even homebuyers requisite payment realize home equity

demonstrate critical economy well-functioning house finance market. with old mortgage system disarray, are, one hopes, within sight new strong system. while many structural permutation might characterize new system, i would suggest focus four core principle evaluate proposals: adequate consumer protection. first foremost, new system must contain adequate protection consumers. in aftermath widespread abuses, consumer need feel confident satisfactorily negotiate reasonable mortgage. transparency. second, must transparency levels. retail product transparent possible, consumer find easy understand term risk mortgages. lender servicers also make much information reasonably feasible available investors. indeed, adequate information due diligence likely prerequisite attract capital back mortgage market. simplicity. third, new system encourage simplicity. retail mortgage contract ought simple possible. too often, complexity mortgage serve confuse borrower make difficult make inform decisions. similarly, complexity securitizations mortgage package make analysis difficult investors. these structure turn especially fragile stress high default subsequent losses. after crash, delinquency rising, investor find model cash flow alternative scenario confuse uncertain. while complexity may prove inevitable byproduct financial innovation, investor likely demand much simple instrument go forward. properly align incentives. finally, new system feature clear role properly align incentive players. too often recent turmoil, saw example misalign interest compete objectives. for instance, evidence loan officer mortgage broke may concern whether loan profitable personally whether borrower could actually repay.4 servicers, too, turn interest always align investors, different tranche investor compete interest try impose onto servicers. certainly, great clarity role responsibilities, associate compensation participant origination chain, help party understand, properly align, incentives. homeownership yet come under guide principles, would new mortgage market look like? 4 see “did securitization lead lax screening? evidence subprime loans” benjamin keys,

future, servicer contract need provide clear guidance incentive structure lead transparency certainty loan modification loss mitigation tools. performance contract require servicers make investment

ultimate future fannie freddie, market participant need see clear roadmap individual institution role government house finance private market begin map course themselves. conclusion today i attempt

2009. * * * lady gentlemen, i please london today would like thank the economist opportunity deliver city lecture. a regard topic, i think would opportunity reflect future macro-prudential supervision europe. we gradually begin see beyond current crisis consider way strengthen resilience financial system. this project macro-prudential oversight make important contribution. i begin say word current condition euro area financial system. then i make case macro-prudential supervision single market european union discus issue conduct macro-prudential supervision. i conclude remark issue point view financial sector itself. 1. the current condition euro area financial system let start say word european central bank regard current situation financial system euro area. the ecb’s vice president, lucas papademos, present comprehensive assessment soon, base publication next edition ecb’s financial stability review. a case significant financial systems, overall assessment health vulnerability euro area financial system call deep analysis. there particular considerable degree diversity financial performance large financial institution euro area. some still process deleveraging, others show rise appetite risk. it also quite challenge disentangle consider “self-sustainable” development recent market recovery development might highly dependent unprecedented programme official support financial system still place. a result support measure – combination fiscal stimulus improve macroeconomic outlook – strain euro area’s financial system clearly diminish past months, financial market recovery begun, which, areas, look significant. since march year, improvement financial market broad-based. euro area money market spreads, especially short maturities, narrow continuously remain low levels. there also sign unease counterparty credit risk abating. this reflect longer-term spread interbank deposit repo interest rates, also steadily declined. corporate bond equity market continue recover. these development improve financial performance bank euro area. yet crisis securitisation structure product – consequence irresponsible originate-and-distribute model – yet behind us. and next big challenge bank already felt. that challenge stem consequence impact financial crisis real economy, notably deterioration quality loan portfolios. there surge 2 bi review 166/2009 provision loan write-offs. in third quarter year, provision large euro area banks, measure percentage total loans, significantly high previous periods. depreciation loan portfolio lead another wave write-downs, initiate first half year, follow first wave write-down second half 2008, arise mostly mark-to-market loss structure products. not surprisingly, give nature, second wave affect wide range institutions. it also emphasis scale challenge bank face seek strengthen profitability. so even though regulatory capital ratio large euro area bank broadly stand high level crisis, necessity increase capital must stress case number institutions. i urge bank take full advantage recent recovery profitability strengthen capital positions, rather distribute large part profit pay unwarranted level compensation bonuses. strong balance sheet help bank fulfil essential function economy – is, lend. the ecb provide exceptional measures, call ‘enhanced credit support’, bank enable finance broad economy. they must take maintain responsibility. a i indicated, heart financial system start beat much normal frequency again, nobody overlook many wire tube emergency medicine continue administered. a key question u ecb, central banks, concern time withdrawal medicine avoid threat addiction dependency. we make clear unwind enhance credit support timely orderly fashion. last week begin initiate, gradual fashion, unwind exceptional measures. we help fact exceptional measure design eventual phasing-out mind. 2. the case macro-prudential supervision eu let move core topic lecture today. the three question i would like address are: macro-prudential supervision desirable european union; organised; implication financial sector? let look question desirability first. the financial crisis reveal many respects. it reveal scale potential fallout failure large financial institutions. it reveal fragility financial system feature trend cut across institutions, market infrastructures. and illustrate amplitude consequence adverse feedback loop financial system real economy. all three element i describe key feature systemic risk: first, contagion; second, build-up financial imbalance unsustainable trend within across financial system; third, close link real economy potential strong feedback effects. in short, crisis reveal fundamental importance systemic risk. the purpose macro-prudential supervision identify source systemic risk recommend remedial action. of three element i mentioned, contagion link real economy least novel financial crisis. they observe many previous crises. the element unexpected current crisis rigour systemic risk trigger collective behaviour financial institution bi review 166/2009 3 way interact financial markets. the crisis highlight importance improve understand interconnectedness financial system, via direct link financial institution indirect one create financial markets. the crisis teach u major risk emerge within financial system itself. it real economy throw financial system disarray, reverse. endogenous risk – risk emerge within financial sector – many causes. they may arise, example, large part system rely source funding, similar exposure – rise financial imbalances, currency mismatch widespread mis-pricing risk. we also see turbulence arise relatively modest initial shocks. the system interconnect look stable turn “meta-stable”, mean potentially highly instable. snow mountain slope meta-stable, look pristine tranquil yet turn avalanche minor disturbance. the meta-stability system complex concept, call analysis interplay diverse phenomena. in financial systems, phenomenon include herd behaviour, complex network relationship counterparties, contagion common correlate exposure particular asset classes. they also include undesirable pro-cyclical effect prudential rules, account rules, credit rat agencies, compensation system put undue emphasis short-term earnings. on last point, i say so-called bonus culture one many factor drive financial system wrong direction – away intermediation self-referential speculation; away medium-term stability short-term orientation; away service sector self-serving sector. i outline key feature systemic risk underlie need establish new framework macro-prudential supervision. in case europe, still one reason, existence single european market. the single market make financial system much fully integrate would otherwise – term set up, term regulate term linkage real economy structure single market eu. cross-border cross-sectoral financial integration within eu foster competition, freedom establishment free flow capital. the extent integration within eu’s financial sector substantial achievement safeguard aftermath crisis. about 40% foreign claim uk bank euro area, roughly share observe opposite direction.1 therefore, european reason create framework macro-prudential oversight level single market 27 member country european union. the single financial market crucial component overall single market project, macro-prudential supervision enhance resilience market. 3. the conduct macro-prudential supervision the desirability macro-prudential supervision clear. and naturally spring objective – mitigate prevent systemic risk financial stability eu basis identify vulnerability systemic risk assessments. now must turn second question ask supervision conducted.2 1 bi data foreign claim nationality report bank (ultimate risk basis), 2009q1. 2 see also l. papademos, “financial stability macro-prudential supervision: objectives, instrument role ecb”, speech 4 september 2009. 4 bi review 166/2009 almost everywhere world, central bank see playing, call play, important role macro-prudential supervision. in view good reason that. on top key involvement financial sector, central bank posse three main feature qualify function: are, nature, anchor stability; medium-term oriented; independent. central bank traditionally active financial stability analysis. of course, financial stability analysis macro-prudential supervision yet another step. financial stability describe overall resilience system, focus imbalance stress financial system aggregate. while macro-prudential supervision take similarly broad view, must also focus specific source instability specific group financial institutions, add policy component oversight function. overall, effectiveness macro-prudential supervision depend many inputs, include quantitative qualitative information supervisors, regulators, macroeconomists, market participant stakeholder seek identify systemic risk propose policy responses. the analysis systemic risk surveillance assessment indeed demanding,3 much credibility entire framework depend it. in view, difficult piece analysis implication interlinkages complex system understand potential risk might spread throughout system. risk surveillance risk detection call early warn indicator approach capable indicate financial system whole part system approach “danger zone”. risk identification call monitor comprehensive set macro-financial variable forward-looking indicators. this task require detail understand channel emerge risk transmitted. i speak yesterday cambridge analytical challenge underlie systemic risk various research avenue pursued. the challenge effective macro-prudential supervision concern quality recommendation themselves. here, key lie specificity. the specific recommendation are, easy implementation concrete actions. it knowledge supervisory regulatory authority enter equation. it important component macro-prudential assessment and, particular, design recommendation appropriate policy action need contain build-up financial vulnerability mitigate material risks. specific warn require close input supervisors, regulator public private stakeholders. this reason credible framework macro-prudential supervision set broadly, combine variety perspective closely coordinate micro-prudential supervisors. macro-prudential recommendation address individual institutions. this remain sole prerogative micro-prudential supervisors. instead, address regulators, supervisor authority foster regulatory supervisory policies. these authority instrument steer variable maturity mismatches, excessive credit growth, leverage, risk appetite market participants. while might desirable feasible target variable directly, prudential policy instrument – individually combination – affect indirectly. 3 the bank england release interest analysis role macro-prudential policy november 2009, highlight many analytical challenge well. the ecb undertake series research field systemic risk. bi review 166/2009 5 macro-prudential supervision substitute micro-prudential supervision. rather, complement micro-prudential supervision; conceive deep integration financial system make difficult ensure systemic stability focus financial institution one time. in provide specific warn recommendations, base comprehensive analysis systemic risk, effective framework macro-prudential supervision close gap analysis financial stability micro-prudential supervision. set formal framework macro-prudential supervision also help coordinate macro-prudential policy effectively international level. this particularly important eu, give depth financial integration rest world. 4. implication financial sector let turn last part lecture reflect possible implication financial sector. the financial sector important stake well-functioning macro-prudential supervision framework ultimately benefit it. the industry closely involve framework, information insight market participant essential inputs. any well-functioning macro-supervisory framework need support market participants, rigorous monitor systemic risk require continuous market intelligence. contact market participant essential detect important trends, grow financial imbalances, convergence business models, similarity investment strategy innovation financial instrument – name few. it immense value establish structure dialogue financial industry end. anecdotal evidence little relevance possibility drill source risk basis well-founded information regular dialogue market participants. i understand may concern impose additional report burden industry. in view, happen. to extent macro-prudential oversight require micro-prudential data, latter available supervisors, full confidentiality ensured. any additional report would exceptional. macro-prudential supervision also avoid lead excessive burden regulation. the legal principle non bi idem apply regulation: financial sector cannot regulate twice. the aim macro-prudential supervision provide good regulation – possible much better, quantity quality. indeed, i foresee several benefit financial industry well-functioning macro-prudential oversight. the first main benefit course stable financial system, much advantage player industry everyone wide economy. the second benefit is, i mentioned, good regulation, rather regulation. good regulation combine micro-prudential macro-prudential perspectives. macro-prudential policy advice allow market participant internalise potential effect systemic risk conduct business. this enable financial institution improve forward-looking capacity decision-making, take corrective measure sufficient lead time, resilient market tension arise. the third set benefit lie technical level. the analytical progress go hand hand strengthen macro-prudential oversight benefit financial institutions’ in-house risk analysis. 6 bi review 166/2009 this apply particular large, complex interconnect institutions, substantial part macro-prudential analysis likely centred, institution tend contribute significantly level risk overall system. for example, likely benefit enhancement financial institutions’ internal models, include stress testing, notably take account system-wide factor macro-financial variables. a good understand concept measurement systemic risk lead accurate indicator aggregate leverage, correlation concentration exposure specific asset class firm’s interconnectedness. with view enable good measurement key element systemic risk analysis, responsibility financial institution continue enhance transparency granularity individual reporting. this could improve, example, individual firms’ assessment counterparty risks. good measurement also allow good management. risk management decision good informed. and financial institutions’ preparedness specific risk enhanced. 5. conclusion let draw close refer concrete legislative proposal currently underway establish macro-prudential framework eu. this plan establishment european systemic risk board (esrb) basis proposal high-level group chair jacques de larosière. i please see broad support legislative proposal ecofin council, i would like pay tribute european commission swedish presidency prepare advance proposals. the european parliament, always commit advance european supervision micro macro level, currently examine proposal prepare decision. in hear monday week, i much appreciate opportunity present parliament’s committee economic monetary affair perspective matter. the ecb, institution european union whole, institution 27 eu member states, invite provide support esrb. the ecofin conclude ecb provide analytical, statistical, administrative logistical support, close cooperation national central bank 27 states. the ecb’s general council, which, together three head european supervisory authority commission, nucleus esrb, meet least four time year since 1999. the general council prepare approve convergence reports, contribute function exchange rate mechanism erm ii involve wide range central bank tasks, include legal opinions, statistical issue accounting, well regular review monetary policy eu. a central bankers, aware challenge jointly contribute stability eu financial system. a i highlighted, enhance resilience financial system stand highest-order objective institutional market reform implement wake financial crisis. macro-prudential supervision eu count active role 27 governor national central banks, include active involvement mervyn king governor bank england, full participation head european supervisory authority commissioner. it count also close link national supervisory authorities, particularly fsa chairman, lord turner. set way, provide significant contribution resilience financial system. we succeed. at stake stability one world’s large financial systems, also support 490 million citizen european union bi review 166/2009 7 watch effort closely. we count heavily support financial system, would forgive u second time. thank attention. bi review 166/2009 1 rasheed mohammed al-maraj: inaugural plenary session – “regulatory perspectives” speech his excellency rasheed mohammed al-maraj, governor central bank bahrain, 16th world islamic bank conference – session 1: inaugural plenary session: “regulatory perspectives”, manama, 7 december 2009. * * * your excellencies, distinguish guests, lady gentlemen: “salaam alaikum” it pleasure opportunity welcome world islamic bank conference. the 2009 conference sixteenth hold bahrain, wibc firmly establish landmark event calendar. i would like congratulate organiser assemble strong list speaker year’s event, i sure best yet. let begin thank many distinguish speaker appear conference, well event organiser sponsors. collectively, contribution reason success event. it also give great pleasure welcome back his excellency heng swee keat, manage director monetary authority singapore. your presence world islamic bank conference second year succession indication increasingly strong tie bahrain singapore, important role singapore play help develop international presence islamic financial industry. i also like welcome speaker session, his excellency aset issekeshev, minister trade & industry republic kazakhstan, his excellency khalid m. al-aboodi, chief executive officer general manager islamic corporation development private sector, part islamic development bank group. we greatly please u today well. when world islamic bank conference take place year ago, overshadow event follow collapse lehman brothers. for time seem financial institution large strong threat failure unthinkable. there wide-spread risk aversion financial markets. interbank market freeze many bank find difficult fund positions. for time seem world financial system teeter brink total collapse. the nightmare scenario seem unfold eye avert timely effective intervention government around world. bank recapitalized, blanket guarantee deposit issued, central bank provide liquidity unlimited amounts. these measure sufficient stave catastrophe. although bahrain consider necessary resort extraordinary measure adopt elsewhere, central bank take number policy action ensure continue smooth function financial markets. although bahrain badly affect crisis financial centres, room complacency. a 2009 unfolded, impact crisis level real economic activity become apparent. this feed rise credit loss reduce profitability many banks. reduce investor appetite risk also impact bank follow “originate distribute” model, especially fund real estate development distribute share investor special purpose vehicles. more challenge economic condition affect islamic financial industry much conventional one. a result, essential islamic financial industry recognize 2 bi review 166/2009 crisis lesson apply well conventional financial institutions. the first lesson industry might usefully learn importance avoid might term “straight line thinking”. this tendency assume hold true recent year hold true future well. for example, fact economy grow last five year rate six seven percent, lead conclusion continue grow rate indefinitely future. a result, bank financial institution build business plan expansion strategy around assumption indefinite period strong economic growth. these business plan strategy tend come unstuck growth fall short expectation past year. “straight line thinking” result poor decision-making throughout financial industry. late conference hear professor nassim nicholas taleb whose book, black swan, deservedly attract wide attention show fallacy behind kind reasoning. nonetheless, islamic financial industry relatively young one, many institution yet experience full business cycle, “straight line thinking” seem particularly prevalent sector industry. in future islamic financial institution need adopt conservative assumption business plan strategy stress test outcome may optimistic originally assumed. closely relate “straight line thinking” tendency carry away wave euphoria. when market booming, every day seem announcement major new project deal, tempt carry along psychology. banker begin fear lose profit opportunity exploit competitors. they see rivals’ ambitious expansion plan feel must jump board bandwagon. a result industry move herd, gallop direction once. few bother stop consider whether direction head one lead cliff. while important function regulation work herd mentality feature financial market beginning, primary responsibility question direction travel must industry itself. it job prudent banker raise awkward question sustainability bank’s business model ability generate profit long-run short-term. it also worth remember word warren buffet fearful others greedy, greedy fearful. thirdly, crisis also illustrate importance good liquidity risk management. prior crisis, bank management pay little attention liquidity risks. they reluctant invest safe, low yield liquid asset time much good investment return could earn financial instruments. they also assume would possible exit position time, without consider possibility financial institution would try thing time. the regulator conventional bank recognise importance liquidity adequacy parallel capital adequacy. new international standard develop liquidity several regulators, uk’s fsa, already put forward proposal enhance liquidity standards. a doubt aware, cbb recently publish draft consultation paper liquidity standard conventional bank currently consider similar proposal islamic financial institutions. liquidity management has, course, long-standing issue islamic financial institutions. we recognise relative lack sharia-compliant high quality liquid instrument could use meet stock liquid asset test. a know, cbb undertake number initiative recent year assist islamic financial sector overcome difficulty. nonetheless, although recognize problem difficult one, bi review 166/2009 3 management islamic financial institution responsibility ensure take appropriate step limit risk illiquidity institutions. prudent bank require management consider risk adjust profitability. for example, put large proportion bank’s asset potentially profitable, also highly illiquid, real estate development project may fail achieve appropriate risk reward trade-off. if bank put asset long-term illiquid assets, may show high level profitability quarters, unlikely remain business long. finally, let turn role board director senior management. the financial crisis involve failure corporate governance many different levels. there common pattern behind many fail financial institution last 18 months. in many cases, chief executive dominant figure make sure alone take important decisions. there culture open debate discussion within institutions, result member board director feel able challenge chief executive’s decisions. many bank board lack bank experts. individual recruit board bank connection rather knowledge bank industry ability ask right kind questions. board director also fail fiduciary duty consider interest shareholders, also creditor depositors. bank like corporation director need consider interest shareholders. bank special position trust charge look people’s money. this mean interest creditor depositor need equal weight shareholder decision take board directors. recognition directors’ fiduciary responsibility is, therefore, essential element corporate governance banks. this observation apply special force islamic financial industry. the fiduciary duty board director islamic financial institution relate interest shareholders, depositors, creditors, also investment account holder bear many risk shareholders, lack control rights. board director management therefore fiduciary duty consider interest wide range stakeholders. it essential sharia-compliant institution reflect requirement corporate governance arrangements. the four issue i mention today – avoid “straight line thinking”, avoid herd behaviour, manage liquidity risks, high standard corporate governance – lesson learn financial crisis. however, i believe lesson one great relevance islamic financial industry, one need give especially careful attention reform practices. while financial crisis result regulatory change apply conventional islamic bank alike, primary responsibility ensure sound prudent bank practice must reside owner manager bank themselves. post-crisis reform need begin industry examine carefully practice consider whether meet standard various stakeholder right expect. only able sustain public trust essential component successful financial industry. a financial crisis shown, little point pursue short-term profitability long-run result loss public trust industry itself. on note i like thank attention wish conference every success. bi review 166/2009 1 gertrude tumpel-gugerell: the way forward monetary, fiscal macroprudential policy speech m gertrude tumpel-gugerell, member executive board european central bank, conference “europe crisis: resume long-term perspective”, organise confederation swedish enterprise centre global studies, stockholm, 11 december 2009. * * * introduction thank invitation speak today. in short intervention, i focus question post-crisis monetary, fiscal macroprudential policy europe look like. rapid determine policy action avoid thing turn bad peak crisis, bad seem behind us, time look ahead. notably, need reverse temporary, implement need change structurally, reduce chance crisis occur again. monetary policy let start monetary policy. after crisis intensify significantly, bite one year ago, ecb respond swiftly vigorously. in particular, low main interest rate substantially 325 basis point october 2008 may 2009. the current rate 1% low since monetary union start 1999. in addition, take number non-standard liquidity credit support measure mitigate adverse impact dysfunctional money market liquidity situation solvent bank euro area thereby avoid emergence systemic liquidity crisis. to end, instance, provide bank unlimited liquidity expand list collateral, prolong maturity refinance operation 1 year. from beginning, make clear enhance credit support measure would temporary nature remain place long needed. now, take account ongoing improvement financial market conditions, arrive situation fact liquidity measure need extent past. therefore, announce last week initial step gradually phase measures. at time, continue provide liquidity support euro area bank extend period time favourable conditions, – despite start phase – impact previously take measure reach well next year. while still period high uncertainty, exclude setback road back sustainable growth rate stable financial market conditions, also need prepare “normal” times. in respect, particular view recent experience, need ask whether way monetary policy conduct need changed. on that, let first say primary objective ecb remain maintain price stability medium term, continue succeed look measure inflation expectation well anchor line price stability. secondly, comprehensive assessment economic monetary development already take account wide set indicators, include example also asset price credit developments. thus, need change monetary policy framework 2 bi review 166/2009 fundamental way. nonetheless, crisis show detail refine analysis financial market indicator important both, financial stability monetary policy objectives. here need invest become wary financial market risk effect macroeconomic environment. fiscal policy a regard fiscal policies, i concern project strong increase government deficit debt level euro area countries. accord european commission, deficit ratio euro area would reach around 7% gdp 2010 compare 2% 2008; government debt ratio gdp expect increase 84% compare 69% 2008. 13 16 euro area member state face excessive deficit procedure due budget deficit 3% gdp deficit criterion maastricht treaty. certainly, fiscal measure stabilise financial sector wide economy help limit adverse effect economic financial crisis. however, time prepare ambitious well-defined fiscal exit strategies. otherwise, government debt euro area set quickly rise level 100% gdp, might severely undermine public’s trust sustainability public finances. moreover, unsustainable debt development would, medium long-term, put upward pressure interest rates. at european level, fiscal consolidation process guide rule stability growth pact. first, imply set realistic also sufficiently ambitious deadline correct excessive deficit euro area countries. the ecofin council adopt recommendation country-specific deadline fiscal adjustment requirement month. second, national government need specify fiscal consolidation strategy underpin well-specified measures. give project strong increase public spend ratio euro area countries, government focus expenditure-based fiscal consolidation. in past, also prove effective tax increase achieve successful fiscal consolidation. macroprudential policy a formidable challenge central bank community period ahead respond best possible way call enhance macro-prudential oversight. in eu, decision take establish european systemic risk board. this body responsible carry systemic risk surveillance assessment eu-wide level and, consider necessary, translate assessment risk warn possibly policy recommendations. the financial crisis illustrate large gap exist between, one hand, risk surveillance assessment task and, other, advice risk mitigation possible policy follow-ups. the establishment esrb along sister body, european system financial supervision, work close co-operation, represent significant step direction. in new setting, macro-prudential policy instrument aim influence variable maturity mismatches, excessive credit growth, leverage, risk appetite market participants. the type policy tool might activate address systemic risk may include counter cyclical capital buffers, enhance liquidity requirements, forward-looking loan-loss provisioning, leverage ratios, haircut collateral requirement secure lending, set maximum loan-to-value ratio mortgages. in sense, use policy tool take account macro-financial contagion aspects, likely require continuous interaction esrb relevant supervisory regulatory authorities. bi review 166/2009 3 progress make lay framework systemic risk surveillance assessment. the esrb – or, matter, body responsible macro-prudential oversight – aim reduce systemic risk. the establishment esrb also new eu supervisory architecture mean vulnerability potential source risk financial system detect timely manner. this foster good awareness risk potential implications. regulation make system resilient. in fact, extent narrow policy gap systemic risk assessment translation risk mitigate policy actions, ultimately enhance financial system’s resilience adverse disturbances. in sense political support reform absolutely essential. conclusion let conclude. monetary fiscal policies, vigorous swift action peak financial crisis, avoid free fall economic activity dry financial markets. a gradually seem leave extraordinary circumstance behind us, monetary fiscal policy must return normal mode operation. will normal mode look different one crisis? a monetary policy, assure ecb monitor development carefully continue gradually phase-out appropriate time enhance credit support measures, without hamper function financial markets. let also assure maintain price stability remain primary objective. at time, let also emphasize central bank must become wary financial market risk macroeconomic implication overall benefit achieve monetary policy objective. a regard fiscal policies, consolidation effort need implement timely credibly, past particular focus expenditure side. a macroprudential policies, recent crisis strikingly illustrate interconnectedness characterize financial system. this reaffirm need strengthen macroprudential policies, i.e. focus systemic nature risk mitigation reduce chance crisis happen need. finally, let u forget importance self set standard rule financial market themselves. importantly, financial industry must aware responsibility need draw right lesson crisis future practises. thank attention. 4 bi review 166/2009 bi

would follows. first, asian financial system obviously could immune global financial turmoil, indeed seriously impacted. second, compare happen unite state europe, financial system asia remain

u.s./european financial institution also reflect respective balance sheets. while ratio non-performing loan recently show steep rise unite state europe, remain stable low level asia. bank lend growth decelerate sharply unite state europe recently turn negative countries. in asian jurisdictions, also decelerate recent period remain positive, even accelerate china. likewise, japan’s financial system enjoy relative robustness compare u.s. european systems. libor-ois spread2, directly reflect stress fund market, widen aftermath lehman shock end last year, unite state europe. however, yen fund market, spread remain relatively narrow, currently back august 2007 levels. third, impact current crisis asian region small asian financial crisis 1997 1998. the asian financial crisis lead sovereign debt crises, economy compel seek financial support international monetary fund. the situation time nearly serious. 3. background robustness asian financial system this beg question: how could asian financial system remain relatively robust time? in view, main reason memory previous severe financial crisis still fresh minds, lesson learn crisis put good use, even perfectly. there variety factor behind asian financial crisis, combine complex way. the key factor directly precipitate crisis double mismatch currency maturity formation asset liability structure financial institutions, create downward feedback loop currency risk liquidity risk. with bitter experience mind, many asian economy endeavor increase robustness financial systems. first, financial institution take measure improve risk management. mismatch reduced, although effort seem necessary. moreover, asian financial institution adopt cautious approach towards complex securitization product investment decisions, memory asian financial crisis still fresh minds. this lead comparatively low credit cost time. second, asian regulatory supervisory authority make effort enhance resilience financial systems. they use variety measure enhance robustness well transparency financial systems, include attract foreign capital facilitate mergers. moreover, enactment law regulation concern deposit insurance prompt corrective action, financial system provide safety-nets ensure stability time crisis. third, follow previous point, liquidity backstop put place preparation turmoil financial foreign exchange markets. central bank equip market operation tool stand facility ensure liquidity domestic fund markets. a regional network currency swap arrangement expand chiang mai initiative ensure liquidity foreign currency markets. 2 libor-ois spread difference libor overnight index swap rate, could consider indicator counterparty credit risk liquidity premium. bi review 165/2009 3 enhance foreign reserves, flexible foreign exchange mechanisms, stringent fiscal discipline also contribute reduce concern sovereign risk. 4. learn past crisis experience and yet, even learn lesson past crisis teach us, guarantee resilience asian financial system future well? i must say, i refrain optimistic respect. i doubt because, first, difficult u truly learn experience others. since burst bubble subsequent financial crisis japan, much discussion so-called “lost decade” academic policymakers abroad. however, i must say implication experience, severity liquidity crisis balance sheet adjustments, fully take heart3. even lesson crisis correctly understand outside observers, often difficult implement necessary measure jurisdiction without actually experience crisis. for instance, face many fail financial institution burst bubble japan learn importance infrastructure whereby fail institution resolve orderly manner. we overcome many difficulty finally introduce resolution regime equip today. after outbreak current financial crisis, i rather surprise learn resolution regime yet fully introduce many european countries. thus, i realize difficult learn experience others translate one’s action. the financial system asian economy relatively stable current crisis, need recognize feel le pain, asian region may miss something suppose learn new experience. second, memory fade time generation pass. i mention early asian financial institutions, include japan’s, cautious invest complex securitization products, guarantee remain prudent future. history provide u many example one success lead complacency: bubble economy japan late 1980s, east asian miracle early 1990s, great moderation mid-2000s, name few. third, since crisis emerge different guise depend stage development structure economy, way respond crisis also evolve. in order maintain financial stability, mechanism financial institutions’ governance safety-net economy, indeed society general, crucial importance. however, governance mechanism safety-net arrangement appropriate society times. the asian crisis teach u downside free capital flow country equip appropriate bank supervision regulation. in argument so-called crony capitalism, asian financial system criticize opacity, consider result favoritism base family local ties. it beyond ability judge whether criticism justify not, quite possible stage economic social development, factors, long-term customer relationship mutual assistance, role play governance mechanism. the exact form governance mechanism still vary across society even age globalization. in review policy systems, include financial regulation supervision, important jurisdiction strive find answer best fit financial economic structures. 3 see masaaki shirakawa, “way out economic financial crisis: lesson policy actions”, speech japan society new york (april 2009) discussion so-called “lost decade”. 4 bi review 165/2009 5. towards good financial regulation supervision vigorous discussion currently hold variety international forums, include financial stability board basel committee, view reform framework financial regulation supervision. although asian financial system remain relatively stable, cannot guarantee immunity global financial crises, actually significantly impact current crisis. a robust global financial system public good benefit whole world. this cannot over-emphasized. in order prevent another financial crisis, country well aware common objective first place. effort make organize internationally consistent regulatory supervisory framework. in make efforts, must cautious reform financial regulatory supervisory framework conduct well-balanced manner. when talk regulation supervision, confine discussion within sphere regulation supervision itself. we rather keep eye wide context. when embark regulatory supervisory reform, i believe, important strike right balance number dimension follows. balance macroeconomic policy financial regulation supervision first, balance need macroeconomic policy, particularly monetary policy one hand, financial regulation supervision other. in recent years, grow tendency among academic central banker draw clear line role monetary policy supervision regulation: namely, monetary policy aim price stability, regulation supervision aim financial system stability. however, actually witness credit boom period unwelcome combination asset price increase, rapid credit expansion, subdue inflation. a result, debate often frame term trade-off price stability financial system stability. however, true trade-off price stability financial system stability, exist intertemporally economic stability present future. although ensure soundness individual financial institution regulation supervision surely important, sound management effort micro level may sufficient guarantee financial system stability. from macro-perspective, however, maintain monetary policy accommodate excessive leverage maturity mismatch long term, someone eventually take excessive risk, lead erosion financial system stability. that monetary policy, too, conduct macro-prudential perspective, aim sustainable price stability long term. at time, must avoid strengthen regulatory framework become impediment macroeconomic stability. in sense, must carefully ass condition global economy determine time implement strengthen capital standards. for this, declare statement g20 pittsburgh summit september, necessary u take approach strengthen capital standard implement economic recovery assured. balance regulation self-discipline second, balance need regulation apply financial institution one hand, management self-discipline financial institution other. financial market ever-changing business model differ across institutions. give limit resource supervisor regulators, impossible supervise regulate every inch activity financial institutions. moreover, give limit liability shareholders, myopic behavior shareholder manager cannot restrain simply enhance minimum capital ratio standard regulations. before emergence subprime loan problem, financial institution well-capitalized bi review 165/2009 5 term regulatory definition capital. of course, say owe deficiency current capital regulation. that is, risk adequately capture calculation capital ratios. at time, however, seem suggest intrinsically difficult capture risk correctly timely manner. after all, first line defense financial institution manager whose task properly identify manage risk ensure financial soundness institutions. on relate issue, mechanism factor govern self-discipline exercise manager vary country country. a typical example compensation scheme managers. if check disclosure journal u.s. japanese financial institutions, notice huge difference two country term level compensation managers. in recent report, financial stability board describe number attribute require desirable scheme level compensation. for part, i would like emphasize managers’ appropriate judgment strategic issue crucially important. balance regulation supervision third, balance need regulation supervision. there non-negligible difference among country term financial economic structures, well term business model financial institutions. a minimum set common rule need apply internationally active financial institutions. at time, however, also important leave certain amount room local regulator supervisor adapt local situation. for example, appropriate method liquidity management differ accord business model particular financial institution. when consider liquidity regulation, first item come many people’s mind qualify liquid asset would government bonds. however, asian jurisdictions, outstanding amount government bond issue small, result fiscal discipline. for jurisdictions, uniform liquidity regulation could even harmful. in japan, supervisory authority monitor liquidity position financial institution detail manner routine basis. thus, time lehman shock, bank japan position know daily basis fund activity financial institutions, include foreign bank security firms. this type information particularly valuable bank japan conduct open market operation stress situation. this one reason japan’s financial system able remain relatively stable time. of course, country afford conduct monitor regular basis. thus, best way address issue may le different across jurisdictions, might difficult always establish internationally uniform hard-wired standard. a i mention earlier, i strongly believe necessity internationally common rules. that said, hard draw clear line area internationally common rule applied, domestic rule applied. the hold determine whether supervision regulation play main role particular area. i would like emphasize importance both; is, internationally common rule one hand, due respect difference among country institution other. balance prevent crisis contain ripple effect fourth, balance need policy aim prevent crisis aim contain ripple effect crisis already occurred. even effort i mention made, include macroeconomic policies, regulation, supervision, self-discipline, always remain possibility financial institution failure. recognize harsh reality, redouble effort construct financial infrastructure resilient shocks. challenge abound sphere, i would like stress crucial 6 bi review 165/2009 role smooth transfer liquidity across currencies, time zones, jurisdictional boundaries. it lack liquidity, rather lack capital, directly cause failure financial institutions. therefore, endeavor prevent crisis contagion trigger concern lack liquidity. in regard, example, currency swap arrangement cross-border collateral arrangement could effective liquidity supplement tools. enhance infrastructure financial transactions, include shorten settlement periods, also important issue. 6. conclude remark a i argued, strike right balance variety dimension important realize financial system stability. i would like conclude remark word mention order attain kind balance i outlined, crucial relevant organization personnel balance broad perspective issue hand. the japanese financial crisis result burst bubble emerge late 1980s. during bubble era, i work monetary policy area. for several year burst bubble, i involve resolution fail financial institution develop necessary framework carry resolutions. in late 1990s, i move work international financial markets, several year asian financial crisis, i involve work carry committee global financial system host bank international settlements. after that, i return monetary policy area mid-2000s, cover period identify number keywords, include burst it bubble, deflation, yen carry trade. look back, i believe knowledge intuition i gain experience extremely valuable make policy decision face recent crisis. such personal experience lead emphasize importance people involve world financial stability broad perspective possible, rather confine silo, staff experience variety job rotation. it also quite important management central bank regulator foster institutional culture. international human network also vital element develop broad perspective. the recent crisis remind u significance international network cooperation. from viewpoint, i would like express gratitude bank negara malaysia bank international settlement organize fruitful event, make valuable contribution widen perspectives. thank much attention. bi review 165/2009 1 linah k mohohlo: global economic development impact botswana address mr linah k mohohlo, governor bank botswana, global expo botswana 2009, gaborone, 4 november 2009. * * * it honour privilege part festivity mark 2009 global expo botswana, country’s premier international business-to-business exhibition. at outset, let extend special welcome exhibitor visitor overseas sister country region. please feel home midst. this year’s expo come opportune time state global economy stabilization phase, and, therefore, call close economic, trade entrepreneurial interaction order sustain recovery. at moment optimism global recovery, year’s global expo assume great importance ever before. the expo present opportunity explore new avenue investment trade, continue uplift improve collective standard living. it is, therefore, hope desire potential investor seek opportunity investment partner domestic counterparts. at time, domestic entrepreneur able widen horizon acquire new way business; learn foreign domestic counterpart develop market networks. it also desire in, end, develop life-long personal friendship enrich experience individual families. i find appropriate, therefore, theme global expo botswana 2009 “unlocking opportunity current global recession”. this theme call u reflect current weak global economy, call u reflect lesson learn well emerge trends; also afford u opportunity prevent history repeat economic perspective, home globally. a part address theme, i believe relevant i highlight global economic developments, impact economy. since last year, world economy experience bad recession since great depression 1930s. although immediate cause economic recession 2007 collapse mortgage market unite state america, depth spread reflect deep global economic trade imbalance addressed. the recession particularly severe advance economy which, group, forecast decline overall 3.4 percent year. fortunately, emerge develop economy expect register growth rate 1.7 percent 2009; is, nonetheless, much slow rate expansion compare 6 percent achieve previous year. the global recession severely affect international trade. accord international monetary fund, volume trade decline steep 11.9 percent year. the reason simple. rapid economic growth many countries, especially last two decade since end cold war, depend export performance. when import country begin experience economic downturn, demand export decline fast rate slowdown growth. that global consensus time economic recession, effort make bencourage, restrict, trade country bail out. global expo botswana answer call. 2 bi review 165/2009 the good news that, severe, recession le deep last short period many initially feared. this fortunate outcome due unprecedented coordination fiscal monetary policy put place major economies. it clear effort begin bear fruit, extent 3.1 percent global economic expansion forecast next year. such optimism global recovery policy maker discuss best wind-down stimulus packages, international economy progressively return normal performance. in fact, country moderately recession – australia norway – begin tighten monetary policy. france germany realise positive economic growth almost two successive quarters. similarly, world’s large economy, unite state america, grow estimate annualised 3.5 percent third quarter 2009, significantly fast rate expected, first economic expansion two years. thank china continue robust economic growth path. all economic expansion statistic encouraging, even domestic economy, luxury sector diamond mine tourism derive benefit. unfortunately, unite kingdom continue experience constraint economic recovery, expect wood due course. with respect development domestic economy, aware botswana escape effect global recession. however, on-going global economic recovery lead rebound economic activity, particularly third quarter, compare first half year, diamond production. in addition beneficial effect on-going recovery world economy, government spend ease monetary policy contribute strong expansion non-mining sector, enable overall economy grow 1.3 percent third quarter year. this suggest underlie trend economic activity remain positive, partly government able implement fiscal stimulus draw save accumulate revenue buoyant. a result world economic upturn, diamond production resume response steady revival overseas demand rough diamonds; expect trend continue second half year. the resumption diamond export also lead surplus current account balance payment recent months, much foreign exchange reserve increase month consistent decline. a intimate earlier, bank botswana lend support domestic economic recovery ease monetary policy. to end, bank rate reduce 15.5 percent december 2008 current level 11 percent. it important emphasise bank remain vigilant monitor inflation trends, ensure medium term inflation objective 3–6 percent adhere to, despite transient spike prices, push inflation 7 percent september. after bank’s policy stabilise inflation low sustainable level order promote long-term economic growth diversification. needle add, world economy remain fragile. for strong rebound economic activity sustained, need learn current crisis take corrective measures, avoid recurrence recent economic financial turmoil. at global level, discussion need create new economic order. towards end, g20 long obscure talk shop finance minister central bank governor advance economies. although practically develop country participation, take comfort fact transform serious forum world leader take collective global decisions. it also expect assume responsibility policy coordination, role has, now, play g8. after year virtually fruitless discussions, sign progress long overdue reform governance function bretton wood institutions, world bank international monetary fund. bi review 165/2009 3 however, le progress make reform regulation supervision financial institutions. and yet, need curb excessive risk-taking institutions. after all, behaviour threaten collapse global financial system 2008, trigger recession. similarly, little sign revive global trade system doha round trade talks. and yet clear even-handed trade relation could emerge negotiation could boost world trade fulfill g20 commitment discourage country pursue policy restrict trade protectionist measures. here home, one main lesson derive global financial turmoil economic recession reliance one dominant sector far safe. clearly concert effort towards diversify economy even urgent, government need partner private sector endeavour. many build block already place diversify investment development. we macroeconomic stability; strong robust structure sound policy formulation; exchange controls; bank system stable, soundly manage offer diverse products. these

organiser appropriately arrange investment forum, buyer-seller meetings, several workshops. these event contribute significantly achievement objective global expo botswana 2009. i would like take

investment fund statistic euro area introductory remark mr josé manuel gonzález-páramo, member executive board european central bank, first statistical release, frankfurt main, 11 december 2009. * * * lady gentlemen, welcome ecb. today pleasure introduce important new set statistic euro area single economic entity. these statistic provide detail harmonise information asset liability investment fund resident euro area. they compile ecb close cooperation national central banks. fruitful work also conduct liaison european fund asset management association (efama), business association represent room. since inception ecb, major progress achieve develop monetary financial statistic euro area. this work, carry close cooperation member states, result full range timely high quality euro area statistics, ecb constantly monitor perform policy functions. the first major step implementation euro area statistic monetary financial institution (in particular derive statistical information monetary aggregates), lend interest rates, well balance payments. in recent years, effort focus development statistic financial sectors. this also reflect increase link bank sector financial institutions. moreover, statistic integrate euro area accounts, provide overall picture euro area economy. the next milestone release new investment fund statistics, today. for years, ecb already publish un-harmonised partly estimate euro area investment fund statistics, quarterly frequency. today present, first time, harmonise investment fund statistic cover investment fund resident euro area. this include data main fund type bond, equity mix funds, also type funds, include hedge funds. our new dataset contain much detail breakdown asset hold liability issue investment funds. the data provide, example, detail information residency sector issuer security share hold funds. new information available, well, residency holder share issue euro area investment funds. in addition detail quarterly information, ecb also publish key monthly information outstanding amount net sale share issue funds. a important improvement concern timeliness publication statistics: 2010, statistic become available one-and-a-half month (compared 3-and-a-half month past). there many reason high quality statistic euro area investment fund important ecb’s monetary financial analysis. let highlight two them: first, since investment fund large institutional investors, portfolio choice may indicative general trend portfolio diversification. for reason, statistic certainly also useful explain monetary developments. second, change investment funds’ asset value transmitted, valuation shares, household firms. in turn, wealth effects, may implication aggregate demand. the structure financial asset hold investment fund also provide important information regard financial risk indirectly bear household firm portfolio investment fund shares. 2 bi review 165/2009 in addition new statistic investment funds, separate data also publish every quarter euro area money market fund balance sheets. a consequence, one perform analysis whole sector funds. these new data money market fund also useful addition ecb’s monetary analysis. because close substitutability share issue bank deposits, money market fund form part monetary financial institution sector thereby contain m3 figures. from on, new investment fund money market fund data publish regular monthly ecb statistical press releases. i convince new harmonise statistic yield novel insight structure development financial sector euro area economy. the financial crisis clearly demonstrate high quality up-to-date statistic indispensable policy maker market participant alike. thank much attention. now, director general statistics, mr. steven keuning, present detail feature first result new statistics. follow presentation stand ready answer questions. bi review 164/2009 1 mario draghi: the social market economy solution global financial economic crisis remark mr mario draghi, governor bank italy chairman financial stability board, european people’s party high-level policy debate "the social market economy solution global financial economic crisis", epp statutory congress, bonn, 9 december 2009. * * * i please talk progress find implement solution global financial crisis. you decide focus today tomorrow issue critically important economy citizens. and i honour opportunity speak term financial regulatory reform, achieve date priority ahead. one year climax financial crisis, market condition ease significantly degree confidence financial system returned. however, market reaction dubai’s woe reminder remain unusually vulnerable shocks. the crisis imply massive transfer debt private public sector. fiscal position deteriorate across board unprecedented pace. public deficit g7 country surge 2% gdp 2007 10% today. the limit set stability growth pact exceed 2014 least euro area. although necessary unavoidable, extraordinary borrow needs, combine long-term fiscal challenge healthcare, pension system climate change, lead public debt excess 100% gdp oecd country 2010 (up 74% 2007). it surprise therefore market recently sensitive accumulate debt burden government quasi-government sectors. sovereign represent increase share transaction credit protection market (cds), market participant challenge assumption risk-free. government auction face time time unsatisfactory demand, even highly-rated issuers. sovereign cd premia remain volatile elevated. market also show discrimination across countries. while develop country come fund pressure, emerge country low debt level able issue long term, show recent 50-year bond china, sometimes fix rate local currency, unimaginable year ago. so way out, government need communicate credibly medium-term plan restore fiscal sustainability, order limit upward pressure fund cost retain ready access global markets. that important deliver fiscal prudence, also avoid adverse spill-over rest financial system give pivotal benchmark status. on fund front, also heighten risk crowd out. global refinance need firmly skew towards short term maturities. estimate differ, bank corporate bond redemption hover around usd 3 4,000 billon annually 2010 2012, double annual amount mid-2000s. roll-over government debt come top needs. leverage borrower high-yield company also face refinance pressure. and securitization market thaw slowly. overall, market need refinance high debt level low average quality reduce tolerance towards leverage, time window support scheme progressively unwind. such absorption pressure may well lead high volatile fund costs. therefore, time financial institution corporates engage proactively lengthen debt profile tap global market orderly fashion give risk may otherwise force raise fund le attractive terms. 2 bi review 164/2009 amidst challenges, restore well function market-based economy also require exit exceptional financial sector support measure introduce since 2007. clearly, timing, speed modality exit involve important trade-offs, judgment need used. implement exit strategy require strike uneasy balance exit early late. this underscore important resolve regulatory issue front us, part parcel ability exit crisis confidence resilience financial system. bolster resilience financial system broad project encompass considerable number relate measures. it involve multiple layer policy authority across country sectors. and require coordination joined-up international response, make policy effective establish level play field. drive forward coordinate global regulatory response key role g20 leader financial stability board, i honour chair. much policy development achieve – meet eye – implemented, result different financial system one bring u crisis: resilient, disciplined, le procyclical le leverage system; one perverse incentive excessive risk take – private

global. it therefore critical importance that, set constructive path reform respective constituencies, work ensure take place view preserve advantage integrate global financial market level play field across country sectors. the financial stability board take seriously. complete implement financial reform thus remain key imperative – nationally internationally. let speak area critical decision month ahead determine whether credible reform achieved. i leave aside issue reform national regional oversight structures, focus bank capital liquidity, compensation, accounting, derivatives, address moral hazard pose institution big fail. • improve bank capital clearly single important project build great resilience system. through basel committee bank supervision, agree key measure need strengthen capital framework – raise quality quantity capital; introduce leverage ratio constrain bank leverage; require bank create countercyclical buff draw bad times. proposal first two develop end

go usual. the fsb launch review action take authority firms, focus consistency effectiveness achieve intend results, propose additional measure needed. • on accounting, see progress revamp financial instrument accounting. but quite distance achieve objective improved, converge standard le complex le prone amplify economic cycles. this difficult area pursue vigorously dialogue account standard setters, prudential regulator stakeholders. but must way respect integrity independence standard set process. • last least, must reduce moral hazard pose institution large, complex, interconnect fail. the large-scale support provide crisis stave systemic collapse materially worsen moral hazard risks. why financial firm believe authority stand behind condition turn worse? moreover, many bank become larger, small result crisis-related mergers. moral hazard risk pose large prospective burden taxpayer serious threat maintenance market-based system. so done? • at pittsburgh summit, g20 leader call fsb propose end-october 2010 possible measure reduce problems. we evaluate approach three headings, recognise silver bullet one-size-fits solution area: – first, reduce probability impact failure systemically important institution. the aim link capital liquidity charge closely externality spill-over cost failure. here, investigate capital surcharge systemic importance, well role new capital instruments, contingent capital, insurance scheme could play. we also consider option incentivise structure business model support effective supervision. – second, improve resolution capacity, establish credible resolution framework large interconnect financial institution – framework ability fund preserve continuity fail institution’s core functions, authority impose loss shareholder unsecured creditor work also underway improve ex ante crisis preparedness resolution, include use “living wills”. we must recognise, time, achieve effective resolution cross-border entity ultimately require address difficult issue – 4 bi review 164/2009 recognition harmonisation resolution regimes, share across border cost resolution. – third, strengthen core financial infrastructure market reduce contagion risks, include move over-the-counter derivative onto exchange central clear platforms. action latter area shrink risk exposure arise interconnectedness contribute authority choice bail systemically important financial institutions. let conclude two general remarks. first, effective work strengthen global financial system require policy well design robust long run. this necessarily take time. it important, therefore, government send strong message determine see reform through. where international policy development ongoing, need continue support; policy work concluded, need commitment consistent national implementation. second, give commitment g20 leader make coherent approach improve financial regulation, must strive overcome inconsistency final rule-making implementation national regional level achieve level play field. the fsb monitor undertake regular peer review among fsb member – country-by-country, topic across entire membership. the fundamental value peer review dialogue constructive engagement member towards common objective well regulated, open, market-based financial system. in global context, course critically important

the western balkan – regional cooperation eu membership speech mr ardian fullani, governor bank albania, conference “the western balkans: overcome economic crisis – regional cooperation eu membership", brussels, 9 december 2009. * * * during last 20 year region undergo significant structural changes, fuel economic incentive economic growth. in early stage transition fast significant transformation labor late capital market reorient factor production toward productive sectors. this contribute high total factor productivity consequently fast economic growth. the final stage transition dominate robust financial deepen process fuel among others eu base capital inflows. this financial intermediation bust credit growth consumption yield absorption lead growth model region. in aftermath crisis policy choice limited. from broad prospective region choose new philosophy, different boom-bust model last decade. i strongly believe must focal point regional policies. the current crisis point several problem growth models. the call catch process model unsustainable consumption behavior rather sustainable long run equilibrium. despite overall fiscal consolidation relatively high rate growths, result increase macroeconomic imbalance mostly evidence fast enlargement current account deficits. from micro analysis point view reflect unsustainable financial position enterprise household balance sheets, lead persistent fight market share product service bank system. it reason hard gain achievement attain last 15 year eastern europe, get reverse within one week. today, one year eruption financial crisis, i affirm measure undertake central bank country region resemble one another. generally speaking, opinion measure adopt period extreme nature; unusual go “constitution” modern central bank regard liquidity, money market monetary policy transmission channels. however, embrace philosophy “the end justify means”. nevertheless, i think central bank become vulnerable term independence monetary policy efficiency. provide liquidity case, quantity, maturity accept kind collateral would definitely damage monetary policy, potential second round effect financial stability. if central bank short run shift focus primary objective support economic growth cost, would indirectly create premise long ring economic imbalances. the current police pursue monetary fiscal authority consider new normality. while global economy adjust toward new equilibrium, solid macro-prudential long run policy replace current stimulate efforts. therefore challenge economy long run address current problem inherit one base new model growth, base on: (i) high save investments, aim toward contain consumption match domestic production; (ii) persistent fdi inflow orient toward tradable sectors; (iii) regional cooperation. 2 bi review 164/2009 let briefly share think importance last remark, namely regional cooperation. follow argument illustrate benefit cooperation, several levels: • from development point view, increase cooperation integration regional level create great scope economy scale. this would increase incentive local foreign investor undertake big investment project would profitable otherwise. a relate advantage would increase specialization economies, lead high economic performance. • on policy level, coordinate macroeconomic policies, legal prudential frameworks, would tend improve allocation resource prevent beggar-thy-neighbor policies. this race bottom type philosophy would benefit region whole. • from strategic point view, region competition several emerge region global scale. it’s sufficient best guy village; especially increase number village global scale, ever increase number clever guys. • from convergence point view, share experience would avoid costly errors, coordinate policy step would make strong case fast eu integration. we demonstrate region fit enter club, firstly adopt rule club among ourselves. in technical concrete approach, effort public authority region achieve real meaningful cooperation consider followings: first, mentality society region change. it note region history full conflict many disputes. it young generation people open-minded approach region, find solution promote behavior build future path toward europe. second, commitment full integration european union, serve solid platform cooperation, anchor pursue sound policy coordinate structural reforms. third, important precondition strengthen country domestic anchors, specifically form medium-term fiscal rules, fiscal councils, embed fiscal constraint countries’ constitutions. fourth, legal basis support international cooperation fully place. it important cooperation guide set consolidate principle regional relevance. fifth, urgent need policy would encourage strong inward fdi non-bank flows. the region’s growth model might need self-reliant, emphasize domestic savings, good mobilization labor resources, much great role trade good sector engine growth. dear participants, let conclude point region offer interest combination countries, languages, culture geographical composition. analyze individually, difficult think economy generate substantial incentive foreign investors, particularly strategic technologically advance investors, able use advantage provide economy scale. moreover, cost associate different strategic project national level would high still lag economies. i believe plenty room establish joint regional market duty make utmost use it. there still gap region respect infrastructure, energy, tourism, financial architecture, mine agriculture. out task jointly identify miss opportunities, jointly incorporate realistic business plan jointly present bi review 164/2009 3 regional project contemporaneous way private investor supranational agencies, benefit political, financial technological support finally ensure stable growth model. on national level, still need deep structural reform effort make operate concert way across see region. i believe european union structure closely orientate, monitor ass process. this way steadily convert country highly productive economies, attractive foreign investor backdrop favourable labour cost. this make sense fully re-dimension educational capacities, particularly technology area could discover explore advantage compare economies. instead look merely competitors, approach regional cooperation non-zero-sum game, country gain partnership. summarizing, process call risk adverse macro development policies; well coordinate policy mix; strong cross border co-operation, concert effort – perhaps harmonize motivate across region – deepen quality structural reforms. structural reform target improve business environment help foster new capital inflow strong sustainable growth. in respect (and light last crisis lessons), country make good use eu fiscal surveillance process explicit policy commitment

organize minister finance netherlands antilles, curaçao, bank netherlands antilles, willemstad, 24 august 2009. * * * lady gentlemen, good morning! 1. introduction i truly honor invite speak distinguish audience topic touch everyone’s wallet, dollarization. with dollarization context i refer use u dollar exclusive legal tender country. i must admit centrale bank van aruba (cba), although regular bilateral meetings, quite surprise recent consideration bna replace netherlands antillean guilder u dollar legal tender island curaçao short term. in view far-reaching consequence change, possibly aruba too, i highly applaud mrs. de lanooy’s initiative organize forum experts, could enlighten u rather complicate issue. at end, crucial importance require political decision base thorough assessment opportunity risk associate dollarization. in next minute i first clarify view regard dollarization general and, subsequently, i briefly focus special case small-island economy like aruba netherlands antilles. 2. dollarized country country dollarized economy broadly divide two categories. the first group consist countries, generally small strong political and/or economic tie country issue currency use. various island state caribbean (virgin islands) pacific (guam, micronesia) belong group, economic size comparable aruba, curaçao st. maarten. other example include mini state europe like andorra monaco, use euro legal tender. all all, thirty country territory classify category. the second group country much smaller. it consist economy dollarized former special political event economic crisis. ecuador good example case. at end 1990’s, country experience high inflation depreciation local currency (the sucre) government suddenly decide dollarize economy, even without consult imf. mr. stanley fischer, time deputy manage director imf, late state would advise dollarization, bank sector ecuador unhealthy fiscal position weak. however, end, imf decide cooperate 2 bi review 164/2009 ecuador move towards dollarization economy, latter become success economic performance ecuador fairly stable since dollarization introduced. the ecuadorian case prof difficult ass merit cost dollarization. in fact, successfully execute dollarization enough realize stable economic environment: process need follow sound economic fiscal policies, otherwise situation go bad worse. in words: dollarization magic wand! 3. effect dollarization the case ecuador illustrate well hard formulate general condition successful dollarization. it difficult ass pro con dollarization, also necessary analyze country’s start position, ass political social willingness abandon local currency, execute sound economic policy dollarization, order able conclude effect dollarization are. in last ten year steady discussion pro con dollarization. very distinguish economist like stanley fischer (who currently governor bank israel), sebastian edwards, rudiger dornbusch, jeffrey sachs paul krugman make valuable contributions, reach however different conclusion merit dollarization. i briefly elaborate pro con dollarization macro-economic level, thus operational implications. whether effect dollarizing economy consider positive negative, could greatly differ advocate opponents. i briefly refer effect dollarization: 1. dollarization could low transaction costs, especially payment nonresident u dollars. 2. depend capital restriction place depth domestic bank sector, could lead reduce interest rates, thereby make le costly borrow. this could also case acquire international loan, exchange devaluation premium rate charge local company government. 3. because elimination exchange rate risk, dollarization could beneficial international trade foreign investment. 4. the import monetary policy u.s., issue country adopt currency, unavoidable. this mean local policymakers long position use exchange rate absorb external shock finance budget deficit print money. 5. some task central bank, especially function lender last resort, credit line local bank experience financial stress, disappear. this typically link ability central bank print country’s currency. 6. in process dollarization, central bank buy back local currency, large portion current stock international reserve needed. although need international reserve support exchange rate eliminated, still crucial central bank retain adequate level reserve help support economic shocks, well finance operations. 7. dollarization eliminate seigniorage earnings, income central bank issue local currency minus cost print banknote coins. this could lead reduce income government. bi review 164/2009 3 4. view dollarization particularly reduction bank cost perspective low interest rate could make dollarization appear attractive. however, seem stable economic environment strong fundamentals, reliable macroeconomic policy, credible central bank, advantage dollarization marginal. the good track record maintain fix stable exchange rate u dollar. the goal maintain fix exchange rate able benefit trade advantage anchor currency country exist strong economical ties, maintain degree independence term monetary policy. furthermore, cannot deny political social aspect this. have one’s central bank issue one’s currency give political status, often important element national identity. 5. the case aruba only month prior status aparte 1986, island council aruba, many study discussions, decide institute central bank issue currency, aruban florin, nominal value antillean guilder, 1.79 florin one u dollar. the prime reason behind decision perceive complexity within monetary union netherlands antilles hen adopt antillean guilder loss monetary independence fully dollarized economy. for fully familiar issues, i must point decision aruban authority peg aruban florin u dollar unilateral one, anchor central bank ordinance, ordinance govern foreign exchange transactions, state decree value florin. in words, take political decision change exchange rate aruban florin vis-à-vis u dollar. just netherlands antilles, aruba able maintain peg, mean experience unchanged rate exchange u dollar since 1971. start 1986, economy average annual per caput real growth rate 2.3 percent, moderate inflation (on average 4.0 percent), debt gdp ratio 44.1 percent, still manageable, level international reserve adequate (currently 8.7 month import payments). in last two decades, aruba make great economic progress: choose invest tourism and, currently, aruba one popular tourism destination caribbean. two three visitor americans, make strange hear u dollar widely accept mean payment aruba. these economic institutional development demonstrate possible issue manage local currency successfully small open economy like ours. 6. the case netherlands antilles now, i would like turn case netherlands antilles. i know dollarization antillean economy discuss before. a early 1986, de boer kamps investigate possibility dollarization netherlands antilles study initiate university netherlands antilles.1 the author advocate prudence respect 1 j. de boer / j.a. kamps – dollarisatie op de nederlandse antillen. een verkennende studie. una cahier, no. 21, june 1986. 4 bi review 164/2009 dollarization antillean economy, think sensible first investigate situation similar country experience dollarization. to knowledge, follow-up give study. the discussion bring 2005 become clear curaçao st. maarten would become separate entity within kingdom, bes-islands (bonaire, saba statia) elect become integral part netherlands. de nederlandsche bank (conditionally) advise form monetary union various island instead dollarizing economy. this full conformity recommendation make 2004 work group governmental financial relation head mr. jesurun).2 de nederlandsche bank also mention credible independent central bank important form monetary union bna prove well-equipped task.3 7. conclude remark in view forthcoming change kingdom’s statutes, curaçao st. maarten decide short term regard legal tender. although island deem small justify cost associate maintain local currency, experience aruba, entail existence local currency link u dollar credible central bank, give u strong argument continue dollar-linked florin. in choose option, curaçao st. maarten could continue benefit financial soundness dollar, still maintain certain degree monetary independence. last least, i would like point currency choice, whether end would local currency u dollar, purely stage economic act. depend actors, outcome play would drama happy one. in choice dollarization, role central bank would limit nihil, government would become even prominent. there significant shift responsibility. while start fiscal position st. maarten curaçao would advantageous autonomous countries, mean low debt stance, critical fiscal rule benchmark legally imbedded, accountability normal way life. this would ensure internal fiscal discipline guaranteed, need force upon external party. that true independence. i would even go step recommend creation special reserves, would use counteract financial stress. this would provide necessary confidence promote financial economic stability. there doubt excite time netherlands antilles. i strongly advise learn experience aruba, good also bad ones. i wish success

stability review 2009 speech prof hans-helmut kotz, member executive board deutsche bundesbank, press conference presentation deutsche bundesbank financial stability review 2009, frankfurt main, 25 november 2009. * * * i german financial system stabilise in early autumn 2008, international financial system verge collapse. activity interbank money market severely impaired, virtually turnover long maturities. enormous uncertainty prevailed. premium unsecured loan soar 50 time pre-crisis levels. all indicator risk – whether equity, bond, credit derivative market – stand all-time highs. there danger international financial crisis, interact severe slump global growth half century, would lead le uncontrollable downward spiral. a perceptible stabilisation way since spring 2009, however, even though predominantly reflect unprecedented measure take fiscal, monetary financial market policymakers. a bad outcome avert thank non-standard policy measures, apply throughout world. the international german financial system stabilise public sector – germany elsewhere – assume role “risk-taker last resort”. this backdrop present year’s bundesbank financial stability review. at current juncture, domestic credit institution benefit benign global economic outlook. prospect improve markedly, apply especially strongly export-oriented german economy. this immediate positive impact condition financial sector operates. nevertheless, road u strew obstacles. major challenge german bank system still lie ahead. the purpose financial stability review therefore ass possible risk go forward well german financial system’s resilience light potential, unrealistic adverse developments. recent upward revision growth forecast blind u fact benign global economic climate mainly outcome large-scale fiscal stimulus programmes. concurrently, extraordinary monetary policy measure deploy underwrite financial system’s stability. the process restructure financial sector, make possible unprecedented policy initiatives, remain vulnerable, however, setback recovery real economy. the upturn still far self-sustaining. the come year show far fade public-sector stimulus replace endogenous private sector activity – germany’s case, typically generate interplay net exports, capital expenditure household consumption. it still open doubt, however, whether stylise typical upswing actually materialise time round. hence, would premature regard financial crisis, economic crisis directly link it, already run course. clearly, protract period stagnation major economy would pose substantial risk financial stability. the detrimental, self-reinforcing feedback loop unprecedented globally synchronous reduction level real economic activity essentially dysfunctional financial system, unravel since summer year, might tighten again. it follow exit broad-based stabilisation policy predicate calibrate sustain improvement underlie market condition well financial sector resilience. 2 bi review 164/2009 at time, important bear mind implication highly unorthodox measure take support stimulate economy inevitably entail. they inherently carry considerable risk medium long term. a prime example risk balloon government debt many industrial countries. in addition already acknowledged, explicit public debt, bank rescue package obviously impose additional, implicit potential burden public sector. transparent credible strategy therefore crucial unwind manage fiscal – and, course, monetary – policy support measures. should policy-making process lose credibility, would reflect rise risk premium interest rates. high interest rates, turn, would tend depress capital expenditure and, therefore, potential growth. in addition, would hamper already onerous task consolidate public finances, vital ensure sustainable debt containment. it therefore crucial keep market participants’ expectation stability-focused monetary policy well sound fiscal policy firmly anchored. ii ongoing challenge the government public support measure buy financial system time cope loss prepare potential financial strain lurk horizon. moreover, public-sector intervention decisively positive impact outlook earnings. short-term interest rate low level indeed. the yield curve, ie spread long-term short-term rates, exceptionally steep. this naturally allow substantial income generate maturity transformation (see chart 1). income commission fee also soar recently, partly back large-scale issuance government bond public sector oblige launch response financial crisis. income commission fee boost vigorous corporate issuance activity. this also begin boost equity credit market since spring 2009, thus improve banks’ earn form broke proprietary trading. nonetheless, development fragile. it buoy non-standard public sector support package – extra-ordinary – phase point. quite clearly, current conjuncture represent new post-crisis normality. yet mean imply german bank recognise seriousness situation. they consolidate balance sheet also bolster capital buff (see chart 2). for instance, average tier 1 capital ratio rise 2.4 percentage point mid-2007 mid-2009. another positive aspect that, international standards, germany comparatively favourable start position weather financial crisis. for one thing, domestic enterprise household relatively moderate level debt. consequently, percentage non-performing loan correspondingly low. for another, real estate price germany flat long time, thus way decouple fundamentals. obviously, limit credit risk property financing. nonetheless, even case last economic recovery underway, german bank tackle sizeable problems. for instance, balance sheet accommodate substantial value adjustments. base empirical assessment, 17 bank mostly involved, €90 billion impairment already recognised, peak write-down securitisations behind them. give current prospects, additional write-down structure product €10 billion €15 billion expect (see chart 3 4). if, however, price recovery evidence since mid-2009 continues, loss overall portfolio lower. the outlook evolution asset loan book is, however, quite different. here, well-established stylise fact write-down lag real economy’s cycle this also hold current situation. loan loss drag banks’ earn go forward. use information time series well cross-section dimension whole german bank system, conclude write-down €50 billion bi review 164/2009 3 €75 billion expected. it go without say that, particularly juncture, estimate (see chart 5 6) subject significant uncertainty. statistical relation likely le robust typically past. we add assumption economic growth significantly le benign current consensus. therefore, economic recovery accelerates, assume recent forecasts, banks’ re-valuation requirement would correspondingly lower. needle add, project potential write-down automatically translate additional capital requirements. current income well loan-loss provision obviously also use cover potential losses. nevertheless, bank would well advise steel possible negative developments. they time tackle accumulate problem prepare future contingencies. they use capacity adjust created, first foremost, bolster risk provisioning, shore capital enhance cost efficiency. currently, low level lend largely reflect german enterprises’ weak demand credit, hence access credit currently impair capital scarcity. but look ahead, fat capital cushion would strengthen banks’ capacity cater rise corporate borrow demand typically accompany upswing. at time, price credit supply commensurate underlie risks. iii macroprudential approach – new focus supervisor regulator after successfully stabilise financial system, governments, central bank prudential supervisory authority around world face challenge draw appropriate conclusion prevent crisis magnitude recurring. by nature, financial stability public good. it cannot therefore ensure solely private basis. there significant difference private social rationality. action reasonable individual perspective may generate unintended externality produce adverse implication systemic stability. consequently, financial stability cannot expect arise spontaneously interaction private players. at time, absence financial stability may well entail enormous cost society – painfully experienced. therefore, together national international institutions, work hard draw right lesson order contain potential vulnerabilities. a reason crisis multifaceted complex, simple answer quick fixes. what needed, rather, set specific change concrete amendment regulatory supervisory framework. thoroughness take priority speed. one key insight gain – perhaps accurate say reaffirm – crisis traditional microprudential perspective, focus largely individual institution only, long appropriate. to address financial stability issue appropriately microprudential approach supplement macroprudential supervision. naturally, microeconomic supervision remain indispensable. it is, however, far adequate effective prevention crisis upshot systemic stress. a failure take holistic, system-wide view logically imply danger ignore systemic risk emanate interaction financial market players. systemic risk create endogenously rather exogenous origin beyond remit financial markets. it arise, example, form herd behaviour. systemic stress may also result excessive homogeneity, generally render system vulnerable. liquidity risk special important case point. here, feedback effect – difficult fund condition problematic market liquidity – may bring systemic downward spiral. in particular, repo market affect severely. the systemic perspective therefore particular relevance market-oriented financial system (as oppose characterise high degree bank intermediation). the design macroprudential supervision regulation hence raise host complex issues. procyclical element regulation – whether relate capital requirement 4 bi review 164/2009 account principle – may, instance, aggravate inherent up down financial system. if impact regulation upturn different impact downturn, immediate effect real economy. such generator procyclicality may, example, favour build-up credit-financed imbalance upturn. in vein, mechanism might also potentially amplify feedback effect negative market development crisis. to contain destabilise effects, great importance attach future adequate and, particular, counter-cyclical risk buffers. a second challenge arise interconnectedness financial system. this obviously necessary feature modern financial system. but interdependence entail consequence – macroeconomic cost cannot account microeconomic level. these systemic externality increase institution become large interconnected. the macroprudential perspective therefore provide argument treat financial intermediary differently accord position system whole. this functional view also justify regulate market participant outside traditional bank system identically insofar fulfil similar function roles. the appropriate regulation supervision big highly interconnect institution pose particular difficulty collapse would jeopardise financial system whole (“too big interconnect fail” problem). a logical corollary need great intensity supervision. moreover, additional capital requirement make sound analytical sense. yet note practical implementation theoretically advisable idea involve difficulty does, incidentally, formulate anticyclical capital requirements. however, must lead issue ignored, potential opportunity cost society would grave. it clear brief comment add macroprudential perspective microprudential oversight pose major challenge central bank supervisory authorities. the bundesbank seek face challenge devote particular attention macroprudential analysis. since may 2009, work issue focus within newly create financial stability department. this department also mandate write year’s financial stability review. get macroprudential supervision right indeed much work progress. we middle period intense debate. nevertheless, concrete progress already achieve areas. in regard, reform agenda implement g20 summit process, largely guidance financial stability board (fsb), deserve special mention. give significant mutual interdependence well substantial cross-border effects, good reason establish rule international level. inconsistency encourage regulatory arbitrage thus tend heighten systemic vulnerability. therefore, bundesbank much involve work fsb. i would like restrict highlight two aspect enjoy broad consensus international debate. first, consensus one point mention earlier, namely need strengthen financial institutions’ resilience; capital liquidity buff weather crisis increased. more robust capital liquidity requirement well improve measurement exposure risk also necessary risk arise excessive leverage good control future. due account take devise implement rule particularity peculiarity national financial systems. this especially important regard aspire improvement quality banks’ capital base. here essential focus target function – ability absorb loss – rather legal form. in view ongoing difficult economic environment, also evident appropriate transition period granted. overhasty implementation would pave way likely capital-induced credit supply failure. bi review 164/2009 5 second, must ensure incentive structure participant financial system align objective foster sustainable development. this facilitate enhance transparency, strengthen market discipline, even though obviously sufficient own. this apply especially securitisation process. significantly improve standard quality integrity key precondition revive securitisation market. originator direct interest ensure risk (including correlate defaults) capture adequately – instance retain vertical slice securitisations. provide instrument design way make microeconomic risk-taking compatible sound macroeconomic outcomes, play effective role source fund bank sector. they thereby also contribute reliable properly price lend enterprise – important aspect economic perspective. in nutshell, internationally coordinate reform substantially increase stability financial system. on balance, probably imply moderate earn prospect financial sector. however, earn also likely le volatile therefore robust. give considerable negative externality may arise financial institution run distress, seem price worth pay safeguard financial stability. after all, long run bank also benefit stable financial system. chart 1 6 bi review 164/2009 chart 2 chart 3 bi review 164/2009 7 chart 4 chart 5 8 bi review 164/2009 chart 6 bi review 163/2009 1 duvvuri subbarao: financial inclusion – challenge opportunity remark dr duvvuri subbarao, governor reserve bank india, bankers’ club, kolkata, 9 december 2009. * * * 1. be kolkata, city joy, always heart warm experience. be pre-christmas season particular delight, personally, nostalgic memory. my special thank bankers’ club invite speak evening. i recall meet club last year thick deep financial crisis time, u anxious uncertain immediate future. i believe bad behind us. attention around world india shift manage crisis manage recovery. a happens, also return address endure challenge – lift nearly half billion people poverty. there many thing need accomplish gigantic task. one financial inclusion. i would like focus comment even challenge opportunity financial inclusion. financial inclusion – thousand flower bloom 2. if will, let begin couple anecdotes. in rural maharashtra, people, like everywhere else country, face daily challenge water, sanitation, electricity transportation, number woman improve lives, life families, become entrepreneurs, could take bank loan. • take aruna gaikwad. aruna, farm labourer, begin sell excess produce local market. an astute observer law supply demand come price fruit vegetables, soon saw uptick business. to expand, need borrow money could build vegetable stand. the loan help establish thrive vegetable vend business, allow shift away back-breaking work tend people’s fields. her former hand-to-mouth existence give way new reality, one include save check account bank, credit need keep kid school – good fortune never had. • and lakshmi shellar. widow 17, lakshmi help form local self-help group. she speak speak meetings, inspire woman group take future hands. meanwhile, bring bank service them. and provide even literacy classes. the 177 woman lakshmi’s self-help group borrow repay loans. 3. aruna lakshmi two million woman across country demonstrate possible rural woman access basic financial services. this financial inclusion – give people opportunity build good life children. that impulse, give chance, contribute sustain improvement quality life community level foster growth poverty reduction national level. 4. but remain tremendous barrier unleash “fortune bottom pyramid.” chief among them: financial exclusion. this confluence multiple barriers: lack access, lack physical social infrastructure, lack understand knowledge, lack technology; lack support, lack confidence, among others. overcome barrier is, nutshell, challenge financial inclusion. 2 163/2009 why financial inclusion important? 5. why financial inclusion important? it important simply necessary condition sustain equitable growth. there few, any, instance economy transit agrarian system post-industrial modern society without broad-based financial inclusion. a people comfortable access financial services, know personal experience economic opportunity strongly intertwine financial access. such access especially powerful poor provide opportunity build savings, make investment avail credit. importantly, access financial service also help poor insure income shock equip meet emergency illness, death family loss employment. needle add, financial inclusion protect poor clutch usurious money lenders. 6. there another benefit financial inclusion yet fully appreciate let alone exploit. financial inclusion make possible government make payment social security transfers, national rural employment guarantee programme (nrega) wage bank account beneficiary “electric benefit transfer” (ebt) method. this minimize transaction cost include leakages. in part country ebt already take off, result impressive experience payer recipient extremely satisfying. 7. there enormous benefit aggregate level too. the first obvious benefit financial inclusion provide avenue bring save poor formal financial intermediation system channel investment. second, large number low cost deposit offer bank opportunity reduce dependence bulk deposit help good manage liquidity risk asset-liability mismatches. financial exclusion – big picture 8. effort financial inclusion new; government reserve bank pursue goal last several decade build rural cooperative structure 1950s, social contract bank 1960s expansion bank branch network 1970s 1980s. these initiative pay term network branch across country. 9. yet extent financial exclusion staggering. out 600,000 habitation country, 30,000 commercial bank branch. just 40 per cent population across country bank accounts, ratio much low north-east country. the proportion people kind life insurance cover low 10 per cent proportion non-life insurance abysmally low 0.6 per cent. people debit card comprise 13 per cent credit card marginal 2 per cent. 10. the national sample survey data reveal that, 2003, 89.3 million farmer household country, 51 percent seek credit either institutional non-institutional source kind. 11. these statistics, stagger are, convey true extent financial exclusion. even bank account claim opened, verification show account dormant. few conduct bank transaction even few receive credit. million people across country thereby deny opportunity harness earn capacity entrepreneurial talent, condemn marginalization poverty. 12. but bright side story. remember illustration give business strategy courses. a business executive shoe company send large develop country ass market potential there. what saw million people bi review 163/2009 3 go without shoes. he come back report management business potential one wear shoes. a month later, strategist rival company go saw picture. he come back report management tremendous business potential country number shoe sell. ultimately, question mindset. 13. bank must see picture like second business strategist, look opportunity bottom pyramid move financial inclusion big way. rbi’s effort 14. let briefly outline effort pursue reserve bank financial inclusion. our approach financial inclusion aim “connecting people” bank system open accounts. this include meet small credit need people, give access payment system provide remittance facilities. this lead notable developments: (i) no frill accounts: in november 2005, rbi ask bank offer basic bank “no-frills” account low zero minimum balance minimum charge expand outreach account low income groups. (ii) easy credit facility: bank ask introduce general purpose credit card (gcc) facility rs. 25,000. however, total number gccs issue bank end-march, 2009 0.15 million. (iii) simple kyc norms: in order ensure people belong low income groups, urban rural areas, encounter difficulty open bank accounts, “know your customer” (kyc) procedure open account simplify account balance exceed r 50,000 credit thereto exceed r 100,000 year. (iv) use information technology: bank urge scale it initiative financial inclusion speedily ensure solution highly secure, amenable audit, follow widely-accepted open standard ensure eventual inter-operability among different systems. two important initiative are: • smart card open bank account biometric identification. these help customer get bank service near doorstep. • link mobile hand hold electronic device bank transactions. in october 2008, rbi advise bank issue relate technology, security standards, customer protection. (v) ebt banks: the reserve bank consultation state government encourage adopt electronic benefit transfer (ebt) banks. (vi) 100% financial inclusion drive: the reserve bank launch financial inclusion drive target one district state 100% financial inclusion. in light experience gained, coverage extend areas/districts. we carry external evaluation quality 100% financial inclusion report banks. on basis, january 2009, advise bank to: (i) ensure provision bank service near location no-frills account holder variety channels; (ii) provide gcc/small overdraft along no-frills account encourage account holder actively operate accounts; (iii) conduct awareness drive facility offer no-frills account holders; (iv) review extent coverage district declare 100 per cent financially included; (v) efficiently leverage available technology enable financial inclusion solutions. 4 163/2009 business correspondent model 15. possibly important initiative reserve bank business correspondent (bc) model. the bc model ensure close relationship poor people organize financial system. recognize this, 2006, permit bank use service non-governmental organizations, micro-finance institutions, retire bank employees, ex-servicemen, retire government employees, section 25 companies, civil society organisation business correspondent provide financial bank services. 16. even bc model take off, need fine tune monitor appropriately improve efficacy, include good train bcs. recently, enlarge scope bc model permit bank appoint individual kirana/medical/fair price shop owners, individual public call office (pco) operators, agent small save scheme insurance companies, individual petrol pumps, retire teacher self-help group link bank bcs. with view ensure viability bc model, bank also permit collect reasonable service charge customer transparent manner. go forward, reserve bank endeavour give complete flexibility bank appoint bcs negative list entity would eligible. bank branch atm expansion liberalize 17. last year, reserve bank totally free location atm prior authorization. in october 2009 policy review, rbi take big step free branch open town village population 50,000. domestic schedule commercial bank (other rrbs) free open branch town village le 50,000 population enjoin ensure least one-third branch expansion happen underbanked district underbanked states. this one criterion reserve bank’s consideration proposal bank open branch major city (tier 1 tier 2) centres. expansion bank north-east 18. to improve bank penetration north-east, reserve bank ask state government bank identify centre need set either full fledge branch offer forex facilities, handle government business meet currency requirements. we also offer fund capital run cost five year provide state government concern will make available premise put place appropriate security arrangements. meghalaya first block, eight centre allot three public sector banks, follow bid process. the reserve bank work state north-east institute similar arrangements. project financial literacy 19. let say word reserve bank’s drive financial literacy. financial literacy stepping-stone toward financial inclusion. moreover, financial market become increasingly complex serious problem information asymmetry, need financial literacy become even acute. the reserve bank initiate “project financial literacy” objective disseminate information regard central bank general bank concept various target groups. our website also available 13 languages. 20. our “financial education” web site link offer basic banking, finance central bank child ages. in comic book format, simplify complexity bi review 163/2009 5 banking, finance central banking, goal make learn fun interesting. financial literacy credit counsel 21. we advise convenor-bank state level bankers’ committee set financial literacy-cum-counselling centre one district pilot basis, base experience, extend facility district due course. so far, 154 credit counsel centre set various state country. these centre expect provide free financial education people rural urban area various financial product services, maintain arm’s-length relationship parent bank. financial curriculum school college 22. the reserve bank further financial literacy drive collaborate state government across country include financial literacy curriculum school syllabus. we launch pilot karnataka. we give material banking, personal finance well reserve bank state government. the karnataka government adapted, translate include much material curriculum high school class slat go stream next academic year start june 2010. base experience, want mainstream initiative across country. financial inclusion – challenge opportunity 23. let turn challenge financial inclusion potential opportunities. the question ask this: despite rural policy-push, many bankable people unbanked? there barrier access financial service emanate demand side supply side factors. 24. from demand side, big barrier lack awareness financial service products, limit literacy, especially financial literacy populace, social exclusion. many generic financial product unsuitable poor much effort design product suitable needs. the unfriendly unempathetic attitude bank customer also play important role undermine demand financial services. on top that, exorbitant oftentimes non-transparent fees, combine burdensome term condition attach financial products, also dampen demand. 25. from supply side, main barrier transaction cost banker perceive. because current low volumes, bank find extend financial service cost effective. furthermore, lack communication, lack infrastructure, language barrier low literacy level raise cost provide service inhibit banker take initiative supply side. 26. a couple week ago, reserve bank, collaboration boston consult group, organize workshop financial inclusion college agricultural bank pune. the express purpose workshop listen frontline manager operate field opportunity challenge financial inclusion. accordingly, invite workshop, bank branch managers, include rural areas, representative microfinance institution ngos. the chairman large public sector private bank also present. 27. i must say listen participant workshop enormously rich learn experience. the big take away workshop, reserve bank institution personally, even problem extend financial 6 163/2009 inclusion, insurmountable. if reserve bank commercial bank put minds, importantly hearts, together problem resolved. 28. accord hear workshop, three big challenge are: (i) cost; (ii) lack robust technology; (iii) lack awareness. some challenge clearly exaggerate others easily redressed. 29. cost, course, main consideration. it nobody’s case 500,000 village country cover brick mortar branch. that clearly “bankable” proposition. we need go low cost business correspondent model leverage technology deliver financial services. 30. the reserve bank encourage bank use it-enabled financial inclusion leverage smart cards/mobile technology. business correspondent bank make extensive use hand hold devices/mobile phone reach bank service remote villages, especially electronic benefit transfer nrega wage social security payments. this successful andhra pradesh, state-wide project recently kicked-off orissa. in addition, pilot project underway state country. 31. a village-to-village robust electronic remittance system presently available country, enable build suitable infrastructure connect system various bank presently involve electronic benefit transfer (ebt) medium business correspondents. a robust switch similar national financial switch (nfs) locate purpose national payment corporation india/institute development research bank technology may fulfil long felt requirement nationwide remittance system country. this make remittance system efficient, therefore, attractive. 32. i also want emphasize tremendous opportunity way forward reduce cost increase volumes. let elaborate bit. first, demographic profile – labour force 15–64 age group go increase. a job opportunity grow people start earning, income provide large grow source deposit banks. bank ahead curve establish presence vast hinterland country first mover advantage exploit potentially huge opportunity. second, opportunity capture remittances. although firm figures, i tell thousand crore rupee remittance take place across country today, predominantly migrant labour, ninety per cent happen non-formal channels. if bank capture even half fold, reduce cost labour make remittance also advantage enormous, permanent float. 33. third, ebt, electronic benefit transfer, another big opportunity. i believe bank inhibit push forward fear unknown: certain business cost-effective. bank clearly underestimate potential. if indeed, even government payment rural people capture ebt mode, give bank large float make attractive business proposition. so far share cost bank state government regard ebt. a ebt mode expand become universal, bank find viable business model even without service charges. 34. it also relevant acknowledge potential unique identification number (uid) nandan nilekani team work on. the uid powerful instrumentality help poor people establish identity meet banks’ kyc norms. i believe, go reduce cash non-cash transaction cost bank potential customers. the uid another powerful illustration harness technology benefit poor. bi review 163/2009 7 35. the reserve bank make commitment bank-led model financial inclusion support bank financial inclusion initiative way information dissemination, share best practice also regulatory incentives. however, i want add commitment bank lead model irrevocable. there model financial inclusion experiment elsewhere world. should bank fail come forward exploit opportunity financial inclusion, reserve bank hesitate explore model further financial inclusion. 36. a word also microfinance institution (mfis). many bank partner microfinance institution provide financial service relatively high risk segment population. microfinance provide access finance entire sector people leave behind formal financial sector – micro finance demonstrate low-income category indeed “bankable” proposition. but cost remain issue. interest rate charge – 24–30 percent – seem high. compare informal sector, perhaps rate lower, question whether rate affordable. ideally, rate interest charge alignment cost funds, transaction costs, risk cost certain margin, case, need transparency determination fairness application. way forward 37. on way forward, reserve bank push three targets. first, lead bank district ask draw roadmap march 2010 ensure village population 2,000 access financial service bank outlet, necessarily bank branch, march 2011. a aside, let also tell many consumer good company unveil specific strategy target village population le 5,000 micro-markets. it seem bankers, also follow client markets. second, commercial bank – public sector banks, private bank foreign bank – go ask come specific board approve plan financial inclusion march 2010. these plan intend roll next three years. we, reserve bank, refrain deliberately impose uniform model bank want bank build strategy line business model comparative advantage. this hopefully ensure good ownership. the reserve bank consult indian bank association regard. third, learn frontline manager pune workshop top management bank sufficiently emphasize, much le reward, effort financial inclusion. to remedy this, go ask bank include criterion financial inclusion performance evaluation field staff. 38. the reserve bank value two-way communication. by listening, learn appreciate people’s need aspirations. this push u sensitive, innovative responsive. one initiative platinum jubilee year reach remote village – focus financial education – spread awareness economy, emphasize role reserve bank play everyday life make general public aware financial service bank offer benefit use bank services. the outreach programme simultaneous effort educate low income group demand financial service encourage bank supply financial service need poor. i must say experience date outreach programme immensely reward fulfilling. i want thank commercial bank actively cooperate u outreach programme. 39. last week, i visit jalanga village orissa part outreach programme. i impress self-help group – group usually woman get together, pool save give loan member – group empower woman give financial independence thereby confidence. more hope, 8 163/2009 woman vision imagine take advantage slight opportunity work hard make happen. conclusion 40. let conclude reiterating, even cost clichéd, bank poor actually rich bank proposition. financial inclusion win-win opportunity poor, bank nation. because grow incomes, improve awareness levels, aspiration poor rise. we forgive rise meet aspiration poverty imagination. it bank convert see dead-weight obligation excite opportunity move aggressively financial inclusion. bi review 163/2009 1 jan f qvigstad: could financial crisis avoided? challenge international cooperation conflict speech mr jan f qvigstad, deputy governor norge bank (central bank norway), seminar financial crisis arrange prio, oslo, 8 december 2009. * * * what happened? confidence financial market participant collapse september last year follow lehman brother bankruptcy. the price credit jump money bond markets. equity price declined, increase cost raise new equity capital. the authority worldwide respond supply substantial liquidity bank central bank key rate reduced. in many countries, authority provide extraordinary loan take bank maintain confidence institution market activity. in countries, authority purchase security bring long-term interest rates. stimulus also provide increase public sector demand government budget deficit grow unprecedented level countries. the reaction household business increase save private sector demand declined. credit standard tighten risk premium soared. the drop demand rapidly translate contraction trade output. in spring 2009, world trade around 20 per cent level prevail one year earlier. in many countries, total value good service production (gdp) decline several consecutive quarters. country heavily reliant export manufacture good particularly hard hit. unemployment increase sharply country far own. give high level available resources, prospect low normal interest rate among main trade partner time ahead. there sign stimulus measure revive growth, production still low prior crisis. the challenge go forward address problem rise unemployment high government debt many countries. why happen? when queen england visit london school economics november last year, ask host one foresee financial crisis. in july year, question answer panel 33 prominent economist british universities, government institution business sector. the panel cite single cause, web causation. an important factor behind crisis find global macroeconomic development year precede crisis. in 2000s, china make grand entry global trade attendant surge production income. this lead high demand inputs, price oil raw material increased. on hand, global consumer price growth pull export cheap good china country low production costs. interest rate low many country prevent low inflation deflation. in china, large share income saved, either form investment new production equipment financial assets. the increase supply financial save push global long-term interest rates. low interest rate encourage consumer business country borrow capital china surplus countries. the foreign debt country u uk accumulate rapidly year lead crisis. 2 163/2009 historically low interest rate prompt fund manager western country seek new alternative search high yields. new financial save product develop spread investor around world. it often difficult, even impossible, investor value risk underlie products. yield potential also increase leverage security purchases. a long price rise, return equity increase degree leveraging. on hand, risk leave debt, little equity capital, increase price fall. in year ahead crisis, high debt leverage still appear attractive proposition environment low credit risk glut cheap credit. the result surge debt accumulation year precede crisis. price security property market soared. the build-up macroeconomic imbalance year prior crisis increase vulnerability potential amplitude downswing. many observer warn risk associate development one foresee crisis would unfold, would erupt, severity. the global financial crisis reveal weakness financial system. in retrospect, clear financial sector regulation adequate. regulation primarily design ensure individual bank sufficient equity capital protect lender depositor losses, rather ensure stability system whole. for example, requirement stipulate size liquid asset bank must hold weather period failure market funding. nor minimum requirement fund stability. an example importance condition collapse british bank northern rock september 2007. the bank residential mortgage portfolio particularly expose risk. the bank had, however, expand rapidly several years, expansion partly base short-term market funding. when fund market failed, bank promptly encounter liquidity problem compel turn bank england support. when become know bank seek government support, depositor quickly lose confidence uk experience first bank run since 1866. many bank consider solid applicable regulation also encounter problem financial market confidence evaporated. something worked: imf, g20 wto the imf organisation international cooperation base system mutual assistance among member countries. the imf provide loan country experience balance payment problems. the loan finance member countries. if problem stem economic policy mismanagement, loan subject specific requirement measure correct policy. when crisis occurred, imf react swiftly accommodate increase need imf services. the imf’s role lender interlocutor authority crisis-hit country probably help limit crisis. the imf provide support assistance country directly affect crisis country innocent bystanders. the sharp increase imf lend reduce financial resource organization. member country increase contribution imf. during financial crisis, g20 play prominent role international coordination economic policy. the group launch several important initiative crisis, subsequently place responsibility imf. all country stand benefit establishment international meet place major economy consider interest. however, unlike imf, g20 representative body countries. even g20 account large share global output, country included, low-income country region like africa, middle east nordic countries. one possibility develop g20 base imf model country represent constituencies. small bi review 163/2009 3 country like norway, least nordic countries, could represent forum discussion policy major economies. in wake great depression 1930s, protectionist measure introduce many countries. custom duty increase shield domestic industry. a result, world trade continue decline several years. so far, protectionist policy avoid wake late crisis, make possible reverse sharp contraction world trade rapidly hence reinvigorate economic growth. one reason mistake 1930s repeat time may world trade organisation (wto) establish interim. international trade agreement conclude auspex wto contribute bind national government prevent protectionist measures. by large, work well recent crisis. could crisis avoided? the macroeconomic force unleash year lead financial crisis strong. it unlikely single country could stem tide. china’s participation international trade good add several hundred million person global workforce years. this increase room strong, non-inflationary global growth. china prepared, however, liberalise capital market fully. the chinese government will allow currency float freely exchange rate u dollar managed. this disable important stabiliser contribute increase world trade imbalances. long-term interest rate remain low spite substantial monetary policy tighten u 2004 2006. international organisation bis, oecd, imf others note one occasion grow imbalance world economy source concern. but economic policy decision prerogative national governments. give policy pursue china, probably limit monetary policy western country could reality achieve term roll back forces. increase private save u deficit country would probably require monetary policy tighten sufficient push long-term interest rates. alternatively, substantial increase public sector save would necessary. both alternative would probably lead economic policy drive downturn. it demand pursue policy base proposition crisis might occur future. improve financial regulation would probably reduce severity financial crisis. regulation insurance similar features: case annual premium must pay form slightly low growth. this occur capital allow flow entirely freely high yield vehicles. in return, regulation counter build-up financial imbalances. this reduce probability negative event trigger severe financial crisis. it optimal fully insure crisis insurance premium would high. but financial crisis demonstrate imbalance ahead crisis unsustainable could reduce regulatory improvements. the reason occur may risk take form several interweave imbalance single authority power correct. bank financial market regulation enhance norway abroad. the basel committee bank supervision financial stability board (fsb), mandate g20, soon issue recommendation strengthen regulation banks’ capital liquidity management. in uk, regulatory authority already draw new bank regulation. a natural consequence financial crisis increase weight give ensure system-wide stability stability individual banks. other important question whether systemically important bank subject tight regulation reduce procyclicality bank behaviour. 4 163/2009 recommendation basel committee fsb examine national authority subsequently adopt new regulation. in world global financial market, limit far single country go alone. international coordination important new regulation intend effect. the crisis open political window tight regulation financial system, uncertain long window remain open. bi review 162/2009 1 ben s bernanke: frequently ask question speech mr ben s bernanke, chairman board governor federal reserve system, economic club washington dc, washington dc, 7 december 2009. the original speech, contain various link document mentioned, find u federal reserve system’s website. * * * it pleasure speak economic club washington. have face serious financial crisis bad recession since great depression, economy make important progress past year. although economic stress face many family business remain intense, job open scarce credit still hard come by, financial system economy move back brink collapse, economic growth returned, sign recovery become widespread. understandably, situation complicate one, people many question current situation path forward. accordingly, take inspiration ubiquitous frequently-asked-questions lists, faqs, internet websites, remark today i’d like address four important faq economy federal reserve. they are: 1. where economy headed? 2. what federal reserve support economy financial system? 3. will federal reserve’s action lead high inflation road? 4. how avoid similar crisis future? where economy headed? first, understand economy might headed, take look recently.1 a year ago, economy – indeed, world’s major economy – reel effect devastate financial crisis. policymakers abroad undertake extraordinary series action aim stabilize financial system cushion economic impact crisis. critically, policy intervention succeed avert global financial meltdown could plunge world second great depression. but although global economic cataclysm avoided, crisis nevertheless widespread severe economic consequences, include deep recession world’s major economies. in unite states, unemployment rate, low 4.4 percent march 2007, currently stand 10 percent. recently see pickup economic activity, reflecting, part, wan force restrain economy precede several quarters. the collapse final demand accelerate latter part 2008 leave many firm excessive inventory unsold goods, turn lead cut production employment aggressively. this phenomenon especially evident motor vehicle industry, automakers, number face severe financial pressures, temporarily suspend production many plants. by middle year, however, 1 for discussion, see ben s. bernanke (2009), “on outlook economy policy”, speech deliver economic club new york, new york, n.y., november 16. 2 bi review 162/2009 inventory sufficiently reduce encourage firm wide range industry begin increase output again, contribute recent upturn nation’s gross domestic product (gdp).2 although work inventory encourage production, sustainable recovery require renew growth final sales. it encourage begin see evidence strong demand home consumer good services. in house sector, sale new exist home move appreciably course year, price firm bit. meanwhile, inventory unsold new home shrinking. reflect developments, homebuilder somewhat increase rate new construction – mark change steep decline characterize past years. consumer spend also rise since midyear. part increase reflect temporary surge auto purchase result “cash clunkers” program, spend category motor vehicle increase well. in business sector, outlay new equipment software show tentative sign stabilizing, improve economic condition abroad buoy demand u.s. exports. though begin see improvement economic activity, still way go assure recovery self-sustaining. also issue whether recovery strong enough create large number job need materially bring unemployment rate. economic forecast subject great uncertainty, best guess point continue see modest economic growth next year – sufficient bring unemployment rate, pace slow would like. a number factor support view recovery continue next year. importantly, financial condition continue improve: corporation relatively little difficulty raise fund bond stock markets, stock price asset value recover significantly lows, variety indicator suggest fear systemic collapse recede substantially. monetary fiscal policy supportive. and i already mention appear improve condition housing, consumer expenditure, business investment, global economic activity. on hand, economy confront formidable headwind seem likely keep pace expansion moderate. despite general improvement financial conditions, credit remain tight many borrowers, particularly bank-dependent borrower household small businesses. and job market, though long contract pace saw 2008 early year, remain weak. household spend unlikely grow rapidly people remain worry job security limit access credit. inflation affect number crosscurrents. high rate resource slack contribute slow underlie wage price trends, longer-run inflation expectation stable. commodity price rise lately, likely reflect pickup global economic activity depreciation dollar. although continue monitor inflation closely, net appear likely remain subdue time. 2 the three-month diffusion index manufacture – measure breadth production change across industry category – stand 63.8 percent september. see board governor federal reserve system (2009), statistical release g.17, “industrial production capacity utilization”, table 6: diffusion index industrial production (november 17). bi review 162/2009 3 what federal reserve support economy financial system? the discussion economy head bring u second question: what federal reserve support economy financial system? the federal reserve been, still is, great deal foster financial stability spur recovery job economic activity.3 notably, begin process ease monetary policy september 2007, shortly crisis began. by mid-december 2008, target rate effectively low could go – within range 0 1/4 percent, compare 5-1/4 percent crisis – maintain low rate past year. our effort support economy go well beyond conventional monetary policy, however. i already allude federal reserve’s close cooperation treasury, federal deposit insurance corporation (fdic), domestic foreign authority concert ultimately successful effort stabilize global bank system, verge collapse follow extraordinary event september october 2008. we subsequently take strong measures, independently conjunction agencies, help normalize key financial institution credit market disrupt crisis. among money market mutual fund industry, large number american households, businesses, municipality make short-term investments; commercial paper market, many firm tap finance day-to-day operations. we also establish subsequently expand special arrangement central bank provide dollar global fund markets, find disruption dollar-based market abroad spill markets. more recently, play important part help re-start market asset-backed security finance auto loans, credit card loans, small business loans, student loans, loan finance commercial real estate, type credit. by work revive markets, allow bank tap broad security market finance lending, help bank make room balance sheet new credit household businesses. in addition, support overall function private credit market help low interest rate bonds, mortgages, loan purchase unprecedented volume mortgage-related security treasury debt. in efforts, objective support specific financial institution market sake. rather, recognize healthy economy require well-functioning financial markets, move always single aim promote economic recovery economic opportunity. in respect, mean goal fully consistent traditional function central bank mandate give federal reserve congress promote price stability maximum employment. in addition ease monetary policy act stabilize financial markets, work role bank supervisor encourage bank lending. in november 2008 join bank regulator urge bank continue lend creditworthy borrower – benefit economy bank – recently provide guideline bank work constructively trouble commercial real estate loans.4 this spring, lead coordinated, comprehensive examination 19 country’s 3 see ben s. bernanke (2009), “reflections year crisis”, speech deliver ”financial stability macroeconomic policy”, symposium sponsor federal reserve bank kansa city, hold jackson hole, wyo., august 20–22. 4 see board governor federal reserve system, federal deposit insurance corporation, office comptroller currency, office thrift supervision (2008), “interagency statement meet need creditworthy borrowers”, joint press release, november 12, ; board governor federal 4 bi review 162/2009 large banks, exercise formally know supervisory capital assessment program, scap, informally “stress test”. this assessment design ensure banks, collectively hold two-thirds asset bank system, would remain well capitalize able lend creditworthy borrower even economic condition turn even bad expected. the release assessment result may provide sorely need clarity banks’ condition mark turn point restoration confidence bank system.5 in month since then, strong encouragement federal bank supervisors, many large institution raise billion dollar new capital, improve ability withstand possible future loss extend loan demand credit recovers. meanwhile, also continue effort ensure fair treatment customer financial firms. during past year half, comprehensively overhaul regulation protect mortgage borrowers, credit card holders, user overdraft protection plans, among others. in navigate crisis, federal reserve greatly aid regional structure establish congress create federal reserve 1913. the 270 business people, bankers, nonprofit executives, academics, community, agricultural, labor leader serve board 12 reserve bank 24 branch provide valuable insight current economic financial condition statistic alone cannot. thus, structure federal reserve ensure policymaking inform washington perspective, wall street perspective, also main street perspective. indeed, reserve bank branch deep root nation’s community much good work there. they have, give couple examples, assist organization specialize foreclosure mitigation work nonprofit group help stabilize neighborhood hit high rate foreclosure. they (as well board) also much involve financial economic education, help people make good financial decision good understand economy works. all told, federal reserve’s action – combination policymakers abroad – help restore financial stability pull economy back brink. because programs, auto buyer obtain loan would otherwise obtained, college student finance education credit otherwise likely would received, home buyer secure mortgage affordable sustainable term would otherwise. these improvement credit condition turn support broad economic recovery. will federal reserve’s action lead high inflation road? the scope scale actions, however, necessary helpful view, leave uneasy. in all, asset purchase lend cause federal reserve’s balance sheet double, le $900 billion crisis begin $2.2 trillion today. unprecedented balance sheet expansion near-zero overnight interest rate raise third frequently ask question: will federal reserve’s action combat crisis lead high inflation road? the answer no; federal reserve commit keep inflation low able so. in near term, elevate unemployment stable inflation expectation reserve system (2009), “federal reserve adopt policy statement support prudent commercial real estate (cre) loan workouts”, press release, october 30. 5 see board governor federal reserve system (2009), “federal reserve, occ, fdic release result supervisory capital assessment program”, press release, may 7; board governor federal reserve system (2009), “federal reserve board make announcement regard supervisory capital assessment program (scap)”, press release, november 9. bi review 162/2009 5 keep inflation subdued, indeed, inflation could move low here. however, recovery strengthens, time come appropriate begin withdraw unprecedented monetary stimulus help support economic activity. for reason, give careful think exit strategy. we confident tool necessary withdraw monetary stimulus timely effective way.6 indeed, balance sheet already begin adjust, improve financial condition lead substantially reduce use lend facilities. the balance sheet also shrink time mortgage-backed security asset hold mature prepaid. however, even balance sheet stay large while, able raise target short-term interest rate – rate bank lend overnight – thus tighten financial condition appropriately. operationally, important tool adjust stance monetary policy authority, grant u congress last year, pay bank interest balance hold federal reserve. when time come raise short-term interest rate thereby tighten policy, raise rate offer bank balance us. bank unwilling make overnight loan rate low rate earn risk-free fed, interest rate pay banks’ balance tend set floor target overnight loan rate short-term interest rates. additional upward pressure short-term interest rate achieve measure reduce supply fund bank available lend other. we number tool accomplish this. for example, use short-term fund method know reverse repurchase agreements, act directly reduce quantity reserve hold bank system. by pay slightly high rate interest, could induce bank lock balance longer-term account us, make balance unavailable lend overnight market. and, necessary, always option reduce size balance sheet sell security hold open market. a always, difficult challenge federal open market committee devise technical mean unwind monetary stimulus. rather, challenge face central bank every economic recovery, correctly judge best time tighten policy. because monetary policy affect economy lag, need base decision best forecast economy develop. a i say moment ago, currently expect inflation remain subdue time. it also reassure longer-term inflation expectation appear stable. nevertheless, keep close eye inflation risk whatever necessary meet mandate foster price stability maximum employment. how avoid similar crisis future? a federal reserve others work build progress already make toward secure sustain economic recovery price stability, must also continue address weakness lead current crisis. thus, final question afternoon is: how avoid similar crisis future?7 6 see ben s. bernanke (2009), “the federal reserve's balance sheet: an update”, speech deliver federal reserve board conference key development monetary policy, washington, october 8; ben s. bernanke (2009), “the fed's exit strategy”, opinion, wall street journal, july 21. 7 see ben s. bernanke (2009), “financial regulation supervision crisis: the role federal reserve”, speech deliver federal reserve bank boston 54th economic conference, hold chatham, mass., october 23. 6 bi review 162/2009 although source crisis extraordinarily complex numerous, fundamental cause many financial firm simply appreciate risk taking. their risk-management system inadequate capital liquidity buff insufficient. unfortunately, neither firm regulator identify remedied many weakness soon enough. thus, financial regulators, include federal reserve, must undertake unsparing self-assessments. at federal reserve, extensively review performance move strengthen oversight banks. work cooperatively agencies, toughen bank regulation help constrain excessive risk-taking enhance ability bank withstand financial stress. for example, among leader international efforts, organization basel committee bank supervision, increase quantity capital liquidity bank must hold. at home, implement standard require bank organization adopt compensation policy link pay institutions’ long-term performance avoid encourage excessive risk-taking. i mention scap, otherwise know stress tests. we apply lesson learn exercise reorient approach supervision large, interconnect bank organization critical stability financial system. in particular, take “macroprudential” approach, one go beyond supervisors’ traditional focus health individual institution scrutinize interrelationship among firm market good anticipate source financial contagion. to that, expand use kind simultaneous comparative cross-firm examination use good effect scap. the federal reserve’s ability draw range discipline – use economists, market experts, accountants, lawyers, addition bank examiner – essential success scap, multidisciplinary approach central feature supervision future. for example, complement traditional onsite examination enhance off-site surveillance programs, multidisciplinary team combine supervisory information, firm-specific data analysis, market-based indicator identify problem may affect one bank institutions. although regulator great deal improve financial oversight, congress also must act fix gap weakness structure regulatory system and, doing, address serious problem pose firm perceive “too big fail”. no firm, virtue size complexity, permit hold financial system, economy, american taxpayer hostage. to eliminate possibility, number step required. first, systemically important financial institutions, banks, subject strong comprehensive supervision consolidated, firmwide, basis. such institution subject tough capital, liquidity, risk-management requirement firm – reduce chance fail remove incentive grow simply order perceive big fail. neither aig, insurance company, bear stearns, investment firm, subject strong consolidate supervision. the federal reserve, regulator bank hold companies, already supervise many large complex institution world. that experience, together broad knowledge financial markets, make u well suit serve consolidate supervisor systemically important nonbank institution well. in addition, involvement supervision critical ensure necessary expertise, information, authority carry essential function promote financial stability make monetary policy. second, systemically important institution approach failure, government policymakers must option bailout disorderly, confidence-shattering bankruptcy. the congress create new resolution regime, analogous regime currently use fdic fail banks, would permit government wind trouble systemically important firm way protect financial stability also bi review 162/2009 7 impose loss shareholder creditor fail firm, without cost taxpayer. impose loss creditor troubled, systemically critical firm would help address too-big-to-fail problem restore market discipline level play field small firms, minimize disruptive effect failure financial system economy. third, regulatory structure require good mechanism monitor address emerge risk financial system whole. because size, diversity, complexity financial system, task may exceed capacity individual agency. the federal reserve therefore support creation systemic oversight council, make principal financial regulators, identify development may pose systemic risks, recommend approach deal them, coordinate response member agencies. conclusion in closing, i note fall last year, unite states, indeed world, confront financial crisis magnitude unseen generations. concert action federal reserve policymakers abroad help avoid bad outcomes. nevertheless, turmoil deal severe blow economy recently begin recover. the improvement financial condition year resumption growth summer offer hope expectation continue recovery new year. however, significant headwind remain, include tight credit condition weak job market. the federal reserve aggressive effort stabilize financial system support economic activity. at point, however, need unwind accommodative policy order avoid high inflation future. i confident tool commitment make adjustment need manner consistent mandate foster employment price stability. in meantime, financial firm must good job manage risk business, regulator – federal reserve include – must complete thoroughgoing overhaul approach supervision, congress move forward make need change system financial regulation avoid similar crisis future. in particular, must solve problem “too big fail”. in sum, come long way dark period crisis, distance yet go. in midst tough days, october 2008, i say speech i confident american economy, great intrinsic vitality, would emerge period renew vigor.8 i remain equally confident today. 8 see ben s. bernanke (2008), “stabilizing financial market economy”, speech deliver economic club new york, new york, n.y., october 15.
