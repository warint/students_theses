regulation also applyto supervision. i focus several federal reserve initiative underway tosupport community bank pandemic future.the first principle fundamental regulation sometimes bear repeating—regulation shouldalways strike right balance. for bank regulation, mean balance actionsthat promote safety soundness action promote acceptable manageablelevel risk-taking. the challenge neither little effective achieve publicbenefit government oversight, much prevent regulate business meetingtheir customers’ needs. some regulation appropriate necessary strike rightbalance mean point regulation go far end reduce public’swelfare. in recent years, federal reserve agency make oversight moreeffective good differentiate prudential regulation supervision base asset size ofbanks, complexity activities, relate risk pose financial system.this especially important community banks, manage risk well andduring 2008 financial crisis manage risk well since. achieve theseprinciples also require follow consumer protection law regulations, include fair lendinglaws, ensure fairness broad access credit financial service enable economicopportunity individual communities.the second principle regulatory framework effective, also efficient, andthat mean assess impact requirements. for federal reserve, mean thatwe consider rule’s benefit safety soundness potential negative effect, 1 / 4bis central bankers' speech include limit availability credit service public, implication ofcompliance cost banks. the wisdom approach evident consider effectof regulation community bank role provide financial service theircommunities. community bank often one source credit andfinancial service customers. their small operational scale rely few staff toreach disburse customer base limit resource compliance activities.regulations consider potential impact availability service community,as well cost bank implement rule, particularly rural locations. it isnecessary full careful practical analysis cost benefit part everyrulemaking.the third principle regulation supervision consistent, transparent, fair.regulators obligate law act manner, also make good practical sense.these

president netherlands bank (dnb), open eventorganized bruegel, 11 february 2021.* * *thank you. it’s great able speak here. over years, bruegel become synonymouswith excellent policy-relevant research. your work help people like job better.that also recognize others. in “2020 global go to think tank index report” publishedby university pennsylvania two week ago, bruegel rank number one non-usthink tank world. that’s worthy congratulations!let start take back thirty year ago, europe stand great economicchallenge time: transform cripple communist economy central easterneurope modern market economies. when i work imf late 1990s, ourreports refer group country transition economies.as bruegel also point out, thirty year late transition economy now. not onlymust make fossil-based economy carbon neutral 2050, prevent catastrophicclimate change. but must recover public health economic crisis. ifocus climate change, challenge really much broader. it include form ofenvironmental degradation make economy unsustainable.europe’s green deal tackle multiple crisis head-on. it ambitious, comprehensive,and focus growth. and next generation eu recovery package, andreinforcements eu budget, back unprecedented public financial firepower. thenew sustainable finance agenda come soon, likely provide plan mobilizemuch need private investments. and exactly best economic response thecovid crisis start implement green deal soon possible. after euro crisis,after brexit, europe lead way, make proud european today.but true leader show way. they also make sure everyone board. theintroduction european climate law proposal states, i quote:the european green deal reaffirm commission’s ambition make europe firstclimate-neutral continent 2050.’end quotation.laudable itself. but frankly, would much good planet if, 2050, werethe last continent climate-neutral. because would mean nation caughtup u even surpass us. and whole world become climate neutralbefore crucial 2050 deadline.i optimistic europe team new american leadership, possibly withchina india others, form powerhouse, engine, get world back ontrack meet paris agreement. because order get energy transition really done, wewill need work together many areas. because there’s european, american achinese climate problem, global climate problem.now let’s go back europe. a know, get european economy sustainable forfuture generation require large investments. a big part investment need madeby private sector. and private investment scale sufficiently, thefinancial sector finance them, need get right condition place. what need 1 / 4bis central bankers' speech done? and governments, central bank supervisor do? that i want todiscuss today.first all, need good business case green investments. one policy instrument isabsolutely key here, raise effective price greenhouse gas emissions. carbonemissions main, contributor greenhouse gases. you see, i’m aneconomist. some may call naïve, i firm belief, back experience, foreconomic transformation take hold, need relative price reflect truescarcity economic resources. in case, price climate cost greenhouse gasemissions. internalize externality. that make far easy firm household todetermine future value asset liabilities. this alter incentive framework.then, market force drive thing right direction. this ball lie squarely court ofgovernments. the eu green deal set ambitious plan make carbon price moreeffective, crucial plan water down. this one thing make allthe thing do, much effective.secondly, investor financial sector need clear credible transition plan fromgovernments. a plan provide answer question like: emission target metand when? what action necessary achieve targets? what regulation go beimplemented sequence? what investment government make itself? howare go compensate vulnerable groups? in answer question drawlessons economic transition thirty year ago. for example, i recall debate about‘gradualism’ versus ‘cold turkey’. some reforms, like change relative prices, may todo soon possible. others, like change productive capacity, take time.what’s also important plan still place next election. aplan give investor sense going. that offer perspective, providesopportunities, reduce investment risk. here, again, i think green deal go long wayin fulfil need comprehensive plan. and enshrine law, work outthe detail get implemented.apart carbon price plan place, else need get themoney flow it’s green?well, thirdly, banks, insurance company pension fund need aware theclimate risk face. and manage risk accordingly. financial institution vulnerableto physical consequence change climate. just ask insurance companies. and, asi said, broad climate change. in last year’s report indebted nature, show thatdutch financial institution alone half trillion euro exposure company withhigh high dependency well-functioning ecosystem. company whose business maybe risk due biodiversity loss form environmental degradation.financial institution also run transition risks. for instance, bank loan provide carmanufacturer may risk fail develop build clean vehicle meet new energyregulations change consumer demand time. so climate risk new importantdriver financial risk. financial supervisor must push financial institution manage riskadequately. just risks.pressing good risk management stem primarily mandate supervisor keepfinancial institution safe sound. but important by-product. once theseinstitutions good understandingtask impact climate-related risk balancesheets, impact investment decisions. le money flow fossil-fuelinvestments, green investments. this way, financial institution become apowerful force push green transition.to honest, i yet see clear evidence reallocation effect play 2 / 4bis central bankers' speech significant scale. for one thing, it’s difficult bank financial firm manage theirexposures long lack good information green not.that bring fourth point, disclosure. the information financial sectoruses strong corporate disclosure build upon. that quantity,quality consistency corporate report sustainability-related information must improve.credible comparable information readily available market participants,shareholders stakeholders.this call global solution. i believe report information effective itis align requirement global account standards, therefore reflect theaudited annual account companies. this also ensure level play field acrossjurisdictions. i think international financial report standard foundation, ifrs, bestpositioned set standards. therefore i happy ifrs recently announce totake step direction. europe, frontrunner, key role play make globaleffort succeed. the italian g20 presidency ask financial stability board explorehow progress make here, base recommendation task force climate-related financial disclosures.finally, european capital market need supply risk capital. at moment, europeanfirms mainly depend bank funding, extent capital markets. they onlyhave limit access private fund markets, small eu, leastcompared us. we need european financial market supply diverse type riskcapital need fund energy transition. risk capital typically come venturecapitalists, private equity funds, investment funds. and also need something aboutthe exist carbon-bias european capital markets. in respect, i think europeancommission’s action plan capital market union could improve stimulatingbetter access risk capital green investments. at time, fund non-greeninvestments need become expensive. apart carbon pricing, good disclosure is,again, key here. once become clear investor company’s foot print notsustainable, risk premia rise.central bank also help correct carbon bias capital markets. in euro area,central bank purchase corporate bond follow market neutrality principle. this mean thatthe purchase reflect broad corporate debt market. but neutrality mean ifthere carbon bias european capital market relative price carbonemissions distorted? central bank could explore how, within boundary theirmandates, redesign monetary policy instrument prevent bias fromoccurring, instead contribute unlock green investments. we could take theexisting eu policies, non-financial report directive eu taxonomy forsustainable activities, start point respect.i speak need carbon price transition plans. about need good riskmanagement disclosure. and need supply risk capital.when come role financial sector, i may inadvertently leave theimpression finance always follow real economy. that government central banksand policymakers standard setter provide right conditions, fund thegreen transition follow suit. although i think largely true, entirely i see therole financial sector. financial market player wait regulations, andconditions, perfect data set place impact. they perform acrucial role economy help company grow create job wealth. thatmeans social responsibility make sure business modelssupport sustainable economy. it good see many financial institution work onreducing carbon footprint. to i would say, keep good work, branch 3 / 4bis central bankers' speech possible. and others i say, don’t talk talk, also walk walk.maybe now, thirty year later, fully realize much courage take central andeastern european partner embark bold experiment. without exist blueprint.under economic circumstance make trouble today look relatively benign. but hadlittle choice. and neither we. so let’s learn experience take courage theirexample. even yet know exactly carbon-neutral economy look like, howit change everyday lives. the eu green deal ambitious bold. and toget work implement fund it. and time, reach beyond borders.to work together governments, regulators, private investors, financial sector, climateexperts, central bank countries. to overcome policy challenges. and makesure meet paris agreement targets, tackle climate change time. 4 / 4bis central bankers' speech warwick economics summit february 5, 2021 robert holzmann governor oesterreichische nationalbank verlegerin und herausgeberin: oesterreichische nationalbank referat pressestelle wien 9., otto-wagner-platz 3 postfach 61, 1010 wien open statement challenge balance monetary policy fiscal policy open statement warwick economics summit 2021 in open statement, i would like address relationship monetary fiscal policy, successful interaction critical deal shocks, economic fallout pandemic crisis, come aftermath. first, interaction monetary fiscal policy make comeback academic research broad policy discourse. it much part lecture textbook i student (well … 50+ year ago). back then, question basic still relevant – e.g. policy instrument assign policy objective. the assign instrument change across time, exchange rate regime case point, factor stressed, credibility policy institution. recently discussion move consider monetary fiscal policy strategic substitute – state-contingent decision use – toward think policy strategic complements. with appropriate design interaction, instrument expand policy space other: most importantly, accommodate monetary policy low rate interest allow fiscal policy expand policy scope. in turn, fiscal policy action help economy recover, thus take away burden central bank bring economy back potential inflation back target. this reemergence interest policy coordination happen aftermath stress importance independent central bank pursuit narrow policy objective effective credible. the empirical analysis last decade effectiveness fiscal versus monetary policy address shock suggest somewhat good outcome monetary policy little existence complementary approach. this lead second part: ha suboptimal individual policy approach joint policy coordination change current crisis? to stay within time allocation, i focus euro area. 2 after global financial crisis, monetary policy critical overcome fragile situation euro eu economies. the implementation unconventional monetary policy (negative interest rate policy; quantitative ease asset purchase programs; target long-term repurchase program banks, aim provide finance smes, etc.) major contribution 2014 make monetary policy effective view fall low r* − equilibrium rate return (a important hypothetical benchmark variable return). with begin economic fallout due lockdown covid-19 march 2020, ecb fast offer strong monetary package, initially include eur 750 billion flexible asset purchase (now eur 1,850 billion) pandemic emergency purchase programme (pepp), package almost similar size subsidize credit commercial bank lend private sector firms. first review monetary policy package suggest high effectiveness stabilize financial market output growth limit effectiveness keep inflation close ecb’s target close 2%. so far, side effect contain need monitor carefully go forward. there concern longer-term effectiveness monetary policy instruments, i.e. fall marginal effectiveness increase side effects. in parallel monetary accommodation, national fiscal policy member country quick generous support firm worker particular sector heavily hit (i.e. tourism, restaurant personal services). how exit strategy support program design achieve yet unknown. for euro area member states, european stability mechanism establish fund ceiling eur 500 billion credit line early-on crisis, which, however, little use far due condition attached, albeit mild. the eu commission decide eur 750 billion “next generation eu” fund, almost half amount transfer member state heavily hit crisis. these resource use next generation investment – i.e. climate digitalization – mid-2021 onward. the resource sizable albeit huge. their effectiveness crucially hinge condition member state indeed use reform economy view bolster productivity financial sustainability future. assess policy reaction aftermath global financial crisis, recent monetary fiscal policy eu (and elsewhere) much forthcoming. but able offer long-term perspective view decisive importance equilibrium interest rate r* policies? this lead third final part. what key option policymakers must decide area monetary fiscal policy? option 1 consider r* − hypothetical estimate equilibrium interest rate − exogenous low even negative far future. in case, fiscal policy encourage remain generous interest payment remain low hence fiscal sustainability appear issue. monetary policy remain unconventional, conventional policy (based interest rate policy forward guidance only) work. in case economic shock would need apply inflation stay low. if inflation increase, however, raise nominal interest rate would threaten fiscal sustainability − monetary policy life aims. hence, one would live fragile equilibrium without exit strategy. 3 option 2 consider r* endogenous variable accessible policy intervention raise back level see past. if achieved, would allow return conventional monetary policy without side effect unconventional policy allow reduce balance sheet central banks. it would promise grow income, rise r* would large part result rise productivity. it would require keep lid public deficit debt. in short, option 2 offer exit option current, fragile policy mix. achieve rise r* will, first all, require good understand driver secular fall r* recent decades. yet, i think two policy intervention explore right away: measure increase productivity (and clever fiscal policy decisive structural reform play major role) measure reduce savings-overhang global north view capital need global south (in particular africa, europe strong interest). both policy measure desirable useful independently effect r*. in recent report r* call global public good, i concur. in short run, option 1 hold true, r* cannot change swiftly. in long run, hopefully option 2 realize provide forceful action taken. every voyage start step, green one. john a rolle: role bahamian financial service sector thetransformation

beyond pandemic introduction good morning, thank host today. i’m sure many share sentiment virtual events—that would much rather together person, yet grateful technology allow u gather online. the need switch digital platform is, course, one small example change bring global pandemic. covid-19 claim life far many—in canada, lose 20,000 people. the virus devastate impact household business across country. almost overnight, canadian economy suffer bad setback since great depression. one major impact pandemic certainly familiar u now: digitalization personal professional life accelerated. in remark today, i’ll focus development affect world payments. i’m refer change way canadian consumer business pay goods, service financial assets. i’ll begin talk briefly economic consequence pandemic. then i’ll go discus implication three main aspect payments. the first concept central bank digital currency—a “digital loonie,” were. for several years, bank canada analyze circumstance might lead canada decide issue digital currency. the pandemic may bring u decision point sooner anticipated. next, i’d like look major program payment system modernization underway canada. consumer business see benefit - 2 - modernization roll year next. the pandemic underscore importance expand reach real-time payments. finally, i address issue cross-border payments, often slow, expensive vulnerable fraud. the bank collaborate international partner roadmap address pain point cross-border payments. we fully commit work public private sector make necessary change canada support this. covid-19 digital economy the digitalization economy well underway covid-19 hit, change bring pandemic rapid far-reaching. a society, quickly implement virtual workplace largely imagining. nearly one-third canadian mostly work home,1 include me—i office eight time since last march. in addition, many student continue learn virtually. covid-19 also change shop. a survey canadian retailer show e-commerce nearly double pre-pandemic levels.2 business respond pandemic incorporate new technology operations. in recent business outlook survey, nearly two-thirds participate firm report make kind

covid-19: the impact pandemic demand use cash,” bank canada staff discussion paper no. 2020-6 (july 2020). - 3 - cash: physical digital let’s start canadian bank notes. a embrace technology many innovations, one thing hasn’t change much cash. it’s true bank update bank note new excite ways. we’ve incorporate state-of-the-art security feature combat counterfeiting. we make bank note use polymer instead paper. and we’ve make concert effort ensure image portrait subject bank note reflect canada’s unique change identity. but basic nature bank note changed—they still physical objects. however, past decade so, bank consider bank notes, we’ve ask ourselves: could canada canadian benefit digital form cash? in speech montréal year ago, i give preliminary view: see need central bank digital currency time, could imagine scenario could make central bank digital currency beneficial canada. i conclude would move forward develop digital currency contingency plan, give quickly world change time require develop viable product.7 a year later, view remain unchanged: digital currency mean forego conclusion. that said, world change even fast expected. in fact, two week i spoke, first lockdown imposed, accelerate evolution digital economy. and work prepare day canada might want launch digital loonie—backed bank—has also accelerated. we alone. in recent survey, almost 60 percent central bank report possibility issue central bank digital currency within six years. this le 40 percent year ago.8 one scenario watch whether sharp decline acceptance cash reach tip point canada. we’ve already see society economy modernize, cash lose grind digital method payment—around world home.9 since covid-19 hit, we’ve see grow hesitancy canada use cash. although canadian hold cash ever, cash may currently circulate much. in recent bank canada surveys, consumer report 7 t. lane, “money payment digital age” (speech cfa montréal fintech rdv 2020, montréal, quebec, february 25, 2020). 8

things,” bank canada the economy, plain simple (october 2019). - 4 - merchant preference contactless payments, report experience merchants’ refusal cash due fear virus transmission.10 of course, it’s early tell whether trend continue beyond pandemic, watch closely. the scenario i raise speech last year increase use digital currency create private sector, include cryptocurrencies so-called stablecoins. while product exist several years, could see boost acceleration digitalization midst pandemic. even increasingly digital economy, though, cryptocurrencies bitcoin plausible claim become money future. they deeply flaw method payment—except illicit transaction like money laundering, anonymity trump features—because rely costly verification method purchase power wildly unstable. the recent spike price look le like trend like speculative mania—an atmosphere one high-profile tweet enough trigger sudden jump price. in contrast, widespread adoption stablecoins everyday transaction possible, although none near point yet. because case partly fully back safe assets, purchase power design stable. but many issue need address confident stablecoins use safely general public. the financial stability board examine issue global level, i chair international work group take work forward. here canada, still work ensure regulatory framework cover new products. amid developments, two fundamental question need addressed: be benefit issue digital form money? and yes, so? in response first question, don’t yet know whether many canadian actually want use stablecoin kind digital currency alternative available—cash, debit, credit electronic transfer. would addition digital form cash exist suite digital payment method meet real demand enhance evolution competitive, vibrant digital economy? more work clearly need identify potential benefit users, compare alternatives. and course also need study potential risks. 10 h. chen, w. engert, k. p. huynh, g. nicholls, m. nicholson j. zhu, “cash covid-19: the impact pandemic demand use cash,” bank canada staff discussion paper no. 2020-6 (july 2020). - 5 - in response second question, public want digital cash-like currency, good reason illustrate central bank—a trust public institution—should issue it. currency core part bank’s mandate, integrity currency public good canadian benefit from. only central bank guarantee complete safety universal access, public interest—not profits—as top priority. let spell one aspect. it say digital economy, data new oil. many technology company follow business model use customers’ data refine expand range product service offer public. this, turn, pull business onto platform, generate data, on. if business model use foundation dominant method payment economy, issuer would gain control enormous range data—bringing overwhelm market power.11 in effect, technology company could become gatekeeper entire economy, concern implication privacy, competition inclusion. let’s compare central bank digital currency. a central bank—with commercial motivation harvest data—is uniquely position build safeguard privacy, time defend criminal uses. privacy clearly important canadians, it’s also public interest protect degree privacy.12 universal access would need another key feature central bank digital currency. that mean ensure remote marginalize communities—including limit underbanked unbanked—are leave new way pay good services. a part advance work, bank research experiment different technologies. in addition, recently engage three university project team independently develop proposal digital currency ecosystem could look like. their report release tomorrow. this blue-sky think help inform research go forward. we also carefully consider business model canadian central bank digital currency might look like: what role would private sector play development, distribution transfer? how would product interface canada’s core payment system transfer fund among financial institution settle retail large-scale payments? 11 j. chiu t. koeppl, “payments dna big tech.” presentation the future money payments: implication central banking, bank canada annual economic conference, november 5, 2020. 12 r. j. garratt m. r. c. van oordt, “privacy public good: a case electronic cash,” bank canada staff discussion paper no. 2019-24 (july 2019). - 6 - modernize core payment system long pandemic hit, effort modernize canada’s core payment system already begun. this work important, rapid expansion digital economy accelerate pandemic, see benefit clearly. lead payment canada, several key player payment ecosystem—such interac, commercial bank stakeholders—have work bring payment system fully modern digital age. the bank canada heavily involve central bank, regulator and, cases, participant. over next year so, improvement start come online. this important canadian mean great speed, convenience, competition choice people pay good services. right now, fast immediate money transfer see e-transfers. but new real-time rail system—which go live 2022—will provide real-time payment beyond already offer e-transfer. when innovation complete, imagine scenario like these: business able pay part-time worker immediately upon completion shift; homebuyers put deposit first home click button instead physically take bank draft lawyer’s office; government able distribute emergency fund matter seconds, directly citizens’ bank accounts. the bank also help improve core payment systems. this include interbank payment system call lynx, replace current large value transfer system autumn. lynx’s up-to-date technology include enhance safeguard cyber risks. another system we’re look improve one clear cheque low-value payments. improvement expand consumers’ choice convenient digital payments. two important developments, i briefly describe, complement changes. the first retail payment supervision. this past august, bank assume oversight responsibility interac e-transfer system current mandate. and government canada announce intention give bank canada oversight authority retail payment service providers—companies aren’t traditional bank specialize process payment public. by ensure risk well managed, bank, new supervisory role, support confidence payment service provider encourage competition innovation retail payments. the second development open banking, remove barrier bank customer safely easily share financial information choose engage service provider manage money assets. open bank help promote great competition choice allow consumer business easily compare product service various financial institution offer. - 7 - several country already introduce open banking, federal government launch consultation implement canada. this do ensure innovation balance data control privacy considerations. we come long way, work remains. and work take great urgency find environment current system’s shortcoming could limit ability consumer business pursue opportunity create digital economy. thankfully, canadian look forward significant improvement speed, convenience, efficiency choice digital payment near future. this important part bank’s responsibility promote safe, sound efficient financial systems. cross-border payment i’d like turn issue cross-border payments, area obvious press need improvement. send money abroad always notoriously slow expensive individual businesses—so much interfere life livelihoods. issue cross-border payment affect million canadians. this include new canadian send money family country origin. it include snowbird split time canada warm climates—although winter, part. and include many canadian business face unnecessary cost delay pay supply service abroad receive payment thing sell outside country. beyond borders, issue even press develop countries, many individual rely family member abroad send money afford basic necessity food, clothe education. many need become acute uneven global impact pandemic. put simply, problem send money across border create disadvantage prevent already impoverish people country fully participate global economy. in fact, issue use argument creation use cryptocurrencies stablecoins. but plenty room improve cross-border payment without use novel method payment, would fix problem cross-border payments. a part initiative endorse g20 coordinate financial stability board, bank canada central bank regulator develop roadmap solve problems. our main goal support fast cheap cross-border payment accessible transparent. a i mention begin speech today, identify numerous pain point cross-border payments. technological shortcoming certainly pose problem different message standard different countries. anti-terrorism anti–money launder regulations—while crucial safety security—can also slow transfer money, multiple - 8 - compliance checks. and course, numerous time zone consider. when send money ottawa noon way cambodia, local payment system isn’t open midnight process funds. the g20 roadmap extensive lay work several different organization carry out. for part, bank work partner internationally—most notably committee payment market infrastructure bank international settlements. but important, we’re also put piece place canada support coordinate domestic effort necessary identify address press issue canadian perspective. for effort successful, central bank authority around world work need cooperation public private sector partner jurisdictions. only make last improvement cross-border payment ensure people, business nation around world best opportunity truly participate global economy. conclusion canadian may take current payment ecosystem grant buy good service already relatively simple. long go day make large impulse buy weekend next impossible bank wasn’t open withdraw cash. but doesn’t mean aren’t opportunity provide canadian great choice pay good services. digital payment method integral truly digital economy, open endless possibility digital innovation. and struggle personal, professional economic ramification pandemic, it’s even important bank move forward work. the bank continue explore possibility digital currency would electronic version bank note canadian trust rely on. we issue currency time right, support canadian federal government, best evidence hand. we make core payment system effective efficient help consumer business exchange fund real time. and push forward work make cross-border payment cheaper, easy safe people around globe send receive money. thank me, i look forward questions.

investment country. allow also brief comment content speech. a member govern council european central bank (ecb), i today subject so-called “quiet period” ahead monetary policy decision-making meetings. therefore, think may interpret indicative monetary economic outlook. against background ongoing covid-19 pandemic impact economy, i like talk today bank industry spain. the industry play crucial role crisis situation present one provide finance productive sector households. and, like sector economy, also see risk face consequence crisis rise. the current conjuncture highlight importance maintain healthy resilient bank industry face various shock may arise. resilience bank industry generate crisis evidently, improvement past decade term balance sheet quality solvency level leave global spanish bank sector good place absorb current crisis continue provide finance economy needs. notably, effect far-reaching international financial reform and, spain’s case, restructure sector implement past decade are, along various economic policy measure adopt crisis, help mitigate manage risk generate pandemic. indeed, financial system far act mitigate – amplify – factor impact crisis. this reminder u importance sound bank industry shore prudent global regulatory standards. let illustrate figures. spanish banks’ level solvency increased, term tier 1 capital, €158 billion 2007 €215 billion crisis, i.e. 35%. and almost half total amount capital sector form buff regulatory minimum amount, can, necessary, release part prudential response crisis. moreover, wake global financial crisis, mortgage lend standard much strict and, case loan firms, much closely tie efficiency. likewise important standpoint industry’s resilience deleveraging undergo spanish non-financial private sector period. from 2010 2019 decline almost 30 pp gdp household debt ratio; case non-financial corporation sector, net debt fell 45 pp gdp 2010. 2 in event, appropriate mean illustrate bank sector’s resilience stress test regularly perform supervisors. in july, ecb conduct vulnerability analysis bank supervision. the aim test, prospectively, banks’ resilience shock cause pandemic. the result exercise spanish bank similar obtain banco de españa forward look exercise spanish bank (flesb) stress test exercise, whose final result publish autumn financial stability report. in baseline scenario consider banco de españa’s vulnerability exercise, include cumulative decline euro area gdp 2020, 2021 2022 around 1.6%, reduction solvency spanish bank whole estimate 2 pp significant institution international presence, 1 pp significant institution 0.8 pp institution direct supervision banco de españa, leave 9.9%, 12% 18.7% average, respectively, prudential requirement established. under harsh scenario, spanish gdp decline 5.7% 2020 2022, reduction solvency ratio much great (3.9 pp significant institution international presence, 4.6 % significant institution 1.3 % institution direct supervision banco de españa), leave average common equity tier 1 (cet1) capital 8%, 8.4% 16.6%, respectively, risk-weighted assets. while heterogeneity across banks, result highlight, first, bank face crisis big safety margins. further, result show effectiveness measure implement date mitigate impact crisis. bank sector resilience must maintain crisis there room complacency initial, positive diagnosis. a know, scale shock high. even give horizon result distribution vaccines, know duration crisis uncertain, see emergence since last autumn fresh outbreak virus practically worldwide. to date, crisis cause pandemic considerably impact non-financial corporations’ profit household income, impair solvency. however, see increase non-performing loans, due largely wide range measure various authority adopted. the ultimate impact crisis bank industry indeed hinge scale duration, also effectiveness economic policy alleviate effect household firms. in respect, current situation incomplete, uncertain uneven economic recovery, retain large part exceptional measure support economy warranted, particular certain sectors. in event, projection suggest significant increase ratio non-performing loan come quarters, even benign scenario. 3 against backdrop, i three important consideration make view maintain sector’s resilience come months, beyond keep extraordinary measure place. firstly, much downturn banks’ result first three quarter 2020 due great provision anticipation future asset impairment, still materialise come quarters. specifically, spanish bank increase provision 75% first nine month 2020 compare period year earlier. sustain effort come quarter would enable bulk provision need anticipate stress test likely scenario come year met. this lead significant decline banks’ profitability, also raise loss absorption capacity, something investor particularly value circumstances. the message i wish convey bank persist early recognition policy, enable continue fulfil task provide fund economy. it important bank analyse situation individually, distinguish temporary permanent effects. automatic reclassification result excessively procyclical behaviour avoided. however, all, bank must prudent, assess provision need accordance plausible conservative scenario come years. in short, especially crisis prolonged, bank must ensure timely proper recognition effective quality impairment credit exposure compliance supervisory guidelines. secondly, i wish refer capital buff build use crisis. a i mention earlier, solvency level significantly high run-up global financial crisis. at start crisis, prudential supervisor decide release many macroprudential buff – capital, countercyclical systemic risk buff – and, time, microprudential authority temporarily allow bank operate level set certain structural requirements. these decision seek help bank continue provide finance household firm need adverse environment present one. our empirical analysis show use buff enable bank provide fund real economy. this turn positive impact economic growth, encourage recovery moderate decline. and positive impact it, turn, boost credit demand banks’ income, ultimately translate high solvency levels. in event, important note may difficult bank use buff fear may penalise financial market reach certain capital ratios, would increase fund cost could, therefore, affect solvency levels. this 4 market stigma effect could lead bank avoid use capital buffers, accordance analysis would negative impact economy.1 in addition, use capital buff may difficult doubt rebuild post-crisis. the difficulty would bank oblige rebuild buff time capacity generate profit modest market might receptive. in setting, clear communication macroprudential microprudential authority capacity make use buff flexibility subsequently rebuild essential. in respect, authority make clear bank sufficient time resume compliance capital requirements, rebuild process event begin main effect pandemic dispelled. in event, evidence available come month effective use capital buffers, loss stem covid-19 crisis materialise, essential allow conclusion draw effective use buff ass whether additional measure may needed. base experience obtain crisis, medium-term horizon, balance structural countercyclical capital buff could also analyse way avoid difficulty i mentioned, arise. thirdly, i also wish refer treatment dividend crisis. a well aware, one recommendation european prudential supervisors, also make many countries, bank refrain distribute dividend highly prudent pay bonus staff. this measure seek ensure that, highly uncertain setting, bank able build sufficient fund absorb losses. in general, spanish bank legally able suspend defer dividend distribute 2019 income comply recommendations. this enable increase 2020 capital buff already build onset pandemic. the positive impact measure supplement reinforce decision take various economic authorities, which, i said, release large part macroprudential buff mitigate impact pandemic banks’ income statements. to date, potentially negative side effect measure limited. although cost capital bank rise substantially onset pandemic, follow implementation broad raft measure introduce mitigate impact increase fully corrected. in addition, recommendation limit dividend payouts appear significant effect, least european bank systems. 1 another question hamper use capital buff bank that, current regulations, capital level fall certain thresholds, preventive measure activated, ban dividend suspension interest payment at1 t2 instruments. once again, bank would suffer consequent stigma market instrument issued. 5 at end december, ecb european systemic risk board review recommendation. give continue uncertainty economic impact pandemic, recommend bank act extreme prudence refrain pay cash dividend conduct share buy-backs, limit distribution 30 september 2021. specifically, ecb expect dividend share buy-backs remain 15% cumulative 2019-20 profit high 20 basis point cet1 ratio, lower. these measure provide flexibility early recommendation. this warrant slight decline macroeconomic uncertainty compare spring fact core projection scenario close use vulnerability analysis carry ecb first half 2020 which, i indicate above, confirm resilience european bank sector. in event, prudent approach still required, consider impact pandemic yet fully reflect banks’ balance sheets, bank continue benefit various public support measure credit impairment arise time lag. the revise recommendation aim safeguard banks’ loss-absorbing capacity provide support economy. the recommendation remain valid end september 2021 when, provide materially adverse developments, ecb intend lift recommendation return assess banks’ capital dividend distribution plan base outcome normal supervisory cycle. post-crisis, bank sector resilience key once crisis come end effect receded, also need ensure bank sector remain resilient, especially new risk may emerge. in regard, i wish make reflection global bank regulation. the basel reform phase last decade incorporate regulation lesson learn global financial crisis. the first stage basel reform begin 2010 conclude second wave reform publish 2017. in first phase, aim boost level quality banks’ microprudential capital requirements. the intention reduce risk-taking, increase “skin game”, provide great loss-absorbing capacity. in addition, releasable macroprudential buff i refer early also introduced. the second phase basel reform focus matter come light first phase, namely calculation risk-weighted asset (the denominator capital requirement basel standards) need standardise treatment among institutions. once again, aim reinforce banks’ credibility regard prudential ratio correct measurement risk assume. a crucial aspect reform “output floor”, limit reduction bank obtain use internal model calculate minimum capital requirement instead standardise approach require use model much le sensitive new data inputs. 6 the impact analysis reform reveal banks’ capital requirement would increase jurisdictions, although would also reduce certain elements. some elements, include european transposition basel iii, already implement capital requirement regulation (crr) quick fix, introduce late june.2 the objective basel iii reform, consist balance simplicity, comparability risk sensitivity, remain wholly place. in sense, decide defer implementation one year increase banks’ operational capacity, basel committee bank supervision (bcbs) member commit full consistent implementation new date agreed. both economy financial system thus sufficient time absorb main effect crisis gradually rebuild buff may used. in addition, note bcbs carefully assess impact reforms, include lesson learn covid-19 crisis. this analysis, base rigorous empirical evidence, serve determine whether additional regulatory aspect need addressing. further, important respond new risk may emerge. at present, clear profound technological change take place financial sector bring new risks, cyberattacks reliance external service providers. these technological development may also eventually give rise significant change financial service value chain, example, increase importance technology firms. these firm – big tech – posse enormous amount customer data, make highly effective use data ends. recent experience show firm cause disruption sector entered, take profitable business segment supplant exist firms. these development major implication supervisor regulators. first, proactive supervision must primary response changes, traditional regulatory framework may sufficient. second, give consideration regulatory perimeter ensure oft-cited mantra ‘same activities, risks, rules” actually applies. and third, cooperation among different authority essential, give diversity sector issue potentially affect technological innovations. in regard, customer data governance fundamental issue need reflect upon great length. if deem necessary data make available operators, seem reasonable exception obligation make available precise extent obligation clear. that said, 2 in particular, impact sme infrastructure support factor reflect recent behaviour solvency ratios. the effect exemption software-related intangible investment capital deduction become evident late date. 7 individual incentive collect manage information must undermine customers’ right must respected. mention also make new risk arise transition sustainable economy. it crucial sector incorporate decision-making process climate change-associated risks, physical transition-related alike. and supervisor must ensure bank correctly price risk associate climate change incorporate portfolio management. many supervisor (including banco de españa) develop environmental stress test introduce come years. their aim simulate consequence financial institution different hypothetical scenario entail change structure economy. i would also like reflect i consider one main challenge bank sector short, medium long term, namely low profitability bank business. it already low many european country coronavirus crisis, present crisis put pressure. to address challenge, essential bank continue make efficiency gains, cut cost make use new technologies. consolidation sector could appropriate way achieve aim. specifically, appear room consolidation spain european jurisdiction indicator point surplus capacity. naturally, process responsibility banks’ owners, role, bank supervisors, analyse merger plan submit u standpoint business viability. this entail assess solvency result institution, analyse impact overall financial stability oversee execution merger ensure potential synergy indeed harnessed. transnational european merger would particularly positive. they would deepen bank union, reduce sovereign-bank risk nexus, provide great potential diversification. they would also help establish broad customer bases, cost investment technology could widely distributed, although immediate impact cost-cutting would limited. in respect, ecb guide supervisory approach consolidation bank sector aim precisely provide market great predictability supervisory actions, help bank design merger plan sound prudential standpoint ensure result institution business plan that, execute correctly, add value. however, bank also seek enhance efficiency improve use make information hold. this require significant investment digitalisation also incorporation new data process technology allow change business model control risk profile. and important “quick fix” bring european prudential regulation kind investment much close line already place unite state switzerland. 8 investment kind would enable bank face major potential competitor –not necessarily financial institutions– might venture credit market great guarantee success. allow end address final reflection need persevere european response crisis financial sphere well. the response prudential authorities, along monetary fiscal policy measure adopted, far enable initial impact shock absorb prevent materialisation systemic risk financial system would exacerbate crisis make persistent. however, shortcoming continue exist also revealed. in respect, completion bank union approval fully mutualised european deposit insurance scheme would make decisive contribution ensure financial stability euro area, come month medium term. further deepen capital market union project also essential. moreover, priority must give analyse appropriate european resolution winding-up regulation hypothetical systemic crisis, possible role asset management company event severe impairment european financial institutions’ balance sheets. to sum up, continue address crisis effectively, persevere european response - financial sphere well - essential. thank much. vitas vasiliauskas: introductory remark - cyprus annual bankingconference fintech expointroductory remark mr vitas vasiliauskas, chairman board bank lithuania, atthe cyprus annual bank conference fintech expo, 15 january 2021.* * *good morning, dear listeners, fellow governors,i would like thank governor insight panel, also organiser theconference invite me.discussing role bank time covid-19 indeed vital. bank important tothe economy heart human body.and like cardiovascular diseases, lead cause mortality europe,diseases bank sector often stand behind deep crisis history. in 1930s, thegreat depression significantly amplify bank runs. in 2008, subprime mortgage loansextended bank create u house bubble bring entire global financialsystem. in europe, heavily bank-based system, infamous sovereign-bank nexus result ina prolong european sovereign debt crisis.the covid-19 crisis not, course, cause bank system. but could greatlyamplified shock resilient enough. moreover, weak bank system woulddiminish prospect sustain recovery.this role bank critical current context. in light, i would like makethree point brief intervention:• first, learn lesson previous crisis – contribute banks’ resilienceduring current one.• second, swift regulatory response shock covid-19 help bankingsystem support shake economy.• and third, truly sustainable long-term economic recovery crisis depend solvingequally long-term issue european bank system.let u begin resilience bank far prevent health crisis turninginto full-blown systemic financial crisis. the basel iii reform make sure global bankingsystem significantly good capitalise onset global financial crisis. thecommon equity tier 1 (cet1) ratio eu bank sector – key indicator financialsoundness – rise 9% 2009 nearly 15% fourth quarter 2019, thecovid-19 crisis hit. with amount capital, bank generally continue lend theeconomy even truly adverse scenario materialise, show ecb’s vulnerabilityanalysis publish july 2020.this show field bank regulation, waste previous crisis learntour lesson well.my second point relate regulatory response. the relief package ecb bankingsupervision announce march design ensure bank keep lend thecontracting economy. for instance, bank allow temporarily operate level ofcapital define bank-specific pillar 2 capital requirements, namely pillar ii guidance. 1 / 2bis central bankers' speech in lithuania, macroprudential policy key domain regulatory response package. priorto 2020, critic would say macroprudential set-up perhaps wide-ranging. butthis crisis showed, i believe, policy stance right one.first, help prevent deterioration lend standard build-up systemic risk therun covid-19 shock. and second, time came, implement counter-cyclical policy decision line intend function framework. for instance, inmid-march, bank lithuania fully release counter-cyclical capital buff 1% 0%.overall, relaxation various requirement increase lend potential bank inlithuania €2 billion, third, compare 2019. of course, talk potentialhere, real world. but real-world data encouraging, least term oflending households, broadly return pre-pandemic levels.going forward, policymakers “waste good crisis” time well, take freshlook exist macroprudential framework. we could even consider novel way applyingmacroprudential tool – application borrower-based measure cycle,e.g. relax loan-to-value debt-service-to-income requirement time crisis.finally, i would like make point long-term issue european bank sector. thefirst issue inadequate bank profitability. in regard, need consolidation viamergers acquisition make european bank sector leaner. complete bankingunion create european deposit insurance scheme (edis) would open door truecross border consolidation europe.the second issue non-performing loan (npls) – long-standing problem europeanbanking sector. to tackle potential rise npls, next round government support shouldput emphasis solvency rather liquidity support. in opinion, eu returnto idea establish european solvency support instrument. there also great needof convergence various insolvency framework across member states.tackling issue would allow bank keep lend sustain recovery.thank attention! 2 / 2bis central bankers' speech finance expenditure committee (fec) 2019 - 20 financial review reserve bank new zealand governor’s open

have? anddo need form central bank money? should banks’ deposit central bank betokenised? should banknote become digital?there many question surround “central bank digital currencies” (cbdc). and stillhave find right answers. but one thing certain: central bank around world haveundertaken tremendous effort ass potential investigate opportunity ofcbdc.just recently, bank international settlement (bis) publish third survey amongstcentral bank worldwide. the survey show shift mainly analytical work towards technicalexperimentation. more 60% central bank engage practical experimental work.it clear, then, even headway make explore central bank digitalcurrencies past year. on one hand, bi predict central bank representinga fifth world’s population issue general purpose cbdc next three years. on theother, widespread roll cbdcs seem way off. and good reason this.because cbdc game changer – potential benefits, also number ofchallenges.central bank digital currency promise combine improve efficiency digital formwith safety provide central bank single mean payment.however, central bank digital currency would third form central bank money, alongsidecash bank reserves. introduce new form central bank money could haveprofound impact financial system, especially available banks, instead,like cash today, general public. if properly think through, intervention maylead unintended consequences.today, i would like outline area i believe need tackle order create asafe, efficient future-proof currency. but let start three trend currentlyobserving: digitalisation, decline cash usage emergence new form money.2 trend paymentstrend 1: digitalisationour economy grow digital day. business process become increasinglyautomated interdependent. complex value chain arise. the “internet things” enablesmachine-to-machine communication. e-commerce online service kind to1 1 / 4bis central bankers' speech experience enormous uptake due pandemic. the pace digitalisation probablynever fast today. these development increasingly call safe efficientsettlement asset seamlessly integrate almost kind business process. trend 2: decline use cashparallel this, see use cash waning, even germany. the currentpandemic boost use credit debit cards, contactless payments, inparticular. in recently conduct survey payment behaviour germany coronaviruspandemic, find share cash transaction fall 74% 60% thelast three years. admittedly, remain see whether current behaviour also persist inthe post-coronavirus period. but currently see quite considerable change forum country strongly accustom pay cash.trend 3: emerge mean payment €another trend emergence new form digital mean payments. these becentral bank digital currency issue foreign central bank well privately issue meansof payment stablecoins. at moment, alternative mean payment still inthe development test phase. however, give speed technology developing,their widespread adoption might far le think. should form moneybecome widely use medium exchange store value euro area, significantimplications could arise: role euro payment industry, consequently alsofor financial stability. 3 central bank need preparedthe three trend i outline highlight that, payment ecosystem go expand,central bank need prepared.as highlight report bi seven central banks, central bank need aposition make inform judgment come decision central bank digitalcurrency.any dedicate central bank digital currency design carefully. possible advantagessuch safety efficiency improvement everyday payments, productivity gain bypromoting money could use programmable environments, availability newservices must clearly outweigh potential risk regard monetary policy financialstability. in case, must properly design mitigate risks.the eurosystem take comprehensive approach address challenges. a part ofa high-level eurosystem task force, colleague i identify possible scenario wouldrequire issuance digital euro publish last october ecb’s “report adigital euro” the govern council ecb yet reach decision whether tointroduce digital euro. we must first sure need issue cbdc and, so, thatwe able manage accompany risks. in digital age, time essence. but wealso take time homework.therefore, eurosystem start engage widely citizens, academia, financialsector public authority ass detail needs, well benefit andchallenges expect issuance digital euro. in mid-january, public consultationon digital euro come end record level participation european citizens.experimental work support analysis possible technical design implications.234 2 / 4bis central bankers' speech further outreach market exchange international central bank lead thework central bank digital currency follow. and bring last point.4 international dimension key international cooperation key shape future ecosystem central bank digitalcurrencies.as bi central bank rightly emphasise report regardless finaldesign, certain core feature common standard valuable guide acentral bank decide issue digital currency public.the feature i consider relevant context convertibility, interoperability andinternational standards.convertibility essential ensure trust currency. people must sure exchangethe form money hold par point time.interoperability require ensure smooth exchange money different kind ofpayment systems. in digitalise world, absolute prerequisite ensure efficientfinancial system.finally, appropriate international standard focal point ensure efficient cross-border payment flow.in view, three feature key determinant stable broadly accept digitalcurrency fit international financial system.against backdrop, safe efficient payment market must bring next level, inparticular cross-border cross-currency payments. this topic agenda forseveral years. while see significant progress improve payment domesticor regional level, cross-border payment are, put bluntly, still medieval age.the g20 roadmap enhance cross-border payment important step direction.the committee payment market infrastructures, together financial stabilityboard bis, set comprehensive work programme encompass 19 buildingblocks across five focus areas, include new payment infrastructure arrangements, whichcovers central bank digital currencies, amongst things.this work serve long-term goal achieve fair sustainable paymentslandscape, long international cooperation thrives.i optimistic fruitful work initiate g20, also form internationalformats, continue. cbdc might panacea challenge payment arefacing. but might option, include cross-border payments.in nutshell, payment – always – backbone economy. the digitaleconomy already change payment landscape quite significantly continue doso future. it responsibility central bank

(mark.deen@banque-france.fr), déborah guedj (deborah.guedj@banque-france.fr page 1 sur 8 i would like welcome banque de france 5th edition rencontres "climate change sustainable finance", organise jointly option finance. central banks’ commitment climate cause may seem obvious today, despite urgency address covid pandemic. but case five year ago, issue see rapid massive change mindset initiative. at banque de france increasingly within eurosystem, drive simple tenacious ambition: utmost support add collective action fight global warming. we cannot everything – nothing replace appropriate carbon price therefore, let clear, carbon tax one form another. but lot. the banque de france spearhead creation network green financial system (ngfs), launch paris december 2017 chair dutch colleague frank elderson. this network - already achieve lot regard supervision bank insurance company – count 80 members, include u federal reserve since 15 december 2020.i since 2019, banque

first central bank include fight climate change strategic review. today supervision, responsible investment, support green finance, bruno le maire forcefully stressed... tomorrow green monetary policy itself: morning, i would like explore together new frontier lie us. it perhaps least obvious one, one important. the journey sometimes little technical – i agree – roadmap precise. i first come back mean monetary action face climate change (i). i present three concrete lever acceleration (ii). page 2 sur 8 *** i. why must eurosystem act climate change? should monetary policy "greened"? the subject easily give rise heat debate: one hand, "conservatives" – mention climate sceptic – concern central banks' action inflation, denounce risk "politicisation" “mission creep". and hand, activist call change mandate, focus fight climate change conversion instrument – include american movement "green qe". in opinion, truth simple stronger. the eurosystem's consideration climate change neither abuse mission, mere militant conviction fad; imperative must pursue name current mandate ensure smooth implementation monetary policy. 1.1 in name mandate without even mention "secondaryiii" objectives, include environmental protection, climate change link core eurosystem’s monetary mandate: price stability. shock relate climate change potentially difficult manage central bank stagflationary nature, may result upward pressure price slowdown activity. transitional policy – bring taxation changes, carbon tax, regulatory change – affect prices, notably energy prices, generate inflationary pressure weigh activity, already case automotive sector. in addition transition risks, climate event already increasingly visible effect activity food prices. the price wheat currently reach historic high, partly climate reasons. in europe itself, drought summer 2018 cause rhine drop historically low level slow growth germany disrupt river transport. page 3 sur 8 in long term, climate change weigh potential growth economies. numerous study show high temperature reduce labour productivity 2% every degree 25°c.iv accord simulation banque de france, real gdp europe expect 2 6% low 2050, event disorderly rather orderly climate transition. 1.2 for smooth implementation monetary policy climate risk also source financial risk. it therefore essential, colleague friend jens weidmann, president bundesbank, says, "central bank […] practice preach"v bank supervise, i.e. good factor climate risk operations. moreover, preserve financial stability prerequisite ensure smooth transmission monetary policy, ngf also recently recalled.vi let's face it: ecb's balance sheet "exposed" climate risk security purchase asset pledge collateral banks, extent insufficiently take account. this primarily due lack comprehensive standardise information need economic agent factor climate risk. i come back need standardisation later. but fundamentally, difficulty price climate risk due characteristic risks, particular call "green swans", generate radical uncertainty whose consequence systemic.vii in respect, market neutrality – guide execution market operation – put brake carbon neutrality.viii market operation conduct neutral manner long comply central banks’ risk control rules. and yet, climate risk precisely financial risk currently insufficiently measure markets.ix another difficulty often put forward, overcome: fact climate risk long-term, many risk measure short- medium-term. page 4 sur 8 this real technical challenge: "probability default" usually one year; economic forecast cover two three-year horizon. we must therefore work "lengthen" measures, fact "tragedy horizonx" exist call status quo. on contrary! climate change call early resolute action benefit corrective measure essentially felt long term. ii. how central bank intervene? how concretely achieved? let start stress key point: eurosystem's highly accommodative monetary policy already help finance transition thank low interest rate abundant liquidity. green investment significant, aware this, – eur 1,000 billion public private investment plan part european green deal;xi never monetary policy favourable achieve this. the green central bank's action therefore require ease monetary policy, rather recalibration tools. by next september, decide within govern council conclusion "strategic review". to contribute debate, i would today like present ambition form simple triptych: forecast, disclose incorporate climate risk. 2.1 forecast, therefore model first ambition: deepen understand effect climate change price also growth, business cycle much long time horizons. we start scratch! much progress already made, notably drive ngfs. our model already incorporate, three-year horizon, effect tax measure facilitate transition, carbon tax. however, change behaviour economic agent difficult take account, even though - via expectation - economic consequence could felt well implementation. we also need examine impact energy sector economic dynamics, particularly international trade valuation page 5 sur 8 certain financial assets. beyond monetary policy horizon, important ass impact climate risk potential growth consequence central bank's policy space achieve primary objective. i refer particular long-term effect frequent severe extreme climate event capital accumulation, labour market migration flows. 2.2 disclose, and, this, impose standard this bring second ambition: impose transparency counterparties, financial also corporate, collateral asset purchase programmes. this transparency prerequisite good risk assessment. to so, i believe eurosystem require issuer disclose climate-related exposure use metric need harmonised. a far rat agency concerned, could decide work include climate-related risk sufficiently. this transparency requirement go hand hand harmonise regulatory framework. i repeat, i regret say neither europe, even france, today position compare - therefore correctly ass - heterogeneous data publish financial institution companies. from perspective, standardisation data draft non-financial report directive - discuss year - adoption hopefully next year, french presidency - battle fight 2021. and would unacceptable - time progress climate change move right direction europe first round climate-related value - europe lose second round, i.e. measure value use standard publish data. 2.3 incorporate climate risk, order reduce operation economy the third part triptych, core activity, powerful: reduce climate risk concrete terms, asset purchase page 6 sur 8 collateral policies. this ambition require great dexterity; root conviction: hand tool move forward, concretely, strongly. i propose start decarbonise ecb's balance sheet pragmatic, gradual target manner corporate assets, whether hold central bank's balance sheet (purchases) take collateral, without include government securities. there least two argument priority: 1/ difficult differentiate climate policy euro area countries. 2/ conversely, non-financial corporation clearly identify player whose activity carbon intensive. thank transparency efforts, know calculate climate indicator 90% value corporate bond eligible eurosystem.xii we also know bank loan large debtors, also important climate terms. the second step would extend decarbonisation strategy security issue financial institutions. to achieve this, bank need able ass indirect emissions, generate activity finance.xiii after determine scope, decarbonisation method remain defined. i believe seek achieve adjustment valuation asset accord climate transition risk. this solution considerable advantage avoid threshold effect would result simply exclude certain securities. ultimately, able must directly measure additional financial risk associate climate risk, reduce value asset accordingly: notably aim climate stress test method actively work banque de france acpr, framework ngfs. but pending actual completion, could choose good "proxy" financial risk, namely climate alignment; i.e. align asset firm 2°c trajectory set paris agreement. more specifically, eurosystem could use indicator measure effort issuer make give period reduce carbon emission compare peer page 7 sur 8 economic sector. here, data. the advance 2° alignment methodologies, even yet finalised, advantageous take account past effort future commitment reduce "carbon" emission predetermine horizon. this sector-specific dynamic assessment time provide great incentive would prevent issuer carbon-intensive sector blindly "punished" (contrary exclusion-based approach). for collateral, asset valuation adjustment could directly applied. but ambition must equally apply least much corporate bond purchase programmes. here, oblige purchase asset market price; i believe possible desirable recalibrate purchase limit per company (tilting) basis climate criteria. for instance, eurosystem could limit security purchase issuer whose climate performance compatible paris agreement. conversely, security issue "aligned" company could purchase large quantities. this approach, apply company corporate sector purchase programme, would comprehensive green qe, whose quantitative impact would low would target green bond only. *** this action programme ambitious: fight global warming, eurosystem would thus target direct effect - good conduct monetary policy reduce risk - well indirect effect - steer behaviour company financial institutions, disclosure policy, well asset purchase collateral policies. and programme demanding: require in-depth work macroeconomic model well climate assessment assets. but make decision quickly - end year - implement three five years. then eurosystem, together european central bank, impetus create christine lagarde, banque de france, pioneer global fight. we must so, name mandate. page 8 sur 8 however, central bank alone able enough. let u transform fight opportunity, combination fiscal, monetary structural policy within framework genuine green policy-mix combine carbon prices, public investment, sector-specific rule monetary action.

restoration biodiversity ecosystems©2021 central bank ireland nakamura toyoaki member policy board bank japanfebruary 10, 2021(english translation base japanese original) economic activity, prices, monetary policy japan speech meet local leader kochi (via webcast) 1 i. recent economic price development a. economic development i begin speech talk overseas economies. the growth rate april-june quarter 2020 substantially negative many country due measure lockdown implement response spread novel coronavirus (covid-19). however, july-september quarter turn significantly positive amid resumption economic activity (chart 1). the pace economic improvement october-december quarter vary across region sectors; growth rate unite state china positive two consecutive quarter european union turn negative due tighten public health measure follow resurgence covid-19. a outlook, overseas economy likely improve, partly support aggressive macroeconomic policies, although pace likely moderate time being. downside risk high development country likely remain dependent course covid-19. japan's economy pick trend, although remain severe situation (chart 2). export production continue increase clearly, mainly automobile-related goods, also wide range goods, include capital good it-related goods. however, stagnation become noticeable nonmanufacturing industry, particularly face-to-face services, mainly due third wave covid-19. business fix investment continue decline july-september quarter 2020. nevertheless, machinery investment manufacture industry pick up, reflect recovery export production. accord bank japan's december tankan (short-term economic survey enterprise japan), however, proportion firm respond current business condition "unfavorable" continue exceed proportion respond "favorable." the result observe future business conditions. sale forecast industry enterprise fiscal 2020 decline almost 10 percent year-on-year basis. it matter concern year-on-year rate growth research development (r&d) investment plan industry enterprise fiscal 2020 negative. give impact covid-19 2 expand release tankan, downside risk business fix investment significant, mainly face-to-face service industry. with regard substantial decline real gdp growth rate april-june quarter 2020 pick-up subsequent quarter, seem japan's recovery lack momentum compare unite state europe (chart 3). a comparison show domestic demand components, business fix investment private consumption, relatively weak japan compare unite state particular (chart 4). the relative weakness private consumption japan could attributable fact large population seniors, remain strongly vigilant covid-19. such weakness business fix investment could japanese firm active u.s. firm make digital investments. in view, lack momentum economic recovery japan due various challenge face long time. i return later. b. price development let move price developments. the year-on-year rate change consumer price index (cpi) item le fresh food, core cpi, negative since spring 2020, impact covid-19 intensify (chart 5). it recent decrease partly affect past decline crude oil price discount hotel charge "go to travel" campaign -- government's program promote domestic tourism. these factor likely eventually push cpi, mainly rise purchase power consumers. it become increasingly important clearly identify examine demand trend individual item compose cpi basket information gain interview firm individuals, instead focus solely fact core cpi negative. for instance, december 2020 opinion survey general public's view behavior show proportion respondent answer price go compare one year ago answer price would go one year 60 percent. le 10 percent respondent answer price would go question (chart 6). base survey result information, price cut decrease value-added firm observe widely yet. 3 c. outlook economic activity price now i would like explain policy board members' baseline scenario regard outlook economic activity prices. japan's economy likely follow improve trend impact covid-19 wan gradually, pace expect moderate. thereafter, impact subside globally, economy project keep improve overseas economy return steady growth path. give factors, bank's january 2021 outlook economic activity price (outlook report), forecast majority policy board member real gdp growth rate range minus 5.7 minus 5.4 percent, 3.3 4.0 percent, 1.5 2.0 percent fiscal 2020, 2021, 2022, respectively (chart 7). a outlook prices, year-on-year rate change core cpi likely negative time being, mainly affect widen negative output gap temporary price decline i note earlier. thereafter, expect turn positive increase gradually, since downward pressure price project wane gradually along economic improvement effect factor decline crude oil price likely dissipate. in january outlook report, forecast majority policy board member year-on-year rate change core cpi range minus 0.7 minus 0.5 percent, 0.3 0.5 percent, 0.7 0.8 percent fiscal 2020, 2021, 2022, respectively (chart 7). the risk overall sustain decline price judge significant present. however, level corporate profit expect low prior covid-19 outbreak, employment income situation likely remain weak time being. this likely take time economy recover, mainly nonmanufacturing industry, due recent resurgence covid-19. in addition, decline actual price prone strong effect people's perception price japan unite state europe, give japan suffer prolong deflation. take factor account, price development continue warrant attention. 4 ii.conduct monetary policylet turn bank's policy conduct. the bank conduct powerful monetary ease since march 2020 response covid-19 follow three measure (chart 8). the first special program support finance response novel coronavirus (covid-19) (the special program) provide support, mainly corporate financing. the second ample flexible provision funds, mainly purchase japanese government bond (jgbs) conduct u.s. dollar funds-supplying operations. the third active purchase exchange-traded fund (etfs) japan real estate investment trust (j-reits) low risk premia asset markets.the bank's response positive effects, couple government's measure active effort financial institutions. some nervousness see financial market recently, remain various uncertainties. however, tension ease compare spring summer period 2020. firms' financial position long deteriorating, although weak, environment funding, bank borrow well issuance cp corporate bonds, remain accommodative. thus, smooth function financial intermediation ensured, big difference time global financial crisis (gfc), downward pressure financial side real economy intensified. however, downward pressure economic activity price due impact covid-19 likely persist. give situation, bank decide december 2020 monetary policy meet (mpm) extend duration special program end september 2021 conduct assessment effective sustainable monetary ease view achieve price stability target 2 percent. in summer 2016, three year introduction quantitative qualitative monetary ease (qqe) 2013, bank conduct comprehensive assessment examine effects. the find indicate that, (1) large-scale monetary easing, financial condition improve significantly, see correction past excessive appreciation 5 yen decline stock prices, (2) lead improvement business performance economic activity. on hand, find regard price reveal follow points. first, although economy long deflation sense sustain decline prices, cpi reach price stability target 2 percent. second, people's mindset behavior base assumption price increase easily deeply entrench prolong deflation, still take long time mindset behavior change. in addition, find also confirm monetary ease could cumulative negative impact financial institutions' profit well investment income life insurance company pension funds, turn could adversely affect function financial intermediation. a policy response base find comprehensive assessment, bank introduce yield curve control september 2016. through framework, control policy interest rate appropriate level take consideration positive side effect monetary easing. also, july 2018, bank, view persistently continue powerful monetary easing, shift flexible market operation asset purchase long-term interest rate may move upward downward extent amount etf j-reit purchase may increase decrease depend market conditions. the upcoming assessment monetary ease measure drive motivation comprehensive assessment. the current framework qqe yield curve control work well four year since introduction, include covid-19 era. the bank, framework, ass whether operational practice policy tools, include various asset purchases, intend effects. furthermore, monetary ease inevitably prolong due linger impact covid-19, bank open option pursuit effective sustainable monetary easing. a find assessment schedule make public march mpm, i cannot draw conclusion advance. however, let express view etf purchases. in japan, base past experience, destabilization stock market tend 6 bring deflationary mindset. give unique factor, i think etf purchase effective dispel mindset continue necessary policy tool. that said, necessary bear mind large-scale purchase prolong hold asset -- limit etf -- could affect market functioning. while i continue consider detail possible response careful examination effect side effects, important prepare respond timely effective manner counter possible change economic activity prices, well financial conditions. iii.challenges face japan's economy need strengthen growth potentiala. challenge face japan's economy next, i would like talk challenge face japan's economy longer-term perspective. up 1985 plaza accord, yen remain weak u.s. dollar despite first second petroleum crises. in situation, japanese firm concentrate fix investment exclusively japan enhance rationalization efficiency. thus, japan become so-called process trade country, leverage strong price competitiveness drive export acquire foreign currency. the drive export increase corporate profit household income, eventually pour financial institution deposit pass firms, mainly use fix r&d investments. consequently, virtuous cycle operate japanese industry. with place, firm employee build "win-win" relationship, firm give employee sense assurance wage would rise constantly base lifetime employment seniority-based wages, employee contribute improve business performance sense loyalty firms. at time, unique culture take root japan -- namely, whereby "diligence" emphasis "group individual" consider important. after plaza accord, latter half 1980s, yen appreciate u.s. dollar around 230 yen per dollar level 120 yen. then, circumstance japan grapple non-performing loan problem burst bubble economy, rise newly industrialize economy strong price competitiveness realize exploit cheap labor. furthermore, japan's 7 population rapidly age birth rate declining; work age population begin decrease reach peak 1995. with change surround japanese industry take place, exist business structure long able sustain firms' price competitiveness. japanese firm thus face need bolster innovation capability reform industrial structure. however, traditional employment practice work style slow changed. many firm choose squeeze fix expense main cost reduction measure case earn deteriorated. therefore, labor depreciation cost reduction prioritize realignment business portfolio, would enhance value-added, postponed. a result, firm continue maintain low-profit less-competitive businesses. their investment distortedly affect -- r&d investment, instance -- delay strengthen promise businesses. furthermore, along wan profitability, i think firm bias toward avoid risk fear occurrence unexpected major economic shocks. it seem combination factor lead 30-year slump productivity low growth, japan leave behind tide global growth. look trend japanese enterprises' labor productivity size, large enterprises, mark significant decline due gfc, finally surpass fiscal 2018 fiscal 2007 level. on hand, labor productivity medium-sized enterprise small medium enterprise (smes) show small decline time gfc. however, improvement observe thereafter type enterprise moderate, thus strong enough drive productivity growth japan's economy whole (chart 9). b. change economic condition need structural reform japan face major changes, digitalization carbon reduction. a digitalization progress further, people free time space constraints. in society 5.0 -- concept future society propose japanese government -- cyber real space highly integrated. in society, overcome challenge create new value appreciated, increase business scale efficiency. with regard carbon 8 reduction, automobile industry, underpin japan's growth employment many years, confront worldwide trend toward end new sale gasoline-powered vehicles. a electric vehicle come use widely, seem possible market environment could change drastically highly commoditized digital-oriented one. under circumstances, japanese government declare action plan1 next drive force growth would digital green areas, would support reinforcement japan's r&d capability long term end. the government also make clear aim create environment startup smes japan grow, support smes' effort raise productivity, grow larger, take challenge enter overseas markets. in fact, deregulation market expansion free trade agreement trans-pacific partnership agreement create prime opportunity japan, face population decline structural issues. now drastic change occur environment, crucial firm enhance innovation capabilities, one step ahead pursue change, realize growth. to end, important realize expansion business scale strengthen business foundations, set forth government.2 firm take initiative view press need digital utilization, well reform employment practices, work styles, business portfolios. in words, transformation typical japanese style business begin progress. for instance, increase number firm promote great mobility employment shift job-based employment performance-based wage systems. in addition, firm pursue business realignment integration beyond corporate boundaries, acquisition divestitures, business alliances. i expect restructure business portfolio move forward, thereby enhance productivity creation value-added business growth. 1 the action plan decide committee growth strategy december 1, 2020. 2 see footnote 1. 9 c. need growth smes since gdp sum value-added firms' business activities, i think necessary term japan's future growth increase productivity value-added firms. to end, driver economic growth, essential increase number startup smes grow larger; example, startup develop so-called unicorn valuation 1 billion u.s. dollars. accord report u.s. research company, 518 unicorn world; 249, half total, unite states, follow 122 china. there four unicorn japan, compare 13, 26, 11 germany, india, south korea, respectively, although japan's economic scale big country (chart 10). this suggest technology service one step ahead respond change economic environment, fintech online services, attract investment fund growth. it easy task achieve sustainable growth increase corporate value. from experience management, i say that, order turn environmental change opportunity, firm need strengthen business resource rely solely resource make effective use personnel different background knowledge. they also need take lead pursue change reform business structure without delay, thereby realize growth. to end, important carry deregulation aim facilitate free business activity create market firm obtain ample investment fund enable implement growth strategy thereby achieve sustainable growth. in follows, i talk role direct indirect finance expect play term firms' fund raising. d. expect role direct finance first, let talk direct financing, firm issue stock raise fund directly. a end september 2020, japanese household hold 1,900 trillion yen financial assets, 1,000 trillion yen cash deposit 500 trillion yen 10 insurance pension plans. this mean that, great deal money pour financial institutions, much flow directly firm actually business. fund raise initial public offer (ipos) public offer (pos) japan 2019 remain small, amount 10 billion u.s. dollars, one tenth amount raise unite states. in addition, look venture investment investment funds, amount fund invest venture capital (vc) fund unite state 2020 16 trillion yen (156.2 billion u.s. dollars), continue increase even covid-19 pandemic.3 on hand, japan, amount invest vc fund 2019 200 billion yen, decline 30 percent january-september period 2020 compare year earlier.4 in unite states, ample fund flow firms, startup disruptive technology business model bolster innovation capability steadily raise funds, become unicorns. such unicorn continue raise fund directly financial market even go public, eventually grow major firms. on hand, japan, total market capitalization firm list first section tokyo stock exchange (tse) end 2020 amount 667 trillion yen, exceed 591 trillion yen end 1989, within bubble period.5 over time frame, number list firm increase 1,000. this suggest list firm whole achieve growth term average capitalization per firm. market capitalization reflect investors' growth expectations. for expectation ground fundamentals, list firm realize investors' growth expectation raise investment fund end. 3 base data u.s. national venture capital association pitchbook. 4 base data venture enterprise center. 5 firm list first section tse end 2020 include 37 firm list july 16, 2013, integration cash equity market tse osaka security exchange. 11 recently, case start see overseas investment vc fund invest startup japan. in regard, prime minister suga declare policy speech creation framework financial market attract green investment home abroad.6 i hope direct finance market increase size liquidity market wide range investor supply long-term fund support firms' growth. i also expect investment startup vc fund active, mainly growth area japan's economy -- namely, digital green area -- clear now. e. expect role indirect finance next, i would like touch indirect financing, firm raise fund financial institutions. japan's advantage lie fact infrastructure need economic growth; is, necessary work capital business fix investment fund supply steadily financial institution firms. however, business environment face regional financial institution grow challenge due impact covid-19 addition structural factor decline birthrate, age population, population outflow, well continue low interest rate environment. amid circumstances, bank decide 2020 introduce special deposit facility enhance resilience regional financial system. the aim facility encourage regional financial institutions' initiative strengthen business foundation may firmly support regional economy future smoothly fulfill financial intermediation function. let express view regard regional financial system. while geographic coverage regional financial institutions' business often divide prefectural basis, value chain not. a population shrink become difficult achieve business growth within limit geographic area, increase number firm pursue growth productivity business scale. even growth-oriented startup smes provide excellent technology services, lack resource personnel, 6 see "policy speech prime minister 204th session diet," deliver january 18, 2021. 12 materials, money, well strong customer base. thus, help address insufficiency, regional financial institution expect provide high-value service thereby support local smes' sustainable growth leverage information institution smes, capability growth potential. i think initiative line expectation institutions' borrower -- namely, local smes. give data information create value today, regional financial institution expect expand data information network beyond geographic boundary offer value demand borrowers, provide solution borrowers' business challenges. for regional financial institution provide strong sustain support local smes' initiative achieve growth, business integration merger one option them. at time, various alliances, include partner different type businesses, also effective. to give illustration region, let u look ryoma sakamoto, hero close day tokugawa shogunate bear kochi prefecture. even era movement japan strictly regulated, lead kameyama shachū, equivalent modern trade company. with sight set resource strategy satsuma chōshū clans, geographically temperamentally far remove one another, sakamoto help bring satsuma-chōshū alliance realization develop human resource network ultimately lead japan's transformation meiji restoration. my hope kochi prefecture today see movement toward transformation. with eye post-covid-19 era, direct indirect finance play major role effort increase productivity business scale smes, include startups. it necessary risk money market harness expertise, particularly term business growth potential, bank financial institution harness term business sustainability. i expect see increase interaction business manager markets, shift mindset manager toward focus sustainable growth, proactive procurement investment fund growth, reform business 13 model portfolios. i hope factor increase productivity economy whole. at present, management staff firms, smes particular, make strenuous effort address significant environmental change cause covid-19 pandemic. give global economy experience period prolong low growth follow major shock, government central bank around world make every effort prevent much possible covid-19 shock create "scarring effects," long-lasting aftereffect economy. on hand, face significant change, firm achieve substantial growth one step ahead turn change opportunity. although japan suffer prolong low growth deflation, i expect long-standing challenge attract close attention due covid-19 pandemic finally resolve time, bank encourage effort monetary ease measures. thank you. economic activity, prices, monetary policy japanfebruary 10, 2021nakamura toyoakibank japanspeech

russia, follow-up boardof director meeting, moscow, 12 february 2021.* * *today, decide keep key rate 4.25% per annum.the economy bounce back rather steadily. i would like remind previousmeeting expect economic revival pause end 2020. however, gdp statisticsand high-frequency indicator evidence happen. moreover, inflation also exceedsour expectations.i dwell factors, take account make decisiontoday.i start situation economy. it turn good thanwe expected, range reason this. first, restriction autumn winterwere tough spring. second, household business good preparedfor resurgence coronavirus case adjust faster. credit activity decline,and consumer demand remain unchanged, include owe rise online purchases.third, external demand russian export also turn high expectations.we assume demand economy recover steadily on, promotedby lend expansion amid accommodative monetary policy, mass vaccination,and improvement household business sentiment.over acute phase crisis, budget spend considerably support real sector.the effect stimulus measure expect continue first half year well.further on, schedule fiscal policy normalisation reduce extent influence.nonetheless, budget remain expansionary compare long-term parametersprovided fiscal rule.in conditions, economic growth continue owe revival domesticand external demand. the recovery domestic demand drive cancellationof restriction epidemic situation improves, especially service sector. externaldemand boost rebound global economy. disinflationary demand-sidepressure thus decrease overall.given current positive trends, keep unchanged forecast gdp growth 3–4% 2021. furthermore, economy may reach pre-pandemic level already late 2021,and mid-2022, assume earlier. this become possible primarily resultof le significant decline 2020.the second factor inflation. annual inflation speed 5.2% january, exceed bankof russia’s target. this elevate inflation rate largely result pass-through rubleweakening price growth global commodity markets. accord estimates,the contribution pass-through exchange rate movement annual inflationapproximated one percentage point. the contribution high price food market slightlylower yet substantial. give increase inflation expectation supply-side restrictions, thesefactors may longer-lasting effect prices.the pass-through last year’s ruble depreciation price still continues, although waning.recently, price could affect ruble exchange rate fluctuation 2020 h2, 1 / 3bis central bankers' speech also weaken spring, enterprise unable revise price immediatelydue slump demand. eventually, combination two episode rubledepreciation may reason inflation expectation stay elevate long period.upward pressure domestic price persist due situation global commodity markets,first foremost food markets. food price rise reduce inventoriesand unfavourable weather conditions. moreover, growth price cereal increase costsin meat product manufacture proinflationary factor itself, may alsoentail secondary effects. it worth note new mechanism export duty grainmarkets smooth influence global price fluctuation domestic prices.finally, inflation still affect group factor associate epidemic situation.it include staff shortage number industries, increase cost incur companiesto comply sanitary epidemiological rules, persistent temporary delay suppliesdue disruption logistics chains. these supply-side factor put upward pressureon inflation.given nature processes, estimate annual inflation pas peakin february—march, go incrementally. this become possibleas impact proinflationary factor gradually exhausted. begin march,the statistical base effect also play significant role decrease annual inflation. takinginto account monetary policy pursued, forecast price grow 3.7%—4.2% overthe year.the third factor take account make today’s decision thatmonetary condition remain accommodative. while nominal interest rate loansand deposit change slightly, real price condition eased. bank also continuedto ease non-price lend condition range segments. yield federal government bondsincreased somewhat amid growth long-term interest rate global financial markets.owing monetary policy pursue government’s anti-crisis support measures,the increase bank system’s claim company accelerate 10.2% last year, whichis 2019. the growth rate claim household equal 12.9%. the economyand borrower obtain fund need smoothly overcome acute phaseof crisis resume development.in 2021, monetary condition remain accommodative, promote lend expansion,despite expect gradual termination preferential programmes. the bank system’sclaims company forecast increase 7–11% year, household —by 14–18%, largely result accelerate expansion mortgage lending.as regard fluctuation bank sector liquidity observe recent months, impacton monetary conditions. a before, bank russia preserve money market rate closeto key rate. this become possible owe streamline operational procedure whichis efficient amid deficit surplus liquidity.today, publish bank russia’s update baseline forecast. it relieson follow assumptions:first all, external condition become promising. the global economy expectedto grow fast owe mass vaccination additional fiscal stimulus advance economies.this strengthen external demand russian exports. therefore, increasedour forecast oil price 45 50 u dollar per barrel 2021 2022. nonetheless,our forecast remain conservative give high uncertainty potential spreadof pandemic. accord estimates, fast recovery demandfor oil may translate great extent rise oil output rather oil prices. 2 / 3bis central bankers' speech a regard 2022–2023 horizon, forecast remain unchanged. the economy willexpand 2.5–3.5% 2022 2–3% 2023. give monetary policy pursued, inflationwill return target end 2021 stay close 4% on.i speak possible risk forecast. disinflationary risk prevailany long 2021. moreover, generally balance proinflationaryand disinflationary risk forecast horizon.proinflationary risk include, first foremost, possible rise price globalcommodity markets. second, epidemic situation remain one least predictablefactors. it potential worsen reason companies’ cost stay high,with good transportation problem production chain disruption persisting. third,inflation expectation may remain elevate long period time. fourth, worthemphasising economic rebound may uneven involve local price spike individualsegments. for instance, restriction lift service sector hardesthit pandemic, increase demand amid insufficient rise supply may becomea temporary proinflationary factor. the scale duration impact dependon new balance demand supply, households’ behaviour, change consumerpreferences, pace cancellation restriction foreign travels. fifth, still takeinto account persistent geopolitical risk may affect yield trend inflationand exchange rate expectations.the second group risk include disinflationary factors. first all, fiscal policynormalisation may significant influence final demand and, accordingly, pricemovements. second, uncertainty regard future consumer behaviour remains. duringthe quarantine long self-isolation period, lot people abandon services,formed new consumption preferences, change mode life. we knowwhether become steady influence price trends. third, afterthe boundary reopened, natural expect demand shift towards outboundtourism services. a labour migrant flow logistics chain restore, becomea disinflationary factor. finally, restriction eased, company ableto reduce cost sanitation premise anti-pandemicprotection staff customers, ease pressure businesses’ costs.in conclusion, i would like comment monetary policy prospects. the accommodativemonetary policy government’s package anti-crisis measure promotingeconomic revival acute phase crisis. accord estimates, consider thatthe potential monetary policy ease exhausted. it ease could additionallyincrease proinflationary risks. nonetheless, monetary policy remain accommodativeon average throughout 2021, support recovery russian economy. the baselinescenario provide gradual return

central bank immediately cutthe interest rates, quickly reach low threshold 0. this render interest rate,as main instrument monetary policy, practically useless. in order re-activate theeconomy, central bank advance economy (federal reserve, european central bank,bank england, bank japan) conduct massive temporary liquidity injections, bypurchasing security capital markets. even though

investment finance - lithuaniawelcome speech mr vitas vasiliauskas, chairman board bank lithuania, atthe joint bank lithuania european investment bank webinar investment andinvestment finance, 11 february 2021.* * *good morning, dear marco, dear thomas colleagues, presenter viewers,a warm welcome joint webinar organise bank lithuania europeaninvestment bank (eib). allow me, first all, thank eib approach u idea tohold event.this indeed pivotal time talk investment. investment decision make nowwill crucial short long run.let u begin short-term implications. accord organisation economic co-operation development (oecd), gross fix capital formation euro area fell almost11% last year. this stark contrast us, decrease amount even2%. in 2021, investment u remain strong well.accordingly, gdp euro area project recover pre-pandemic level onlytowards end 2022. the us, meanwhile, likely make lose grind already thisyear, whereas china’s output fully bounce back – already return pre-pandemic trend. europe satisfy outlook.the euro area need strong investment push speed recovery catch theother large economies. otherwise, painful long-term scar effect become unavoidable.public investment key regard – especially current low-rate environment,characterised historically low sovereign debt service cost share fiscal revenue.as private sector, various survey report show uncertainty stand thelargest barrier private corporate investment. our estimation show even lithuania,despite strong economic resilience display far, private sector investment likely havefallen almost 8% 2020.however, policy maker address issue. current research suggest firmsgrow risk-averse due uncertainty cloud future, public investment become much moreeffective usual. not high multiplier, actually crowds-in privateinvestment, rather crowd out. that is, course, high-quality public investmentwhich well-targeted enhance potential output.this consistent speedy implementation next generation eu package beso important europe near-term horizon. at heart package recovery andresilience facility (rrf). by support member states’ reform public investment, therrf provide anti-cyclical fiscal impulse immediate term – much need acrossmany part europe. and i believe that, give current circumstances, catalyseprivate sector investment.however, risk european money disburse quickly enough becauseof administrative obstacle rrf plan put forward member state may simplylack ambition. lithuania good track record regard absorption rate europeanfunds – currently rank ninth term 2014–2020 financial perspective. but cannotgrow complacent.12 1 / 3bis central bankers' speech lithuania take full advantage rrf fund put forward high-quality plan thecommission april. by this, i mean plan base rigorous cost-benefit analysis andis line european priorities. the bank lithuania stand ready mobilise expertcapacities help ensure plan advance serious investment reform agenda.this lead directly long-term perspective.according late data, lithuania’s gdp decrease 1.3% 2020, beat previousforecasts make bank lithuania international institutions. and despite theongoing second lockdown.in light, rrf important lithuania much immediate relief measure, butas tool long-term economic transformation upcoming year even decades.indeed, need think strategically post-pandemic world. at least three major force willbe shape future – shift supply chains, digitalisation climate change. our investmentstrategies accommodate trends.first, pandemic has, least partly, provide impulse reverse globalisation.vulnerabilities relate global value chain exposed. country region havedeclared intension repatriate production strategically important goods.it crucial lithuania, yet achieve full economic convergence euaverage, us global shift advantage. we need attract foreign direct investmentthat could help u enhance participation recalibrated value chains. we focus onbringing high value-added activities, could provide strong impetus growthof labour productivity and, consequently, potential output.second, digitalisation also greatly accelerate pandemic. restaurant andshops digitalise process offer delivery services. people workingremotely extend period time.we therefore need invest digital infrastructure, include 5g networks, fully adjust thenew reality.digitalisation also bring automation artificial intelligence, thus provide boost toproductivity. we encourage investment policies, include investment inhuman capital, labour force successfully participate brave new digitaleconomy.here i see connection third great force shape future – climate change.investment green technology help reduce co2 emission bring cheaperrenewable energy.large-scale ambitious green investment programme also help offset negativeeffects automation – loss job grow regional inequalities.again, next generation eu become good anchor green investment. at least 37% ofexpenditure national rrf plan must support climate objectives.however, green investment need even higher. under european green deal strategy, theeu commit reduce greenhouse gas emission least 55% 2030, compare to1990 levels. it estimate “green investment gap” – additional investmentsnecessary achieve target – amount €300 billion per year.therefore, quite obvious need promote green investment national level aswell. 2 / 3bis central bankers' speech one way provide leeway green investment european fiscalframework, review likely resume 2021. for instance, could introduce a“green clause”, would exclude growth-enhancing green investment overall deficittarget.this issue relevant lithuania member state, since europeancommission consider u risk miss 2030 climate targets.fostering financial system finance climate-friendly investment also anincreasingly important topic central banks. last year, bank lithuania join networkfor green financial system (ngfs), aim scale green finance. climate change,including relate risk correctly price markets, also consider theongoing european central bank’s (ecb) monetary policy strategy review.dear colleagues,to conclude, investment today important ever. first, help repair, i.e. restoregrowth short-to-medium term. and second, need prepare long game.i therefore look forward upcoming discussion presentations, include latesteib investment survey key find lithuania.thank you.marco francini, moderator, head regional eib group office baltic states, european investment bank.thomas östros, vice-president eib.12 3 / 3bis central bankers' speech

european union pursue approach so-called equivalence, face itallows defer authority appropriate. the eu’s framework equivalence infinancial service patchwork across many different piece financial service legislation,taking different form different sub-sectors, present all. nor theequivalence measure prescribe judgement made.as well known, post-brexit equivalence process uk eu beenstraightforward. it is, course, two distinct process – one uk recognise eu asequivalent uk, one vice versa. the uk grant equivalence eu someareas, eu do likewise uk. in area – involve central clear andsettlement – agreement eu extend temporary equivalence uk,recognising, i think, clear risk financial stability would arise beendone outset.it would reasonable think common framework global

continue example ofcentral clearing, eu recently make u sec equivalent ccps, subject certainconditions. these condition already meet uk ccps legal requirement theonshored legislation, equivalence beyond temporary extension remain uncertain.the eu argue must good understand uk intend amend alter rulesgoing forwards. this standard eu hold country would, i suspect, notagree hold itself. it hard see beyond one two way interpret statement, 2 / 4bis central bankers' speech neither stand much scrutiny.the first interpretation rule change future, would beunwelcome. this unrealistic, dangerous inconsistent practice. a world around uschanges, must rule accommodate changes. a evidence this, look whatthe authority response covid shock create financialmarkets. the eu almost constantly revising, contemplate revise rules, that’sa good thing. so, i dismiss argument.the second argument uk rule change independently eu. i ambeing careful phrase point. it’s uk rule might change independently – theequivalence process provide re-assessment decisions, aproblem. so, must strong form change independently. but isrule-taking pure simple. it acceptable uk rule govern system 10 time thesize uk gdp

consistent internationalstandards appropriate.let give three example area rule change uk look at, two involvingbanks one life insurance. first, basel regime bank has, outset 1980s,applied so-called “internationally active banks”. the eu choose apply bank andrelevant deposit takers. that matter choice. but basel regime heavy duty andcomplicated apply small bank (i know many big bank say same,

overwhelm body evidence thatsuch approach interests, let alone anyone else’s. that said, i believe wehave bright future compete global financial market underpin strong andeffective common global regulatory standards.i want finish one important area, is, rule apply – supervision aswe call – sure application rule effective across borders, andparticularly uk eu. it course critical rule apply

developments. i would like start say word context italy begin presidency. 2. we know current global crisis one unprecedented magnitude. since inception pandemic, 100 million individual diagnose covid-19 worldwide; almost 30 million case record europe. more 2 million people die it, one third europe.the pandemic, combine containment measure introduce curb spread virus, plunge world economy one deep recession recent history. in 2020, despite short spell recovery summer, world gdp decline 3.5 per cent, large contraction since wwii. economic loss euro area uk particularly severe. fiscal monetary authority respond swiftly massive expansionary interventions. the measure aim strengthen healthcare systems, support firms’ households, preserve orderly monetary financial conditions.the short-term objective mitigate immediate consequence pandemic achieved, prevent drying-up liquidity, avoid immediate 2credit crunch could lead large wave defaults, tame deflationary pressure would scar economic fabric economy generate financial instability. 3. accord late projection release imf, global economic activity surpass pre-pandemic level end 2021, world gdp grow 5.5 per cent. the forecast revise positively, light expectation vaccine would remove current restriction second half year. however, projection heterogeneous across world regions, owe difference access healthcare, effectiveness relief measures, exposure cross-country spillovers, structural characteristics. furthermore, large uncertainty still surround evolution epidemic, reflect new wave contagion, new variant virus distribution vaccines. in context, time effectiveness distribution vaccine paramount importance reinforce confidence household firms, crucial ingredient balanced, sustain inclusive recovery.4. policy-makers confront need speed strengthen recovery. inclusion important: pandemic exacerbate inequalities. the better-off likely work home good equip study home. this task challenging.first all, important phasing-out measure design carefully, avoid premature removal support hold back pace recovery, still prevent possible misallocation resources. at time, set stage long-lasting recovery require tackle structural global challenges, lack determine policy response since even pandemic.5. it exceptional circumstance last december italy assume presidency g20, lay priority basis three pillars: people, planet prosperity. the finance track g20 focus current development policy actions. we closely monitor progress commitment objective lay action plan, endorse last april g20 leader provide coordinate response crisis, update october. a live document, action plan update again, take account evolution health economic situation. we build excellent result achieve saudi presidency.in meet g20 finance central bank deputy january 25th-26th, italian presidency receive broad consensus priorities, initiative work plan different work groups: framework work group (fwg), infrastructure work group (iwg), international finance architecture (ifa) work group. 23the framework work group focus three objectives: ensure policy mix remain appropriate address economic consequence pandemic crisis; exploit opportunity digital transformation boost productivity; monitor global risks, include arise non-economic factors, climate-related ones. the work program infrastructure work group 2021 build around four pillars: resilience maintenance, digitalization, sustainability, social inclusion. while infrastructure investment important lever support post-covid recovery, common goal look beyond short term embark infrastructure agenda contribute last broad-based prosperity.as international finance architecture work group, need preserve international financial stability whilst transition emergency response crisis towards recovery stage. the work group focus four main areas: debt, global financial resilience, finance need vulnerable countries, implication rise digital currency international monetary system. 6. the g20 finance track also strive sustain recovery develop long-term strategy foster transformation towards greener, digital inclusive societies. today – look beyond current situation – i would like touch upon three press challenge world economy face come years. they core theme agenda italian presidency: climate change, future potential pandemics, financial inclusion.some policy priority even covid-19 pandemic. the shock nevertheless bring swift structural transformations, together new opportunities, make urgent address issue coordinate effective manner, without complacency.7. protect planet mean build resilient society tackle climate challenge. the natural environment threaten effect climate change, increase repercussion economies. last year, together 2016, warm record. we must curb carbon footprint human activities. this go expensive complex many dimensions, technical political. base alternative scenario regard timeline intensity introduction risk mitigation policies, define network green financial system (ngfs), worldwide group 70 central bank supervisors, picture emerge warrant resolute action. to allow smooth transition net zero co2 emission 2070, keep rise global temperature within 2°c, line paris agreement goal, policy response must prompt, extensive coordinated. delay hesitation would force costly brutal adjustment future. 4an ambitious green agenda core italian g20 presidency. we believe finance track bring sustainability back centre policy agenda, make climate challenge cross-cutting priority across activities. at g20 level, explore issue relate sustainable finance climate change since 2016.the italian presidency propose re-establish sustainable finance study group take stock recent development sustainable finance climate risks, ultimate goal suggest ‘sustainable’ growth path. the urgency recovery could renew momentum reshape economic model around low-carbon strategy: improve energy efficiency, deploy renewables energy storage develop carbon capture technologies. the work group italian presidency mainly focus improve quality, availability comparability data ass climate-related issue and, generally, sustainability, financial risks, opportunities. the group could also investigate area future action achieve sustainable development agenda unite nations, particular access modern form sustainable energy natural capital conservation restoration.the transition zero-emissions economy foster financial system, give key role allocation resources. several analysis show incorporate environmental, social governance (esg) factor investment strategy hamper financial performance. the risk-adjusted return sustainable investment indeed often high achieve use traditional financial models. during recent market turmoil, preference financial investor sustainable investment prove resilient. another important venue discus possible instrument reach carbon neutrality, include ‘climate cooperation’, year’s conference party (cop26), unite nation framework convention climate change. the coincidence italy president g20 co-chair cop26 (the chair uk, president g7) may allow u bring forward climate change agenda many front simultaneously, involvement private sector finance green agenda. 8. the covid-19 pandemic ensue global health crisis clearly highlight cost extreme health emergencies. the risk another pandemic high. in 2018, article world health organisation (who), larry summer two distinguish public health scholar write that: ‘few doubt major epidemic pandemic strike would argue world adequately prepared’.1 evidently, last year prepared. a broad-based global effort improve prevention, surveillance, preparedness utmost importance, ‘health all’ perspective. 1 fan, j., d. jamison l. summer (2018) ‘pandemic risk: large expect losses?’ bulletin world health organization, 96:129-134. 54while massive effort way strict health policy sense – develop distribute vaccines, test capacity treatments, strengthen disease surveillance network global protocol health emergency – deficiency fund emerged. the current architecture allow timely mobilization resource respond pandemic support global preparedness. achieve goal cannot responsibility one country isolation single institution alone health cross cut multi-sectoral nature centre economic resilience.approving proposal italian presidency, first g20 finance central bank deputy meet january 25th-26th, g20 member agree establish high level independent panel (hlip) finance global common pandemic preparedness response. the panel leverage who’s assessment gap pandemic preparedness ongoing international initiative enhance it. it interact main relevant global health actor identify specific gap finance system propose solution meet systematic basis. it consider optimally leverage resource public, private philanthropic sector international financial institutions. the panel ensure broad regional gender balance, comprise eminent individuals. it conclusion suppose input joint g20 meet finance health minister schedule next october.9. provide access affordable useful financial product – transactions, payments, savings, credit insurance – key support development growth. if accompany financial literacy, allow individual company generate income, manage volatile cash flow, plan investment strengthen resilience income fluctuation shocks.the g20 active promote goal ‘not leave anyone behind’ access finance, particular global partnership financial inclusion (gpfi). in 2021 gpfi, italy one newly appoint co-chairs, focus digital financial inclusion individual micro, small medium-sized enterprise (msmes). the shift towards digitalization service represent great opportunity expand access finance; time, increase financial exclusion unless support appropriate literacy, financial digital, adequate governance. digital transformation enhance financial inclusion effectively reach vulnerable financially underserved, include micro small enterprises, individual business equip financial competence allow make inform decisions. we must ensure wide access digital financial infrastructure translate irresponsible financial behavior, can, turn, endanger growth financial stability.to fulfil work plan commitments, g20 presidency mandate implement partner (ips) – include

one concern raise digital financial awareness household msmes. the one aim foster innovative regulatory supervisory approach encourage development inclusive responsible digital financial service grant adequate protection final customers, include cyber risk. the 2021 gpfi’s focus digital financial inclusion also take account remittance effective action need support them, also time crisis. 10. i briefly touch upon three theme agenda g20 finance track italian presidency. all three challenge – climate change, preparedness health policy financial inclusion – must find adequate coordinate response order advance onto ‘sustained’ ‘sustainable’ recovery path. great uncertainty still surround evolution epidemic relate economic developments; outlook nevertheless positive. it therefore
