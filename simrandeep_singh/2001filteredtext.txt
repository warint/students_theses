 bi review 25/20011laurence meyer: doe money matter?remarks mr laurence h meyer, member board governor u federal reservesystem, occasion 2001 homer jones memorial lecture, washington university,st. louis, missouri, 28 march 2001.* * *it always pleasure return st. louis washington university see many friendsand former colleagues. but special pleasure occasion, homer joneslecture. homer jones still active federal reserve bank st. louis i arrive atwashington university 1969, wife, alice, faculty member economicsdepartment. i pleasure get know both. homer special many ways. he was, ofcourse, leader build research department federal reserve bank st. louis inorienting toward monetarist perspective. but also remarkable contrast strongconvictions gentle manner. it combination admire emulate. i admit i mayhave successful emulate strong conviction gentle manner. but onlymakes admire homer even more.i remember vividly first visit st. louis washington university early 1969. i agraduate student mit visit university search appointment assistant professor ofeconomics. i pick airport deliver hotel, advance seminar theuniversity follow day. when i walk hotel room, small sign desk immediatelycaught attention. it read: "money matters." my first reaction awe reach st. louisfed. they take monetarism bite pretty seriously, i thought. it turn fact ad alocal commercial bank, st. louis fed. but story incident provide humorousopening seminar next day. i nervous, get seminar good start anamusing story helped. it give momentum. and look i end up.so i consider topic homer jones lecture, i think monetarism role ofmoney. my mind quickly take back incident i take title, "does money matter?"what i mind assessment monetarism's role shape current think aboutmacroeconomic model conduct monetary policy.i often start paper work back conclusion. monetarism money, moneyplays explicit role today's consensus macro model, play virtually role conduct ofmonetary policy, least unite states. the conclusion appear be, therefore, thatmonetarism influence either macroeconomics monetary policy. that conclusion wasa problem: i want write paper homer jones lecture.i decided, therefore, take completely novel approach paper. i would postpone write theconclusion i write paper. so i invite share journey search conclusion. iwill start outline essential feature monetarism, set interpretation today'sconsensus macro model, interpret role monetarism shape consensus. whateverthe last influence monetarism, journey still find explicit role money theconsensus model little explicit role current practice monetary policy, least theunited states. this lead explore whether current model current practice undervalue therole money.i.money monetarismin view, monetarism several essential features. first foremost, monetarism thereincarnation classical macroeconomics, focus long-run property economy asopposed short-run dynamics.classical macroeconomics emphasize several key long-run property economy, include theneutrality money quantity theory money. neutrality hold equilibrium value realvariables – include level output – independent level money supply longrun. superneutrality hold real variable – include rate growth output – areindependent rate growth money supply long run. the quantity theory moneyholds price move proportionately change money supply inflation link 2bis review 25/2001money growth. together, proposition identify monetary policy achieve whatit cannot therefore delineate responsibility central banks. they mean central bankshave effect level growth rate output long run determine rate inflationin long run.1second, monetarism focus le structure economy short-run dynamic moreon longer-run conclusions, long-run relationship money output moneyand inflation. this focus reflects, part, skepticism ability understand adequatelyquantify structural linkage dynamics. for reason, monetarist tend prefer reduced-formequations var structural equation structural econometric model focus long-run result short-run dynamics.third, monetarist skeptical ability use monetary policy short-run stabilization, despitethe fact believe short-run variation money growth affect aggregate demand henceoutput. a result, favor rules, often passive rules, focus achieve rate moneygrowth consistent price stability long run, adjustment cushion short-runfluctuations aggregate demand.2 this preference reflect uncertainty structureof economy short-run dynamic long variable lag response ofaggregate demand change money supply.there over-riding theme across feature monetarism: they focus role moneyand conclusion "money matters." money matter – indeed matter – forinflation long run. give widespread commitment price stability, monetarist believe thatcentral bank therefore give appropriate attention money growth conduct monetarypolicy.ii.the consensus macro model: monetarism without money?one way judge influence monetarism conformity today's consensus macro modelwith monetarism's central features, set above.one favorite say economist is, "two economists, three opinions." that say ismore true macroeconomist microeconomists. for reason define consensus macromodel always challenge. but i believe convergence toward aconsensus recent years. this consensus typically express term simple three-equationdynamic model:3(1) ygt = ygt-1 + b et(ygt+1) - c [rt -et(pt+1)] + xt(2) pt = (ygt) + w1 pt-1 + w2 et(pt+1) + zt, w1 + w2 = 1(3) rt = r* + et(pt+1) + f yg t-1 + g (pt-1 - pt),where yg equal output gap (the percentage point difference actual potential output),r equal nominal interest rate, r* equal equilibrium real interest rate, p equal inflation, pt equalsinflation target, x z stochastic shocks, coefficient positive.the model include aggregate demand equation, phillips curve, monetary policy rule. theaggregate demand equation, give equation 1, essentially dynamic version old be curve,in level output (in case output gap) depend real interest rate. thisspecification allow effect lag output expectation future output. the phillipscurve, give equation 2, relate inflation rate output gap (measuring balance betweensupply demand output market) past inflation inflation expectations. theeffect past inflation capture role sticky prices, inflation expectation assume 1superneutrality controversial neutrality. indeed, fundamental justification price stability objective thatinflation undermine efficiency economy perhaps distort save investment choices. what essential isthat monetary policy cannot raise level growth rate output increase rate money growth.2many monetarist come believe short-run variation money growth significant effect real variable theshort run. the important effect variation money growth short-run economic activity demonstrate inempirical research conduct federal reserve bank st. louis, notably andersen jordan (1968) byandersen carlson (1970). but skepticism ability harness effect use stabilization policy remained.still, hafer wheelock (2001) noted, temptation, always resisted, use short-runrelationship prescribe monetarist strategy stabilization policy.3see, example, fuhrer moore (1995), clarida, gali, gertler (1999), mccallum (2000). bi review 25/20013set, equation 1, accord rational expectations. the policy rule, equation 3, relate theinterest rate, view instrument monetary policy, output gap differencebetween inflation central bank's inflation target. that is, policy adjust response thedeviations output inflation respective objective – full employment price stability.4there least three innovation consensus model compare is-lm framework,perhaps yesterday's consensus model. first, is-lm model two equation three unknownsand therefore could solve assume either price level output level fixed.today's consensus model allow sticky price short run full price flexibility thelong run introduce phillips curve. in effect, phillips curve pin degree whichprices sticky short run, allow scope short-run movement actual output relativeto potential stabilization policy provide mechanism ensure transition thelong-run classical equilibrium.second, today's consensus model replace lm equation policy rule. the lm curveexpresses equilibrium condition money market, balance supply thedemand money. implicitly, money supply treat instrument monetary policy. thepolicy rule today's consensus model specify way policymakers adjust interest rate toeconomic developments. this specification advantage accurately capture theprevailing operate procedure central bank around world, give they, almost withoutexception, implement monetary policy set target key interest rate. it also reflect amore modern view "policy" systematic adjustment policy instrument instrument toongoing economic development rather simply exogenous process, outside model.third, model explicitly incorporate forward-looking element economic behavior accountsfor importance expectations. in eclectic form present here, model allow bothforward-looking element lag adjustment due, example, adjustment costs.the consensus model widely use teach macroeconomics policy analysis, specificallyin evaluate property alternative policy rules. larger-scale macro model use policyanalysis forecast typically rich structures, include richly define set ofmonetary policy channels. this set generally include range interest rate asset price andthe exchange rate, almost never direct independent role money. this true frb-usmodel use staff board governor policy analysis forecasting. that model hasa structure much consistent simple consensus model aggregate demand andinflation equations, example, mix lag adjustment forward-lookingexpectations interest rate determination anchor policy rule.so influence monetarism today's consensus model? on one hand, model hasno apparent role money. on surface, therefore, today's consensus model appear clearand definitive rejection "money matters" focus monetarism. on hand, classicalproperties i outline hold model (at least redefine term "monetary policy" ratherthan "money supply"). monetary policy affect level growth rate potential output,and inflation determine monetary policy converge target set central bank inthe policy rule.my conclusion, therefore, still clearly see influence monetarism consensusmodel. monetarism focus attention role central bank determine inflation byemphasizing relation money inflation. the consensus model may bypass money, butit retain key conclusion central bank ultimately determine inflation rate.the relation money, output, inflation obviously beneath surface model. wecould bring surface simply append yesterday's lm curve today's consensus model.this provide fourth equation fourth variable, money supply. the lm curve, however, isnot part simultaneous structure expand model. the first three equation determineoutput, interest rate, inflation without call upon lm curve. all lm curve isdetermine level nominal money supply consistent solution output, prices, 4the effect supply demand shock evolution real economic activity clear specification. in thesimple specification i used, effect supply shock hide measure potential output, part outputgap variable, shock term phillips curve. the last several year heighten appreciation shock tothe level potential output (arising, example, change non-accelerating inflation rate unemployment) tothe growth rate potential output (arising shock structural productivity growth) play important role shapingshort-run well long-run movement real economic activity. 4bis review 25/2001interest rate. in effect, lm curve identify amount money central bank find ithas supply follow policy rule, give shock economy. so money supplyhas become le interesting, minor endogenous variable story.this approach not, however, inconsistent stable empirical relation money growthand economic variables, specifically money growth inflation. in fact, moneydemand equation (underlying lm curve) stable, stable relationship betweenmoney inflation long run.the expand model also make clear nothing inconsistent stable long-runrelationship money inflation, emphasize monetarists, expectations-augmented phillips curve, mainstay keynesian-type structural model well part today'sconsensus macro model. the monetarist proposition outcome, result. this conclusionabout long-run relationship money price implicit consensus model, providedthe money demand equation stable. the consensus structural model also structure orprocess. it explain monetary stimulus raise inflation.the consensus model remain consistent relationship money growth inflation, butit appear downgrade role money. but shortchange role money? in search foranswers, i focus monetary policy japan differ role money conduct ofmonetary policy european central bank federal reserve.iii.the monetization debate: doe consensus model shortchange role money?in japan, policy interest rate take zero remain close zero. zero logical lowerbound nominal rate because, interest rate negative, everyone would prefer holdcash would demand bonds. but even short-term policy rate nearly zero,the japanese economy remain weak, case make additional monetary stimulus.however, accord consensus model, policy rate take zero, central bankhas exhaust ability stimulate economy.monetarists, among others, reject conclusion. they argue japan embark strategyof monetization, quantitative easing, judge stimulus policy term rate ofgrowth money supply, level policy rate. the bank japan recently take astep direction monetization strategy.there two path conclusion strategy allow monetary policy provideadditional stimulus, even policy rate drive zero. first, monetarist argue thatmoney directly affect aggregate demand. that is, be curve consensus model mispecifiedbecause allow interest-rate channel influence direct effect money onspending. plug money supply additional determinant aggregate demand and, presto,monetization works! second, even money directly affect aggregate demand, thetransmission mechanism certainly complicate simple be curve specificationsuggests. money could play role structural equation aggregate demand, vars, aproxy channel may difficult quantify simply leave out.personally, i believe direct effect money aggregate demand. but i may bebiased. my view base part research. i test reject hypothesis adirect effect dissertation. in dissertation i also test proxy role hypothesis rejectedit, too. but, proxy role money deserve attention.5when lead monetarists, milton friedman, discuss transmission mechanism,they describe monetary policy operate broad range interest rate assetprices.6 a i note earlier, large-scale structural model also incorporate much detailedtreatment monetary policy channel monetary policy – include range after-tax real 5large-scale model allow well-known real balance effect. increase real money balance raise real valueof net worth operate wealth effect models. however, open market operation involve exchange ofmoney bond therefore directly alter household wealth. mccallum (2000) svensson (2001) discussconditions money could directly affect aggregate demand. svensson summarize condition follows: "[a]direct money effect would arise real balance enter representative agent's utility function utility function wasnot additively separable consumption real balance positive cross derivative." svensson mccallumagree that, reasonable parameter values, effect likely small disregarded.6friedman meiselman (1963). bi review 25/20015interest rate also equity price real exchange rate – compare single policy ratein consensus model. the consensus model adequately summarize transmission mechanismwith single policy rate two assumptions: first, monetary policy operate change someshort-term interest rate; second, interest rate asset price linked, directly orindirectly, policy rate stable predictable arbitrage relationships.monetary policy might still life leave it, even policy rate drive zero, ifmonetary policy operation could somehow affect spread policy rate otherinterest rate – longer-term rate private rate – relationship asset prices, asequity price exchange rates.in simple theoretical models, effect possible long short-term government bond arenot perfect substitute longer-term bonds, private bonds, equities, foreign financial assets. inthis case, open market operation long-term government bond could principle low long-term government bond rate relative policy rate, spillover effect longer-term privaterates. monetary policy short-term private assets, commercial paper could lowerprivate rate relative government rate also allow central bank work around ailingbanking system. finally, open market operation involve foreign financial asset – effectivelyunsterilized intervention foreign exchange market – could, principle, affect exchange rates.however, really substantive difference sterilize unsterilized operation whenthe short-term interest rate already zero.one way open market operation asset might affect rate asset priceswould relative asset-supply effect determine longer-term private rate andexchange rates. for example, relative supply short- longer-term government bondsaffected relative yields, open market purchase long-term bond could low long-term ratesrelative already near-zero short-term rate. whether relative supply effect aresignificant empirical question. the traditional answer effects, thoughpossible, negligible and, effectively, useful part monetary policy. and even monetizationcould push long-term rate zero, guarantee provide enough stimulus, give theprevailing deflation. the real bond rate could still high.this proxy role money could, principle, cover channel besides long-term government andprivate interest rate asset price – liquidity credit effect – might activate byincreases money supply. in case, even additional conventional operation – open marketoperations treasury bill – might stimulate aggregate demand, even could lowerthe short-term nominal interest rate. however, affect seem plausible. for example,would increase liquidity hold money versus short-term bill stimulate aggregate demand? ifeconomic agent want additional liquidity could acquire hold cost byselling zero-interest-rate bill acquire cash. why, central bank initiate change,would affect spending, interest rate asset price affected?bernanke gertler emphasize credit channel part transmission mechanism.7 butthis channel – though amplify effect monetary policy – seem require change ininterest rates. for example, decline interest rate would, accord bernanke gertler,reduce exist commit cash flow borrower therefore make borrower morecreditworthy. this, turn, could result lender offer additional credit. however, interest rate donot decline channel activated.8finally, proxy role money could include effect monetization expectations. this channeldepends ability policymakers alter expectation course effect futurepolicy. that is, policy effect derive high money supply today aperceived commitment high money stock future.expectation effect could alter current long-term real interest rate two ways. first, convince thepublic monetary policy remain stimulative long low expect future nominal short-terminterest rate therefore longer-term nominal interest rates.9 second, convince public thatmonetary policy achieve high inflation rate future, least average, could low 7bernanke gertler (1995).8clouse et al. (2000).9i assume standard expectation theory term structure interest rate constant risk premiums. long-terminterest rate are, case, average current expect future short-term interest rates. 6bis review 25/2001expected current longer-term real interest rates, reinforce effect expect long-term interestrates perceive commitment give path nominal policy rate.these effect illustrate term simple model two-period (non-overlapping) pricecontracts. the current expect future one-period nominal interest rate determine currentnominal interest rate two-period bond. assume current one-period interest rate (thepolicy rate) drive zero public expect positive rate one-period bond nextperiod. if policymakers convince public policymakers drive one-period rate zeroin period two, interest rate two-period bond fall first period, stimulate aggregatedemand.the first channel thus operate low expect future nominal policy rate, thereby loweringcurrent longer-term nominal interest rates. essentially, try low nominal rate along theterm structure, short-term policy rate drive zero. it depend credibility ofthe policy authority pre-commit stimulative policy future – example, maintainthe zero rate policy long period anticipated.the second way expectation affect current real long-term interest rate involve theeffect policy inflation expectations. in order effect work, policymakers must firstconvince public policymakers maintain give path short-term nominal policy rate;thus second effect build upon reinforce first effect. the second effect, convince thepublic inflation high future, convert perceive commitment give path forthe short-term nominal policy rate decline future expect short-term real interest rate andhence current expect longer-term real interest rates.note sufficient policymakers convince public inflation high thanotherwise while, indefinitely. this important, give promise maintain inflationhigher indefinitely might neither necessary credible. one way activate inflation-expectations effect stimulate aggregate demand short run, without compromise longer-run inflation objective, would implement target price level. the central bank would promise, forexample, target price predetermine constant level, would indicate advance periodover would attempt return price-level target. if deflation follows, price-level targetimplies central bank target rise price – inflation – order return theprice level target level. the long deflation lasts, high long last expect futureinflation. once high inflation restore initial price level, objective would price stabilityand, hence, zero inflation. a similar motivation underlie call bank japan adopt aninflation-targeting strategy.10 that is, announce explicit inflation target, bank japanmight raise expectation future inflation therefore low real long-term interest rate today.on one hand, simply undertake monetization operation without effectively communicate theintention respect future policy might effective. on hand, simply announce aninflation target without carry operation today might support objective also might beeffective. however, – carry monetization operation support inflation target –could possibly activate expectation effect.the relative supply effect likely small relevant conduct monetary policyin normal periods. this channel, therefore, perhaps interest nominal interest ratehas drive zero, policy stimulus desired, size policyoperations could much large normal times. however, expectation channel – effectof expectation future monetary policy long-term real interest rate hence aggregatedemand today – is, i believe, important part transmission mechanism normal periodsand extreme circumstances.despite uncertainty effectiveness monetization operations, may think moreseriously policy rate take zero still case furthermonetary stimulus. the problem that, possibility provide stimulus throughmonetization, likely find experiment operation margin,especially stimulus arise relative supply effects. to promise significantresults, unconventional policy operation likely would need implement boldscale. move direction understandably difficult uncertainty theeffectiveness approach. 10see, example, krugman (1998). bi review 25/20017a full consideration topic would require u ass cost operation theways cost balance cost pursue direction period persistentdeflation.11 if cost low, little damage operation ineffective. but i tryhere reach conclusion overall merit monetization. my objective use currentdebate monetary policy japan highlight channel monetary policy possible role formonetary policy zero bind leave consensus model.let sum conclusion absence role money consensus model.first, consensus model incorporate caricature consensus view determination ofoutput inflation, include transmission mechanism. in effect, treat "the" interest rate anindex overall financial conditions, assume long-term interest rates, equity prices, theexchange rate move stable predictable way change policy rate. to sure,this considerable simplification, shortcoming become apparent policyrate drive zero nominal bound.second, though consensus model shortcomings, absence money one them– except perhaps zero nominal bind case. a noted, consensus model significantlyoversimplifies transmission mechanism. it also oversimplify supply side economy –failing, particular, model complex dynamic economy's response unexpectedacceleration structural productivity growth.third, situation policy rate drive zero nominal bind – case injapan today – consensus model miss – proxy role money – become onlyremaining leverage monetary policy. interestingly, large macro model much bettereither, typically allow relative asset-supply effect often provideopportunity inflation-expectations effect might important. in case, money growthcould valuable indicator degree current intend future stimulus provide bymonetary policy.fourth, understand way monetary policy might still provide additional stimulus – oncethe nominal policy rate drive zero – may also provide u rich understand ofhow monetary policy work normal times. in particular, monetization debate highlight rolethat expectation play – normal extreme circumstance – effect monetarypolicy aggregate demand. indeed, become increasingly clear monetary policy work notonly decision policy rate take meet also expectation thatpolicymakers encourage – intentionally otherwise – expect future policy. the language inthe statement issue end fomc meet statement balance risk aswell comment fomc member meet affect expectations. thoseexpectations, turn, immediate effect longer-term interest rates, asset prices, onreal exchange rate – channel monetary policy directly incorporate

policy theunited states.12 by end decade, however, intellectual inroad proponent monetarism– include important work federal reserve bank st. louis – dissatisfaction theinflationary outcome policy procedure place, lead consideration great emphasis onmoney conduct monetary policy.the first conference well-known series federal reserve bank boston, hold june1969, title "controlling monetary

begin set short-run target money growth – two-month target set eachintermeeting period calibrate consistent policy objectives. the federal fund rate wasthen set level estimate consistent achieve money-growth target. i wason leave washington university federal reserve bank new york 1975-76 wrotefrom time time periodic staff memo set fund rate target estimate consistentwith money-growth range. however, money growth deviate short-run target, wasmore likely money-growth target reset interest rate adjusted. in addition,the target rebased meeting, past error typically ignored.in 1975, reflect part monetarist critique monetary policymaking part disappointmentwith recent macroeconomic performance, congress pass concurrent resolution encouragingthe federal reserve set target money supply. follow passage resolution, thefomc adopt first time annual target range money growth announce publicly.the full employment balance growth act 1978 require feed set, semiannually,monetary target calendar year explain deviation targets.from 1979 1982, money-growth target take even central role conduct policy.policy implement period estimate total reserve growth necessary meetthe money-growth target hold associate path nonborrowed reserves. in theprocess, federal fund rate free move whatever level would consistent themoney-growth objective time. monetary policy focus steadily reduce inflation, andpolicymakers le certain increase nominal real interest rate would berequired achieve objective reduce inflation money-inflationrelationship. moreover, serve interest policymakers emphasize markets, notpolicymakers, control interest rate along way.at outset, money-growth range interpret intermediate objectives, ultimateobjective reduce inflation. the 1979 monetary policy report describe policy "thegradual reduction rate increase monetary aggregate order curb inflation." the initialranges money growth high reflect prevail inflation rate graduallylowered time.initially, growth target set m1, m2, bank credit, although emphasis m1measure. but downward shift velocity m1, associate introduction nationwidenow account innovations, fomc downplay m1 target late 1982 shiftedemphasis m2 m3.with deregulation innovation make velocity le predictable, late 1982 fomc also begana gradual return toward interest-rate operate strategy. the monetary aggregate target weredescribed "set aim slow expansion money time rate consistentwith economy's productive potential reasonably stable prices." money-growth target wereevolving toward point would consistent fomc's price-stability

reluctance reflect thediminished confidence policymakers signal deviation result unexpectedjump continue volatility velocity. second, new approach good tune lowerand stable inflation rate mid-1990s. previously, money-growth range graduallylowered signal intent low inflation consistent gradual decline inflation. thefixed range set mid-1990s consistent price stability, objective reach.money ecb two-pillar strategythe maastrich treaty identify price stability override objective ecb. like feed andother central banks, ecb choose implement policy set target short-terminterest rate. but ecb also give prominent role money supply feed doestoday.13the ecb set two-pillar strategy guide adjustment interest rate pursuit pricestability.14 the first pillar reference value money growth. the ecb set

would help policymakers adjust stance monetary policy. but light stablelonger-term relationship, continue deviation would raise significant question should, theleast, require careful reassessment

consistency monetary policy fomc's medium-terminflation objective. on hand, move direction would require significant changesin conduct policy. the fomc – presumably consultation congress – would toestablish explicit inflation target would reveal estimate rate growth inpotential output. this direction would even significant step set referencevalue money growth. an intermediate approach might set reference value base implicitassumptions target inflation rate rate growth potential output – withoutexplicitly identify either. this would similar benchmark range set m2 thelast year benchmark range monetary aggregate abandoned.a money growth reference value consensus modelbut would monitor money growth useful, long policymakers follow disciplinedpolicy adjust policy rate ongoing economic developments, reflect policy rule inthe consensus model? it well know hold nominal interest rate fix face ofaggregate demand shock lead monetary policy, effect, reinforce rather damp suchshocks. the fomc instruct manager system open market account hit give interestrate target. if upward pressure rate arises, example, high nominal income growth orhigher inflation expectations, manager automatically add reserve open market operationsto prevent rise fund rate target. hence, absent change stance policy, apositive demand shock automatically lead high reserve growth hence high money growth,in effect reinforce demand shock. the fast money supply growth relative referencevalue, case, would alert policymakers possibility policy stance longerconsistent objectives. policymakers would still evaluate whether more-rapid moneygrowth reflect shift money demand shock aggregate demand.however, policy rule consensus model design prevent precisely type ofpersistent error response shocks. if aggregate demand shock, effect onutilization rate inflation result adjustment policy rate time consistentwith policymakers' objective output inflation. in effect, policy rule substitute thediscipline money growth target face aggregate demand shocks.so value would reference value money growth policy fact conduct amanner consistent policy rule? first, policy rule attempt summarize systematicresponses policymakers. policymakers not, course, commit follow rule. so, havingan additional check consistency policy medium-term objective could useful whenpolicymakers choose adjust policy line policy rule. second, even rule wereadhered to, another check might useful. in particular, difficulty implement policy rule inpractice make reference value money growth valuable.if policy rule line precisely equilibrium real interest rate output gap werecalibrated correctly relative potential output, benefit monitor money growth might belimited early signal change output inflation. but recent experience, along theearlier experience 1970s, suggest uncertainty real equilibrium interest rate andabout level potential output make implement policy rule challenging. just model-based forecaster often look forecast vars, policymakers policy rule might benefitfrom second check provide money-growth reference value. this justification money-growth reference value seem consistent monetarists' skepticism structural models.an operational reference value m2 growthlet set possible approach implement reference value money growth federalreserve. a simple point departure famous quantity theory equation, m v = p y, m isthe money supply, v velocity, p price level, y level output. this rewritten,in term growth rates, + v = p + y, lowercase letter growth rate m, v, p, andy

differential among alternative measure ofinflation.finally, consider whether adjust m2 reference value systematic trend v2 velocity isappropriate. before velocity shift early 1990s, seem long-standing, small,but positive, trend v2. the pattern long clear. of course, velocity shift early 1990swas, least beginning, unexpected unexplainable. for reference value beinformative, adjustment shift velocity would necessary, ability detect shiftsin "real time" potential problem. at point, assume trend growth v2 zero.bringing step together, result reference value m2 growth 5 percent to5-1/2 percent, sum inflation target estimate trend growth. give uncertaintyabout input calculation, might end narrow range, oppose apoint.the next issue effectively make use reference value. the purpose referencevalue, view, read short-run deviation signal need adjustment inpolicy. the short-term variability velocity make extraction signal difficult. instead,the purpose reference value provide check

unite states. it suggest m2 growth relativeto reference value seem good lead indicator inflation 1960s 1970s.perhaps best example episode money growth provide information might havehelped avoid policy mistake late 1960s early 1970s. during late 1960s,utilization rate increase historically high levels, inflation trend upward. therewas political resistance use fiscal restraint slow economy. monetary

march 2001. * * *i please today discus capital standard community banks. this topic notreflect apparent problem current capital standard organizations. the system hasworked well supervisor community banks. with minor exceptions, continue towork well. nonetheless, issue call discussion new basel capital accordproposed mid-january well bank agencies' advance notice propose rule-makinglast october possible revision community bank capital rules.by way background, may recall original basel accord, reach 1988, designedfor large, internationally active banks. nonetheless, regulator unite state apply ituniversally domestic commercial bank bank hold companies. other country take asimilar approach.technology bank practice advance since 1988, especially large, complexbanking organizations, rule develop serious shortcomings. risk-measurement techniqueshave improved; cost generating, maintaining, analyze data declined; capitalmarkets become tightly intertwined. a result, current accord work well beforethese development prove far crude practice today, particularly practice large,complex bank organizations.supervisors industrial nation conclude need capital measure largebanks risk-sensitive compatible current market practice thecurrent accord. my focus today mean overwhelm majority u.s.banks, specifically community banks.the new basel proposal clearly apply institution supervise programdealing large, complex bank organizations. but program cover twentydomestic entity nearly 9,000 u.s. banks, almost asset exceed $40billion. the vast majority bank country neither large complex seem unlikelycandidates high-maintenance capital standard require costly extensive risk-management systems. more 98 percent u.s. commercial save banks, example,have asset le $5 billion, 95 percent asset le $1 billion.last fall, anticipation basel proposal, u.s. bank agency ask public comment onpossible alternative standard noncomplex banks, simple anything basel proposal. iwill discuss various "simpler" options--both advance proposal last fall thenew basel framework propose january. one outcome consider option may toretain current system, tweak modestly, noncomplex, non-internationally activebanks.innovations new proposalthe basel proposal represent watershed supervisory policy, redefine regulatory approachto bank supervision bank provide others new incentive improve risk-measurement procedures. let call attention important innovation thenew proposal and, time, explore whether innovation would appropriate forcommunity banks.three pillars. the basel committee's approach rest three so-called pillars: (1) new capitalstandard itself; (2) increase supervisory review banks' internal assessment capitaladequacy; (3) additional public disclosure bank risk profiles. in contrast, original baselaccord rest single pillar, regulatory minimum capital.pillars 1 2 effect distinguish two concept capital adequacy: regulatory minimum capital setby pillar 1 supervisor's evaluation banks' internal calculation economic capital 2bis review 22/2001under pillar 2. by "economic" capital i mean amount capital management determine isrequired reflect risks, strategy, objective individual bank, regardless regulatorystructure. the regulatory minimum, effect, provide threshold early intervention supervisors.the procedure assumption embed internal measure economic capital drivebusiness decision bank permit management gauge capital cost of, betterestablish price for, credit vary degree risk. use pillar 2, supervisor would plan toevaluate internal capital- allocation process integrity economic sense, ensure thatthe underlie process assumption use measure economic capital reasonable andconsistent principle pillar 1. finally, pillar 3 look market discipline supplement andreinforce effectiveness pillar 1 2 discipline risk-taking bank organizations.in principle, three-pillar approach apply community bank well lcbos. in practice,however, relative importance detail application three pillar would clearly quitedifferent lcbos community banks. it would difficult expensive develop andmaintain risk-management infrastructure necessary evaluate customer's creditworthiness withthe precision internal quality control necessary use more-advanced capital approach inthe basel proposal. more point, virtually technique procedure seem currentlyunnecessary u.s. banks, remain unless economics nature ofcommunity bank substantially change. the scale operation community bank neitherseparate management credit decision involve complexity characterize theprocess large entities. a result, simple approach define regulatory minimum capital islikely continue work well community banks, even need move complex andmore risk-sensitive approach lcbos.in unite states, supervisory oversight--pillar 2 new proposal--has long integralpart regulatory framework, lcbos community banks. for set institutions,supervision evolve formal, risk-focused approach, exam increasinglyemphasizing adequacy internal process controls.since long risk-focused approach formalized, however, examiner rat abank's capital base assessment risk institution. for example, bank statedcapital ratio well excess minimum requirements--or excess "well capitalized" thresholdunder today's standard--may still assign less-than-satisfactory rat capital componentof camel rat if, opinion supervisor, risk institution warrant arating. in 1991, passage federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act, thecongress formally recognize role supervisory oversight assess capital adequacy banksin relation risk, permit federal bank regulator reclassify bank's capital category undercertain conditions. thus, example, federal bank regulator may reclassify "well capitalized" bankto "adequately capitalized" category bank unsafe unsound condition fail tocorrect unsafe unsound practices. the supervisory oversight capital adequacy, sure, ismore intense continuous case large, complex institutions, calledpillar 2 long been, continue be, integral part framework community banks.market discipline (pillar 3), however, may particularly problematic community banks, since suchinstitutions often closely hold rigorously continuously evaluate market analystsand investors. even trade regional basis, depth trade likely beinadequate provide timely signal supervisor discipline management. so, though pillar 3is irrelevant community banks, unlikely effective large, complex banks.multilayered approach. a i noted, propose basel capital standard highly complex, butfor good reason. the proposal contain overlap option offer several approach toaccommodate bank vary resources, expertise, risk profiles. the question whether thedifferentiation go far enough u.s. bank structure.the basic approach propose accord so-called standardize method. thestandardized approach conceptually current capital accord, risk-sensitivein respects. under basel approaches, bank, now, would allocate risk-weight toeach asset off-balance-sheet position calculate sum risk-weighted assetvalues. the capital requirement remain 8 percent institution's risk-weighted assets. theprimary change, standardize approach, would base asset risk-weights forexposures sovereigns, banks, corporation borrower's external credit ratings,when possible. the proposal would also give recognition bank's effort mitigate riskthrough guarantees, collateral, credit derivatives, net agreements. bi review 22/20013those change may attractive many institutions; however, clear focus new baselproposal base regulatory capital requirement bank's internal credit ratings, theso-called internal rat base irb approach. there two variant irb approach: the"foundation" "advanced" options. both design bank resource expertiseto build maintain sophisticate risk-management system current capitalstandard seriously mismeasures risk.the difference two irb method foundation approach design bankswith system permit full reliance internal risk estimate calculate capitalrequirements. under foundation approach, miss risk parameter would supply thesupervisor would set conservatively. if bank believe conservative estimate areinappropriate large, invest research system prove point pursuethe advance irb approach. bank use advance approach would freedom, theirmethodologies would first closely review approve supervisor.this multilayered structure offer flexible approach could apply wide group banks, notjust large, internationally active banks. the key question u.s. community bank theirregulators whether option new basel proposal--especially standardizedapproach--is good match community banks. another question whether competitive pressureswould provide incentives--perhaps overwhelm incentives--for community bank pursue irbapproach. would allocation resource community bank supervisor desirableand efficient? finally, one basel alternatives, capital standard would mostappropriate community bank unite states?comprehensive treatment risk. although originally portray deal credit risk, thestandard covers, effect, virtually bank risk experience-based, unscientific,capital charge 8 percent. that is, although current standard structure basis creditrisk alone, level set high warrant credit risk, effect incorporate "buffer"that could use cover "other risks."as get precise measure credit risk, lose buff previously build thestandard cover operational risks. explicitly implicitly, need make judgmentsregarding respective correlation different risks. be additive independent, whatdegree one other? can capital cover them, bank need capital foreach one? but question whether current approach, le precise measurementof credit risk buff risks, work well enough community bank beleft is.the bifurcation alternative: interagency advance notice propose rulemakingas i mentioned, community bank unite state have, besides new basel proposal,another capital proposal consider. i refer advance notice propose rulemakingissued last october u.s. bank thrift agency explore alternative simplifyingthe capital standard noncomplex, non-internationally active u.s. depository institutions. this theso-called bifurcate approach. the advance proposal suggest three possible way structure acapital standard non-complex bank organizations. the first option would combine risk-basedratio leverage ratio. this option would retain much current approach tailor capitalcharges size, structure, risk profile less- complex bank organizations. the secondoption would use leverage ratio. take approach unlike primary capital standard weused throughout 1980s, would drop semblance risk-weighted measure base abank's capital requirement ratio capital total assets. the third alternative simplya modify leverage ratio would add exposure arise loan commitment off-balance-sheet transaction total bank assets.reflecting early stage development, proposal present question answer anddoes flesh three alternative presents. one important question relate hownoncomplex institution would defined. the proposal suggest base decision bank'sasset size, nature activities, risk profile--for example, asset le $5 billion,moderate amount off-balance-sheet transaction mostly loan commitments, focuson traditional bank activities. in effect, size threshold would determine factor mostbanks, permit hundred nearly 9,000 federally insure commercial save 4bis review 22/2001banks calculate capital requirement use simple approach. almost thrift well wouldlikely qualify simple approach.this seem proper time consider simple approach community bank weundertake major revision basel accord. however, consistent spirit basel, theagencies propose simple system also conservative, require least aslightly high minimum capital charge. such high minimum would still, however, theactual (or economic) capital maintain virtually community banks.the high capital ratio maintain small bank reflect certain economic realities. thesebanks generally carry great risk large bank great concentration inexposures fund sources, byproduct limit geographic scope scale. in addition,because limit access capital markets, community bank few option foraugmenting capital needed. the high capital ratio community banks, compensate forthese great risks, result much bank managers' tolerance risk market expectation forbanks' capital influence bank supervisors. bank management, market, thesupervisors understand current capital standard set minimum capital requirements, theeconomic level require prudent operations.for reasons, community bank consistently maintain high capital ratio largerbanks since long regulatory capital standard implemented. at end 2000, forexample, bank total asset le $1 billion average tier 1 leverage ratio almost10 percent average total risk-based capital ratio almost 15 percent--both double theminimum standard. in contrast, bank asset great $10 billion average ratio about7 11.5 percent, respectively. these often large difference extend back far data areavailable.despite capital ratio typically well minimum regulator would require,community bank appear little interest advance proposal noncomplex banks. in thesmall number comment letter received, community bank express clearpreference gain simple regulatory capital measure exchange potentially higherminimum capital requirements--requirements still well economic maintain capital. thegains simplicity apparently view offset cost change current setof rule purportedly simple system. the intent proposal, way, reduceregulatory burden small bank ensure capital remain prudent levels.key questionsi hope comment clarify new basel interagency proposal raise someimportant question appropriate capital standard u.s. community banks. if communitybanks want shape outcome, must convey view several key questions.who standard? a crucial question consider bank type ofbanks pursue alternative capital standards. clearly, almost truly globalinstitutions, worldwide, would expect use irb approach, move theadvanced approach, outset. most large bank organizations, suchas large u.s. regional banks, also likely pursue approach, least eventually.supervisory market pressures, alone, would presumably force global large regional banksin direction. give systemic risk pose implication sheer complexity many ourlargest institutions, supervisor worldwide least urge firm direction.however, standard design calibrate properly, incentive include acarrot stick. institution meet demand risk-management public-disclosurestandards require irb approach deserve consideration form regulatoryminimum capital charge accurately reflect underlie risks. the irb banks' risk-measurement management process strengthened, capital market moreinformation judge risk arguably assert discipline, risk appear rise. thekey align incentives--capital charge costs--just right ensure, largely thesupervisory process, require operate standard met.is standardize approach good fit community banks? perhaps large questionrelates alternative community small regional bank choose. most them, isuspect, would opt standardize approach, still-simpler method, suggest bi review 22/20015bifurcated approach proposal last fall. or, noted, many might prefer exist rule inorder avoid transition costs. of course, transition cost balance resultantregulatory burden capital charges. if, example, incentive bank move more-advanced standard exceptionally attractive, large number community regional banksmay choose bear costs. my judgment case communitybanks. from supervisors' point view, incentive move more-advanced approachesshould commensurate identify risk materially disrupt term ofcompetition.although alternative specifically highlighted, remain current capitalstandard reasonable option consider community banks? the standardize approach isonly modest change current system, many change relevant tocommunity banks. community banks, example, presumably many externally ratedcredits, generally lend foreign governments. doe make sense require tochange system compatible standardize approach, result costs, whenthe benefit may minimal?one possible solution may think current system one simple regime fornoncomplex banks--that is, simple new basel options. this would allow community bank toremain today's system regulatory capital minimum.would current system need tweak minimize competitive pressures? i heardsome community banker say competitive pressure would force follow large bank anirb standard. that certainly intent, i convince result inevitable. if is, weneed look closely well incentive balanced.the respondent interagency advance proposal noncomplex bank suggest somerevisions current standard. specifically, suggest reduce requirement certain assets,such low loan-to-value mortgage certain collateralize consumer loans. in cases, theyclaimed, much le capital need required, supervisor would probably agree.the difficulty respondent also suggest exposures, turn, get highercapital requirements, high-risk exposure could easily objectively identify incommunity banks. simply cherry-picking bank's best asset receive low requirement notworkable. indeed, since supervisor believe overall capital requirement excessive,you expect offer low risk-weights low-risk asset without also accept higherrisk-weights high risk activities. at least, might mean high risk-weight--possiblyfar high basis historical record--for classify assets. it could also mean high risk-weight subprime generally risky loans.conclusionin closing, i would emphasize current standard appear work well communitybanks. a change regulation, appropriate cost-benefit analysis must undertaken.that is, benefit new standard outweigh add cost increase incomplexity well one-time cost adjust new system? the propose basel accordappears well design remedy deficiency current standard large, complexbanking organizations. the u.s. bank agencies, however, give careful think towhether option basel proposal good fit u.s. community banks. if arenot, need consider simple standard would appropriate. that rationale forthe advance notice propose rulemaking. remain current standard (with without someminor modifications) option need consider community banks. and need hearyour views. bi

strength late theyear.as i mention earlier, u economic slowdown already begin exert negativeinfluence japan’s economy variety channel include indirect impact involvingeconomic slowdown east asian country closely link u economy. in japan,production growth slow influence decrease exports. if lead decline incorporate profit reduction business spending, momentum economic recoverystemming business sector put great risk before. therefore, need toexamine carefully ongoing production, profits, investment plan time.there another downside risk japan’s economy, i.e., capital market home abroad,especially stock price development impact. weakness japanese stock price beenparticularly pronounce recent months. nikkei stock average renew low record thepost-bubble period begin 1990 although one must make allowance technical changesin index april 2000. it mean easy identify cause weak stock pricedevelopments, seem influence u stock market adjustment alsobearish sentiment market respect japanese economic outlook. they may well areflection concern market home abroad respect delay inaddressing number structural problem japan’s economy has. the bank japan remainvigilant influence weak stock price consumer businesssentiment well corporate finance.price developmentsagainst background recent economic financial market developments, analysis pricedevelopments become issue renew interest. in recent months, variety price indices,such domestic wholesale prices, consumer prices, corporate service prices, beenshowing small decline year year, expect weak time.these price development obviously influence supply demand elements. awide output gap remain significant improvement demand side since economy hitthe bottom two year ago. because economic growth decelerate present, aconcern downward pressure price stem weak demand might intensify comingmonths. on supply side, variety element work, e.g., technological innovation, increasein efficiency distribution system, deregulation, exert downward pressure onprices. take domestic wholesale price example. decline price electric equipment andother machine pronounce influence rapid technologicalinnovation. for another example, decline consumer price account large partby import import competitive goods, e.g., clothing. bi review 20/20013let hasten add say bank japan never argue so-called “good pricedeclines.” instead, bank repeatedly say present price development underthe complex influence demand supply elements, therefore, one afford tounderstand basis movement price index alone whether ongoing price developmentsare consistent sound development economy. the issue utmost importance whetherthe current weak price invite decline corporate profit and/or income workers, lead adeflationary spiral, vicious cycle economic recession price declines. the bank japan ofthe view japan’s economy far avoid deflationary spiral, becauseeconomic growth recently weaken i mention minute ago, economy hasentered phase warrant enhance attention price developments.3. deliberation monetary policya. improvement way liquidity provision reduction interest ratesdecisions february 9 february 28, 2001now let offer think monetary policy basis economic financialdevelopments i discussed. a well aware, bank japan decide monetarypolicy meet february 9, 2001 improvement way liquidity provide tothe market reduction official discount rate 0.15 percentage points. with respect toliquidity provision, decide upon three specific measures: introduction lombard-type standbylending facility, active use outright purchase operation short-term government securities, andpreparation bill purchase operation office bank.at monetary policy meet february 28, 2001, bank decide reduce, 0.10 percentagepoints, target level overnight call rate 0.15 percent official discount rate 0.25percent.lombard-type lend facility new role official discount rateamong policy measures, lombard-type lend facility new japan. officially, aname “supplementary lend facility.” under exist framework liquidity provision, thebank japan select counter-parties decide time well amount lending. incontrast, lombard-type lend facility entitle financial institution borrow bank ofjapan’s discount window amount want time wish, long collateral isproperly set borrow borrower meet condition pre-specified respect toeligibility collateral technical aspects. from viewpoint financial institutions, ameans fund available time.the important function supplementary lend facility perform stabilize interestrates market. under usual circumstances, overnight call rate fluctuate officialdiscount rate former rate bank japan set target level. whenend-of-fiscal year pressure mount shock arise market, e.g., steep decline stock pricesor rumor large bankruptcy, interest rate tend go market. even case, overnightmarket rate keep official discount rate financial institution able toborrow bank japan’s discount window discretion. moreover, financialinstitutions free anxiety fund capabilities, stabilize effect onlythe overnight call rate also short-term interest rate across board. this effect beenstrengthened two reduction official discount rate amount 0.25 percentagepoints february 2001.now let say word role official discount rate plays. in past, bank’sdecision official discount rate basic tool monetary policy. therefore, change thatrate announcement effect since embody change basic stance monetary policy. in1994, however, deregulation interest rate complete, institutional linkage theofficial discount rate bank deposit rate disappeared. in 1996, bank japan make clearthat bank would long use discount window lending, official discount rate wasapplied, mean monetary operations. consequently, role discount rate policyvariable play down, whereas target level overnight call rate begin assume thatrole. 4bis review 20/2001by introduction lombard-type lend facility, however, official discount rate give anew function set ceiling call rate thereby ensure stability short-term interest ratesin market. the bank japan continue guide call rate intend level dailymarket operations, time begin use new function discount rate ameans supplement effect market operations.timely flexible implementation monetary policyhaving explain policy decision make two monetary policy meet february 2001,allow elaborate background. first all, take policy measure thebasis understand economic financial development present future. a isaid minute ago, economic recovery weaken japan uncertainty economicprospects intensify influence overseas economic slowdown decline stockprices. in part money capital markets, certain degree instability, reflectingconcerns future. under circumstances, decide policy measure viewto ensure smooth function stability financial market well strengtheningmonetary support economic recovery. subsequently, overnight call rate alsointerest rate long maturities, e.g., mature beyond fiscal year end even long-terminterest rates, decline considerable degree.another point i would like emphasize fact bank japan continue conductmonetary policy timely flexible manner, view change economic conditions. a i saidearlier, japan’s economic recovery decelerate background suddenslowdown u economic growth elements. in light developments, believe wehave take appropriate policy action timely manner, continue future. atthe time, bank japan hope policy measure take february 2001 willcontribute autonomous economic recovery lead private demand.b. monetary policy stance futurenow let leave aside discussion series policy measure bank japan decide infebruary take something else. there continue variety argument monetarypolicy japan. for example, sometimes hear view present monetary ease isinsufficient, therefore, bank japan resort so-called “quantitative easing” returnto zero interest rate policy. i would like explain basic think monetary policy thebasis discussion hold policy board bank japan.first all, i would like emphasize fact bank japan implement aggressivemonetary ease degree unprecedented history central bank world term ofboth interest rate volume. under influence monetary easing, short long terminterest rate keep extremely low. the bank also provide market ampleliquidity consequently, monetary base, consist money bank directly providesthe system with, show considerable growth, i come back later.a second point i would like make whether bank resort additional measuressuch “quantitative easing” hinge crucially upon conjectural analysis growth priceperformance economy. the word “quantitative easing” mean differently across people whouse term. for example, argument step outright purchase long-termgovernment bonds. the bank japan buy bond line trend growth inbanknotes circulation. this purchase amount \5 trillion per year. if bank increase itspurchase dramatically, would positive effect time might beaccompanied negative side effects. therefore, careful examination positive effect andside effect must place policy implemented. the possible effect step upbond purchase include decline long-term interest rate rise expect rate inflation. inlight serious budget situation today, however, possibility bold measure woulddamage credibility fiscal discipline turn raise long-term interest rate cannot rule out.a policy induce massive depreciation yen’s exchange rate another drastic,unconventional policy. in present legal framework, ministry finance theauthority exchange market intervention. leave issue aside, uncertain effectiveofficial intervention affect exchange rates. neither certain cope terms-of-trade loss stem rise import price adverse influence asian economies. bi review 20/20015after all, bank embark unconventional policy like one categorize quantitativeeasing zero interest rate policy, judge condition economy priceswarrant policies. in regard, bank japan continue examine analyze thesituation full force basis seek appropriate policy centralbank take.a third point i would like emphasize face reality past decadeboth monetary fiscal policy ease dramatically yet fail meet withrobust economic growth. there reason it.let mention three number here. during past five year monetary base expand anannual rate 7.3 percent, money stock 3.3 percent, nominal gdp 0.4 percent. incontrast 1970s 1980s, three indicator grow pari passu, large differencesexist recent years.the difference growth rate monetary base money stock interpretedin following. the monetary base consist banknote current deposit bank andother financial intermediary hold bank japan. a textbook monetary economics tell youthat bank japan supply monetary base, basis bank extend credit themonetary base create multiple increase money stock. in course discussion aboutmonetary policy present, argument sometimes make monetary base inshortage. a i point minute ago, monetary base expand relatively highrate. despite this, however, money stock fail increase much. it mainly credit extension offinancial institution money stock supplied, bank lending, constitutesthe core credit extension, decrease annual rate 1.4 percent past five years.in contrast, bank hold government bond expand remarkable rate 15.7 percent. inother words, financial intermediation take place period way government bondissues increased, finance government expenditure, channel money circulate agreater extent.there another discrepancy, i.e., money stock nominal gdp. the money stock grow amodest rate 3.3 percent per annum. this amount much \20 trillion every year, nominalgdp stay virtually unchanged notwithstanding. in sum, despite relatively ample supply monetarybase, economic growth remain lackluster.all suggest significance structural obstacle japan’s economy, e.g., problem thefinancial system, flip side coin, corporate restructuring. resolution problemswill prepare foundation effectiveness monetary policy enhanced. i plan tocome back issue close remark today conjunction topic non-performingassets.c. price stability monetary policyallow turn another topic: relationship price stability monetary policy. i hearoften nothing monetary policy prevent deflation well inflation. indeed, thebank japan law stipulate bank’s purpose maintenance price stability, thebank fact conduct monetary policy accordance idea. in term practicalimplementation monetary policy, however, relationship objective price stabilityand monetary policy somewhat complex.this complexity mention report bank japan publish last year respect toprice stability. for one thing, relationship differs, depend length time envisionabout price stability. for example, long period, say ten twenty years, excess supply ofmoney many case correspond rise price short supply price declines. this isquite natural light fact price rate exchange goods/services andmoney. base long-term relationship price money, price fluctuation referredto essentially monetary phenomenon price stability consider objective ofmonetary policy.during short period, say month years, however, price fluctuation influencedby money also variety variables. output gap whole economy, inflationexpectation, international commodity prices, exchange rate interrelate complex fashion. insuch complex world, easy task decide precisely monetary policy control prices, 6bis review 20/2001and also far do. suppose oil price shock give rise inflation pressures. if areto contain short period, take tight monetary policy. the upshot may steepdecline economic activity. this inconsistent sustainable price stability long run.conversely, time price decline account productivity gain base rapidtechnological innovation, forceful reduction interest rate view raise price may amplifyeconomic swings.i firmly believe monetary policy important determinant ultimately influence pricedevelopments, order fulfill responsibility long run, must first analyze onlysuperficial movement price index also variety underlie developments, see theongoing price development consistent sustainable economic growth. i believe isindeed bank japan law mean clause bank’s currency monetarycontrol shall aim at, "through pursuit price stability, contribute sound developmentof national economy."4. conclude remarkshaving discuss monetary policy issues, allow close speech today touch onstructural problem japan’s economy. in view, effort enhance productivity address thesupply side structure economy essential japan’s economy achieve strong growth. thefact u uk economy revive strongly 1990s attribute efforts. fromthis viewpoint, utmost importance japan speed reform basis commonunderstanding follow issues.first, economic growth stem innovative strength private sector. creativity andknowledge private sector key bring economy maximum potential. excessivedependence public sector answer.second, strength private sector materialize market mechanism function fully.productivity private sector improve resource capital labor reallocatedand reposition business area high growth potential, efficiency, profitability andthat otherwise. this process go efficiently market mechanism.third, reform inevitably accompany certain degree pains. in course structuralreform, negative influence may arise economy, albeit temporarily, e.g., corporate bankruptciesand restructuring. opportunity must accord firm worker defeatedamidst structural reform make new attempt area take advantage oftheir competitiveness.there variety view respect specific form reform, today i would like say fewwords idea i always turn mind.the first issue concern resolution non-performing asset banks. during past three yearsof term governor bank japan, chairman greenspan federal reserve othereminent people international circle say s&l problem bankingcrises unite states, learn lesson importance remove non-performing asset balance sheet banks. on japan’s side, too, maintain thatmere provision non-performing asset would solve problem essential toremove balance sheet. during past several years, aggregate non-performingassets remain virtually unchanged magnitude \30 trillion. this regrettable fact. underthese circumstances, minister financial services, mr. yanagisawa express view thatbanks step write off. we opinion. i consider remark bothappropriate timely.i believe increase write facilitate structural reform. to promote write off, somespecific means. for example, company split good bad parts, bad part, non-performing part write off. loan sale market also enhanced. it hop suchspecific action announce put practice soon. at time, i strongly hope thatmanagement bank determine embark enhance write off. a asset classifiedunder category “special mention,” importance sufficient provision cannot over-emphasized.while step write contribute resolution non-performing problem, mightaccelerate bankruptcy adverse influence employment. the bank japan bi review 20/20017prepared conduct monetary policy relieve negative impact painful friction theeconomy.the second issue i would like mention absolutely necessary invite personal sectorto stock bond market order help resolve problem banks’ non-performing asset wellas promote structural reform. at present, aggregate financial asset personal sectoramount \1,380 trillion, 54 percent hold form cash deposits.in germany shift indirect finance direct finance go successfully recentyears, result risk capital increased. between early 1990s 1998, law beenenacted three time promote financial capital markets, several reform stockmarket investment

14.6 27.3 percent japan 10.9to 10.4 percent.growth investment trust mutual fund expect happen also japan. in regard,improvements product design investment trust urgent task. in particular, wide variety ofinvestment trust market meet variety demand personal sector, thesame time sound market practice also established.furthermore, establishment investment fund contribute increase flow fund riskcapital. private investment fund ripplewood, establish shinsei bank acquire thelong term credit bank japan, lone star, buy tokyo sowa bank, equityfunds whose shareholder consist mutual funds, pension funds, university endowments. in japanmeasures promote establishment large number fund taken.if financial asset personal sector currently hold predominantly cash depositsare invest financial capital market variety channels, would, ihope, contribute ensure stability financial system prompter resolution non-performing asset problem well facilitate structural reform japan. bi review

february 2001 total interest payment amount naf.226.4million 15.6% total expenditure general government. this mean 15 years’time-span share interest payment total expenditure doubled. thisdevelopment great concern policy maker island various reasons. some ofthese reason are:• if instance government able theoretically operate public sectorwithout debt past 15 years, would generate save 200

meyer: the new basel capital proposalremarks mr laurence h. meyer, member board governor u federal reservesystem, annual washington conference institute international bankers, washington,d.c., 5 march 2001.* * *i please today speak propose new basel capital accord, whichwas issue public comment january 16th. develop implement revise capitalaccord – associate change supervisory practice – watershed bankingsupervision. it clearly affect banks' plan practice year ahead – particularly large,internationally active bank represent here. thus, important banker theregulators carefully review comment proposal. in remark today, i raisesome issue i believe particularly call attention. i urge think carefullyabout let regulator around world know views.more decade ago, basel committee bank supervision adopt current accord forseveral reasons: (1) make capital requirement sensitive risk profile among banks;(2) factor off-balance-sheet exposure assessment capital adequacy; (3) minimizedisincentives hold liquid, low-risk assets; (4) achieve great consistency supervisoryassessments bank capital adequacy throughout world.these objective underlie new proposal. let clear: the 1988 accord, current rule,has serve u well. at inception, significant step forward, reflect state risk-management technology time; also clearly reflect compromise necessary internationalagreement. but technology business practice move on, large institution thisdecade-old rule develop critical shortcomings. risk-measurement practice improved, andcapital market become tightly intertwined. assumption shortcut take currentaccord far crude, give practice today. to take one example, large, complex bankingorganizations routinely structure portfolio way arbitrage around current capitalstandard. these bank often low capital requirement little, any, reduction theiractual risk-taking. a result, report capital ratio may – often – overstate bank's truefinancial strength.thus need capital framework risk-sensitive compatible current marketpractice. absolute level capital must consistent risk order shift risk-taking eitheraway banks, also need standard good reflect relative level risk.identifying correctly measure relative risk critical avoid capital arbitrage. because thecurrent standard largely ignore relative risk different assets, encourage bank shedover-capitalized, low-risk asset retain high-risk asset capital requirement tooweak in short, increase sophistication market demand that, effective, regulatory capitalcharges need reasonably attune underlie economic risks.key innovation new proposalthe propose new capital accord far reach grind breaking. it redefine regulatoryapproach bank supervision provide new incentive bank improve theirrisk-measurement procedures. it recognition technology market practice changedand oversight function need change, too. let call attention mostimportant innovation new proposal.three pillarsas many know early 1999 proposal, basel committee's approach rest threeso-called pillars: (1) new capital standard itself; (2) increase supervisory review bank'sinternal assessment capital adequacy; (3) additional public disclosure bank risk 2bis review ??/2001profiles. the original basel accord, contrast, rest single pillar, set regulatoryminimum capital.the first two pillar propose accord distinguish two concept capital adequacy: theregulatory minimum first economic capital need institution second. theregulatory minimum provide threshold early intervention supervisors. economic capital –determined bank oversee supervisor part second pillar – amount ofcapital bank allocate internal management reason achieve desire creditratings risk premium debt. the new proposal, effect, increase emphasis thesupervisors' oversight institution's economic capital needs, refine calculation theregulatory minimum. and, course, seek obtain assistance market discipline asupplement supervisory oversight.these three pillars, i think, reflect important realities. a i note earlier, change technology andmarket practice undermine current accord large institutions. they also addedto complexity modern bank organizations, complexity already progress theincreasing scale globalization well widen range bank activities. thesefactors associate moral hazard bank supervision increase systemic risk fromscale leave supervisor choice extensive burdensome supervisoryoversight, one hand, increase reliance market discipline couple incentive-compatible regulatory supervisory framework other.that three pillar about. to sure, propose capital standard – least forlarger bank – complex current accord. but i emphasize proposal base onevolving current best risk-management practices, which, turn, represent judgment bankmanagers – supervisor – best measure manage risk give availabletechnologies. the propose accord require bank establish comprehensive risk-managementpolicies follow them. supervisory oversight design broadly test occurring.public disclosure intend harness market discipline supervisor can, fact, lessintrusive market become so. a i discus below, proposal alsoencompass element intend make regulatory capital framework responsive toimprovements time banks' risk-measurement -management capabilities.clearly, propose capital framework challenge regulator bank organizations.although committee amend accord, fully effective 1998, recognize internal measure of"value-at-risk" trade activities, effect amendment quite small compare whatwe proposing. in unite states, trade amendment affect roughly dozeninstitutions applied, course, trade activity market risk. now dealingwith complex topic go core business bank – credit risk. and we're try totackle operational risk well.within unite states, federal reserve comptroller currency have, forseveral year now, focus examination adequacy internal process controls,particularly large, complex institutions. that approach particularly consistent goal ofpillar 2. supervisor abroad look institution's ownmethods evaluate capital adequacy well method serve bank. the processwill evolutionary, continue along path already begun.at federal reserve, begin process year ago, adoption oursupervisory policy statement, sr 99-18. in letter, available web site, examinersare direct ensure institution comprehensive rigorous internal process forevaluating capital adequacy. on part, develop consistent approach thereview bank economic capital methodology dedicate staff specialists. these specialistsare expect able engage bank management assumption analyticalunderpinnings methodology use bank establish capital requirements. ourintention evaluation make evolve sound-practice standard. the art andthe science risk management economic capital determination change rapidly thatneither bank community supervisor luxury determine acceptable orbest practice adhere long. however, – perhaps many – supervisorsabroad, implement pillar 2 even great challenge significant event,potentially introduce material change role. for us, though, right approach –relying internal measure management practice banks, give bi review ??/20013more incentive invest good information system controls, and, i must emphasize, lookingclosely see process work.pillar 3 could characterize much way: another step along path u.s. institutionsand supervisors, dramatic change many practice abroad. in country, havelong benefits, discipline, disclosure practice associate large, deep, widelyanalyzed capital markets. yet, even country, financial disclosure always provide themarket sufficient information fully ass bank's risk position overall capital adequacy. atthe time, recognize limit much inform timely discipline marketscan assert, inherent difficulty measure understand bank risks. despiteall insight detail knowledge, even bank's manager supervisor bewrong surprised.market judgment never perfect, bank develop disclose good information, marketfeedback play large role. for part, bank supervisor certainly use market's help asthey deal ever-more-complex rule bank practices. indeed, believe additionaldisclosure inform market oversight essential element propose new accord.just pillar 2 represent high priority supervision, pillar 3 represent increase emphasison market discipline.multilayered approachin addition three pillars, propose capital standard multilayered, offer variety ofapproaches accommodate bank vary resources, expertise, risk profiles. the basicapproach so-called standardize method. it conceptually current capitalaccord, somewhat risk-sensitive. a bank, now, assign risk weight asset off-balance-sheet position sum risk-weighted asset values. the total capital requirementper dollar risk-weighted asset remain 8 percent. the primary difference current accordis risk weight would base borrowers' external credit ratings, available. the proposalwould also give recognition bank's effort mitigate risk guarantees, collateral,credit derivatives, net agreements.the centerpiece proposal clearly internal rat base (or "irb") approach, whichthe regulatory capital requirement would base bank's internal assessment eachborrower's credit quality. the use propose irb approach, turn, key bank's abilityto meet minimum supervisory requirement demonstrate rigor assessment. reliance onbanks' internal credit risk-measurement -management methodology perhaps single mostfar-reaching innovation new proposal.under irb approach, bank would need several core input credit facility: theprobability default (pd) borrower assign internal borrower grade; expect lossrate, give default (lgd), appropriate type exposure; expect amount exposure atdefault (ead) type exposure, reflect undrawn credit lines; maturity theexposure. those parameter bank provide need well found empirically link tothe financial strength condition borrowers, realizable value collateral risk-mitigating provision credit agreements, many factors.the basel committee design two version irb approach: le sophisticated"foundation" method flexible, also demanding, "advanced" approach.the foundation irb offer bank able meet rigorous standard associate assessmentsof borrower risk, limit ability measure transaction-specific risk, opportunity tobase capital requirement internal credit ratings. this option design banksable estimate default probabilities, yet able determine loss give default exposuresat default. in cases, estimate loss give default effective amount exposure wouldbe determine use formula set regulator, transaction would assumedmaturity three years. if bank find regulatory parameter restrictive – beconservative – may develop evidence, use it, convince supervisor accuracy,after bank could move advance approach.banks use advance approach freedom, methodology derive lossgiven default statistic effective exposure closely reviewed. in cases, supervisor willrequire rigorous analysis support estimates, whether base internal vendordata. bank need understand basis calculations, credit grade must reflect 4bis review ??/2001banks' views. of course, bank permit use internal estimate type ofexposures regulatory parameter others; all-or-nothing proposition.regardless alternative selected, regulatory risk-weighted capital ratio computed, thecase today, ratio total capital risk-weighted assets. the definition total capital isunchanged. the minimum regulatory risk-weighted capital ratio, 8 percent, also unchanged. theonly change risk weight use compute risk-weighted asset thecomprehensiveness risk included.in new proposal, denominator sum credit risk, market risk, operational risk. therisk weight credit risk significantly modified, increasingly one move standardizedto advance irb. the treatment market risk unchanged. operational risk completely newcategory. if measure credit risk decline new risk weight – especially moreadvanced approach – addition operational risk partially offset decline. notsurprisingly, focus lot attention operational risk. and, course, capital arbitrage has,in fact, shift lower-risk asset market, require capital remain bank-heldrisk-weighted asset may increase rather decrease new proposal. the effect may alsodiffer, perhaps significantly, among bank different countries, depend extent whichlow-risk asset leave bank system. remember new risk-weighted charge aredesigned risk sensitive: reduce capital charge le risky assets, relative currentcharges, increase risky assets.the expectation – depend importantly extent capital arbitrage already accomplished– that, give asset, effective risk weight would decline sophisticatedapproaches, result low total regulatory capital charge and, consequently, high reportedrisk-weighted capital ratio. at time, give different risk profiles, capital requirement almostcertainly would vary widely new risk-based capital ratio today's measure.however, bank would presumably respond change risk-based capital ratios. forexample, bank relatively low risk portfolio would find risk-weighted capital ratio rosebecause risk-weighted asset declined. it would, result, presumably either reduce itscapital increase leverage, even risk exposure. a bank low capital ratio wouldpresumably opposite: raise capital, reduce leverage, and/or reduce risk exposures.at end adjustment process, might – either competitive reason ofthe incentive prompt corrective action structure – relatively tight configuration ofrisk-weighted capital ratios, especially lcbos, risky bank would hold absolutecapital support risks. indeed, whole purpose exercise.comprehensive treatment riskalthough current accord emphasize credit risk, intend cover virtually bank risks.that is, although current capital charge initially articulate term credit risk alone, levelwas set high would warrant credit risk alone, effect allow buff thatcould use cover risks.three year ago, carve deal separately trade activity market risk. thatprocess work well lead good risk measure also spur risk-measurement effortswithin industry. it work within current capital framework largely trade activity andcapital requirement associate relatively small almost banks. take "one-off"approach trade activity materially disrupt underlie assumption integrity thecurrent rule.we luxury now. a get precise measure credit risk, lose thebuffers previously build standard cover operational risks. explicitly implicitly, wenow need make judgment regard respective correlation different risks. be additiveor independent degree? can capital cover them, bank need capitalfor one?similar issue arise risk mitigation proper treatment collateral, guarantees, otherrisk-reducing steps. though practice important measure bank's effective risk, theirvalue, principle, reflect implicitly 8 percent charge, part "on average" nature ofthe current accord. again, principle, without traditional cautionary effort bank reducerisks, 1988 current regulatory capital minimum would set high 8 percent. the bi review ??/20015difficulty, course, quantify precisely importance risk risk-mitigatingeffort, fit together.taking industry's leadwhen develop new regulatory standards, bank supervisor traditionally look first common or"best" business practice within industry serve guide. for credit risk, however, havefound though many bank begin adopt formal quantitative approach thesystems bank quite advanced, virtually bank follow best practice area ofcredit risk measurement management. this even though, i hasten add, propose irbframework draw heavily concept system develop leading-edge institutions. foronce, supervisor seem ahead – least even – curve rather behind it.the lag application reflects, i think, reality measure credit operate risk moredifficult measure market risk. in trade activity transaction mark market daily, andlong series data readily available measure rate price volatility. once developed, value-at-risk various stress-measurement technique also spread throughout industry, leastamong relevant institutions. with credit risk, find great range practice risk-measurement skills.as noted, economic capital model use bank great help structure theproposed framework show way. nonetheless, work do develop proposalmakes clear room much improvement certain business practice internaluse model output evaluate capital adequacy. give difficulty developing, maintaining, andvalidating measure credit risk, supervisor need reassurance would come fromknowing bank actually use credit risk measure regulatory reasons. beforesupervisors seriously consider use result bank measure portfoliowide credit risk – asopposed measure borrower- transaction-specific risk – bank need haveenough confidence statistic demonstrate confidence integrate risk measuresinto important part banks' business management decisions.critical issuesthe basel committee commenters need focus several critical issue worktogether refine complete capital proposal. i urge address comments.to proposal apply, bank choose among option theproposal?the original 1988 basel accord design large, internationally active banks. however, theunited state many countries, current accord apply domestic banks, largeand small. with new proposal, national regulator decide widely toapply basel capital framework.in view, great complexity new accord, least respect irb options,suggests cover narrow range banks: active pursuer ofcapital arbitrage, make – make – great advance risk measurementand management, adequacy current standard question. theneed desirability limit application especially true unite states, sucha large number relatively small le complex community banks.indeed, obvious propose standardize approach fit need smallerbanking organization engage primarily traditional bank activities. recall currentstandardized approach originally design large bank mind. the new standardizedapproach complex predecessor, i question whether add implementationburdens cost-effective traditional bank organizations, especially since neither current northe propose capital framework yet address perhaps critical risk factor smallerbanks – geographic sectoral concentration credit risk. in another talk late month i willdiscuss detail whether capital standard change communitybanks. so let focus large bank may choose among three option newproposal. 6bis review ??/2001the large sophisticate u.s. foreign bank undoubtedly strive immediately tomove irb approaches. indeed, extent operational demand foundation andadvanced irb approach view comparable – particularly light input consultingand third-party vendor – many institution may desire migrate directly advance approach soas achieve large possible reduction regulatory capital. this possibility raise veryimportant practical issue: how many bank believe must operate irb approachto remain competitive?it take considerable supervisory resource validate banks' internal methodology tomonitor compliance sound practice irb approach ongoing basis. there is,therefore, practical limit number institution – and, i would argue, country –can effectively supervise irb approaches. under proposal, attempt toprovide incentive bank migrate time standardize foundation and, then,advanced irb approaches. if competitive force encourage many bank choose irbapproaches, careful attention would pay risk weight thestandardized approach associate incentive build irb approaches.in event, i cannot emphasize enough, u.s. regulator intend establish highstandards bank permit participate irb approach ourselves, asoverseers credibility integrity irb process.does new proposal strike right balance rule discretion?as i note earlier, current proposal rebalances regulatory supervisory approach capitalmore toward oversight economic capital away disproportionate focus compliance withthe regulatory minimum. this sensible, give bank today uniformly hold capital theregulatory minimum. but key question well capital individual bank organizationsreflects risk profile risk-management capability individual entities. unfortunately,oversight bank's economic capital need measure require much great supervisoryresources, authority, expertise enforcement regulatory minimums. country without therequisite resources, authority, expertise may need tilt toward rule-based approaches, atleast transitional period supervisory methodology modify theirresources supplemented. doe mean transition regulatory minimum shouldbe high cases, pillar 1 require shoulder burden relative pillar 2?or market discipline (pillar 3) enough ensure banks' economic capital decision areappropriately disciplined? doe current set option provide sufficient flexibility meet needsof country vary supervisory capabilities?will new accord implement consistently within country across countries?this issue precisely new proposal offer great discretion banks, implicitly tosupervisors, therefore could lead great variation capital among bank countries.the issue also important unite states, since two agency supervise large, internationallyactive banks: federal reserve occ. these agency must uniformly implement newproposal preserve competitive equity among u.s. banks. fortunately, feed occ haveworked closely development new proposal. and, even point, havealready begin work closely develop jointly procedure validate banks' internal risk-measurement methodologies.the question remains, however, uniform implementation around world? the proposalrelies heavily supervisory oversight market discipline promote consistency. supervisor willbe responsible validate banks' internal methodologies, ensure ongoing compliance soundpractices, provide oversight economic capital process. the importance thesequalification standard precisely new proposal make requirement bankpermitted operate irb option. these requirement therefore integral part pillar 1.even country without supervisory authority impose qualification requirement thepreferential capital treatment offer pillar 1. carry validation overseeingcompliance ongoing basis considerable challenge everywhere, include unitedstates. a i noted, challenge particularly pronounce country supervisorytradition emphasize type on-site review need validate bank's irbimplementation. bi review ??/20017i impress member committee tradition veryexplicit need obtain resource carry necessary supervisory review. there isalso general agreement ongoing structure exchange experience occur amongcommittee member part process assess degree uniformity implementation.nonetheless, comment expect evolve problem consistency issue would bequite helpful.even supervisory resource adequate, market discipline must also play important role inensuring uniformity implement propose basel standard among banks. of course, banksdon't make choice respect capital levels, pay theappropriate price market low level capital relative risk. at rate, important thatan appropriate level disclosure requirement include pillar 1 facilitate marketdiscipline. the pillar 3 disclosure recommendation far reaching. but pointmany recommendations, requirements. in addition, recognize still havemore work fashion discipline prioritize set disclosure requirements, onethat balance cost compliance benefit disclosure. this, too, area whichbank comment would particularly helpful.does new proposal maintain competitive equity around world provide competitiveadvantage country relative others?obviously, sensitive issue. all party negotiation want standard promote safetyand soundness deter systemic risk. within boundaries, though, also view worldfrom perspective. a country negotiate, supervisor appropriately seek avoid rule thatwould disadvantage banks. hopefully, hope ultimately reach agreementthat acceptable u all. but, crucial banks, self-interest, review proposalscarefully, identify potential problem areas, alert supervisor material concerns.did set relative absolute require capital level right, properlybalance incentive move sophisticate options?i would surprise anyone could, point, provide definitive answer questions,although central success proposal. part problem, course, manygaps remain current proposal, make impossible bank compute amount capitalthey would hold irb approaches. there is, result, interactive process atwork. we need comment already proposed, include feedback implicationsfor banks' capital levels. we continue work fill gap and, work completed,will need feedback effect overall proposal require capital levels.i hope bank industry provide detail constructive feedback propose structureof risk weights, especially portfolio explicitly address proposedframework – primarily corporates, banks, sovereigns, retail irb. be proposedrelationships reasonable loan's risk weight default probabilities, loss give default,exposure, input irb approach? a i suggest earlier, get relative riskweights right, difficult achieve broad goal establish basel committee –such encourage effective risk-management practice discourage capital arbitrage.obviously, set right absolute level capital requirement important well, avoidexcessive systemic risk provide fair play field vis-à-vis nonbank financial institutions.when start determine appropriate absolute level capital requirement banks, wehoped take "bottom-up" perspective. the irb approach begin careful assessment ofrelative risk across different credit instruments. but ultimately ground absolutecapital standard. a bottom-up approach would start maximum insolvency probability thatregulators will accept. this would used, principle, calibrate absolute capital levelfor regulatory minimum. the problem implement approach require supervisoryjudgments area right decision obvious.consequently, part, structure risk weight january proposal beenguided, instead, top-down approach, seem comfortable many committeemembers, even ad hoc. the natural point departure top-down approach thecurrent level capital. in attempt maintain current overall amount capital thesystem, new standardize approach – intend conservative – calibrate 8bis review ??/2001current 8 percent capital standard. under irb approach, enhance risk sensitivity result inlower capital charge assets, precise amount overall benefit difficult todetermine point.within basel committee concern irb approach credit risk could result asignificant decline capital requirement relative current levels, especially advancedapproach. there could, therefore, temptation offset expect decline credit risk capitalwith imposition non-risk-sensitive capital charge "other risks." operational risk anobvious candidate "plug," especially give absence much progress developingmethodologies estimate amount capital appropriate risk. the danger anarbitrary ad hoc approach capital operate risk could deny bank full benefit wouldotherwise available advance approach. such approach could easily subvert anyimprovement new accord's overall risk sensitivity might otherwise flow refinedtreatment credit risk. it also likely discourage bank invest resource necessary tobetter measure operate risk. at minimum, provide incentive so.this issue, especially method determine operational risk, one commentsare eagerly anticipated.are even large bank ready take advantage irb approach?the fact bank supervisor need make much progress explain relativelylong (three-year) transition period propose new accord would implemented. asbankers, ask whether truly ready. the quick answer, "we're there," isprobably wrong. base examination u.s. banks' internal risk-rating processes, i suspectthat bank would get clean sign-off supervisor today.despite importance evaluate borrower's probability default, bank surprisinglyslow, seems, distinguish among acceptable credit risk level price ownassessments capital adequacy. in recent years, lead institution clearly expandedtheir risk gradations, use twenty category parallel practice largeexternal rat firms. typically, though, bank use half dozen "pass" grade less.moreover, distribution credit among grade often insufficient, largeportions portfolio fall one two grades. most significantly, rigor internalconsistency internal risk-rating process often handicap insufficient unclear ratingcriteria limit resource dedicate independent review risk-rating assignments.last fall, basel committee conduct initial survey large internationally active bank orderto estimate quantitative effect proposal capital requirements. the committee wasdisappointed modest number bank worldwide could provide meaningful distribution ofcredit quality, even corporate portfolios. i hope experience say time andattention bank devote exercise lack guidance receive aboutthe state risk-management systems. if latter, industry clearly need increase thepace.processthe new rule is, course, still proposal, although one much time effort beeninvested. it certainly change need develop further, overall structureseems set. the industry need take current proposal seriously comment insubstantive helpful ways. tell u like dislike, constructive, offer alternativesolutions can. your constructive proposal pay due regard objective reformwill, i assure you, play significant role shape final proposal basel committee.once adopt basel committee, proposal submit g-10 central bank fortheir endorsement national jurisdiction necessary domestic rulemaking. in unitedstates many countries, rulemaking process require public comment periodsthat must respected. in country, definitely be. by point, though, theinternational process much-advanced stage. consequently, time commentand influence results. don't miss chance. once fully adopt country baselcommittee, standard likely broad application worldwide replace currentaccord, particularly internationally active banks. every bank expect affected. bi review ??/20019conclusionthe proposal may complex time confusing, i believe right track. we needregulatory capital standard far risk sensitive one providethe industry great incentive measure manage risk. the irb framework seem compatiblewith effort best-practice bank direction risk management seem beheading. the advance irb approach, particular, provide bank substantial flexibility theirrisk-measurement technique eliminate much pure capital arbitrage, provide thatwe calibrate various method reasonably well.such flexibility mean standard, itself, evolve bank practice improve. with experienceand good data, risk parameter change, model get stronger. bank longerhave shelter static uniform regulatory standard require defend ownassessments procedure supervisor market. they start process slowly,moving standardize approach foundation advance irb method theyfeel ready supervisor agrees. good risk management lead low capitalrequirements.the proposal still much work progress, important issue still unresolved. yourcomments

16/20011arnold schilder: bank new economy: supervisory perspectivespeech mr a. schilder, executive director de nederlandsche bank n.v., take offconference ‘information battle: consequence new economy economic business life’,university maastricht, 14 february 2001.* * *introductionthe new economy affect almost two-hundred-year-old nederlandsche bank many ways.today, i focus implication new economy bank bank supervision. thesubject therefore is: e-banking supervision.electronic bankingfirst, e-banking? e-banking provision bank service mean electronic datatransfer participants. the information transfer via network, may computernetwork internet, telecommunication network. rabobank’s random access bankingis example e-banking. by that, customer make payments, deposit savings, makeinvestments internet telephone. in addition, people shop dutch cybermall,such davista (www.davista.nl), random access bank mostly offer possibility pay usingrabo direct. this last application could describe use pin code internet.another recent example e-banking wellowell, own ing. this on-line marketplace.customers compare insurance offer bank product various provider here, andclose deal then. example car insurance save account. in way, ingoffers products, well competitors.what advent electronic medium mean banks? i would like mention threeconsequences. one internet make market transparent. consumer compareproducts service different provider easily, shop around best offers. this isparticularly case standard product like consumer credit, price key factordetermining customers’ selection. in addition, cost switch supplier low caseof electronic banking. combine increase comparability products, could reducecustomer loyalty. this turn mean fierce competition banks.a second consequence new information communication technology theorganisational structure bank affected. bank integrate value chain,horizontally well vertically. this mean element service provide thesame organisation. example account management, product development infrastructure. theinternet put pressure integrate organisational structure. an important aspect internettechnology development require high initial investment, marginal cost ofuse low. this raise possibility new, specialise supplier able carry certainspecific activity efficiently bank themselves. on one hand, situation offer thebanks option outsource operation others, thus achieve cost reductions. onthe hand, could bring unwanted pressure part banks’ value chain, ultimatelylead deconstruction chain itself. a practical consequence trend bank aredeveloping network organisation way alliance cooperation financial non-financial institutions. for example cooperation abn amro kpn relation thelaunch ‘money planet’ internet site.a third consequence new supplier enter market easily. in virtual world,barriers entry significantly lower. there long need extensive branch officenetwork, example. low entry barrier mean supplier market, intensifiescompetition. these supplier may take different forms. they may exist bank originate fromother countries. these bank use internet bring rapid internationalisation theiractivities. various institution already set electronic subsidiaries, offer bank serviceson international scale new brand name name parent bank. example 2bis review 16/2001include bank scotland’s electronic subsidiary eubos, offer mortgage internet inthis country, ing direct, ing’s electronic offshoot, active canada elsewhere.new supplier also pure electronic banks, institution non-banking sector. pureelectronic bank link exist physical bank. although high fixedcosts branch network, invest heavily build reputation. it interestingto note current market share hold bank still small. the principal reason forthis probably lack confidence result lack physical presence highcost market brand name. newcomer non-banking sector existingnon-financial institution offer limit range financial service electronic channels.volkswagen germany one example. they offer consumer credit. also company whichspecialize payment system part non-banking category. right i talking, offeryou possibility make payment mobile telephone. this sevice already available inthe unite states. other non-banking institution include consumer comparison site like wellowell,portals personal agents.the implication e-banking supervisionso far i describe consequence electronic medium bank system. but arethe implication bank supervision? let discus recent activity undertake bysupervisors.first, nederlandsche bank supervise bank system accordance dutch creditsystems supervision act. the policy regulation medium (beleidsregels media) formulatedto indicate act apply financial service offer via electronic media.briefly put, regulation state make difference whether bank service providedvia traditional channel branch offices, internet. in case institutionconcerned require hold bank license. for example, institution establish thenetherlands provide bank service internet come supervision dnb.however, provider establish abroad via internet active dutch market isalso subject dnb supervision. several indicator play part decide whether activity areconsidered direct dutch market, like use dutch language, contact point inthe netherlands, addressee medium used. the exist regulatory legislation thereforeadequate proper bank supervision, also advent e-banking. e-banking howevermade regulator’s task complicated. how check provider active overthe internet dutch market indeed comply regulatory legislation? this bring arecent dnb initiative.second, combination fellow regulator dutch insurance board security boardof netherlands, dnb enter co-operative agreement dutch national policeagency (korps landelijke politiediensten, klpd) dutch economic investigation service(economische controle dienst, ecd). we work together develop new trackingmethods. the objective whose action internet breach regulatorylegislation traced.a third initiative introduction internet officer. the digital detective, cybercop, already afamiliar phenomenon police circles. from beginning, use cybercops inducedinvestigation authority develop technique discover identity breach ofthe law. the regulator want use technology supervision financial sector. thednb one internet officer, like digital detective engage trace financialoffenders. so far, several indication offence internet found. for exampleinstitutions offer bank service internet without bank license. also someso-called ‘study investment associations’ (studiebeleggingsclubs) breach regulatorylegislation. these investment funds, found students, operate internet without licenseof dnb.a fourth initiative protect consumer unauthorised bank service introduction ofso-called hyperlinks. this possibility currently investigated. every financial service providerusing e-commerce would require place hyperlink website refer relevantregulator. by click hyperlink, consumer would access list provider license theregulator, could easily see whether provider list, therefore trustworthy. anotherpossibility consider regulator’s ‘black list’, would special page bi review 16/20013regulator’s website list financial service provider operate without license andtherefore trustworthy.so work together fellow regulators, police investigation services. however, bankhas separate unit concern supervision bank information technology within itssupervision department. the fact e-banking involve several specific operational risks. oneoperational risk mainly relate security system transactions, include dataconfidentiality authentication party involved. another operational risk refer thecontinuous availability internet medium financial transactions. this availability proneto serious hazards, computer virus hackers. think example homebankingapplication abnamro, subject attack hacker september last year. such anincident may damage reputation internet mean payment. it therefore veryimportant bank ensure safety e-banking. the regulator it- unit monitor whetherthis sufficiently done. to end, conversation bank gain insight thecontrols, legal implication particularly security e-banking. furthermore, retrievedocumentation, banks’ risk analysis, independent edp audit report result apenetration test. this test legal attempt hack, conduct external organisation.as well national initiative i mentioned, international activity way thee-banking area. a good example work electronic bank group, ebg, isa work group so-called basel committee bank supervision. this group engage informulating international guidance principle regard e-banking. the ebg recently publish itsprinciples risk management electronic banking, also include issue relate consumerprotection. one example principle concern appropriate disclosure e-banking services.this principle state bank organisation provide website coreinformation order assist customer make inform choices. example disclosedinformation could include contact detail supervisory authority responsible supervision ofthe bank’s head office well detail access national compensation insurance schemes.the risk management principle e-banking currently present bank sector forconsultation. it expect final version present basel committee next month.around april, principle publish website bi (www.bis.org). beside thepublications website (www.dnb.nl), speech, also find link site ofthe bis.besides work basel committee apply specifically bank sector, moregeneral legislation form eu directives. these affect e-banking well. for example thedirective electronic commerce, require provider electronic service make informationon price condition accessible consumers. another relevant directive e-banking onthe remote provision financial services. this state example consumer right torecall agreement supplier provide term delivery, like prices, beforeentering transaction.conclusionto summarize: e-banking phenomenon affect bank regulators. i hope i havemade clear subject regulators’ full attention, nationally internationally. aswell participate international discussion e-banking, bank undertake variousinitiatives include e-banking supervisory policy. this mean afford becomplacent. development proceed rapidly, dnb closely monitor developmentsto ensure timely response. in various way keep know-how continuous basis. bymeans course self-study, example. but also benchmarking third parties, isrelevant review one’s organization time time. finally, important way keepingup know-how recruit new staff. so supervision e-banking arouse yourinterest, dnb probably something you. bi review 5/20011urban bäckström: the swedish economyspeech mr urban bäckström, governor sverige riksbank chairman board ofdirectors president bank international settlements, swedish shareholders’association, gotland section, visby 29 january 2001.* * *thank invite gotland talk swedish economy. be visby always apleasure, besides revive many memory — may know, i spend time inthe sixties.today i intend begin look back economic development recent years. that helpto put current discussion swedish economy perspective. after i shall sayingsomething economy’s recent cyclical path i ass future light theinformation presently available.we experience series year economy expand strongly.since upturn begin summer 1993, annual gdp growth rate average 3 percent. not since period late sixty early seventy growth figure like this.the favourable trend contribute rapidly rise employment decrease unemployment.open unemployment drop four year 9 per cent le 4 per cent. in recentyears, moreover, average almost 100,000 new job create annually. a look thestatistics show expansion employment strong sweden experience since thelabour force survey first publish early sixties.the markedly favourable trend confine growth, employment unemployment. both ourforeign transaction public finance generate surpluses.another aspect good situation inflation remain moderate. in recent year rateof inflation, measure consumer price index, 2 per cent. this pavedthe way real wage increase scale see since sixties.in light factor — rapid economic growth, rise employment, fall unemployment,internal external surpluses, low inflation favourable real wage increase —the picture theswedish economy bright. what, then, explanation advantageous course ofevents? in opinion, combination factors.the economic crisis ravage sweden early ninety clearly mean plenty resourceswere available activity subsequently recovered. that reduce risk production soonreaching ceiling.at time, swedish economy perform efficiently, particularly comparedwith previous quarter-century, even relatively low growth rate tend generate inflation.one explanation lie realignment economic policy begin late eighty promotestability predictability. today say confidence riksbank’s 2 per cent target forannual inflation strong; function clear benchmark price-and wage-setting decisions.the transformation achieve new establishment — least it sector —and increase competition, well deregulation important markets, also includedin complete account factor contribute good performance recent years. theyhave push price thereby keep inflation check, make strong expansion demandfeasible.sooner later, however, excessively rapid increase demand allow continue willresult unbalance economy. this simply rise resource utilisation increase riskof tension supply demand. even best worlds, economy cannot disregard thefundamental law functions. in many respects, recent crisis early ninetieswas occasion economy leave long expand rate could sustained.this end crash. so order avoid situation mount imbalances, time economicgrowth sweden start slow rate sustainable long run.what, then, level potential growth rate? accord common, though entirelycertain estimate, swedish economy’s sustainable annual growth rate lie 2 2.5 per 2bis review 5/2001cent. in view high growth rate recent year consider move towards asituation resource become increasingly strained, might conclude would behealthy swedish economy activity slow little future.many observer count interest rate hikesi recall past year good many observer count fairly large interest rate increases.they think saw clear sign swedish economy way overheat andconsidered ought act promptly prevent happening. along frequent warnings,moreover, number central bank increase instrumental rates. the u.s. federalreserve, instance, raise rate course last year 6.5 per cent. in europe ecbtightened monetary stance increase refinance rate 4.75 per cent, bank ofengland adjust interest rate upwards 2000 6.0 per cent.the riksbank, however, take cautious course. for although assessment economicactivity relatively similar forecasters, differ path ofinflation. in sense, inflation forecast say register temperature activity andindicate quickly economy capable expanding. we saw clear clear signal thatthe relationship growth inflation become favourable. it look though theeconomy could cope somewhat high growth period without become overheat andgenerating high inflation. we take stages, relatively mild monetary stance, forecasthorizon shift future. today note 4 per cent, repo rate sweden lowerthan industrialise countries.closer focus resource utilisationduring autumn focus increasingly resource utilisation. the economy move towardsa situation growth total production ultimately liable excessively high. therewas nothing dramatic this; view strong activity, expected. what wasperhaps surprise shortage become acute, particularly labour market.in upward cyclical phase, development situation tension market goods,services labour threaten gain upper hand threaten price stability gradual process.that make difficult tell exactly imbalance constitute genuine problem inflationprospects.what observer endeavour draw conclusion continuous inflow ofeconomic information, item carefully scrutinised. this simple matter isa risk interpretation sometimes wrong. moreover, time lag measure ofmonetary policy elicit effect — premise full effect interest rate adjustment takesone two year materialise. we therefore balance risk act soon againstthose act late. if riksbank act prematurely, unemployment liable fluctuate morewidely otherwise. act late, hand, may lead high inflation expectation aswell rise price wages. in case, economy may ultimately land recession, perhapswith high unemployment.fortunately, question either/or. a monetary policy adjustment decide gradually,with stepwise adjustment repo rate. consequently always possible compare forecastswith outcomes, ass policy stance continuously make adjustment call for.if monetary policy successfull, foundation laid, low, stable inflation line thetarget riksbank’s statutory objective, also stable output growth long run astable development employment. that something i find important underscore.various form demand adjustmentin come year accordingly adjustment demand swedisheconomy’s long-term growth trend. in principle, happen either spontaneous slacken ofactivity, instance sweden

unfortunately, neither question isanswerable certainty stage. with respect duration stock adjustment, whothink process protract point length current investment boom andthe historical experience

which set factor predominateswill determine, part, shape recovery period slowing.similarly, cannot know certainty pace investment capital good go forward. a iwill discus below, certain pace future

producetheir information content clearly pay production costs, cost appear smallcompared cost build operate network. interestingly, many information providersdo originate content rely instead markets,

aconvenient organize framework identify payment transaction commoncharacteristics.for type commerce, exist electronic payment instrument easily adapt theinternet. most notably, small- medium-sized c2b purchase frequently make use credit cards.because credit card already widely use retail telephone transactions, "card-not-present" transaction easily accept part commerce world wide web. moreover,unlike many payment instruments, credit card could already support low-value internationalcommerce, one historical barrier challenge internet. one card network estimatesthat 95 percent retail

assessment executive board works. before wind up, i shall also considersome issue connect communication transparency.‘hate inflation’as know, monetary policy’s purpose safeguard low inflation. that case anyevent since begin 1990s. it become explicit, course, riksbank adopt aninflation target february 1993. since 1999, moreover, riksbank act state objective ofthe riksbank’s operation shall "maintain price stability".so objective? basically, broad consensus low inflation good foreconomic development accordingly contribute gain prosperity. while true certainsituations economy stimulate

inflation expectation become firmly fix this.in words, long run monetary policy capable influence growth. what doesunderlie country’s economic development thereby prosperity factor labourforce, willingness invest technical progress. the best riksbank promote aneconomic development stable, small fluctuation around long-term trend. ittherefore seem economic debate somewhat lopsided. the long-term issue youwork riksdag (sweden’s parliament) ought attract attention. the riksbank’s doingsget fair share.convincing people sweden value low inflation really difficult. after all,what get let inflation take 1970s ’80s? recurrent devaluation cyclesand level prosperity today considerably many countries. the economicimbalances become large bubble finally burst move 1990s, theconsequences considerable.i perhaps stress i talk economy abstract academic sense.these development tangible man street. take example someone whoplaced, say, 10,000 kronor bond 1970 look forward reap interest current rateof 8 per cent; 1990, twenty years, real value actually shrink 750 kronor,leaving 9,250 kronor. for someone buy property stockholm time, thingsturned differently; 1990 real value grow almost 17,800 kronor. the amountinvested stockholm stock exchange double real term 20,000 kronor.such difference solely due inflation, course, play large part. arbitraryredistribution fashion cause

limited. the target tie tothe consumer price index, measure inflation familiar reliable, besides beingpublished regularly.there great deal say — choice target’s level choice index — inthe light experience academic literature accumulate 1990s. i shall tobe brief, however, otherwise time practical issue ourprocedures, today’s theme.so three short comments:• the appropriate level inflation one debatable point. there argument asomewhat high level well somewhat lower. with present knowledge, isultimately matter judgement far nothing persuade thatthere grind present change target. a i see it, important thingis set distinct target give rate inflation anchor among economicagents, household firms, employer employees. in verysuccessful.• the choice index complicate matter. unfortunately measure inflationthat every situation show whether monetary policy properly balance whichmeasures call for. i already mention cpi’s advantages. the maindrawback time time index markedly affect price movement thatthe riksbank neither want counter. not want counter mainly dowith time lag monetary measure bite; another reason would bechasing tail if, example, raise interest rate counter increasein interest expenditure stem early interest rate hikes. we thereforeclarified policy form relation price movement transitory. in practice,monetary policy recent year base forecast inflation exclude indirecttaxes, subsidy interest expenditure, is, index know und1x.• the third issue exchange rate’s role monetary policy. there le talk thistoday early year inflation target public debate lively.the discussion subside riksbank, early 1996, make clear policy isguided long-term outlook inflation continue low repo rate eventhough krona weakened. for monetary policy central consideration thus theexchange rate’s impact inflation. perhaps i add rough idea ofthe level exchange rate seem reasonable long run. we notintervened since occasion financial turbulence 1998 kronaweakened way retrospect seem unreasonable.assessments come 1–2 year crucialit take time monetary measure affect inflation. some effect interest rate adjustment mayindeed occur quickly. the stock market, instance, influence soon adjustment isannounced immediate consequence household consumption, example, andthereby quick impact certain prices. monetary policy also elicit exchange rate movementsand quickly affect price export imports. normally, however, time lag betweenmonetary measure effects. for example, interest rate hike leaf household lessmoney expenditure also reduce return investments. by gradually influencingconsumption investment, lead time change total demand. with weak demand,firms difficulty raise price lead low inflation.interest rate adjustment accordingly affect inflation variety channel

policyis come twelve twenty-four months. our simple rule action accordingly inflation oneto two year ahead look like target, normally repo rate raise bi review 24/20013vice versa. but also attach importance policy’s effect well timehorizon.in view uncertainty respect, difference opinion — executive board wellas public debate — policy’s time perspective natural. if fearedthat inflation will, instance, shoot beyond target horizon, may grind foracting particularly early. in opinion, however, clear target horizon stand u good stead inrecent years. it make policy easy understand foresee. it also beneficialinternally force u specific good argument depart rule action.there have, moreover, number occasion idea prospect long runwere fault new developments. one example rise activity inflation

uncertainty work highlight again. all cautionsagainst attach undue importance assessment long run.another matter discuss great deal recent year monetary policy ought tohandle price movement asset real

upwardrevision forecast inflation perhaps repo rate increase. but happen insideour normal time horizon? i personally believe may still grind adjust repo rate ifone either foresee future ‘bubble’ may show inflation long run concernedabout consequence economy financial system ‘bubble’ finally bursts. inthe light experience ‘financial bubble’ burst early 1990s, i believe supportfor line action could

meaningful discussion subject, would, view bebefitting clearly understand theoretical underpinnings underlie role finance theprocess growth. view economist important issue viz. inter-relationship

traditional function commercialbank accept deposit grant loans. they accept deposit various kind rangingfrom demand fix deposits, lend money need. that’s brokerand dealer money. it also note that, banker custodian others surplus funds, sowhile earn profit forget business people’s money. hemust always ready meet liability times. in case banker able honour hiscommitment, suffer shock failure, shock also transmit tothe rest economy quickly. the systemic risk arise need eliminate orminimized. besides, banker creator money sense credit creation lead depositgeneration, which, turn, lead credit creation, process ultimately would implicationsfor monetary framework.it’s therefore important that, banker always time bear mind that, guardianof important mechanism. a mechanism, bear relevance monetary policy butalso pave way future economic growth development disruption deviation thisregard, could create economic financial chaos.do namibian commercial bank play developmental role?the traditional function commercial bank namibia undergo rapid transformationsince independence. the total asset commercial bank currently operate system increasedfrom n$1.9 bn 1990 n$10 bn 2000 branch number 101 thetotal number employee reach close 3000.commercial bank real credit private sector grow average rate 10 per centbetween 1990 2000. in nominal terms, total commercial bank credit percentage gdpcurrently stand 45 per cent. this quite high compare norm 13 per cent sub-saharan african countries. except south africa mauritius, ratio credit gdp namibiais high among sadc countries. although substantial credit still allocate individuals,there late, favorable shift allocation credit manufacturing, real estate andconstruction last 10 years. credit extend productive sector economy notbeen encouraging. this area need immediate attention need towork together find way explore ideal solution resolve issue.as real credit private sector, total deposits, average, witness high growthrate since independence 13 per cent compare 3.7 per cent (on average) forthe period 1980-89. if rate growth deposit indicator ability commercial bank tomobilize deposits, performance commercial bank namibia quite commendable.however, worthy note considerable shift structure depositsparticularly since 1995 noticeable slide growth rate time deposits. this would tend tosuggest, despite high growth overall deposit level, commercial bank longerable mobilize substantial long-term deposit particularly wake competition bring bythe introduction unit trust product non-bank financial institutions.as know important indicator soundness bank system bank’soperating efficiency. research conduct research department bank namibia showsthat commercial bank namibia characterize high gross

commercial banksin namibia outperform counterpart lesotho, botswana, swaziland south africa. it hasbeen argue cost deliver service also quite high namibia. on comparative note,this could true weigh situation botswana. it is, however, encourage tonote cost ratio low namibia swaziland, lesotho large extent, southafrica.emerging economic paradigm - need transformation bankingfrom point view central

abank-based economy like ours. the volume credit well allocation key sector theeconomy help stimulate productive activities. although statistic show ratio ofprivate sector credit gdp quite high namibia, still need do especially areaof long term loans. there strong need direct credit previously disadvantage people whobecause accident history may posse specify collateral require banks.as logical step forward towards transform bank system, seem great needfor review lend procedures, practice credit assessment mechanism view toensuring supply credit genuine client particularly hitherto

ecb's strategy. this assessment make basis wide range variablesinfluencing future price developments. this range includes, inter alia, exchange rate, wages, unitlabour costs, bond prices, yield curve, fiscal policy indicators, various measure real economicactivity, price cost indices. in addition in-depth analysis individual indicators,macroeconomic projection real gdp growth inflation regularly made. while suchprojections facilitate structure summarise individual factors, onlyprovide partial summary state economy. hence one element secondpillar. overall, two-pillar approach prove successful first two year ofstage three, characterise above-average degree uncertainty. the ecb'sstrategy certainly rather complex, - time - crucial advantage ofguaranteeing piece relevant information leave policy analysis.regarding actual price developments, admit that, moderate inflation 1999,hicp inflation stand 2% since june 2000. however, due mainly directeffects stem external oil price shock. such

unprecedented prosperity, bank industry come recognize, forthe first time, embed cost lax credit standard overly optimistic assumption aboutborrower prospect seem inevitable consequence ever-lower

bank industry earn fall slightly 2000, thus bring end theindustry’s string ten consecutive year high earnings.nevertheless, though effect excess likely continue much year theform moderately deteriorate asset quality earn large banks, theseproblems, one hopes, prove modest historical standard relative resource ofthese institutions. fortunately, move period uncertain time level industry’soverall profitability well average recent decades. moreover, source bankingrevenues good diversify past, institution hold strong capital reservepositions.not surprisingly, response past laxity, weaken economy, general economic uncertainty,banks tighten lend term conditions. on commercial industrial loans, oursenior loan officer opinion survey indicate tighten start late 1999 persistedthrough early 2001. the survey also indicate continue firm term condition oncorporate loan nearly 60 percent domestic respondents, 45 percent november. inaddition, 40 percent respondent adopt

instandards price clearly necessary important part transition bank mustmake move overly optimistic assumption more-realistic assessment borrowerprospects.as i say previously, however, lender

aggressively peak cycle vast majority ofbad loan made. a disciplined, le pro-cyclical, long-term approach lend provideshigher average risk-adjusted return shareholder obviously self-interest banks.it interest note length current expansion, couple absence problemcommercial loan recently, lead depreciation bankers’ supervisors’ skill inhandling weaken trouble credits. such problem either fade memory

fairly resilient. for example, commercial real estate loan experience below-averagedelinquencies net charge-offs, residential mortgage loans. furthermore, credit card netcharge-offs, escalate recent years, fall moderate levels.still, prudent banker need weigh potential less-agreeable credit conditions. in recentyears, buoyant economic condition raise expectation continue growth income andemployment consumers, turn lead growth household debt outstrippedgains disposable personal income past five years. that growth debt pushedconsumer debt service burden level close peak experience late 1980s.neither borrower lender would enter obligation optimistic theprospects repayment. not surprisingly, lender recently temper outlook, tighteningtheir standard somewhat credit card installment loans. concurrently, demand borrowershas weaken moderately. if loan extend assume little possibility less-than-optimal conditions, problem likely emerge. indeed, loan make use credit-scoringmodels estimate data last five year may optimistic morenormal conditions.history provide excellent lesson bank institution regard appropriate pricing,underwriting, diversification. one memorable, course, real estate crisis ofthe late 1980s early 1990s. however, clear memory lesson dimover time. the exceptional demand office commercial real estate recent year ledto rebound volume loan secure

supervisor pay particular attention tocommunity bank concentration make materially vulnerable downturn thismarket.although asset quality problem large bank may receive headlines,a linger widespread source concern shrink net interest margins. asliability cost rise rapidly last year, nearly large bank hold company experiencedmargin declines, one-fourth experience narrow 25 basis point since ayear

couple rapid loan growth, pressure bank liquidity appear tohave intensified. community bank fund gap loan deposit growth largely byliquidating investments. for example, 1990 end last year, small

2001* * *1.introductiongood even lady gentleman. i thank invite even speak thisprestigious event. the institute banker important organisation encompass industrythat is, i sure well aware, crucial south african reserve bank partner ourcommitment maintain enhance stability country(cid:146)s financial sector.my remark even centre "transparency public understand monetary policy".the public understand aim reserve bank something concern usdeeply. it something go hand hand work bank central thebank(cid:146)s commitment make monetary policy transparent people affect (cid:150) citizen ofsouth africa.first i discus reserve bank(cid:146)s monetary policy framework development haveoccurred area recently. i move onto institutional arrangement conduct ofmonetary policy, work monetary policy committee bank(cid:146)s model forecastingactivities. finally, i say word central objective south african reserve bank.2.the monetary policy frameworkwe announce adoption inflation target monetary policy framework february overa year ago. the formal adoption inflation target framework indicate shift previousinformal policy framework. in past, monetary policy embrace eclectic approach whichrecognition formally give medium longer-term stance monetary policy monitoringdevelopments number financial aggregate money supply bank creditextension.the eclectic approach monetary policy apply 1990s, background ofexplicitly articulate guideline money supply growth. this framework recognise reservebank combat inflation, outline constitution reserve bank act. however,since bank(cid:146)s policy direct impact area money credit, intermediateguidelines set growth money supply. it argue money supply growth could becontained, much money would chase goods, inflation would bring undercontrol.while formally state broad money supply growth fall range 6 10 percentper annum (since mid-1990s), practice bank adopt relatively flexible approach wherethese guideline indeed treat guideline only. a guideline growth total bankcredit extension around 10 percent also adopted. but guideline exceed byconsiderable margins, occasion tolerate without strong policy adjustments, basisof development variables.in practice quite apparent growth money supply could sometimes misleadingindicator current future inflation. accordingly, number variable also analyse indeciding upon appropriate monetary policy stance. these include pace growth thebanking sector(cid:146)s credit extension, movement consumer price production price inflation,domestic production expenditure, balance payment exchange rate situation, thefiscal policy stance. the inflationary potential development many variableswas assess ongoing basis. accordingly, growth money supply really pivotalvariable around monetary policy revolve - although excessive growth money supply certainly 2bis review 19/2001did signal need additional caution. however, money supply growth deem importantand formally recognise intermediate target variable.what since changed? instead target guideline intermediate objectives, reservebank directly target inflation. it monitor analysis whole range factor affectthe rate inflation. the inflation rate, specifically cpix, headline consumer priceindex exclude mortgage costs, fall 6 3 percent end calendar year2002.it within target monetary policy framework south african reserve bank willstrive achieve short term mandate do: achieve price stability. sucha framework monetary policy ensure monetary policy transparent, authoritieshave definite measurable aim conduct monetary policy. and time, itshould give citizen country aspect clarity future make clear thebank(cid:146)s intentions. in doing, inflation target also ease burden take the"guesswork" many decision business make plan futureexpansion investment. it also provide anchor inflation expectation guide bothemployers employee undertake forward-looking negotiations.however, must emphasise least success inflation target frameworkrests whether fully understand labour, business, private sector sector ofthe economy. if sector understand bank target inflation commit thechosen target, engender public confidence reserve bank(cid:146)s monetary policyprocedures.i turn specific inflation target monetary policy framework. the reserve bankmonitors number factor direct influence inflation. these include growth inmoney supply bank credit extension, change nominal real salary wages, thenominal unit labour costs, gap potential actual national output, exchange ratedevelopments import prices. the oil price another factor play major part indomestic inflationary trend late one closely monitored. this exogenous factor isone little control. another exogenous factor food prices, volatile asa result drought floods. and administer prices, influence government monopoliesincluding medical education costs, also impact domestic inflationary trends.in order monitor factors, reserve bank embrace system small core modelsupported models. it move away single large-scale macroeconomic model, inkeeping international developments. the aim keep core model concise focus onthe key economic variable influence inflation, i already mentioned. the core modelincorporates basic assumption economy. it presupposes, among things, thathigher output cannot achieve face persistently high inflation level pricesin money term rate inflation long term depend monetary policy.changes monetary policy, change bank(cid:146)s repo rate, transmit theeconomy via various channels, so-called transmission mechanism. however, transmissionmechanism complex structure encompass large number cause effect scenarios.the traditional channel direct effect change interest rate demand supply.changes repo rate direct effect interest rates, exchange rate decisionson spend investment. change repo rate, therefore, affect demand thesupply good services. the pressure demand supply capacity economy isthe key factor influence domestic inflationary pressures.the link reserve bank(cid:146)s model activity forecast process indirect farfrom mechanical, "black box" approach favour scientists. there mechanical process inwhich forecast directly determine policy decision. it must remember theeconometric model forecast tool help reserve bank solve economic problems. theyare also one set tool use policy decision-making process. i illustrate point byreferring summary bank england use model monetary policycommittee(cid:146)s responsibilities. this summary encapsulate philosophy behind use modelsand forecast reserve bank. i quote:"in ever-changing economy, single model possibly assimilate comprehensiveway factor matter policy. form judgement factors, bi review 19/20013implications policy, job committee, something abdicate tomodels even modellers. but economic model indispensable tool process."to return broad picture, inflation target form framework reserve bank(cid:146)smonetary policy, must remember monetary policy part macroeconomic policy.the task macroeconomic policy promote economic growth development, createemployment, improve live condition people country, eliminate theunjustifiable discrepancy disparate average income various group economy.monetary policy narrow focus occupy important component foundation uponwhich broad goal macroeconomic policy rest. monetary policy aim create maintain astable financial environment within overall economic activity expanded, job create andpoverty reduced.this monetary policy objective support legal obligation reserve bank set inthe constitution republic south african reserve bank act. these statute state thatthe primary objective monetary policy protect value currency order obtainbalanced sustainable economic growth south africa. this require achievement twoobjectives: price stability stable condition financial sector.price stability say occur change general price level materially affect theeconomic decision-making processes. although relative price movement still impact onproduction, consumption, save investment, rate inflation low nolonger important factor economic decision make process.we say stable condition prevail financial sector high degree ofconfidence financial institution financial market able meet contractualobligations. these stable conditions, however, preclude failure individual financialinstitutions. a financial institution fail allow fail even stable financial conditions.it threat systemic risk important part financial sector riskthat situation describe financially unstable.since inflation main focus, may question exchange rate rand fit themonetary policy framework? target inflation mean exchange rate rand isignored. on contrary, impact exchange rate inflation concern u iswhat closely monitor. the impact fluctuation exchange rate inflation carefullyconsidered go daily task manage domestic liquidity determine reporate. if sign emerge increase inflationary pressure arise depreciation theexchange rate rand, absence counterveiling factor refer above, thenmonetary policy would respond appropriate way. this, however, imply thereserve bank defend specific level exchange rate.3.institutional arrangement monetary policyour commitment transparent monetary policy go hand hand attempt alreadymade communicate intention outcome meet public.the monetary policy committee set shortly south africa adopt inflation targetingframework monetary policy. the 14-member-mpc, know short, meet seven time ayear. it first meet 13 october 1999. the task meet decide monetary policystance, focus inflation target must meet target year. a press conference isheld two-day meet conclude committee release statement fleshingout development international domestic economy reason monetarypolicy stance relate prevalent developments.the reserve bank also convene monetary policy forums, name suggests, providea forum open discussion monetary policy general economic developments. the mpfs areheld twice year major centre country engage labour, business, communityand organisations. the forum also ensure view interest party take intoaccount determine monetary policy. this endeavour earnest attempt part tocommunicate monetary policy economic issue broad spectrum people.unfortunately, date, forum well attended, particularly part tradeunion movement. 4bis review 19/2001the reserve bank also publish monetary policy review twice year increase theunderstanding conduct monetary policy. the first review publish 19 march thisyear describe monetary policy framework detail. it also analyse local andinternational economic development inflationary trend arise these. the reserve bankwill also publish inflation forecast form fan chart. the fan chart use many centralbanks illustrate inflation forecasts. so-called confidence band use signify varyingdegrees certainty broadly expect level inflation.last least, reserve bank regularly report parliament stance monetary policy.this line international practice part accountability citizen southafrica.4.mpc decision time still misunderstooddespite effort create transparent open channel communication conduct ofmonetary policy centrality inflation targeting, many people south africa still fixate onthe fluctuation exchange rate rand. question ask change inconsumer prices. but, almost certainly, question arise exchange rate depreciates.together this, monetary policy committee(cid:146)s decision misunderstand time time.one time 16 october last year monetary policy committee convene aspecial meet regular schedule meet review effect development onthe country(cid:146)s inflation outlook. we decide underprovide bank sector(cid:146)s liquidityrequirement thereby lead rise repurchase rate 12 percent. some saw move astrategy aim protect rand. yet committee make quite clear thecase. it give follow reasons, i quote:"at end previous meet (21 september 2000), committee express concernabout second-round price effect depreciation exchange rate rand andthe continue high price petroleum. trade statistic release since thelast meet indicate surplus current account balance payment inthe second quarter 2000 could change deficit third quarter. at sametime non-residents become net seller south african bonds, signal possibleshortfall financial account. a result change continue strength ofthe u dollar, downward pressure exert rand concomitant import priceincreases, raise risk high inflation. these tendency aggravate bycontinued high level international petroleum prices."because development likely impact future price development andexpectations, monetary policy committee go say decide revise monetarypolicy stance. once again, i quote: "it conclude modest increase interest rate thisstage may avoid late steep increase rate order meet inflation target."to give effect this, reserve bank marginally under-provided liquidity requirement thebanks daily repo auction october 17, expect lead increase 25 basispoints repurchase rate.upon evaluate outcome decision next monetary policy committee meeting, thecommittee say although prime lend rate unchanged 25 basis point rise reporate, money market rate generally rose. expectation future rate increase also heightenedimmediately increase repurchase rate.statistics confirm committee(cid:146)s concern current account balance paymentswould slip deficit second third quarter 2000. this current account deficit, theslowdown inflow portfolio capital begin september 1999 reversal insentiment towards emerge market put pressure exchange rate rand, thecommittee said. the concern rand(cid:146)s depreciation could inflationary consequencesif counter developments.although weakness rand, steep rise cost import crude oil upward shiftin food price lead sharp increase consumer price exclude mortgage cost (cpix), themonetary policy committee emphasise exogenous shock yet lead tovisible second-round effect consumer prices. bi review 19/20015however, committee caution sign second-round effect theseexternal shock appear domestic production prices. the production price index, excludingcrude oil food prices, rise steeply 3,2 per cent november 1999 5,7 per cent inseptember 2000. and committee also warn could indicate cpix inflation would beaffected indirectly external factor follow month since increase production pricesusually precede increase consumer price inflation. the influence factor consumerprices, committee said, would depend competitive force economy would betempered medium term prudent fiscal monetary policies.5.conclusionon occasion these, important u re-focus attention reserve bank(cid:146)scentral objective framework mandate objective achieved. to put itanother way, important place reserve bank(cid:146)s action context. let reiterate: ouroverriding monetary policy objective achieve price stability aim achieve theframework target inflation. i stress many hear say before: although wemonitor number variable extrapolate potential impact inflation, rate inflationthat target.the reserve bank(cid:146)s objective enshrine constitution law land. the twoelements financial stability - price stability stability financial sector - closelyrelated. if fail one area, result uncertainty other. we regard financial stability asan important precondition sustainable high growth employment creation. conversely, highrates inflation distort allocation resource lead unequal distribution ofwealth.it background, then, place conduct monetary policy squarely within theobjective price stability within framework inflation targeting.kea leboga. bi review 18/20011willem duisenberg: “the euro. our money”speech dr willem f duisenberg, president european central bank, euro 2002information campaign

banknote coinsthe introduction euro banknote coin mean unprecedented logistical challenge allparties involved; 14.25 billion banknote 50.1 billion coin produced. banknote andcoins distributed. the european central bank (ecb) aim contribute make thisexercise smooth possible. the ecb decide frontloading sub-frontloading ofeuro banknote coin start 1 september 2001. frontloading advance distributionof euro banknote coin credit institution counterparties monetary policyoperations within eurosystem. credit institution sub-frontload euro banknote coin toprofessional group (retailers,

forfrontloading largely depend choose national changeover scenario, well thenational logistical infrastructure. these, scenario infrastructure, differ considerably fromcountry country.when speak euro changeover bear mind subsidiary anddecentralisation principle apply. although ecb endorse general principle andpractices order ensure common level play field competition perspective, isnecessary check specific national changeover scenario order complete detailedinformation. all country acknowledge need frontload bank euro banknotesand coin prior 1 january 2002, so-called e-day. this prerequisite smooth fastchangeover.the ecofin council agree general public could frontloaded euro coins, startingin second half december 2001. most participate country already decide orare process so. in belgium, so-called "starter kits" euro coin value ofapproximately bef 500 available general public 15 december 2001.the ecb rule frontloading euro banknote general public. we certainlyaware fact retailer concern hold large amount cash thefirst day 2002. these concern have, course, take account continue 2bis review 18/2001receive due consideration. however, frontloading euro banknote general public hasmore risk advantage appropriate mean address concern. what meansthen appropriate? let mention examples:• dispense low denomination euro banknote via automate teller machine (atms) atthe start 2002. this measure would useful view fact that, average,around 70% euro banknote put circulation via atms.• establish exchange points.• replace large national denomination atm small one end 2001 inorder ensure small amount pay use low-denomination banknotes. thiswould reduce need retailer large cash hold return change.• use low banknote denomination country welfare payment largely pay incash.the ecb open discuss possible additional measure aim smooth changeover withall relevant party involve euro cash changeover. some party expressedconcerns relate costs. in regard, ecb make position clear outset.we emphasise that, general rule, ecb cover operational cost otherparties. thus, criterion apply apply changeover eurotook place 1 january 1999. each party involve cash changeover - thisobviously include ecb - responsible cover costs. the ecb preparedto cover cost stem extra cash hold credit institutions. an appropriate method toensure developed.the ecb also address issue euro cash changeover outside euro area. we knowthat significant number banknote issue national central bank euro area country arecirculating outside euro area, especially accession countries. the citizen

campaignit sometimes forget euro already existence currency since 1 january1999. therefore, whenever pay cash current banknotes, actually already pay ineuro. however, owe lengthy preparation need produce new high-quality eurobanknotes, still oblige use current national banknotes. this, mainly psychological,drawback disappear 1 january 2002. the euro banknote coin easy usethroughout euro area, make life easy visible proof commoncurrency.it crucial best make sure euro banknote coin well receive byeuro area citizens. the quick acceptance general public much depend ability tocommunicate "our"

professional party directly involve - banks, retailers,cash transit company vend machine operator – and• quick acceptance new banknote public. bi review 18/20013therefore, ecb embark preparation

attentionto vulnerable groups, elderly, handicapped, deaf blind partiallysighted, need receive tailor-made information training.our information campaign coordinate campaign prepare national authoritiesand european commission. it thus consider "specialised" campaign. the message ofour campaign concentrate four main issues:• detail visual appearance banknote coins,• main security features,• denomination euro banknote coins; and• changeover modalities.i like emphasise particularly well co-ordination campaign belgium hasbeen. the national campaign really complementary campaign. this ensure since thenational bank belgium chair national changeover board.although information campaign, particularly communication towards medium co-operation partners, already start month ago, advertise campaign focus mainly onthe detail euro banknote coin cannot start early. it would difficult costlyto try keep public's attention long period time. moreover, euro banknote coinscontain highly sophisticate security features. they new citizen many euro areacountries. in order limit risk counterfeiting, security feature detail eurobanknotes unveil early, words, 1 september 2001, earliestdelivery date frontloading. on particular occasion, ecb present visual appearanceof euro banknote coin medium general public.last week, ecb's regular monthly press conference 1 march, i inform medium theslogan campaign. it "the euro. our money". the research undertake indeedrevealed encourage degree affinity european throughout 12 euro area countriesand currency. the result slogan choose deliverable campaign,especially advertisement develop autumn year begin of2002.in line timely communication policy i outlined, bulk information campaign,in particular mass medium part, visible last

federal reserve board, aconference sponsor security industry association university north carolinaschool law, new york, new york, 27 february 2001* * *good afternoon. it pleasure speak today, i thank security industryassociation university north carolina school law invite participate thisconference.consolidation type business activity prominent feature economiclandscape least past decade. the financial sector participate actively thisdevelopment. indeed, last year witness acceleration consolidation amongfinancial institutions. thus, choice topic afternoon's session timely one.in recognition importance marketplace evolution, especially potential effect awide range public policies, finance minister central bank governor thegroup ten nation september 1999 commission major study possible effect offinancial consolidation matter policy concern central bank finance ministry g-10.this study, i privilege direct, release public late last month. today i wouldlike discus study's major find implications.before review findings, however, let make comment current economicconditions. a always, view i express necessarily share byother member board governor federal open market committee.current economic conditionsrecent data u.s. economy confirm significant deceleration activity occurred. oureconomy clearly undergo stock adjustment bring supply demand inventory andcapital good sector good alignment. one key question is: when stockadjustment run course? unfortunately, question answerable certainty stage.the predominant risk remain growth notably slow would consistent theeconomy realize full potential time. one factor point risk unacceptably slow growthis uncertainty consumer sentiment, feature recent period. it istherefore useful explore deeply economists' understand consumer confidence.usually, consumer sentiment closely mirror contemporaneous economic conditions, generallymoves closely growth household spending. not surprisingly, key influence onhousehold spending, growth personal income buoyancy financial markets,also appear bear importantly consumer sentiment.relative indicator household sector, index consumer sentiment availableon timely basis provide early read direction household spending.moreover, contemporaneous indicator household spending, sentiment also seem tohave limit predictive ability future household spending. these advantage notwithstanding,we are, course, continually attempt evaluate number context entire rangeof indicator household sector.a somewhat puzzle feature recent period that, despite sharp weaken insentiment, household spend appear thus far hold well. how apparentlyconflicting signal resolve go forward apparent today's vantage point, andwill bear close scrutiny.another recent development adverse movement inflation rates. recent inflationchanges influence importantly increase energy prices. price petroleum-relatedproducts increase notably first half last year, follow recently sharpincreases price natural gas and, regions, electricity. largely reflect 2bis review 17/2001developments, consumer price inflation accelerate appreciably past year to3-3/4 percent twelve month end january. the consumer price index exclude foodand energy accelerate well past year, much modestly overallindex, rate increase slightly 2-1/2 percent. energy price likely contribute priceincreases non-energy item effect transportation cost input toproduction. look forward, participant future market expect crude oil price continue tomove down. spot natural gas price well january high expect move stilllower. if expectation prove accurate, help contain inflation directand indirect channels. furthermore, ease resource utilization associate relativelydamped economic growth also restrain price pressure go forward.in current environment, monetary policy face short-term challenge discern uncertaindimensions current slowdown economic growth respond appropriately. any suchresponse, however, make context continue commitment unchanged long-term mission--namely, promotion maximum sustainable employment pursuit pricestability time.the g-10 study financial consolidationlet turn attention topic afternoon's program, namely consolidation thefinancial sector. the g-10 study two primary objectives. it attempt isolate effect ofconsolidation powerful force transform financial system identify keyareas financial consolidation require new accelerate policy development. the diversity ofthe economy involved--even among g-10, australia, spain--and interdependent natureof many force affect financial system make achieve objective difficult, saythe least. however, i believe study success.patterns causeswith study depth, breadth, quite frankly, length one, always potentiallydangerous even possibly mislead summarize key point words. however, ibelieve policymakers communicate wide audience think important policyconcerns, thereby stimulate contribute dialogue public private sectors. thus,despite risks, i would like highlight are, judgment, study's key find policyimplications.the report document that, nation studied, high level merger acquisition activityoccurred 1990s among financial firms, define include depository institutions, securitiesfirms, insurance companies. during decade, approximately 7,500 transactions, value atroughly $1.6 trillion, consummated. moreover, pace consolidation increase time,including noticeable acceleration last three year decade. for example, annualnumber deal increase threefold 1990s, total value deal increase almosttenfold. in europe, roughly two-thirds merger acquisition activity, measure value ofthe european firm acquired, occur decade's last three years. use variety ofmeasures, unite state account 55 percent m&a activity, partly ourhistorically large number relatively small financial firms. however, also true many largeu.s. bank institution expand geographic footprint acquire large banks,especially late decade.most last decade's merger acquisition activity financial sector involve bankingorganizations. acquisition bank firm account 60 percent financial merger and70 percent value merger nation studied. in addition, m&a transactionsinvolved firm compete segment financial service industry within samecountry, domestic merger involve firm different segment overall financial servicesindustry second common type transaction. cross-border merger acquisitionswere le frequent, especially involve firm different industry segments. still, type ofmergers acquisitions, whether within one country cross-border whether within one industrysegment across segments, increase frequency value 1990s.joint venture strategic alliance provide interest contrast pattern inoutright merger acquisitions. a m&a activity, number joint venture strategicalliances increase 1990s, especially large increase last two years. in bi review 17/20013united states, account nearly half joint venture strategic alliances, thearrangements overwhelmingly domestic. however, twelve country studied, cross-border joint venture strategic alliance overall exceed domestic deals.our research show financial consolidation substantially decrease number bank firmsduring 1990s almost every nation studied, measure national concentration thebanking industry tend rise. still, national level, structure bank industrycontinues differ greatly, range unconcentrated nation – unite state andgermany – highly concentrate half nation study. in contrast banking,there consistent pattern across country change number insurance firm orconcentration insurance industry 1990s. within security industry, severalspecific activities, certain type underwriting, dominate small number leadinginstitutions. it unclear, however, whether pattern change much 1990s.one important conclusion study financial consolidation help createa significant number large, case increasingly complex, financial institutions. inaddition, firm increasingly operate across national border subject wide range ofregulatory regimes. these observation several important implication i shall return amoment.our work find important force encourage financial consolidation improvement ininformation technology, financial deregulation, globalization financial nonfinancial markets, andincreased shareholder pressure financial performance. because expect force tocontinue, expect financial consolidation continue well, even though pace may beinterrupted swing macroeconomic cycle factors. the study consider possiblefuture scenario conclude likelihood specific future development impossible toassess confidence. my guess various pattern emerge. globally active universalfinancial service provider continue emerge. we also see development offirms specialize production particular component financial service distributionto end-users product obtain specialize providers--providers may exist within oroutside traditional financial service industry. i fully expect large number efficient andprofitable small medium-sized financial institution remain important player unitedstates. i would guess also case many nations. in addition, uncertainty ofsuccessful post-merger integration may well favor use loose form consolidation, asjoint venture strategic alliances.monetary policyone important policy concern design study potential effect financialconsolidation conduct effectiveness monetary policy. the study finds, however, thatfinancial consolidation significantly affect ability central bank achieve theobjectives monetary policy. why this? although answer somewhat complex, let try toexplain briefly. a part research, ask central bank study nation theirexperiences consolidation monetary policy. virtually report experience atmost minor effects, experience somewhat strong effect able toadjust little difficulty. a key reason find even substantial consolidationwe observed, financial market important monetary policy generally remain highlycompetitive. even nation consolidation considerable, competitive behaviorhas generally sustain possibility new firm could enter market relatively lowcost. it also well worth note work suggest development euro beenparticularly helpful maintain competition europe. the euro encourage development ofeuropean money capital markets, thus make number participant particular nation'smarkets le relevant.consolidation could, least theory, affect way change monetary policy transmit tothe real economy. for example, consolidation could potentially alter way bank adjust theavailability price credit customer central bank change stance monetarypolicy. however, central bank generally indicate effect observed. moreover,frequent review data allow central bank take account future change whensetting policy.on balance, despite quite positive results, study recommend central bank shouldremain alert implication future reduction competitiveness market 4bis review 17/2001important monetary policy implementation. similarly, suggest central bank ought tomonitor potential future effect transmission mechanism monetary policy. monetary policyis simply important health economy otherwise.financial riskfinancial consolidation affect risk individual financial institution financialsystem whole. importantly, study conclude exist policy appear adequate containindividual firm systemic risk intermediate term. however, look ahead,the study identify several topic deserve careful attention policymakers.for example, conclude potential effect financial consolidation risk individualfinancial institution mix net result impossible generalize. thus, mustevaluate individual firm risk case-by-case basis. consolidation seem likely reduce riskthrough diversification gains, although even possibility complex. on one hand,diversification gain seem likely consolidation across region give nation acrossnational borders. on hand, consolidation firm shift toward risky asset portfolios,and consolidation may increase operate risk managerial complexity firms.diversification gain may also result consolidation across financial product services,although research suggest potential benefit may fairly limited.in part net impact consolidation individual firm risk unclear, net impact ofconsolidation systemic risk also uncertain. however, i note consolidation clearly hasencouraged creation number large increasingly complex financial institutions. our studysuggests institution become seriously distressed, consolidation attendantcomplexity might increase chance wind organization would difficult ordisorderly.we recommend risk individual firm financial system could reduce bystepped-up effort understand implication work large complex financialinstitution. because institution big fail, i believe regulator develop clearerunderstanding of, example, administration bankruptcy law convention across borders;the coordination supervisory policy within across borders; treatment over-the-counterderivatives, foreign exchange, "market" activity distress situations; role andresponsibilities manager board directors; administration lender-of-last-resortfunction. i say stepped-up discussion need area consideringadverse development normal activity countries. our study help clarify theneed international attention topic.consolidation, especially result increase complexity financial institutions, appear tohave increase demand market participant supply institution ofinformation regard firm's financial condition. the result rise disclosure probablyimproved firm transparency encourage market discipline thus low individual firm riskand perhaps increase financial stability. however, increase complexity firm also madethem opaque, increase size potential augment moral hazard. thus, neteffect consolidation firm transparency market discipline unclear. indeed, conclude thatthere appear considerable room improvement disclosure financial institutions.our study suggest crisis prevention crisis management could improve additionalcommunication cooperation among central banks, finance ministries, financialsupervisors, domestically internationally. indeed, study strongly support exist effort inthese areas. in view, important initiative include proposal improve risk sensitivityof international basel capital accord bank supervision effort aim improve marketdiscipline. a critical element improve risk-based supervision risk-based capital standard thatare tie closely economic risk. capital standard provide anchor virtually othersupervisory regulatory action support improve supervisory marketdiscipline. for example, early intervention policy trigger accurate capital standard couldprove important crisis prevention.payment settlement systemsfinancial consolidation affect market structure payment security settlement wellas banks' internal system procedure payment back-office activities. our study conclude bi review 17/20015that, balance, financial consolidation lead great concentration payment settlementflows among few parties. fortunately, analysis indicate great concentration ofpayment flow appear decrease competition market payment settlementservices. however, suggest would advisable government authority continue tomonitor competition payment system.in contrast, work indicate closely monitor risk implication consolidation inpayment settlement systems. on one hand, consolidation may help improve theeffectiveness institutions' credit liquidity risk controls. for example, increase concentration ofpayment flow may allow institution get comprehensive picture settlement exposure orcreate great ability net internal payment flows. in addition, central bank make majorefforts recent decade contain reduce systemic risk operate promote real-timegross settlement system insist implementation risk control measure netsettlement systems. on hand, consolidation may lead significant shift risk frominterbank settlement systems, risk management may robust transparent, tocustomer bank third-party service providers, risk management practice may hard forusers discern. in addition, extent consolidation result great concentration ofpayment flows, potential effect operational problem may increase.these development imply central bank oversight risk interbank paymentsystems become closely link traditional supervision individual institution safety andsoundness. a result, conclude increase cooperation communication bankingsupervisors payment system overseer may necessary domestically internationally.efficiency, competition, credit flowsour study

??/20011villy bergström: the riksbank’s role economyspeech mr villy bergström, deputy governor sverige riksbank, swedishshareholders association, jönköping, 28 february 2001.* * *some time ago, british journal the economist write world’s central bank theheight power. it easy get impression see enormous amount interestdevoted central bank daily press, broadcast medium economic journals. thisapplies riksbank sweden, european central bank – ecb – and, especially theu.s. central bank, federal reserve alan greenspan foreground.during autumn electoral campaign unite states, number newspaper put forward theview would make difference whether al gore george bush elect president- case greenspan control. when greenspan surprisingly cut americaninstrumental rate 0.5% january two ordinary monetary policy meet federalreserve’s decision-making body, decision applaud headline “greenspansaves world again”. this type statement simply ridiculous. the importance monetary policycannot compare government’s general policy office president. however,things go far central bank regard second government many countries.these comparison are, course, unreasonable.central bank one sometimes two well-defined tasks, namely maintain stable price andoften also safeguard stability financial system. for purpose, central bank haveprimarily one instrument, instrumental rate, sometimes supplement mean exercisingcontrol. the objective central bank activity thus simple clear, arsenal tool islimited. this cannot way compare complex task governments, decision-making situation conflict goal continually change agenda. in sweden, small part ofthe public policy remove government riksdag riksbank theriksdag’s decision, namely responsibility stable price financial stability. everything elseremains government riksdag.the task policy central bank thus way comparable governmentpolicy regard importance degree complexity.however – say – i like strongly emphasise importance highlevel confidence riksbank. it perhaps say important variable tocomply public’s inflation expectations. after all, expectation reflectconfidence. if disturbance affect economy through, instance, oil price shock, thatinflation exceed riksbank’s target 2 per cent, return target take place quicklyif public expectation remain 2 per cent target. despite oil price triple thebeginning 1999 end last year, inflation expectation stay riksbank’s target. ifexpectations also increase, monetary policy must make considerably stringent expelinflationary expectation economy. from point view, important monetary policyis review discussion take place riksbank’s actions, although importance ofthe bank exaggerated.having say provide perspective task riksbank, i like moveon discus economic situation sweden.favourable growthduring past three years, gdp increase sweden average bite 3.5 percent. the rate growth increasingly high possible long term. the swedisheconomy expand approximately half per

share price upto summer last year. however, household’s expectation future seem play crucial rolefor household’s propensity consume.in last years, investment business sector increase quite strongly volume whileit recently investment house construction start increase.the strong growth see recent year high sustainable long term. theriksbank make assessment annual increase production 2- 2.5 per cent possible inthe long term. the amount gdp increase determine increase productivity byhow much employment increase. the large increase production recent year primarily dueto lot unused resource economy problem year early 90s, whenthere substantial drop production. while productivity business sector increased,it primarily increase employment create scope growth. if compare thehigh-inflation period – 20 year mid-1970s, can, however, see afaster increase productivity past five years. we therefore rule possibilitythat threshold fast growth productivity it investment spread broadbasis “old economy” way happen unite states.the strong increase productivity recent year take place without inflation accelerating. thishas surprise many people – even though previously high unemployment, indicate therewere lot unused resource economy, many doubt whether would bepossible many return labour market quickly. month month, seenincreases employment 80-90 000 person annual basis, 70 per cent takenplace increase supply labour. flexibility labour market thus exceededexpectations. open unemployment around 4 per cent, which, high thanthat consider normal 1980s, low many people early 1990s fear wouldbe normal.stable inflation expectationsthe stabilisation inflation expectation low level show riksbank’s inflation target hasattained high credibility. a number factor contribute confirm confidence pricestability objective. high real wage increase despite moderate nominal pay increase one factorthat undoubtedly increase support wage earner price stability objective. the factthat price stability objective confirm law also probably contribute confirmingconfidence inflation target.however, riksbank pedagogical practical problem. monetary policy decision basedon assessment inflation couple year ahead focus achieve inflation targetduring period. this mean often compel increase interest rate despite theactual rate inflation time target. in december last year, instance, theriksbank increase interest 25 point despite inflation 1.4 per cent. decision arethen make basis forecast two-year horizon.the important reason wait inflation actually exceed target inflationexpectations would risk accelerate since take two year monetary policy itsfull effect. and may – rein inflationary expectation – compel tighten upthe economy would do react earlier.the riksbank’s way conduct monetary policy obviously play important role regard tomaintaining confidence price stability. however, forget fiscal policy also beconducted way compatible price stability target. the budget consolidation, bi review ??/20013government’s expenditure ceiling balance target strongly contribute achievingcredibility price stability objective. it first budget consolidation mid-1990shad come quite long way

consider main thrust baseline scenario, moderaterecovery lead private demand, maintained.it true, however, risk baseline scenario become greater. we payingparticular attention two risks: global economic slowdown especially unite states; instabilityin stock market home abroad. let elaborate risks.first, u economic slowdown become increasingly evident. u economic growth significantlyslowed register rate 5 percent, well potential growth rate firsthalf 2000. some slowdown surprise view fast growth precede period.the slowdown may desirable sustainable growth long believe

this, stock price drop recent month japan. this beattributed large part adjustment it stock price global market, bear thefirst risk i mention minute ago.in addition, course domestic element

ongoing recovery. under circumstances, intend examine closely riskelements influence japanese economy.at monetary policy meet january 19, 2001, chairman policy board, governor hayamiissued instruction bank's staff: staff examine possible room improvementsin way liquidity provision market, view ensure smooth function andstability financial market, report result policy board next monetary

explore whether room improve way bankof japan provide market liquidity current directive money market operations, i.e.,encouraging overnight call rate move around 0.25 percent. a long market functionsproperly, directive achieve without problem use exist operational instruments,and monetary ease channel financial market financial system permeateinto market corporate finance.however, mechanism seize time market disruption dysfunctioning financialintermediation. for instance, temporary deficiency corporate finance autumn 1998,when low interest rate prevail interbank money market. with view support corporatefund raising, bank japan adopt several measures, e.g., increase cp operation andcreation temporary lend program.take y2k episode another example. this happen end 1999, possible y2kcomputer problem overshadow financial markets. at time, mount demand new yearliquidity put upward pressure interest rate contract mature beyond year-end,although widespread perception overnight call rate would likely near-zero forsome time zero interest rate policy. the bank japan try stabilize market byannouncing intention provide ample fund mature beyond year-end flexible manner, andin addition, enhance operational capacity introduction new instruments, e.g.,outright purchase sale short-term government securities.these episode clearly demonstrate decision overnight call rate

bank's financial stability rolebut i ought start say something bank's role relation financial stability. a mostof know, regulatory responsibility individual uk financial institution consolidate inthe financial service authority. the bank long regulator individual firm centralbank retain vital interest system whole. we ultimate provider liquidity tobanks markets. this interest reflect formal responsibility overall stability thefinancial system set memorandum understand treasury, bank fsa.responsibility overall stability uk financial system whole sound huge slightlyfuzzy task. it require central bank try see wood tree - identify assesspotential shocks, understand risk distribute within system, look interlinkagesthat might cause problem one institution market spread trigger wide difficulties. giventhe importance london international financial centre, full assessment uk financialstability, must look beyond country. so also take close interest developmentsin overseas international financial markets. the international bond market course keyexample. we try analyse information market price data. but real understandingof late development come talk market participants.credit risk transfer marketsthis particularly important come financial innovation. in recent years, instrument andmarkets transfer credit risk particular focus change. new way beenfound securitise cashflows could previously traded, unbundle credit risk fromloans bonds, re-bundle credit exposure different way create security differentpay-offs. 2bis review 15/2001the distinction loan bond become increasingly blurred. individual loan soldinto secondary loan market, although company remain reluctant see debt trade inthis way. and portfolio loan cash flows, range mortgage payment recordingroyalties, sell special purpose vehicle securitisation tranche different riskcharacteristics maturities, aaa junk, commercial paper long-term bonds.portfolios bond also repackaged, slice dice similar way create collateralised bondobligations.the new area growth present, however, sale asset remove thebalance sheet. rather use credit derivative leave underlie asset thebalance sheet transfer credit risk. the market credit default swap onindividual investment-grade corporate country issuer become liquid, cases, wehave told, liquid underlie bond market. and investment bank price new bondissues increasingly look credit default swap premia well spread relevantbenchmark exist debt. increasingly, also, bank use derivative transfer portion ofthe credit risk loan portfolio rather sell portfolio outright, create so-called 'synthetic'collateralised debt obligations. data size market difficult come by. but survey bythe british bankers' association last year find outstanding notional principal creditderivatives increase three time since 1997 around $600 billion. some contactssuggest market may even large this. but i think safe conclude alreadylarge grow quickly.in wide sense, development market transfer credit risk highly desirable.the institution best place originate loan necessarily best place bear risk. market incredit risk allow financial institution diversify exposure across different sector andgeographic region maintain customer relationships. just important, price liquidmarkets valuable information, help market participant allocate resource andmanage risk efficiently. if work well, market credit risk transfer potential toenhance financial stability efficiency ensure exposure shock diffuse throughoutthe system, single player excessively exposed.unfortunately, however, innovation, generally question i three. myfirst concern lack transparency. these market mean bank need long remainexposed main customer rapidly take large exposure credit without anynew borrow underlie entities. this could make difficult creditors, shareholdersand regulator ass risk. from point view financial stability, concern theseinstruments might equally use concentrate risk disperse it. careful monitor andmanagement counterparty risk exposure firm important market mechanism limit thisrisk. but individual firm know much total exposure counterparty particularcredit transaction market participants. these concern underline importanceof disclosure element new basel proposal intend promote market discipline - i havemore say basel package moment.and disclosure issue level individual firms, imagine aggregate, thefinancial system whole, gap data large. it major challenge theauthorities keep pace financial innovation collection financial statistics. the asiancrisis reveal importance derivative exposure assess country's financial position butthese include bi statistic cross-border lending, even though derivative acommon feature financial market least fifteen years.my second question concern participant market may fully understand, ormay differ understand of, transaction entered; thatuncertainties may remain court country would treat agreements. thisis always issue new markets, market standard legal precedent clear. but someaspects credit transfer market make particularly relevant. purchaser asset-backedsecurities creditor firm securitise asset need take care assure thistransfer legally robust - true sale. an unexpected consolidation asset securitisationvehicle original lender could lead potential loss either party. lawyer do, ofcourse, pay great attention issue i neither question opinion suggest thatthis necessarily problem. but transaction differ investor must due diligence. ido think great tendency rely unthinkingly rat agency area. bi review 15/20013regulators signal intent area new basel consultative package. not willbanks need demonstrate clean break earn reduction capital requirements, willalso need consider operational reputational risk involve securitisations derivativedeals.my third question whether collectively yet proper understand way credittransfer business bridge lending, security insurance markets. contract banking, onthe one hand, insurance markets, other, respect different animals. insecurity markets, time payment essence. an insurance contract, contrast, nottypically commitment timely payment. if insurance company participate market, inpart use reinsurance-type agreement part use derivative agreements, may beimperfect hedge liquidity risks.the relationship borrower lend bank also traditionally different withits bondholders. any problem borrower may service debt typically address indifferent way lender bondholders. this problem surface recently debate aboutwhether restructure include within definition credit event. isda address thequestion clearly desirable market standard agreement set defnitions shouldexist. i think, though, intrinsically difficult standardise definition credit eventcompared price interest rate - underlie derivative product - wheredata take screen lift page ft.market participant therefore pay even great attention documentation - review newand exist transaction regularly see whether change market practice might leave withimperfect hedge basis risks. the 1999 isda standard documentation great advance. butfirms need review carefully transaction enter prior 1999; and, course,documentation valid party sign agreement confirmation beenexchanged. it happy position back middle office struggle keep traders,in particular deal unsigned master agreement backlog confirmations.basel proposalsi mention new consultative package basel committee couple times. thebank course member basel committee, alongside fsa, keen hearviews market proposals. a second theme address today, i would like todiscuss possible impact revise accord security market capital flows.while basel accord ostensibly apply international banks, directly indirectly havea significant impact security firms. indirectly, way change banks' behaviourin response original basel accord profound effect shape development securitiesmarkets last decade. directly extent eu investment firms, capitaladequacy directive, subject capital requirement banks.one principal goal new basel framework is, course, great risk sensitivity. the lack ofsensitivity exist accord one driver increase capital market activity: boththrough disintermediation, company access capital market fund directlyinstead relatively expensive bank loans, securitisation, bank havesought continue originate credit incur capital cost hold balance sheet.the new basel proposal extent succeed align capital closely theunderlying risk, hope significantly reduce incentive pure regulatory arbitrage.while original accord create incentive securitise or, means, move exposure offbalance sheet, simplistic assume adoption new proposal result swingback traditional bank lending. the wide use internal ratings, couple greatertransparency regard compilation assurance quality control regulators, mayin fact contribute 'commoditisation' bank loans. it conceivable developmentcould reduce cost due diligence loan portfolio rat agency buyers. and, turn, itcould mean reduction cost risk transfer securitisation credit derivatives, withbeneficial effect banks' balance sheet liquidity.however happen, banks' internal rat need carry credibility market and, forthis, transparency essential. the transparency proposal basel committee comeunder certain amount fire volume detail. but i would like critic dwell 4bis review 15/2001moment alternative: world bank effectively set capital, assuranceof consistency comparability one bank another. this important debate arekeen listen others' view proposal finalised.turning possible effect basel capital flow generally, include bank lending,undoubtedly new risk sensitivity tend towards change condition certain borrower andissuers. this particularly mark sovereign context, where, base current ratings,approximately twenty seven sovereign borrower incur low bank capital charge versus elevenincurring high one. again i would stress cushion capital bank maintain overand regulatory minimum blur impact basel changes, since thesecircumstances banks' lend price decision constrain regulatory standard.however, sense basel proposal fail purpose unless price ofbank credit good reflect riskiness borrowers. by remove perverse incentive banks, wealso wish establish good incentive borrowers.greater risk sensitivity does, however, carry possible danger, introduction ofpotential 'procyclicality' capital framework. i touch concern inthe past, make apology again. to counteract danger, regulator notallow banks' internal rat reflect optimistic prospect borrower economicupswing: rather, rat need genuinely forward-looking, factor borrowers' likelyperformance economic stress. long run performance record invaluable inestablishing robust borrower different economic circumstances. in way, economicdownturns come prove much shock rat scales.of course, i wish sound complacent regard avoidance 'procyclicality'. capital isafter mean cushion volatility, also refer 'unexpected' loss, measuringthe unexpected something oxymoron. some researcher bank englandrecently review usefulness various predictive model bank problems, unfortunatelyour conclusion moment bank crisis unique way. in area offinancial stability least, appear merit sam goldwyn's admonition oneshould 'never make forecasts, particularly future'. so whilst may able ensure thatthe bank system protect normal up down develop economy, moreextreme event continue require tailor solutions.changing composition bond marketsi speculate possible long-term effect new basel framework security markets. iwant briefly touch third topic significant change market seem likely toface composition bond issued. a recent bi report trend collateral inwholesale financial

macro-economic perspective, sound government finance clearly desirable. smallergovernment borrow requirement also encourage private sector issuance "crowding in" torevert terminology similar debate early 1980s.for financial markets, however, shrink government bond market number potentialimplications could relevant financial stability.first, government bond market tend volatile recent years. volatility makesgovernment bond le reliable hedge benchmark pricing, market participantshave explore instruments, swap security issue public sectoragencies. indeed, us, european prospectively japanese

business before. the growth european high yield market past fewyears fall price many issue second half last year, mean many youwill need remind this.finally, reduce supply government bond could important implication collateralmarkets, currently play key role. wide use non-government security collateralcould result flight quality crisis might leave lender expose credit risk, orborrowers liquidity risk try meet margin calls. large haircut address risk part.more generally, wide use exposure net well-managed prudently design centralcounterparties may desirable future.conclusioni think

settlementsystems).–access supervisory information help authority good calibrate monetary policy(e.g. case “headwinds” confront u economy recovery theearly 1990s).–the central bank may institution (especially emerge market economies) withthe necessary independence credibility implement rigorous prudential policy andlimit governmental interference.there are, however, also argument side:–information exchange require function group within institution;–given blur distinction different type financial institutions, retentionof supervisory responsibility within central bank may give rise perception thelender last resort function extended, consequent risk moral hazard.–the central bank may become powerful independent endow abroad range functions.–there could conflict interest monetary policy, central bank induce beexcessively expansionary order head weakness individual financial institutions.in terms, obviously “right” answer debate. individual observer may theirown preferences, end day, answer probably depend country-specificcircumstances. for example, independent political industry pressure separatesupervisor be? how scarce relevant skills? and blur distinction betweendifferent type financial intermediary become? some, charles goodhart,1 argue thatthese consideration lead conclusion case combine supervisory monetarypolicy responsibility central bank generally strong emerge markets.but whatever answer question “who supervise?”, necessary define tasksclearly way tool available discharge them. one risk present trendto remove supervision task central bank central bank could leave aresponsibility overall financial stability neither clearly define support thenecessary power access information discharge it. so separate supervisory authoritiesare established, important set structure promote necessary exchange 1c a e goodhart: “the organisational structure financial supervision”, fsi occasional paper no 1, bis, basel, 2000. bi review 13/20013information coordination. much attention give subject unite kingdom,japan country new supervisory structure put place.my argument lecture, however, even developments, basic conceptualframework promotion financial stability fully adequate. it tend see theinterrelationship monetary policy financial supervision important managingcrises, rather origination. there sufficient focus genesis financialinstability.it framework i wish try broaden. my conjecture relationship betweenmonetary financial stability run deep often imagined. more specifically, pursuit ofprice stability sometimes allow financial imbalance arise inadvertently, sow seedsof subsequent instability. conversely, pursuit prudential objectives, institution institution, cantake inadequate account feedback mechanism exacerbate macroeconomic cycles. allowme elaborate points.beyond current debate: genesis financial instabilityi begin two observation support conjecture monetary financial stability cannotbe put separate compartment separately pursued.my first observation since 1980s inflation largely conquered, yet financialinstability has, anything, intensified. it take form price misalignment andwidespread financial distress, industrial country emerge market economies. exchangerate relationship highly volatile, “bubbles” appear emerge occasionallyburst property equity markets. bond yields, too, vary wide range. in financialsystems, highly damage crisis nordic countries, japan, east asia inmexico.several common feature episode instability worthy comment. first, occurredin circumstance inflation either threat, downward trend. in liberalisedfinancial system, absence inflation therefore necessary sufficient condition avoidfinancial instability. secondly, systemic problem cause individual institution get intodifficulty, affect others contagion. in cases, whole set institution act orless way, discipline supervisory authority certainly know wasgoing on. thirdly, portfolio behaviour question encourage expectation underlyingmacroeconomic condition – interest rate growth rate – could extrapolate uncritically intothe future.my second observation several combination monetary financialregime 20th century, none conspicuously successful achievingsimultaneously price stability stability liberalise financial system.–under gold standard, single anchor, gold convertibility, monetaryand financial stability. monetary stability fact define preservation theconvertibility currency gold. likewise, individual financial institution assurethey could always mobilise gold (or asset convertible gold) redeem liabilities.the gold standard example liberalise financial system quantity ofgold act visible exogenous constraint monetary authority bank alike. but itdid prevent wave excessive expansion, follow instability bust. in otherwords, system, unmanaged, inadequate discipline inherent tendency toexcess financial markets.–the interwar year saw replacement brittle discipline gold standard theemergence fiat monetary standards. this lead close identification monetary policywith objective price stability. at time, loosen constraint creditexpansion, nothing prevent widespread financial instability. in wake theturbulence early 1930s, country introduce strict regulation commercialbanking, sometimes financial activity well.–the bretton wood system post-war period de facto dollar standard. giventhe experience interwar period, involve heavy regulation domestic andinternational financial transactions. the system deliver monetary stability, least aslong u authority able keep inflationary force check. it also deliver 4bis review 13/2001financial system stability. but heavy cost repress financial system interms efficiency resource ultimately allocated.–the float exchange rate follow breakdown bretton wood system sawa search alternative monetary anchors, mean discipline financialsystem within liberal environment. a i note moment ago, approach pursuedwas segregate pursuit two objectives. for pursuit price stability, moneysupply target first object attention, prove unsatisfactory, anincreasing number central bank resort “constrained discretion” inflationtargeting. a far financial system stability concerned, answer find inintensified prudential supervision. this follow several damage crisis occur thewake financial liberalisation. the focus supervision le permit activity offinancial intermediaries, prudential risk management pursue combination ofbalance sheet constraints, supervisory oversight, and, market discipline. until now, however,this approach still deliver durable financial stability.the forego brief review lead conjecture basis lecture: combinationof liberalise financial system fiat standard monetary rule base exclusively term ofinflation sufficient secure financial stability. this deny inflation often source offinancial instability. it certainly is. inflation cloud distort relative prices, bias investmenttowards inflation hedges, threaten get control, require drastic monetarytightening, wrench adjustment come wake.yet converse necessarily true. there numerous example period therestoration price stability provide fertile grind excessive optimism. “irrational exuberance”can drive asset price unrealistic levels, even price currently trade good servicesexhibit sign inflation.the reason far seek. in fiat money standard, supply credit endogenous, governedby reaction function authorities. if reaction function respond solely ishappening inflation price current output, little prevent emergence cycle inthe price real financial asset enter inflation measure.if absence inflation not, itself, sufficient ensure financial stability, authorities’reaction function prevent financial imbalances, look contain build-up?the answer is, course, prudential regulation. however, tool prudential regulation arethemselves base perception risk independent credit asset pricecycle. if prudential regulation depend assessment collateral, capital adequacy on, andif valuation asset distorted, bulwark build-up financial imbalance beweakened. put simple terms, even necessary prudential rules, system may haveenough built-in stabiliser avoid financial instability.this point make apparent close look anatomy financial instability. in astylised financial cycle, exogenous development set expansion credit. it oftenimproved economic prospects, due technological innovation, implementation reform – orindeed many genuine, real factors. once way, credit expansion fuel acceleration ofoutput increase asset prices. such development appear boost return low risk,leading credit expansion increase leverage system. if mechanism ofprudential oversight – comprise markets, counterparties official supervisor – work well,excessive leverage avoided. in benign circumstances, financial institution weatherany subsequent downturn. but extension balance sheet go far, eventual reversalcan abrupt severe, widespread bankruptcies, substantial damage financialintermediaries.this kind financial cycle easy identify ex post. it purely domestic nature, bedriven international capital flows. example find nordic country follow theliberalisation 1980s; japan 1980s 1990s; recent experience numberof east asian economies. but much hard identify ex ante.i draw first five conclusion forego analysis, important i want say inthe final part lecture, concern policy challenges.first, financial industry unlike sector feedback mechanism supply priceis le effective, even perverse. in traditional industry, expansion supply put immediatedownward pressure price, squeeze profit margins, reduce incentive invest bi review 13/20015encouraging exit industry. in financial sector, price fall supply creditincreases interest rate. this effect push asset value appear tostrengthen balance sheet borrower intermediary alike. rise asset value encourageleverage credit expansion contribute increase credit growth. conversely, fallingvalues lead deleveraging reduction credit growth.second, fundamental value, basis decision buy sell, lend borrow aremade, extremely hard assess. we course decompose value expect stream ofreturns, discount rate risk premium. but take u far. to important extentvalue, like beauty, eye beholder. it assessment subject powerful wave ofshared optimism pessimism. investor prone see new paradigms, force new fact fitentrenched perceptions. this help explain exchange rate among major currency exhibitwide volatility, individual stocks, even stock indices, move large amount even inthe absence significant new information.my third conclusion cyclical upswings typically sustain overly optimistic expectations,and mute perception risk. a expansion proceeds, risk spread usually narrow, asset value arebuoyant loan-loss provision reduced. with benefit hindsight, look perverse, sincewe see risk imbalance actually accumulate late stage upswing,only materialise ensue recession. the fact financial intermediary good atassessing relative risk point time, project evolution risk financial cycle.unfortunately, however, perception risk, asset value lie behind them, thatconstitute raw material prudential control operate.fourth, widespread financial instability typically arise exposure common, rather thanidiosyncratic factors. the model individual institution get difficulty affect thesystem contagion, exception rather rule. more commonly, financial systemsencounter crisis many institution operate similar way, collectively fail tosee common macroeconomic threat. the financial cycle typical cause. financialintermediaries, supervisors, fail take adequate account emerge imbalances, arelulled false sense security apparent strength asset prices.fifthly, monetary policy lose much effectiveness deal recession banks, badlyoverexposed result precede boom, unable lend. i hardly need belabour pointto asian audience. a well-functioning financial system essential successful monetary policybecause pivotal role transmission monetary policy measures.policy challengesif argument far valid, achieve elusive twin goal financial monetary stability willrequire mutually reinforce anchor put place two spheres. moreover, require anenhanced appreciation interdependence policy two areas. i deal two-way channel inter-dependence turn, start prudential regulation goal financialstability.a key element recognise role common factor generate financial distress, theneed find good way identify tackle emerge imbalances. supervisor recognisingthis, increasingly focus development generate systemic, rather idiosyncratic,difficulties. this mean look correlation risk across institutions, rather factor thatthreaten individual failure. it also mean prudential control calibrate systemicrelevance individual institutions, rather all.we think analogously paradigm shift bring mean/variance portfolioanalysis 1950s. portfolio analysis focus aggregate risk/return characteristic awhole portfolio, characteristic individual securities. similarly, concern thefinancial system ought overall efficiency resilience, performance ofindividual intermediaries. this easy shift perspective supervisor make, give theirnatural focus institution level. nevertheless, shift become apparent thepublic statement leader supervisory profession.another area change supervisory perspective take place lie great recognitionof time property risk financial cycle, endogenous character risk withrespect collective decision lenders. there two problem here. one fact 6bis review 13/2001underlying risk build expansion leverage continues, apparent risk declines, therise collateral values. the second decision extend withdraw credit perverseexternalities: rational one lender act isolation become systemically threaten ifundertaken lender together.the answer seem lie strong incentive build capital cushion good times, bereduced bad times. this would good reflect underlie riskiness banks’ portfolio wouldprovide built-in mechanism dampen financial amplification business cycle.i course aware difficulty implement proposals. fluctuation regulatorycapital would provide opportunity regulatory arbitrage supervisory forbearance. nevertheless,there certain option would limit dangers. for example, provision practice couldcertainly make forward-looking present. loan-to-value ratio could adapt thelight potentially unsustainable movement asset price base conservative, lesscyclically-sensitive measure value. more generally, financial intermediary could induce bytheir supervisor adopt critical attitude optimistic scenario particularly booms. stresstesting essential technique connection. many technique i refer toshould find place supervisory oversight pillar new basel capital accord.lastly, supervisory technique need take balance view utility market force anaid stabilise behaviour. disclosure transparency undoubtedly facilitate exercise ofcounterparty discipline. they important part robust financial architecture, thirdpillar new basel capital accord recognises. there still much asia raise disclosurestandards allow market provide necessary discipline. asia’s crisis starklesson sweep problem carpet solve them. i hardly need remind thisaudience that. at time, one aware market participant may subject tocollective misperceptions risk. and even risk correctly perceived, private response may beappropriate viewpoint systemic stability. private behaviour affect expectationsof official action (moral hazard); short term horizon induce nature contracts; differinginterests principal agents; generally combine effect force thatmake commonly term “herd behaviour”.let turn, finally, role monetary policy. i argue excessive credit expansionduring upswings often contribute accumulation financial imbalances, imbalance whoseunwinding associate bout damage instability. if i right this, questionimmediately arise whether monetary policy one objective limit theaccumulation imbalance or, simply put, prevent emergence financial excesses.this become hotly debate subject monetary economics recent years, end thedebate sight.on one hand, powerful argument say monetary policy focusexclusively consumer price inflation concern asset price financialimbalances generally. a proliferation objective recipe confusion. moreover, canthe authority distinguish unsustainable sustainable evolution asset prices? even theyfelt confident particular development unsustainable, could muster politicalsupport resist it, especially induce economic slowdown? finally, howcould one recognise development sufficiently advance deflate without damagingconsequences would inevitably blame central bank?nevertheless, seem counsel despair say nothing done. the cost uncontrolledfinancial cycle sufficiently large avenue resist least explored. at aminimum, seem reasonable suggest that, formulate monetary policy aim inflationobjective, central bank take explicit account impact financial development thebalance risks. when credit expansion rapid asset price grow substantially fast thanthe price current output, might appropriate authority aim price increase thelower part target corridor, else aim slow overall rate credit expansion. inparticular, rapid credit growth prompt central bank look extra hard inflation risks.such policy, undertake inflation threat seem remote, would doubt characterisedas excessively cautious. yet remember cost financial crisis theevent turn much great output forgo short term restrainingunsustainable growth. bi review 13/20017conclusionlet end recapitulate main point argument. many institutional actor involve inthe quest financial monetary stability. they share common goal, approach fromdifferent perspectives.i hope i persuade interrelationship perspective broad anddeeper usually thought. monetary policy prudential supervision interact way thatincreasingly demand unified, mutually reinforce framework. much progress make indeveloping framework recent years. nevertheless, much remain done.the preservation stability financial system require understand macroeconomicdevelopments interact institutional behaviour prudential norm support undermineequilibrating tendencies. and implementation monetary policy require understand thefact consequence monetary policy economic behaviour go much wide theirimpact consumer price index.this much simply matter what, whether responsibility supervision ofbanks locate inside outside central bank. one could even argue loss supervisoryresponsibilities central bank prompt healthy re-examination mean systemicstability, achieve world many actors.systemic stability remain key challenge financial authority worldwide. nobody, least anasian audience, need remind cost crisis disruption financial sector. anenormous amount achieve improve capacity financial system contribute toeconomic growth development. the task ensure adequate defence place

at least glean projection ofequity analysts, who, one must presume, obtain insight corporate managers.according one prominent survey, three- five-year average earn projection athousand analysts,

even decisionmakers somewhat risk averse, process retrenchment canoccur. thus, although prospective long-term return new high-tech investment may change little,increased uncertainty induce high

economics-getuliovargas foundation, rio de janeiro, 26 june 2001.* * *ito state standpoint advance: i believe completely new financial architecture tobe necessary. i tend one people want improve free market economysystem, also want preserve stand test time. much would already begained free market institutional rule apply consistently.iithere cannot therapy without precede diagnosis. we find go wrong,and why, discuss remedies. the recent crisis undoubtedly reveal theshortcomings system. a i see it, every case – despite individual difference – thesewere due mixture economic policy error inadequate underlie conditions.in almost recent crises, economic policy error seem same:(cid:1) long period fix exchange rate (followed loss external competitiveness, risein interest rates, considerable set-back growth rates, devaluation currencies);(cid:1) increase inflation rates;(cid:1) increase budget deficits.this problem address bundesbank research study publish april1999 monthly report. the bundesbank base research econometric procedures, apply todevelopments major emerge market past 25 years. the main conclusion reach bythe study were(cid:1) currency crisis result pure chance pure speculation;(cid:1) economic fundamental play important role;(cid:1) that, particular, year precede outbreak crisis, macroeconomicindicators deteriorate perceptibly;(cid:1) hand, although systematic link fundamental crises, theindicators able forecast crisis every case (there may warningsignals follow crisis, may crisis precede signals).these conclusion quite important crisis prevention. above beyond that, whetherundesirable economic policy development expand crisis hinge mainly shortcomingsin underlie conditions. these include(cid:1) weak financial sectors;(cid:1) tendency towards nepotism, cronyism, corruption;(cid:1) distort bail-out expectation part market participants, include moral hazard;(cid:1) insufficient information current developments;(cid:1) insufficient surveillance imf contradict action institutions;(cid:1) disregard advice agreements, accompany poor co-operation theinternational organisations. 2bis review 59/2001iiiwhat reform proposal “financial architecture” shaped? let startwith design economic policy. this clearly matter financial architecture far thefundamental characteristic concerned.first all: exchange rates. the interest fixed-versus-floating rate debate issue onwhich simple “yes” “no” answer. the choice exchange-rate system bejudged reference country’s state development, economic benchmark politicalcircumstances.experience suggest stable exchange rate generally desirable. in special, well-definedcases, exchange rate peg useful get domestic inflation control inmaintaining financial stability.in long run, however, country give priority peg rate must ascertain whether ornot keep internal flexibility sufficiently high enable make necessary adjustments.in particular, priority give fix rates, monetary policy completely subordinate theexchange-rate target. moreover, much room budgetary policy. it conduct ina stability-oriented manner order keep domestic external confidence. thus, stableexchange rate sustainable correspond fundamental adequately streamlined. apegged currency alone cannot guarantee market confidence last basis.on hand, fundamental country fairly sound, and, particular, monetarypolicy conduct basis "own" nominal anchor (i.e. independently, strongsense responsibility firm view stability) float exchange rate may support necessaryadjustments country emerge advance economy. in general, float rate,the room manoeuvre larger. but careful: flexible rate panacea, asubstitute keep house order.it may ask point whether european monetary integration model emergingregion. there simple answer that. in view, one aware mainly three points:firstly, decision adopt single currency inevitably political one. secondly, monetary unioncannot cure otherwise deficient economies. and thirdly, monetary region clearly requiresinternal openness imply convergence intense competition. some radical adjustment maybe necessary.ivmy next point: liberalisation capital movements.in principle, fact free movement capital contribute optimum allocation ofresources open question. but must imply liberalisation costs.one important conclusion recent crisis focus so-called “sequencing” bestrengthened. that means: liberalisation country financial marketsand, particular, bank system sound structure healthy condition. knowingthe risks, would irresponsible take second step first.on hand, doubt, point view, capital control realisticalternative open capital markets. the reintroduction maintenance administrative control anotherwise liberal environment pose fundamental problems.firstly, market participant always contrive avoid control and, anything, moreimaginative control authorities.secondly, capital restriction expensive implement cases. to effective, theymust apply quite broadly may therefore also hind desirable capital movements. what ismore, may also delay necessary development efficient financial sector.however, completely rule possibility consider temporary restriction inexceptional cases. limit control capital inflow help prevent crisis confine potentialwithdrawals. such controls, however, efficient clearly understand interimmeasure, complement sound policy well-designed prudential regulations. bi review 59/20013vas far underlie condition concerned, allow point continueto critical especially fraught problems: standard codes, transparency, conditionalityand ownership, private sector involvement, institutional co-ordination.but first all, let come back topic financial supervision. i think, adequate supervision isthe sine qua non robust system.(cid:1) if rule balance inherent risk asset domestic foreign resourcesare insufficient, encourage inappropriate allocation asset bank systembecomes inefficient;(cid:1) foreign debt adequately structure worst-case scenarios, – sooner orlater – may occur almost country;(cid:1) maturity structure banks’ foreign liability dangerously bias towardshort-term positions, denomination liability foreign currency ratherrisky face domestic currency asset (withdrawals lead collapse).let say this: with prudent bank structure appropriate supervision, capitalinflows investment realistic, close optimum. actual crisis could mitigatedor even avoided. by way, i think bank supervision anything withrestrictions over-regulation. on every highway need highway code, city need acertain minimum number traffic lights. otherwise, movement could end disaster.vinow “transparency”.this area probably great change past year – notonly case international institutions, also country themselves. there asignificant expansion publication surveillance report disclosure information onlending.for improve financial market transparency, fact important comprehensive information bemade available analyse evaluate thoroughly. data contribute stabilise globalfinancial system. they strengthen operational efficiency markets, investor good able tomake appropriate risk assessments, and, hopefully, contagion risk associate herd instinctwill reduced.all clear. again, however, let signal warnings:(cid:1) transparency work counter-productively. it limit whereconfidentiality internal openness indispensable fruitful discussion optimalresults.(cid:1) moreover, indicate above, one careful detail information mayperhaps evaluate carelessly. and imf abstain comment andevery number. there guarantee certain indicator always give right signals,and crisis could trigger would otherwise take place.(cid:1) too frequent information may favour short-termism, interfere economic culture.permanently look short-term profits, instance, may counter-productive thelonger-run.(cid:1) last least, i sometimes feel lack information butan abundance. in fact, staff spend time sort useful uselessinformation (and sometimes produce new paper even information).viion “standards codes” general: this complicate matter. 4bis review 59/2001on one hand, probably correct say recent currency crisis due, least part,to careless "immature" pattern behaviour. in respect, standard code set criterion andrequire country "behave correctly". the basic idea draw "rules" thus makingthe interaction internationally link market easier, predictable perhaps also "just", issurely wrong either. i give full support rule serve efficiency markets(for instance: eliminate corruption combat money laundering).on hand, problem might hamper desire success:(cid:1) there 60 standard codes. over 10,000 assessment would tobe prepare order monitor 183 imf countries. this simply cannot bemanaged. besides, cost would reasonable proportion benefit.(cid:1) not standard code relation economics. for reason, too, prioritieshave set.(cid:1) furthermore, always compel reason everything do inaccordance one give standard. be really indispensable precondition themarkets function efficiently?(cid:1) it also difficult answer question whether really rule may wellenhance efficiency perhaps ignore cultural diversity well.thus, conclusion point is: we careful, carry thing far, notat costs.viiiafter “standards codes”, logical next topic “conditionality ownership”. a know,the imf always subject criticism set condition lend toodemanding, "imposes" programmes, even put "gag" borrow country andrestricts sovereignty.some criticism justified. it is, fact, counterproductive borrow country notsufficiently involved, priority take account programme detail thatthe country question long freedom action. in respect, imf wrongpath. thing change present, however. i fully support strategy focus future moreon objective secure borrow country's ownership dispense detailedrequirements implementation (technical assistance continue however).but let u deceive ourselves: the freedom patient limit case. it may become evensmaller, imf keep completely. the constraint fact may overwhelming. diseasesare likely take toll. on hand, certainly realistic chance heal powersare work. these powers, however, actively support patient (with without theimf).ixmuch do regard “private sector involvement” (psi). but yet arrive atfinal conclusions. sometimes seem matter crisis solution. in fact, however, isnot. it is, view, predominantly matter crisis prevention. that manner ofoperating event crisis crucial influence expectations. these, turn, determine theactions investor early stage thus scale risk susceptibility crisis.short-term financial assistance imf event crisis may essential, thecountries directly affect and, result contagion, rest world. a regular bail-out ofthe private sector, however, likely counter-productive:(cid:1) it may detrimental effect risk-awareness private investor obscure theoptimal allocation resources;(cid:1) large-scale financial package may support unsustainable exchange rates;(cid:1) large-scale finance imf bring financial burden cannot cover bythe fund’s resources; bi review 59/20015(cid:1) and, last least, endless finance may encourage resistance implementation ofreforms.my conclusion point: the role imf predominantly catalytic one. for thatpurpose, fund’s main instrument convince advice programmes, money.priority give private market participants. the leitmotif fund “bail-in”,not “bail-out”.admittedly, easy find right balance “bail-in” avoidance contagion.now, fresh idea lerrick meltzer. they propose, i understand it, thatmarkets le leave alone event crisis (bail-in), that, nevertheless, thefund offer minimum safety net avoid panic (by purchase private creditors’ asset awell-defined discount). at first sight, look good. i suspect, however, partly shall thesame deficiency mention – new wrapping.xmy last point, although le important, “institutional co-ordination”. activity private marketparticipants fine, sufficient. we need public activity organise legislative basisand provide public good order maximise global benefits.let’s look imf world bank. there many suggestion improve theireffectiveness, merge institution abolish altogether. i cannot say iparticularly like extremes.rather, change global economic setting, imf need clear mandate. this apply muchto crisis problem demarcate imf’s institutional role vis-à-vis world bank.the role imf world bank need strengthened. they act adviser onmacroeconomic, structural development policy issues, role lender limitedto catalyst. these objective consistent article agreement imfand world bank take due account change environment since bretton woodsinstitutions set up: float exchange rates, liberalisation capital movements, globalisation ofmarkets, heighten awareness poverty problems.the imf design monetary institution, whereas world bank developmentorganisation. a blur responsibility undesirable merger two. theimplications lend logically follow division responsibilities. the imf shouldconfine balance payment fund short-term liquidity assistance. the world bank shouldfocus project finance sectoral loans. this would involve redistribution task theimf world bank: imf least confine long-term structural loans, worldbank avoid participate crisis packages. moreover, combat poverty developmentpolicy objective therefore come within purview world bank. the imf play partin combat poverty foster monetary stability thereby contribute non-inflationarysustainable growth. bi review 59/20011david dodge: canada’s monetary policy approach: work

low inflation end itself, rather mean end – theend advancement economic well-being canadians.of course, low-inflation policy sufficient guarantee best economic outcome forcanada. fiscal prudence policy aim improve structure flexibility theeconomy also essential. but low inflation provide crucial underpin well-functioningeconomy.if goal monetary policy achieve preserve low inflation, would central bank goabout it?anchors monetary policywhen central bank raise low key policy interest rate, set motion series eventsthat start financial markets, work change spending, output, employment,and end effect rate inflation. this series event know transmissionmechanism monetary policy.the problem transmission process lengthy. so take time monetary policy action toaffect output inflation. some effect felt relatively quickly. but full effect felt forsome time – 3 6 quarter case output 6 8 quarter case inflation. thismeans that, central banker go day-to-day business implement monetary policy,they must look ahead anticipate likely happen road. they work withassumptions make judgment call future economic development time andfinal outcome monetary policy action take. all involve considerable uncertainty.this said, look around world, different way focus conduct ofmonetary policy give people great comfort thing track, thus help tie or"anchor" inflation expectations.most country adopt kind explicit target anchor monetary policy. themajor exception unite states, statement general intention respect inflation 2bis review 59/2001has, recent years, prove sufficient anchor monetary policy, light u.s. federal reserve'sstrong credibility.in term explicit anchors, target monetary aggregates, fix exchange rates,and inflation targets. . . . target monetary aggregatesmost industrialize countries, include canada, past try target rate moneygrowth.however, canada unite states, target money growth prove aneffective monetary anchor. deregulation financial innovation weaken reliability ofmoney measures, relationship money growth rate inflation provenunstable. but still look money information content current future developmentsin output inflation.for practical purposes, then, two option today term explicit anchor formonetary policy: fix exchange rate target inflation.. . . fix exchange ratefor many countries, especially small ones, tie currency large neighbour majortrading partner history low inflation one way achieve low rate inflation.there are, course, different form fix exchange rates. they range 'softer'systems – peg – 'harder' fix lie opposite extreme free floatingcurrency. these hard fix currency board, outright use another country's currency("dollarization"), full monetary union.pegged exchange rate adjust (that is, revalue devalued) mostwidely use anchor since second world war. they prevail order brettonwoods system, establish war last early 1970s, finallycollapsed face increasingly open financial markets, large capital flows, u.s. expansionarypolicies.the problem fixed, adjustable, exchange rate guarantee value ofthe currency relative currencies, thus purchase power, rise fall. forexample, currency could come downward pressure peg level linewith country's economic situation (say, large grow fiscal deficit debts).should market begin question authorities' commitment peg, domestic andforeign investor would scramble get out, trigger currency crisis. there shortage suchexamples recent history: repeat episode latin america since 1980s, crisis europe in1992 1993, southeast asia russia 1997–98.because peg prove problematic, realistic approach would involve adopt one themore rigid fixes. i say later. but let move third option foran explicit monetary policy anchor – inflation targets.. . . target inflationamong number industrialize country that, like canada, operate float currency, therehas tendency past decade adopt explicit inflation target anchor formonetary policy. the tendency evident among grow number emerging-marketeconomies recently move flexible exchange rate follow collapse peggedrates. the objective consistently maintain low stable inflation, flexible exchange ratehelps economy adjust shocks.why inflation target work guide monetary policy?in framework, central bank target rate inflation – say, 2 per cent – several quartersahead. then, base judgment current project strength demand relative theeconomy's production capacity, well implication future inflation relative target, itwill take action – long lag involve – ensure target achieve downthe road. bi review 59/20013the value inflation target anchor: canadian experiencein canada, explicit inflation target jointly introduce government canada thebank canada 1991. since 1995, goal keep trend inflation inside targetrange 1 3 per cent.in adopt targets, bank expect would provide useful framework within toassure canadian inflation would remain low stable, thus lead le fluctuation outputand employment. we also expect target would provide precise goal tomeasure conduct monetary policy, thus help increase bank's public accountability.after decade experience, clear inflation target prove effective way ofkeeping inflation low, inflation target provide anchor inflation expectations.moreover, target supply bank mechanism assessing, deal with,demand pressure future inflation way help keep economy even keel.indeed, already evidence pronounce up down economic activity, sotypical past, diminished.here's target help bank ‘stabilize' economy. when demand push theeconomy's capacity produce seem likely put upward pressure future inflation relative tothe target, bank raise interest rates. this help moderate demand reduce inflationpressures. equally importantly, demand weak seem likely put downward pressure onfuture inflation relative target, bank low interest rates, thus provide room theeconomy expand.in short, emphasis inflation control allow bank support growth economy isweak prevent overheat economy strong push capacityconstraints. now, go back i say begin – monetary policycontributes sound economic performance mean focus low inflation.with low-inflation climate encourage initiative canadian business improve costcontrol, efficiency, productivity, mark fiscal progress level government, oureconomy perform well past several years. and generate solid gain inemployment incomes.in light important economic social benefit low inflation inflation target havedelivered, federal government bank canada recently agree retain current targetof 1 3 per cent. to increase chance inflation stay inside range, bank beaiming expressly 2 per cent midpoint. moreover, new agreement run five years, insteadof three, end 2006. both change help increase predictability toreassure canadian low inflation continue feature domestic economic scene.now, let u see exchange rate fit canada need float currency.why need float exchange rate?if want set goal inflation or, what's relevant (since today industrial countriespursue similar low-inflation objective), want run monetary policy suit distincteconomic circumstances, need monetary independence. monetary independence exist onlywithin flexible exchange rate system.the real value float currency canada lie help economy absorb theimpact external shocks. a classic example would sharp movement value exportsrelative imports, occur 1997–98, world commodity price plummet thewake asian crisis. in instance, downward movement value canadian dollarhelped offset loss suffer commodity producers. more importantly, itstrengthened competitiveness canadian manufacturers. they, turn, able expandproduction offset downward pressure output income decline thecommodity sector. in way, national economy able adjust quickly, lessoverall fluctuation output employment, exchange rate move.consider would happen fix exchange rate. with exchange rate allowedto move, domestic wage price would decline restore external competitiveness. 4bis review 59/2001and since neither wage price flexible enough adjust quickly, much adjustmentwould come decline output employment.in world capital free move across national borders, float exchange rate alsohelp absorb pressure stem large capital flow facilitate anynecessary economic adjustments. indeed, i would remind decision float canadiandollar 1950, 1970, take context large capital inflow (and risingcommodity prices) cause concern inflationary effect economy andwere put strong upward pressure currency.the key point canada cannot insulate external shocks. whether ona flexible fix exchange rate, reality shock require domestic adjustment. and,in end, adjustment make – one way another. but, without flexibility floatingcurrency provide, take longer, difficult, cost overall term lose outputand jobs.now, exchange rate move down, way anchor expectationsabout value. otherwise, freedom currency float could, context downwardmovement, undermine confidence value world market home. under approach tomonetary policy, domestic inflation target serf all-important anchor exchangerate.the inflation target float currency work well together – indeed, reinforce other. andthey significant economic benefit canada.these days, advantage monetary policy approach base inflation target supportedby flexible exchange rate regime increasingly recognize others around world. andcanada often hold model. why call country go back peg ourcurrency u.s. dollar enter currency union unite states?pegging would mean lose macroeconomic benefit flexible exchange rate, without gainingthe assurance exchange rate move future. so people talk aboutnow currency union unite states.on face it, prospective gain arrangement would seem attractive. afterall, canada one open economy world, export 40 per cent outputand import much. moreover, 80 per cent trade unite states. so, yes, byadopting u.s. dollar, canadian could save transaction cost convert nationalcurrencies hedge currency movements. there could also advantageslinked improve efficiency result reduce exchange rate uncertainty.the crucial question, however, whether save arrangement would compensatefor loss monetary policy independence loss buff flexible exchangerate provide economic shocks.research bank canada many outside analyst confirm canada benefitssignificantly separate currency float exchange rate. it true canada andthe unite state share many characteristics. but come economic structure, aremany important differences. not economy far open unite states, butcanada also dependent raw materials. moreover, net exporter primarycommodities, american net importers. sharp swing world commodity price muchgreater impact economic activity canada and, importantly, affect u differently thanour neighbours. it clear structure economy sufficiently distinct theunited state flexible exchange rate play key role facilitate domestic economicadjustment shocks.from strictly economic perspective, always possible that, future time, structure ofour two economy could converge point benefit common currency could outweighthe macroeconomic cost abandon flexible exchange rate. but also possible thosestructures could diverge (if trade lead great specialization). we simply know. iwould emphasize, however, crucial factor extent integration betweencanada unite states, rather close far apart economic structure are, orwill be.former bank canada governor thiessen put well last december say "as long aswe remain major producer primary commodities, long want pursue separate bi review 59/20015economic policy suit circumstance require differ monetaryconditions, shock-absorber element float currency serve u well."i fully associate view appearance last month house ofcommons stand committee finance. i said: "it's quite clear stage evolution, afloating currency canada vis-à-vis unite state . . . great advantage thestructures economy differ."thus, one may argue that, time circumstances, float currency theright solution canada. but, i say that, give structure economy, andfor far future i see, advantage flexible exchange rate, anchor adomestic inflation target, clearly outweigh benefit currency union. and certainlyalways outweigh peg.i hope i make clear today canada's monetary policy approach flexible exchangerate, anchor inflation target, works. there need fix it.let conclude presentation give late read economy.recent economic developmentssince late last year, pace economic expansion canada slow substantially, mainlybecause u.s. demand product much weak anticipated. canadianmanufacturers, particularly motor vehicles, electronic products, telecommunication equipment,have make significant adjustments. at time, final domestic demand canadahas remain firm, buttress underlie strength energy sector, retail sales, housing,non-residential construction, service industries. national account data end marchand recent indicator show economy expand moderate pace since thelast quarter 2000.as look ahead, see domestic demand canada continue grow, support easingthat take place monetary conditions, recent tax cut boost disposable incomes,gains employment, project completion current inventory adjustment.we also continue see u.s. demand growth pick second half 2001, give substantialreductions interest rates, relatively high level consumer spending, expect end theinventory correction, recently announce tax cut (which include rebate begin july). butbecause ongoing weakness u.s. capital investment, still uncertainty exacttiming strength project pickup u.s. growth second half year.while uncertainty pose risk canada, continue expect pace economicexpansion pick second half year strengthen somewhat thecourse 2002.total cpi inflation recently top bank's 1 3 per cent target range becauseof rise energy prices, include high electricity rates. total cpi inflation probably remain volatileover next couple months, move 2 per cent end year, ifworld price crude oil natural gas stabilize around current levels.the main risk canadian economic outlook continue possibility projectedpickup u.s. growth may delayed. at time, even though price crude oil andnatural gas ease recent peaks, bank need stay alert sign energycosts spill consumer prices, thus put upward pressure trend ofinflation. in light risks, bank continue monitor situation carefully.in sum, bank remain positive canada's economic prospects. we continue expect thatthe economy grow 2 3 per cent year return somewhat high growthpath 2002. this judgment base recent evidence broadly line bank'sexpectations. and support mark improvement economic fundamentals, whichgives canada good chance weather current economic difficulties. bi review 58/20011mervyn king: a tale two citiesspeech mr mervyn king, deputy

balance risk british economy present? overall, past five year havebeen period remarkable stability uk. annual gdp growth average 2.8%, therehave 35 consecutive quarter positive economic growth. since

reasonably expect see future.there two source uncertainty face uk present, one domestic otherinternational. both relate imbalances. the correction imbalance pose challengesfor policy next years.to see domestic imbalance look beneath relative tranquillity aggregate data thesignificant turbulence among different sector economy. it obvious imbalancebetween sector economy expose international competition sectorsfacing predominantly domestic competition. to describe difference manufacturingand service simple, point clear. for part economy produce internationallytradable, traded, good services, output fall consumer spend buoyant. asa result, "tale two cities" industry experience bad times, withdeclining manufacture output, others best times, late retail sale figuresshowing increase volume sale past twelve month 6.4%.such imbalance uncommon. indeed, i first use phrase "tale two cities" early 1995 todescribe contrast strong demand manufacture output weak retail sales, theopposite position today. since economic see-saw lurch external todomestic demand, partly result continue weakness euro lead largeand persistent rise sterling effective exchange rate.the scale imbalance home see figure domestic external demand.whereas aggregate demand output rise fairly steady rate around 2¾% pastfive years, domestic demand, support rapid money credit growth, rise much morerapidly net external demand. indeed, private final domestic demand grow average rate ofnearly 5% period, growth excess 4% year four last five years.this imbalance domestic demand output result rise trade deficit. netexternal demand, export le imports, actually make negative contribution total economic growthin past five years. this first time external contribution growth beennegative period five consecutive year since 1870s. and negative contribution likelyto continue foreseeable future. 2bis review 58/2001imbalances scale unsustainable, although far obvious long cancontinue. at point, weaken balance

historically high levels. moreover, within corporate sector debt level mosthighly indebted company – top decile distribution debt profit ratio – areeven high early 1980s early 1990s. that hold true even telecom sector isexcluded. spend might, therefore, expect decelerate response balance sheetpositions. but, time being, final domestic demand continue grow trend rates,exacerbating imbalance within economy add risk large adjustment somepoint future. the continue shift resource meet demand good public servicesmeans private demand must grow much slowly next years. in turn, wouldenable trade deficit stabilise eventually fall back.the second uncertainty face uk slowdown world economy, and, particular, thedownturn unite states. in 2000, world economy grow 4.7%, high rate twelveyears. and, stimulate increase productivity growth, u growth rate reach almost6% year first half 2000. such rate unlikely prove sustainable.over past five year productivity growth unite state rise markedly. labourproductivity growth rise 1 percentage point year average 2½%-3% between1995 2000. some rise impact new technology efficiency, theresult great investment it – capital deepen – add significantly

consumption house market appear moreresilient. prompt action federal reserve far limit slowdown downturn ininventories fix investment. whether slowdown u prolong isembodied current consensus view depend critically upon personal consumption. and, inturn, depend upon expectation future productivity hence income growth us.if reappraisal extent increase productivity growth us, thenthere might downward revision asset price low path consumptionspending. so far, evidence, consumption directly, financial market indirectly,suggests major reappraisal occurred. share price fall peak lastyear. but price earn ratio remain well historical levels. the average p/e ratio ussince 1900 around 14. the ratio peak 30, fall back current level well 20.interestingly, divergence valuation hi-tech company virtuallydisappeared recent months. there also reduction perception downside risk toequity returns. return share usually negatively skewed; is, great chance areturn rather expect value. during course year, degree ofnegative skew fall us, suggest market expectation sharp fall shareprices diminished.of course reappraisal future growth productivity could yet occur. the recent fall itspending will, least short run, reduce contribution high productivity growth fromcapital deepening. it never easy detect change underlie productivity growth largequantity data need distinguish clearly change trend cyclical movements.nevertheless, evidence suggest rate compute process power isincreasing – double every eighteen month accord moore's law – diminished. indeed,there suggestion pace double process

business lives. but implication aggregate productivity growth aremuch uncertain.the two uncertainty face uk economy present, namely imbalance home andoverseas, suggest monetary policy committee may slightly bumpy ride thenext four year first four. so far, monetary policy committee manage toachieve overall balance economy despite contrast fortune internationallyexposed shelter sector economy. but large imbalance unwind,then committee likely face difficult challenge try maintain balance totaldemand supply. control inflation future may prove difficult past fouryears, long imbalance persist great risk subsequent adjustment todemand, output inflation large experience recently.any rebalancing economy likely associate fall real exchange rate. but themagnitude time uncertain, also difficult mpc

disappearance macroeconomic disequilibria. and thesecond differ position u european economies, regard cyclicalposition medium-term growth outlook. bi review 57/20013technological progress presuppose absence disequilibriaeconomic development unite state recent year forcefully influence bytechnological innovation. their effect felt, primarily, new economy industries. but,gradually, also emerge traditional industry latter incorporatedtechnological advance production distribution processes. a result, therebeen considerably high economic growth rate past two decades, alsoincreasingly firm empirical evidence rate expansion trend productivity may beenstepped up.however, fact technical progress may provide sustain boost growth capacity notmean, experience recent year unite state clearly shows, macroeconomicdisequilibria concurrently disappear. on contrary, favourable economic expectation thewake technological progress prompt strong rise share price and, mean low costof capital wealth effect, expansion domestic demand which, certain point,outpaced growth rate potential output, even optimistic scenario effect ofthe new economy.the result maladjustment notable decline u household net

investment.this build-up disequilibria, background sign upward pressure price werealso begin emerge, make inevitable also desirable aslowdown pace aggregate demand rate compatible economy's growth potential.and necessarily entail temporary decline productivity. the conclusion may thus drawnfrom recent experience technical progress structural change entail mean thedisappearance moderation economic cycles. what technical progress entail extensionto limit sustain non-inflationary growth capacity.differences euro area economyas indicated, euro area economy affect deteriorate international economicclimate and, particular, sharp slowdown u economy. this natural consequence ofthe grow interdependence various regional economic areas, bring increase ininternational trade financial flows. nonetheless, would mistake draw excessive parallelsbetween economy which, differ cyclical position structural characteristics, notshare growth prospects.in particular, many macroeconomic financial disequilibria build unitedstates find euro area. although investment remain buoyant recent yearsin europe, sign surplus capital good accumulated. moreover, although theeuropean save ratio decline recent years, still hold appreciably high level thanin unite states. finally, private sector le vulnerable wealth position, characterise bylower relative debt le exposure fluctuation financial asset prices.the sustain high private save ratio fiscal consolidation drive undertake euro areamember state pursuant stability growth pact help area whole achieve ahealthy external position. foreseeably, factor mean euro area may sustain, thenear future, growth rate close potential, albeit subject impact development theinternational front.against background, come surprise monetary policy differ sideof atlantic. this discrepancy is, i believe, due much difference statutory remit ofthe respective central bank rather economic situation depart different base andrequiring different measures.to meet objective increase economy's capacity growth require contribution ofstrands economic policy monetary policy. in respect, european governmentshave make headway recent year term fiscal consolidation, thereby increase room formanoeuvre available public finance withstand adverse cyclical circumstances. likewise, mentionshould make effort improve work european product factor markets, part 4bis review

capitalinvestment component, react promptly change expectations.consumer spend also slow amid great uncertainty, rise price loss financialwealth. but still hold sustain level result increase

different strand economicpolicy must thus strengthen economy's flexibility improve market workings.from encourage though risk-free outlook, i believe two issue may highlighted. first, thestrengths

acknowledge great differentiation different level credit risk, toconsider selection alternative method calculate capital attribute great importance tobanks' internal systems, introduce incentive good risk management control.second, thank great sensitivity risk assumed, new basel proposal allow forreadier convergence economic capital (the level capital consider appropriate bankmanagers shareholders) regulatory capital (that require supervisor).finally, aspect new basel accord i consider important integration singlepackage four basic elements: several capital calculation systems; quality management, stressingthe need sound internal risk management systems; system validation supervisor, beingrespectful banks' responsibility management; lastly, transparency, market takesinformed action.i believe new accord, currently consultative stage, mark step forward. it merit oursupport, although work must continue calibration parameter may result meetingthe objective set, namely maintain overall level capital provide proper incentives.adapting new accord demand task credit institutions, whatever country. but ibelieve soundness spanish institution make among best position change.the challenge pose new basel agreement supervisor le scale thosefaced banks. their implementation, schedule 2004, entail new regulatory capital frameworkfor supervisor much demand current one respect humanresources technical knowledge, make necessary objectify qualitative element bank andtheir systems.given range regulation supervisory practice international level, need alevel play field accommodate different country size also investment andcommercial banks, new accord require balance design increase internationalco-ordination among supervisors.as regard introduction international account standard (ias) european union, theaim promote convergence account practice across european countries. this iscertainly desirable goal, pave way progress towards creation singlefinancial market. the practical experience bank supervision last twenty year spainhas demonstrate account regulation fundamental element achieve solid andstable financial system efficient supervision. moreover, account standard base prudentialcriteria conservative principle essential prudential supervision, also forindividual investors, thereby guarantee information receive well-founded.this consider

presentation today, i would like raise issues. ihave attach appendix federal reserve board staff provide far detail relevantto purpose hearings.there are, i believe, two salient point make current state bank system. first,many traditional quantitative qualitative indicator suggest bank asset quality isdeteriorating supervisor therefore need sensitive problem individual banks,both currently month ahead. some credit make early period ofoptimism – especially syndicate loan – pressure scrutiny. the softeningeconomy and/or special circumstance especially affect borrower retail, manufacturing,health care, telecommunication industries. california utilities, know, also underparticular pressure. all these, doubt problem area foreseeable,require bank management supervisor remain particularly alert developments.second, fortunate bank system enter period weak economic performancein strong position. after rebuild capital liquidity early 1990s, follow several yearsof post-world war ii record profit strong loan growth, bank prudent capitaland reserve positions. in addition, asset quality quite good historical standard thedeterioration began. moreover, last decade, i discus fully moment, bank haveimproved risk management control systems, believe may strengthenedthe resultant asset quality shorten banks' response time change economic events. thispotential improve reaction cyclical weakness, good risk management, testedby event recent quarter may well test come quarters.we generalize recent event understand bite good relevant pattern inbanking, pattern appear change better. the recent weaken loan qualitybears characteristic typical traditional relationship loan business cycle – thepro-cyclicality bank lend practices. the rapid increase loans, though typical normalexpansion economy, unusual associate decade ofuninterrupted economic growth.as economy expanded, business household finance need increase projection offuture outcome turn increasingly optimistic. in context, loan officer whose experiencecounsels vast majority bad loan make latter stage business expansion,have choice (1) restrain lending, presumably lose market share (2) hop

management bedifficult because, regrettably, incentive loan officer manager traditionally rewardedloan growth, market share, profit derive book interest income with, retrospect,inadequate provision possible default. moreover, credit-risk specialist bank historically havehad difficulty make case risk inability measure quantify it. at thesame time, debt service current market risk premium cyclically low, couple sameinability quantify measure risk, supervisory criticism standard traditionally beendifficult justify.when economy begin slow quality book loan deteriorates, thecurrent cycle,

retrospect doubtless loan thatwould profitable bank.such policy demonstrably best interest banks' shareholder economy. theylead unnecessary degree cyclical volatility earn and, such, reduce long-termcapitalized value bank. more importantly, policy contribute increase economicinstability.the last year traditional characteristic i described: thesubstantial ease term economy improved, rapid expansion loan book, thedeterioration loan quality economy slowed, cumulative tighten loan standards.but interval interest characteristic observe early expansions. first, inthe mid-1990s, examiner begin focus banks' risk-management system processes; thesame time, supervisors' observation soften loan standard come unusually early theexpansion take seriously often case. the turmoil

one. formal risk-management system design reduce potential unintended acceptance risk andhence reduce pro-cyclical behavior characterize bank history. but, again, theprocess begun.the federal bank agency try generalize institutionalize process currentefforts reform basel capital accord. when operational, near middle decade, therevised accord, basel ii, promise promote good risk management wide group ofbanks also less-intrusive supervision risk-management system validated. it alsopromises le variability loan policy cycle bank supervisory focus onformal technique manage risk.in recent years,

organization relax standard rigor credit risk analysis inthis period, bank supervisor respond issue cautionary guidance step theintensity review lend operation many bank firms. in particular, supervisor point outthe need lender avoid use overly optimistic assumption presume strong conditionswould prevail indefinitely. in addition, supervisor also note lack downside risk analysis orstress

response current credit difficulties, bank agency issue guidance early yearclarifying expectation regard sound practice manage leverage finance exposures.even recent weaknesses, bank begin reevaluate strategic direction and, theencouragement supervisors, become deliberate need implement formalprocedures recognizing, pricing, manage risk. without reforms, recent deterioratingtrends would likely

executive hong kong monetary authority, hongkong association banks’ half-yearly dinner, hong kong, 19 june 2001.* * *thank much ask give speech evening. the last time i invite tospeak hkab dinner almost exactly two year ago, time nearly nineyears ago. although i quite sure whether i could manage pace rate accelerationwere continue, pleasure get together frequently. it also mostappropriate. the bank industry hong kong go period rapid transformation. theregulatory system middle programme intensive reform. and hong kongassociation banks, 20th year, currently review role aim light thesechanges. a bank sector’s main representative body, hkab important role play: ishall suggest late on, indeed increasingly important role play bank sectorcontinues evolve adapt change conditions. before i turn subject, i like toaddress, briefly, two broad interconnect subjects: first, theme competition, particularly inthe context current programme bank sector reform; secondly, question ofconsumer protection, light increase competition trends.competition bank sector reformwe two year programme extensive bank sector reform. in fact, firstmeasure programme clarification, dinner june 1999, hkma’spolicy question lender last resort. it pretty heavy-going speech after-dinneroccasion, i still recall droop eyelid stifle yawns. but least satthrough take satisfaction fact witness minor historical event.since then, reform programme make great deal progress. in 1999 relax “onebuilding” condition foreign bank license since 1978. last year expand access real timegross settlement implement first phase deregulation remain interest raterules. we also complete study public consultation case establish commercialcredit reference agency. early year, similar public consultation complete case forum deposit insurance scheme. the general view consultation two schemesshould pursued, although fully recognise dissent opinion question ofdeposit insurance. we work detail schemes, look forward tofurther consultation hkab body proposal progress.the theme reform programme facilitate great competition bank sector whilestrengthening safety soundness. perhaps single important measure remove barriersto competition abolition early next month last remain interest rate rules, whichinvolves remove interest rate cap save account end prohibition interest oncurrent accounts. there is, course, much speculation immediate impact event:whether big bang change face bank services, merely quiet change ofgear. give plentiful liquidity bank system, likely latter. but thereshould doubt significance bring end restriction existencefor third century. the restrictions, may recall, introduce 1964 asa measure prevent cut-throat competition among banks. they serve purpose, havenow outlive usefulness.why place much stress facilitate competition regulatory reform? i use term“facilitate” within power government – certainly policy ourgovernment – create competition, force competition happen. competition part hongkong’s free market ethos. it already strong bank sector here. we witness inparticular – occasionally concern – mortgage war provision creditcard consumer services. competition sharpen stimulate globalisation,which open hitherto restrict market business able export strengths, andby technological advance, put premium innovation ingenuity. 2bis review 55/2001for economy whole, competition promote efficiency allocation resource andstrength flexibility face change crisis. in bank sector, great competitionstrengthens individual banks, force focus core competence, thebanking system whole, weed inefficiencies. for consumer, competition promoteschoice, quality efficiency product services, reasonable costs. but competition,by nature, produce winner losers. it also complicate relationship banksand customers, service fee structure become complex sophisticatedproducts proliferate.the general government policy competition hong kong adopt sector-specific approach.we dispose idea general, overarch competition authority, since sector ofthe economy special need concerns. the bank sector, uniquehistory, which, obvious reasons, subject supervision perhaps sectorof economy, require particularly focus approach. the approach simple proactiveone. the main policy objective remove barrier competition, interest rate rules,and maintain level play field, particularly regard access infrastructure.in addition proactive policy approach, two main subsidiary concerns. one isto watch sign collusion anti-competitive behaviour industry address thesewhen occur. i note see sign present, though remainvigilant. the general concern adjustment fee services, form anecessary part competition reallocation resource result deregulation, notlead exclusion certain group society basic level bank services, theyshould introduce transparent way. again, i make clear that, despite concernsexpressed number group last months, believe that, general, bank areaddressing point. i also add, avoidance doubt, hkma’spolicy regulate fee charges. this something leave market. it would hardly beconsistent u one hand promote great competition seek todetermine influence fee charges. however, public concern effect ofderegulation, couple recognition importance bank service people’s daily lives,suggest pay attention past question consumerissues. this subject i like turn.consumer protectionfirst, i think need understand change go bank services, includingthe restructure fee charges, solely result interest rate deregulation. there area number factor – global much local – drive bank refocus business.these include: increase competition within outside bank industry; pressure toincrease shareholder value; need develop new income stream amid shortage conventionallending opportunities; globalisation, induce bank specialise form business inwhich competitive advantage. these various factor force bank innovate(cid:1) new product new technology – order diversify income. they alsoforcing bank become cost-efficient: scrutinise profitability various services, andto rationalise cost structures. the result many case substantial change retail bankingservices: example, sell business units, close branches, expansioninto fee-based business, mpf insurance services, development cost-effectivemodes service delivery, atm network internet, imposition specificfees charge service incur fee charge past.consumers also need react change environment – example, make use ofdelivery channel atms, telephone bank internet reduce cost usingbanking services. cost minimisation also provide incentive consumer shop around, andnew technology form internet enhance mean so. with shop aroundcomes awareness else offer, great expectation part consumer. lesspositively, disruption anxiety, reflect steadily growingnumber complaint protests, great political attention pay subject.what stance hkma? we not, i already said, regulate fee charges. butwe seek ensure transparency provision services, particularly set outof fee charges. the code bank practice, non-statutory code issue jointly byhkab dtc association endorsement, main tool achieve end, and, bi review 55/20013you know, code currently subject extensive revision strengthening. thisprocess almost end believe make code even effective tool. inaddition transparency, hope banks, make decision fee charges, willshow sensitivity need vulnerable member society. we believe that, sofar, bank display sensitivity. we also wish ensure continue choice forcustomers. again, believe choice, deregulation, new technology, newproducts indeed combine competition provide great choice ever before. we shallcontinue monitor.this reasonably healthy picture. but time also, i think, look current arrangement forconsumer protection bank industry, see whether improvement needed, so,what be. the hkma already play informal role address consumer complaints,though power settle disputes. should – someone else – give suchpowers? should sanction bank fail comply code practice? how doeshong kong compare jurisdiction area?it intention clarify issue surround bank consumer protection thatwe recently undertake comparative study practice uk, australia hong kong. thereport study present legco panel financial affair madeavailable general public, and, course, bank sector. the study examine differentapproaches subject australia uk, note that, contrast hong kong, theregulators place give specific mandate relation protection ofconsumers financial bank services. two major difference hong kong andthe overseas regime highlighted: first, setting, monitor enforcement standard ofbusiness practice; and, secondly, investigation, resolution, arbitration customercomplaints. with regard former, australia uk both, like hong kong, anon-statutory code bank practice, set standards. but australia uk takethis stage further, formal monitor compliance specialist agency, which, ukcase least, power impose sanction institution breach code. for theresolution customer complaints, uk australia formalise ombudsman scheme,with power arbitrate disputes.these two key feature british australian system illustrate arrangement hongkong go far as, le formalise than, jurisdictions. this may havesomething different philosophical approaches: hong kong tradition free-market one, entail low level government involvement business relationships. but asthe hong kong market become sophisticate competitive, consumer issuesare come fore, may useful consider whether hong kong follow path ofother jurisdictions.at early stage discussion, seem three broad options, necessarilymutually exclusive. the first form self-regulation bank industry. the second toprovide specific mandate regulator, hkma. the third place responsibility inthe hand ombudsman. there number issue – philosophical, practical –that need take account decide fullness time responsibility wouldlie. a far hkma concerned, argument are, i suggest, finely balanced.one argument hold formal role hkma area might create conflict ofinterest prudential regulation consumer protection roles. the point view isthat two role co-exist sufficiently high thick chinese wall them, andthat, furthermore, synergy two roles, cost benefit achieved. thehkma open mind issue, hop receive view way forward, fromthe industry, legislative councillors, community large. and i stress, beforethe charge empire build raised, necessarily one function hkmawould wish add already onerous responsibilities.there is, course, parallel question whether hkab, main industry organisation, asthe traditional vehicle self-regulation, play role consumer protection. here thearguments seem evenly balanced. on one hand, knowledge proximity industrywould place hkab advantage handle complaints. on hand, could theperception conflict interest. i note hkab’s wish take formal role ofconsumer protection, i respect that. but, whichever organisation take formal role, hkabwill almost certainly part play shape policy practice area. 4bis review 55/2001the future role hkabquite apart consumer protection, large question remain industry, hkma,and least community might expect hkab future, one principalresponsibilities – weekly set interest rate – take away. it subject ishould like briefly address final section speech.it is, perhaps, something irony that, time hkab’s formal power diminishing, itspublic profile never higher. we know television press becomealmost weekly tradition chairman appear statue square receive petitions,banners, kind symbolic object concern groups. i think say something thereputation hkab establish industry body. it also say something publicexpectations role. it therefore timely, period deregulation rise expectations,that reconsideration hkab’s role could developed.i stress decision role develop ultimately matter hkabitself. hkab has, fact, already commission consultant examine subject, havenow publish report consultation member banks. the hkma read report, andfrom point view recommendation sensible realistic. take account thereport, see bank sector developing, see scope develop hkab’s role infour broad areas.first, perhaps important, report recommend hkab could take functionas voice industry. we support recommendation. hkab already fulfil role greatextent, particularly submission policy proposal regular meet u avariety operational issues. but role could deepened, particularly develop unifiedposition major policy issues, achieve position broadly reflect view wholeof bank industry. i would even suggest scope hkab become thespokesperson bank industry, also lobbyist industry. this easy task,because bank industry hong kong diverse always able come single view onissues affect it. nor reason every issue. however, hkab coulddevelop profile gain strength representative organisation work developingits role clear industry voice.the second main recommendation report concern hkab’s role development thecode bank practice. the code, set standard bank services, jointly issuedby hkab dtc association, endorsement of, involvement of, hkma. it anon-statutory code, although compliance expect ais. it monitor hkma aspart regular supervision, although, i mention earlier, formal, statutory mandatein project. there is, i think, scope, report advocates, hkab take great ownership ofthis code, particularly set standard – ensure high standard – andin monitor enforce compliance. this would consistent practice bankingassociations jurisdictions, would logical development hkab’s role.a third area highlight consultant’s report consumer education field bankingservices. this neglect subject hong kong. the question organisation takethe lead is, course, tie question take consumer protection. but,whatever answer second question, seem clear hkab would need involve insome form another. this, fact, reflect practice among industry organisation otherjurisdictions, many strong tradition produce plain-language factsheets, webpagesand resource run personal finances, protect one’s financial interests, make themost new form financial services.moving away recommendation consultant’s report, is, i think, fourth area inwhich hkab could become involved. this development hong kong’s financialinfrastructure. this one hkma’s key policy objectives, also area hkabhas keen constructive interest. in particular, hkab, together hkma, joint owner ofhong kong interbank clear ltd, operate one key feature hong kong’s financialinfrastructure, real time gross settlement system. one project hkab workclosely hkma development commercial credit reference agency. some yourmembers already participate work group engage thrash thedetails ccra would work. an issue raise deliberation theworking group whether hkab participate ownership ccra, inhkicl. this idea find much favour consult industry ccra bi review 55/20015scheme last year. but perhaps, seem likely scheme go ahead, ideawhich revisit stage future. that matter hkab one ileave think about. even confirm early view participate directly thisparticular project, would undermine general principle hkma hkab should,wherever feasible, work hand hand develop important piece financial infrastructure.conclusionto summarise, deregulation bring great competition bank industry, shouldenable bank exercise great deal freedom nature business pursue theform service offer. ideally, freedom also provide great choice consumer,greater efficiency delivery services, good value money. in practice, however, thetransitional period find also give rise misunderstandings, disputes,and dissatisfaction among many consumer need resolved. to approach theseproblems find practical way resolve them, need develop sophisticate andbetter organise system consumer protection. we place subject table fordiscussion. i hope community representatives, industry, yourorganisation, take debate help shape effective solution. bi review 55/20011bank japan’s june report recent economic

money supply line potential output growth – necessarycondition prevent emergence speculative bubbles. in addition, low inflation rate itselffosters long-term investment help stabilise asset prices.iiifinancial market naturally play part shape monetary policy. in second pillar ecb’smonetary policy strategy, broad set indicator medium-term outlook price stability andfor economic growth observed. bi review 54/20013it three respect financial market price particularly valuable monetary policymakers.first, provide u early lead indicator market expectation macroeconomicdevelopments. for example, change term structure interest rate relate future economicgrowth. a steepen yield curve typically forecast strong economic growth.such increase term spread would, however, convey unambiguous information. higherlong-term rate could also reflect expectation high future inflation change risk premia.additional information asset money market may therefore necessary interpret marketexpectations regard.second, measure expect volatility future financial market price show u degree ofuncertainty attach expectations. imply volatility derive option long-term bond anexample. however, consensus read volatility exactly. we know surewhich particular component long-term bond yield – real interest rate, expect inflation orrisk premia – determine volatility. thus, informational value measurement limited.third, financial market price give u insight expectation market participant regardto monetary policy action. euribor rate especially helpful respect. they allow u toconstruct yield curve money market. additional information derive three-monthfutures. thus, havea pretty good picture anticipation prevail market regard tomonetary policy moves. all all, financial market provide central banker helpful information.the use market information is, however, subject caveats. financial market price opento whole host influence – include distortion institutional features, irrational behaviour andherding behaviour, instance.market expectation therefore never substitute central bank’s independentassessment economic situation future developments. we use financial market price tocomplement cross-check economic assessments.while try figure market think, market busy try figure wethink. we watch – watch us. if central bank always meet market expectations,destabilising circularity could occur. monetary policy decision base mainly onfundamental economic data.reducing uncertainty far possible clearly one aim eurosystem. the eurosystemtherefore communicate extensively markets. which why, example, decide topublish staff economic projections.the increase role communication transparency reflect change relationship betweenmonetary policy financial markets. monetary policy today make use financial market lotmore actively openly early times.ivladies gentlemen, present general remark monetary policy let nowget specific current situation monetary policy euro area.the govern council ecb is, present, take decision climate considerableglobal economic uncertainty. in situation like particularly important pursue clear andconsistent rule-based policy. the monetary policy strategy develop govern council theecb meet precisely need. the public right expect govern council ecb stickto strategy present interest rate assessments.let’s start money supply. it play prominent role “first pillar” monetary policy, theunderlying perception inflation is, long term, essentially monetary phenomenon. themoney supply euro area increase 4.6 % february april, compare samemonths one year previously. this increase roughly line 4½ % reference value – otherwords, level keep price stability trend economic growth.monetary growth tend slow since spring 2000. because statisticaldistortions, even more, fact, initially expected. there two main cause thesedistortions.first, non-euro-area resident considerable hold money market fund units. however, themoney supply concept relate euro-area residents, mainly amount cash residentshold euro area relevant term expenditure. the late figure ecb currently put 4bis review 54/2001this distortion 0.5 percentage point. the money growth rate figure i mention moment ago hasalready adjusted.second, short-term money market instruments, likewise hold non-euro-arearesidents, also exaggerate extent monetary growth. precise statistical data category ofinstrument still collect ecb publish end year.if facet take account, monetary growth well quote figure cannottherefore describe expansionary. from medium-term perspective, indication ofprice risks.in connection second pillar ecb’s strategy, data point decrease pressure onprices. this would appear odds current unsatisfactory price trend; euro-area inflationwas 3.0 % april. however, largely due special factors, effect likely tosubside come months. basically, factor high price crude oil and, aresult, fuel, together effect price produce crisis food sector.wage negotiator right assume inflationary effect temporary, havebeen second-round effect far. in state that, i refer recent wage settlement thegerman bank sector. negotiator agree wage increase slightly le 3 %. nowthat economic risk long ignored, extremely important negotiate moderate wagesettlements.the rise cost energy currently drive overall price up, time put thebrake economy. the outlook forecast euro area year beadjusted. industrial output capacity utilisation already decline somewhat. survey showthat industrial sentiment, particular, become far gloomy. view angle, couldalso entail limit price risk period ahead.while economic outlook run counter inflationary pressures, euro exchange rate mustbe watch closely possible risk price stability. let stress utmost interest astrong currency. the external value euro important indicator second pillar theecb’s monetary policy strategy.financial market share medium-term expectation price developments. capital market ratesare still low level – reflection expectation possible inflationary pressure undercontrol long term. interest rates, least, impediment economic upturn.after weigh factor take account medium-term orientation monetary policy,i reach conclusion current monetary policy stance appropriate presentjuncture.vladies gentlemen,let try summarise main feature interdependence monetary policy andfinancial markets:(cid:1) central bank need well-functioning financial markets. they work crucial link betweenmonetary policy-setting ultimate goal, price stability. disintermediation furtherheightens importance financial market transmission mechanism monetarypolicy. therefore, monetary policymakers need analyse structural change financialmarkets thoroughly.(cid:1) central bank acquire information expectation financial market participant bymonitoring financial market prices. they cross-check forecast data.(cid:1) finally, order avoid misperceptions policy stance markets, aconsistent communication policy.with capital market integrate habit field finance investment changing, centralbankers euro area enter period heighten uncertainty. the ecb optedfor monetary policy strategy anchor markets’ expectation future price stability. the

monetary policykilled new economy. so let begin story slowdown start – is, withmonetary policy.an important question economic performance period 1996 mid-2000 – anda question key importance monetary policymakers – whether sustainable. to sure,if high rate productivity growth continued, growth could remain elevate compare itsaverage rate previous two decades. but even new, high rate structural productivitygrowth persist, could aggregate demand grow fast upward-revised rate increasein supply, could unemployment rate fall indefinitely, without economy overheat andinflation rising? in words, new-economy force eliminate risk overheat higherinflation much part "old" economy? my unambiguous answer "no." and thatanswer share fomc, motivate monetary policy tighten begin middleof 1999.given uncertainty sustainable configuration unemployment, output growth andinflation, lack precise roadmap need go. while know precisely whattrend growth was, know certain growth persistently trend – give thecontinuing decline unemployment rate 1996 though mid-1999. so seem prudent toslow growth attempt move toward trend that, i believe, intent monetary policybegan tighten mid-1999.some, least, worry

sharply. wa increase ratio debt service toincome low, even negative, personal save rate sustainable? if not, consumer spend couldslow sharply.the late herb stein, wise economist, say something sustainable, won'tcontinue! but often case unsustainable development spontaneously unwind.instead, often reverse correct change behavior trigger externalevent – example, global financial crisis, unexpected policy development, unforeseendeterioration broad conditions.iv.why sharp slowdown?why growth fall sharply anticipate tell u new economy?sharp slowdown often result three inter-related reinforce developments: acoincidence adverse shocks, unwind pre-existing imbalance trigger deteriorationin broad macroeconomic conditions, collapse consumer business confidence.the economy slow part,

energy price rise throughout 1999 2000. oil pricesshot fall natural gas price soar late last year oil price begin recede. thehigher energy price undermine consumers' purchase power. 6bis review

central swing activity occur recession sharpslowdowns. the current correction does, however, seem new-economy flavor. becauseinformation technology provide firm rapid flow information current sale

wasslowing growth, economy weaken expected. this also fairly typical development– coincidence forecast error direction across many spend category – duringperiods unusually strong weak growth. it often relate sharp swing business andconsumer confidence – swing large would predict thecontemporaneous change employment, income, interest rates, forth.v.what happen new economy?so happen new economy? the answer, i believe, still new economy(again). the shape slowdown new economy write it, shape theearlier expansion did. we could say new economy suffer old economy disease – ifnot full-fledged recession, least close relative, growth recession – result thedevelopments i described. a growth recession refer period below-trend growth duringwhich unemployment rate rises. but miss distinctive feature current slowdown.so i think story turn period force operate economywere line produce exceptionally favorable performance period economy mustadjust imbalance build early period. our job monetary policymakersis try ensure adjustment jarring. but pain. many investor areunderstandably unhappy loss wealth. so much accumulate fewyears quickly disappeared, almost mysteriously. in addition, many firm go bankruptand others will, especially risky venture technology sector. but patternsseem historical precedent correction equity value investment follow,after lag, transition period high

response ofoutput demand shock might le persistent. on hand, appear high-techrevolution help firm forecaster anticipate change demand.there guarantee higher-growth economy le vulnerable recessions. indeed, i believethat new-economy development raise sustainable growth might also, least initially,have make economic performance volatile. first, i note adjustment high rate ofproductivity growth might bring temporary surge output, top high average growth rates,while time low rate inflation. such remarkable performance, bind tobe temporary, nevertheless could easily encourage unsustainable expectations. hence, attempt totake advantage new-economy force prompt frenzy investment activity many bad,as well good, investment decision made. bad investment result firm go ofbusiness others suffer temporarily depress profitability therefore curtail furtherexpansion while. and, part profit opportunity new technology firm sodifficult gauge, exuberance take valuation level prove

jean-claude trichet, governor banque de france, institute ofinternational finance spring membership meet hold hong kong 1 june 2001.* * *ladies gentlemen,it’s great pleasure share view distinguish audience two topic ofgreat importance: first one deal recent economic development euro area themotivations last 25bps rate cut ecb 10 may’s meeting. the second point dealswith important question international financial architecture.let start first topic.the global outlook 2001 continue characterise sizeable uncertainties, amid thereadjustments take place american japanese economies, impact rest ofthe world. in unite states, however, gdp growth estimate first quarter 2001indicates slowdown substantial, economy still drive far firm consumerexpenditure.economic activity euro area 2000 expand annualised rate 3.4%, strongestgrowth since 1990, drive buoyant domestic foreign demand. the general outlook yearand next one remain positive, even if, clearly, impact american slowdown

activity euro area largely determine bydomestic factor long-term finance cost disposable income developments, haveremained favourable. furthermore, still high rate capacity utilisation manufacturingsector, ongoing growth employment continue decline unemployment helpmaintain positive growth private investment consumption.employment euro area estimate increase 0.6% first quarter

euro area far remain moderate. per capitanominal compensation employee grow 2.0% 1999 2.4% 2000, unit labourcosts increase 1.3% 0.9%, respectively. there number factor help explainwhy increase oil

long-term growth perspective euro area strengthen member statesintensify fiscal consolidation. all all, look ahead, gdp euro area expect growapproximately close trend potential growth.in context moderate still substantial economic growth inflationary pressures, areexpected weaken medium run, govern council ecb decide thursday10 may’s meet adjust key ecb rate 25 basis points. more precisely, presidentwim duisenberg explain behalf govern council, decision ground thefollowing key monetary, financial economical developments:on monetary side, constitute may know first pillar ecb monetary policystrategy, m3 growth long pose risk price stability. such statement result thefollowing considerations: 2bis review 49/2001(cid:1) m3 growth gradual downward trend since begin last year, reflectingthe tighten ecb monetary policy, start november 1999. in periodfrom february april 2001, three-months average annual growth rate m3adjusted hold resident outside euro area money market fund

le risk price stabilityover medium-term emanate monetary developments.as regard second pillar ecb monetary policy strategy, upward risk price stability overthe medium-term also diminish somewhat.still, hicp growth rate accelerate year-on-year basis april 2.9% possibly figurefor may good. but development mainly seem generate temporaryfactors substantially diminish next 12 month permit

recent year reinforce international financial stabilityand enhance prevention. we must continue effort toward progress regard thereform financial architecture. i also think fruitful lesson draw assessmentof new characteristic financial market impact financial stability.1.we must pursue reinforce effort towards renew international financialarchitecture.these effort tend improve prevention management financial crises.1.1strengthening preventionstrengthening prevention call parallel effort actors, international financial institutions,investors public authorities. prevention lay appropriate surveillance adequate macro-economic policies.1.1.1as regard surveillance, much progress already achieved:(cid:1) in institutional field, important change recently occurred: let mention theimpressive work carry financial stability forum 1999 (e.g. report highlyleverage institutions, capital flows, incentive foster implementation standards). icould also quote work g20 international monetary financial committee.together exist institution imf, world bank bi theinternational level, probably efficient structure cope current andfuture international financial challenges.(cid:1) the implementation internationally acknowledge standard contribute reduceemerging market economies’ financial vulnerability and, together enhancedtransparency, improve market discipline market participants’ ability good ass therisks investment decisions.(cid:2) many effort already achieve design 65 internationally agreedstandards codes; financial stability forum identify 12 key bi review 49/20013the international financial stability suggest incentive implement them. theimplementation standard self interest partner processof economic financial globalisation. the commitment country implementcodes standard likely reinforce market participant actually reflectinformation observance code standard differentiate credit ratings.(cid:2) international financial institution also continue proceed toward greatertransparency, particular participation 60 country voluntary basis thepilot initiative release imf article iv reports.(cid:2) a regard private sector, progress may take form voluntary improveddisclosure, demand statistical report extend requirement non-transparent segment financial markets.1.1.2prevention also lay sound economic conditions.a sound macro-economic framework appropriate macro-economic policy essential theycondition resilience economy external shocks. three issue worth address inthat respect:(cid:1) a far choice exchange rate regime concerned, sustainability anyregime depend crucially consistency country’s domestic macroeconomic andstructural policy framework. a consequence, call “corner solutions” notnecessarily available options; “intermediate solutions” remain relevant options,particularly open economy close link partner country (or single currencyarea) maintain price stability, country experience high inflation anchor thecurrency provide simple credible rule monetary policy; regard, intermediatesolutions might particularly appropriate country apply join europeanunion.(cid:1) the soundness domestic financial system core element ability economyto resist external shocks; furthermore, clear weakness financial system canlead financial instability therefore trigger capital outflows, experience thecontext recent financial crises. a consequence, emerge market economy shouldestablish appropriate institutional, supervisory regulatory framework, build oninternational standards, core principle effective bank supervision issuedby basle committee bank supervision.(cid:1) the implementation sound macro-economic policy also key regard crisisprevention. in respect, let say word reserve debt management.to mitigate volatility capital flow especially short term flow reap benefitsof capital account liberalization, one adopt risk management strategy involvesa system monitor assess risk liquidity economy whole,including sector level. the international community may assist develop bestpractices relate reserve debt management: let quote example morestringent publish obligation net foreign exchange reserve adopt within contextof imf special data dissemination standard (sdds) imf world bankinitiative promote good practice reserve sovereign liability management.1.2clarify principle govern crisis resolution distribution role amongactorsi would like give view two issue stake great importance andstrongly inter-related, i.e. role imf involvement private sector.1.2.1the imf remain centre process crisis resolutionwhatever prevention features, crisis still occur future. in respect, i would like tofocus role imf regard international lend crisis management.(cid:1) a regard lend role, view, imf cannot act international lender lastresort. first, limit resource match private capital flows; second,the perception role would increase moral hazard. the imf thus provideunlimited unconditional financial support, catalytic role remain core element 4bis review 49/2001financial crisis resolution. a consequence, imf financial assistance ex antelimited term quotas. access regular limit exceptional andallowed case systemic risks. however, short-term finance bulk imflending role, imf also promote macro-stability, include structural mattersrelevant macro-economic policies. a consequence, imf need medium longterm surveillance medium long term facility adjustment take hold.(cid:1) a regard role crisis management, imf could concentrate agree thecrisis country program ensure adjustment finance short andmedium-term:(cid:2) this means, example, imf conditionality cover short medium andlong term issues. the asian crisis lead extension imf conditionality tostructural areas, mainly regard financial system restructure issues. thisextension somewhat criticise i share views: include structuralmatters imf conditionality clearly line imf mission regardsfinancial stability reinforce efficiency. in respect, review imfconditionality process mean, opinion, necessarilybe weakened, focus short term macroeconomic variables.(cid:2) while face financial crisis, imf could indicate relative contribution ofofficial finance private sector finance well domestic economicadjustments require fill gap. before disburse share financing, shouldreview ass country’s effort secure contribution privatecreditors require ensure medium-term sustainability; fail secure neededcontribution private creditor could lead revision program requireadditional domestic adjustment.2.changes function financial market recent year also raiseimportant issue international community may address.there need underscore much financial market change last two decadesunder combine impact factor financial deregulation, technological financialinnovation, intensify competition among financial institution increase demand moretransparency great profitability. these change enhance overall efficiency financialmarkets and, extension, develop economies:(cid:1) market become transparent competitive.(cid:1) financial innovation make easy government corporate sector toraise capital hedge risks.(cid:1) economic agent fund invest, particular households, choose widerrange investment vehicle offer good returns.(cid:1) grow disintermediation contribute le inflationary finance economies.despite achievements, surprise development financial assetmarkets. while rapid emergence "new economy" bubble 1999 early 2000, follow bya series sharp corrections, illustrate potential modern financial markets, e.g. tofinance technological innovation, also demonstrate tendency over-react, move fromexcessive optimism disproportionate pessimism, ensue negative consequence thebehaviour firm households.we attentive boom-bust episode financial asset markets, since canaffect monetary financial stability world economy. i would like discus two issueshere:(cid:1) first, factor encourage excessively homogeneous market behaviour may hind asmooth efficient function markets, and(cid:1) second, way foster diverse behaviour market considered. bi review 49/200152.1some factor encourage excessively homogeneous market behaviour may hind asmooth efficient function marketsfinancial asset price fluctuate widely sometimes deviate economic fundamental longperiods time. several factor play happens. i shall give examples.(cid:1) some market participant become incline engage "short-termism", is,they preoccupy short-term results. this trend might result, particular,from grow pressure yield immediate financial result necessarilysustainable.(cid:1) mimetic behaviour mean new phenomenon financial markets. however,technological development market may gradually reinforce type ofbehaviour. the spread benchmarking, allow fund manager client tomeasure performance funds, together grow competitionwithin sector, appear increase mimetic behaviour. some operator havecome conclusion good wrong along everybody else, rather thantake risk wrong alone.(cid:1) the spread certain fund management techniques, particular index management, whichhas prove popular equity markets, may contribute amplify movementsin financial asset prices. this technique endeavour match accurately possibledevelopments stock market benchmark indices. it therefore mechanistically leadsmanagers accentuate current price trend buy stock rise sellingthose falling.(cid:1) the impact risk management technique market dynamic particularly enlighteningwith regard question asset price overshooting. of course, central bank andfinancial institution continue encourage use instruments. but, timesof financial turmoil, grow use sophisticate risk management technique byfinancial intermediary paradoxical effect amplify initial shock thespill-over effect. regardless intrinsic quality risk management tools, theirgrowing use may produce pernicious effects. when market player rely convergingrisk evaluations, tend take decision time, thus amplify theinitial shock price trade volumes.all factor one consequence common: encourage homogenous behaviour andreactions detriment diversity conducive smooth function financialmarkets.2.2for reason, could reflect way – together financial industry –on possible way foster behavioural diversity global markets.to safeguard smooth function markets, particular efficient price mechanism, itwould opportune protect, even reinforce, diversity behaviour markets. thisnecessary diversity merely echo different time horizons, strategy reaction functionsof market players. on point, i would like explore possible avenues.2.2.1first overall strengthen continue effort aim market transparency:(cid:1) experience show uncertainty incomplete information determine factor inmimetic behaviour. these shortfall market transparency make herd behaviour seemrational agents, prefer follow big participants, think betterinformed, rather develop analysis. strengthen transparency therefore is,more ever, priority.(cid:1) one objective transparency enable good differentiation borrowercreditworthiness. a key feature mimetic behaviour borrower "tarred thesame brush". so one emerge economy encounter difficulties, neighbouringcountries, country share common characteristics, treat way –regardless actual economic financial situation. the apply businessesoperating economic sector. transparency substantially increase since theasian crisis thank solid global consensus – let u continue reinforce efforts- 6bis review 49/20012.2.2take account medium long-term perspective market participants:(cid:1) some investors, pension fund insurance companies, invest fund inorder enable customer build wealth medium long term, notably inpreparation retirement. consequently, type investor suppose behavedifferently trader short-term investors, work different timehorizon. but time seem push behave much way, onthe basis overwhelmingly dominant short-term horizon.(cid:1) to preserve, even restore, specific investment approach, particular investorsmight shield excessive short-term pressures. this objective raisesconsiderable difficulties, touch way performance ofmedium long-term fund (including pension funds) life insurance company areassessed.2.2.3 diversify risk management tool financial institutions:(cid:1) a i mention earlier, even best technique adverse effects. to degree,this perhaps happen value-at-risk base techniques, beenmassively adopt financial industry. because use le similarparameters feature – example, take inadequate account ofmarket liquidity time 1998 crisis –, tool tend give converge signal tothose use them. they thus encourage herd behaviour i discuss previously.(cid:1) of course, fact market participant sophisticate average isa guarantee standardisation remain limited, since develop technique thatare little use others.(cid:1) however, supervisor help spread idea financial institution roundout current range risk management tool include extensive use stress testing.this technique offer good reflection vary situation institution thediverse perception institution exceptional events. the application stresstesting technique result thus inherently diversify resultingfrom method base value-at-risk approach.these example option help improve function markets.indisputable progress already made: generalisation concept appropriatetransparency since asian crisis comprehensive use stress test two significantexamples. however, i would like stress one point. there probably merit overall reviewof regulatory, account tax rule regulations, well code good conduct goodpractices, structural development market themselves, identify possible amendment andimprovements could help protect enhance behavioural conceptual diversity ofmodern financial markets. bi review 49/20011andrew crockett: issue global financial supervisionremarks mr andrew crockett, general manager bank international settlement andchairman financial stability forum, 36th seacen governors’ conference hold insingapore, 1 june 2001.* * *the maintenance financial stability use relatively straightforward day bank andother financial institution earn protect rent supervisor manager could focus onsimple risk measures. over last decades, world become far complicated. firm arerunning complex risks, sectoral distinction blur market integrate globally.this make task authority responsible financial stability difficult define andexecute: parameter considered, shock come many corners, themanner supervisory action affect supervise institution far complex.so supervisor authority responsibility financial stability adjust? thereare substantive procedural issue considered. one substantive issue authoritiesshould respond complex environment. in principle, may two options: adjust tothe exist complexity, try shape environment compatible existingregulatory framework prudential approaches. but latter cost bring risk own.moreover, may feasible give international dimension financial intermediation.another challenge, involve substantive procedural issues, domestic well asinternational dimensions, devise rule consistent across sectors, leave gaps, areimplemented effectively fairly. what supervisory regulatory approach workable morecomplex environment? and how, procedurally, rule draw enforced? oneresponse latter integrate regulatory supervisory rule make enforcementfunctions single body. the various authority involve deepen co-operation. atthe international level, global super-regulator seem neither realistic desirable option relativeto enhance co-operative approach seek consistency adequate recognition differences.to provide background issues, i begin remark describe thecharacteristics result evolution financial sector recent year withwhich authority contend. i group remainder remark twoheadings: implication supervisory authorities; procedural issue arise inorganizing supervisory oversight.i.nature change financial systemsthe basic force affect financial sector are: quicken pace technologicalinnovation, especially data process communication; grow acceptance marketprocesses basic determinant resource allocation. the impact technical innovation andderegulation bank rest financial sector profound. the range productsand service widen markedly. intermediation cost decline enormously. financialtransactions grow rapidly relation gdp. all bring considerable benefitsthrough efficient origination allocation capital, great availability capital investment,greater efficiency management risks, etc.let note six characteristic transformation important implication supervisionand regulation. these characteristic many common strand channel interaction.first, firm run complex (and sometimes opaque) risks. advance processingof information finance theory permit independent price risk factor werepreviously bundle together instrument. at time, intensification financialintermediation give rise explosion demand hedge (and position-taking)instruments. the good news new financial instrument enormously improve thetechnology risk-management. the downside instruments, properlyunderstood used, increase potential loss, whether result inadequate understandingor deliberate leverage bets. 2bis review 49/2001second, sectoral distinction become blurred. to degree, reflect greaterwillingness accept free market philosophy. but importantly, ability deconstruct re-combine risk enable financial intermediary expand compete effectively sectorsbeyond own. and regulatory umbrella framework provide thegreatest benefit flexibility. to sure, helpfully expose regulatory economicinefficiencies. but motivate principally regulatory arbitrage, authority need toguard lead system wide reduction capital adequacy undue risk concentration.a third relate characteristic greatly enhance competition. this prime objective ofmuch deregulation privatisation take place financial industry. but thecompetitive climate sharpen developments, too. a great focus shareholdervalue induce banks' management pay attention rate return equity. this isgood news financial industry induce use capital efficiently financialservices become cheap end-users. but also mean cushion bad luck orbad judgement thinner. franchise value much smaller, erosion capital morequickly lead threat failure (and temptation take unwarranted risk stay business).fourth, source financial disturbance become become unpredictable.one cause capital market integration, affect country’s financial market institutionswhether economy entirely integrated. we see capital flow volatile andunpredictable. contagion mean problem neighbour distant economy canrapidly become one’s own. another aspect much great diversity actor financialmarkets. in 1970s 80s, financial intermediation conduct banks, withinsurance company investment vehicle well define roles. but many different type ofinstitution, include non-financial firm involve wholesale retail markets. andfinancial institution base outside major centre come play important role ininternational markets.a fifth characteristic financial system appear become pro-cyclical thanbefore, capable amplify credit growth leverage market position intensely thanbefore. in essence, “marginal” risk financial actor willingly engage great before. toa degree, result innovation financial technology, include process securitisation,which allow risk good distribute managed. the widespread use trade ofcollateral also factor. but also reflect intensification competition, perhaps viewamong firm able get risky engagement sour. of course, pro-cyclicality work directions: downturn set in, financial system seem proneto liquidity erosion reduce credit supply previous episode stress.the final characteristic i would like draw attention greatly increase speed ofdevelopments financial sector. the speed transmission news financial sector hasalways high relative sectors. nowadays, market communication execution bealmost instantaneous. but also speed financial sector actors’ judgement strategicopportunities environment move take advantage them. new cheapertechnology, well deregulation, greatly help this. business model get adopt anddiscarded quickly. this test regulator supervisors, challenge tocreate rule game robust fad, fashion arbitrage.there several consequence characteristic i mention i return.however, one, consolidation, become characteristic present environment. i believeconsolidation much run many countries. so far, mainly take place withinnational markets, within particular sectors. look ahead, however, cross-border cross-functional merger alliance seem increasingly likely.ii.implications authoritiesas i note outset, substantive issue raise forego authority shouldrespond complex environment prevails. in principle, may two options: toadjust supervision regulation challenge environment, try shape theenvironment compatible slowly evolve regulatory framework prudentialapparatus.the latter may possible, within limits, economy whose financial market remain relativelyheavily regulate close markets. but one cannot ignore difficulty, cost bi review 49/20013risks deliberately prevent adjustment world outside change ever rapidpace. a gap create – one slowly erode – one may late bemuch difficult close.in asia, elsewhere, country follow different reform strategies. give wide range ofinitial conditions, single prescription. all same, two key lesson past crisesare widely recognised. the first need liberalise financial activity flow amanner consistent supervisory infrastructural capacity. firms, supervisor theinfrastructure need time adapt demand complex market environment.the second lesson comprehensive approach needed. the financial sector existin vacuum. it efficiency stability depend, prudential standard apply tofinancial institutions, robustness financial infrastructure underpin transactions.weaknesses financial infrastructure render useless careful supervisoryoversight. weak account audit practice major source problems. improvedinsolvency arrangement also critical: absence fully satisfactory bankruptcy arrangementsthat permit orderly restructure distress corporate debt important factorretarding market development, intensify financial crisis many south east asian economies.one area change need almost everywhere corporate governance practices. wheredemands reform infrastructural improvement make professionally operate boardsand management anticipation expand business opportunities, authority fewqualms embrace them.while sound infrastructure strong corporate governance, include effective bank management,are crucial element overall adjustment strategy, equally important adjustment regulationand supervision. let review major change take place area.an important trend strengthen risk sensitivity prudential framework.banking supervisor focus intensively recent year detail aspect sound riskmanagement practice financial institutions: first, accurate measurement monitor risk;second, control price exposures; third, hold adequate capital reserve tomeet unexpected losses. this work apparent propose revision basel capitalaccord. in revise standardise approach, risk-weights reflective actual risk. and inthe internal rat base approach, subject safeguards, bank able use creditassessments. this intend strengthen internal firm discipline reduce “gaming”that become rampant old accord. but, supervisor know well, parameter ofincreased risk sensitivity must calibrate implement carefully avoid increase thepotential discontinuity adverse market circumstances.a complementary trend been, continue be, strengthen supervisory oversight.this imply move away direct control-type regulation type activity financialflows, towards supervision – move, words, away compliance portfolioconstraints, toward assessment whether overall management financial firm'sbusiness prudently conducted. there several reason shift (which reflect inpillar two revise basel accord). first, rapid development new instrument methodsof risk management make mechanical application balance sheet ratio inappropriate. second,regulation inevitably create incentive financial engineer find way around rules. moregenerally, regulation blunt instrument capture technicality sophisticationrequired control risk complex financial organisation.to effective, increase reliance supervisory oversight require upgrade supervisorycapacity, term staff skills. an effective supervisor must understand aspect afinancial firm's business, foresee multiple source risk likely confront. thismeans supervision become demand profession, skill require ofsupervisors become great diverse. account legal training, important,are long enough. supervisory authority go seek also staff background ineconomics business management. supervisor become like consultants, whose taskis understand bank's business draw management's attention underappreciated sourcesof risk.a third trend increase reliance market discipline. disclosure transparency animportant part robust financial architecture, third pillar new accord recognises.there still much do, asia elsewhere, raise disclosure standard allow market 4bis review 49/2001to provide necessary discipline. asia’s crisis stark lesson sweep problem underthe carpet solve them. at time, supervisor need take balance view utilityof market force aid stabilise behaviour. market participant may subject collectivemisperceptions risk, reflect underprice risk upswings. and even risk iscorrectly perceived, private response may appropriate viewpoint systemic stability.private behaviour affect expectation official action (moral hazard); short termhorizons induce nature contracts; differ interest principal agents;and generally combine effect force make commonly term “herdbehaviour”.finally, central banker supervisor increasingly aware generalise financial instabilityusually root macroeconomic factors. bank often get serious difficulty bythemselves. and do, usually remedy hand. crisis typically occur banksare jointly expose common macroeconomic shock. this realisation spur search fortechniques make bank system resilient financial version theeconomic cycle. bank need encourage build capital cushion good time theyare available protect lend cycle turn down. by token, would alsolessen risk credit cycle would unnecessarily exacerbate economic cycle hence therisk financial distress. among technique stress-testing, pre-provisioning, cyclicallyvariable loan value ratios, on. the strengthen supervisory review process (pillar 2)envisaged new accord could provide sound basis promote practices.monetary authorities, too, begin recognise complex two-way relationship betweenmonetary financial stability. the seed future financial instability usually sow byexcessive credit expansion. this facilitate build leverage financial system andexposes institution loss credit cycle turns. monetary policy moreconscious future risk accommodate excessive credit expansion unsustainablerise asset price often accompany it.iii.the organisation supervisory functionsas i note outset, also procedural issue consider adjust morecomplex environment. the blur distinction institution make increasingly importantto consistency supervisory rule enforcement method apply across differentsectors. in absence, would twin danger regulatory arbitrage competition laxity.this issue individual economy much increasingly integrate global financialsystem. hence, national international dimension question thesupervisory function best organised.at national level, two quite different approach pursued: bring regulatory,supervisory, oversight function together single entity, scandinavian first thelate 1980s others (e.g. japan, uk) copy since; or, keep entity separate, butcreate mechanism ensure appropriate co-ordination among relevant authorities. each hasadvantages disadvantages.at one level, single entity solution seem attractive. it would certainly seem preferable thepreponderance domestic institution integrate financial conglomerates. (but eventhen – netherlands – authority come different conclusions). and integration might bean attractive option history supervisory regulatory failure call adjustment areunlikely obtain within exist diversify structure.but even condition met, immediately clear regulatory activity thatit make sense bring together keep stand-alone basis. should example theprudential supervision bank financial institution integrated, market regulation,including customer investor protection, keep separate? experience well integratedregulators handle potentially conflict objective episode significant turmoil might tell.a single embrace financial authority naturally prompt question authority shouldreside. this subject intense debate quite number countries. and suchentities created, mostly exist outside central bank. this see anumber advantages: give blur distinction different type financialinstitutions, retention supervisory responsibility within central bank may give rise toperceptions lender last resort function extended, consequent risk moral bi review 49/20015hazard. there could also conflict interest monetary policy, central bank induce tobe excessively expansionary order head weakness individual financial institutions. thereis also issue reputational risk. finally, central bank may perceive powerful isboth independent endow broad range functions.there are, however, argument retain least supervisory function within centralbank. the central bank easy access market information case crisis, willbe easy coordinate monetary prudential policy actions. it easy ass andrespond build-up systemic risk supervisory authority also responsibilities, andhence specific know-how, area financial system (e.g. market function theoperation clear settlement systems), central banks. and, access supervisoryinformation help central bank good calibrate monetary policy (e.g. case the“headwinds” confront u economy recovery early 1990s).in terms, obviously “right” answer debate. individual observer may theirown preferences, end day, answer probably depend country-specificcircumstances. for example, independent political industry pressure separatesupervisor be? how scarce relevant skills? and blur distinction betweendifferent type financial intermediary become? some, charles goodhart*, argue thatthese consideration lead conclusion case combine supervisory monetarypolicy responsibility central bank generally strong emerge markets.but whatever answer question “who supervise?”, necessary define tasksclearly way tool available discharge them. one risk present trendto remove supervision task central bank central bank could leave aresponsibility overall financial stability neither clearly define support thenecessary power access information discharge it. so separate supervisory authoritiesare established, important set structure promote necessary exchange ofinformation permit central bank influence design prudential rules. much attention isbeing give subject country new supervisory structure put place.equally, however, supervisory responsibility remain central bank, important ittoo develop close co-ordination relevant authorities.a global super-regulator?of course, issue single regulator possible response national level exist atthe global level well. how ensure level play field internationally, term ofregulatory/prudential policy enforcement? an approach sometimes discuss set upa world financial authority, power set enforce regulation world-wide. i believesuch approach would either feasible desirable. it feasible, since littlechance sovereign legislature cede power regulatory area supranational body. and itwould necessarily desirable. a single regulator could well monolithic, disincline toexperiment new regulatory approaches. the rule would create might take adequateaccount particularity financial sector different jurisdictions. and insofar countrieshad agree regulatory initiatives, would risk converge low commondenominator.in view, promise approach adopt basel committee follow bymost standard-setting bodies. it draw set standard agree bysupervisors advance jurisdictions, whose broad adoption encourage peerpressure market forces. it remarkable note that, basel rule back noformal legislation, basel committee law-making mandate, recommendation havegreater acceptance force many treaty-based agreements.of course many issue remain. one ensure rule make restrict group adequatelyresponsive circumstance country member standard-setting group. thiscan achieve process consultation review, much wide range country isinvolved. another issue implementation. how country encourage adopt measuresthat strengthen financial systems? here part answer seem seek great *cae goodhart “the organisational structure financial supervision” fsi occasional paper no 1, bis, basel, 2000. 6bis review 49/2001support market. if market reward high standard easy access fund low costs,there little doubt strong internal pressure would create improve standards.perhaps appropriate say word financial stability forum. the forum wascreated 1999, include senior representative ministry finance, central bank andregulatory authority major financial markets, well representative maininternational organisation standard set bodies. a key reason set forum therealisation many body whose activity contribute financial stability astake preservation.the forum, words, tangible recognition fact financial stability require vigilancein number dimensions. individual financial institution run prudent lines, marketshave open transparent, financial infrastructure robust. all theseobjectives pursue global level, since financial industry global capitalmarkets increasingly integrated. yet global authority act area thatare required. the forum help fill gap, facilitate co-ordination effort thenumerous separate authority responsibility field financial stability.iv.conclusionin summary, prudential regulation become complex demanding, well moreimportant fascinating. it demand comprehensive approach hitherto. it bringingtogether multiple discipline attempt harness force market improve market’sstability. it stress great risk sensitivity, flexible supervision, reliance market discipline.this is, course, important step along road efficient resilientfinancial system. but important step. and work benefit u

economic growth. secondly, i shall say fewwords euro area financial system heading, two year introduction theeuro. after i shall discus role monetary policy interplay financial marketsand economic growth. towards end, i shall address, mention governor liebscher, therole central bank prudential supervision.does financial system matter economic growth?in financial system fund flow surplus fund shortage offunds, either direct, market-based finance indirect, bank-based finance. the former britishprime minister william gladstone express importance finance economy 1858 asfollows: "finance is, were, stomach country, organ take theirtone."the financial system comprise financial markets, instrument institutions. today i would like toaddress issue whether design financial system matter economic growth. my viewis answer question yes. accord cross-country comparisons, individual countrystudies well industry firm level analyses, positive link exist sophistication ofthe financial system

relation degree ofdevelopment financial system economic development.some economist believe finance-growth relationship important. for instance,robert lucas assert 1988 economist badly over-stress role financial factor ineconomic growth. moreover, joan robertson declare 1952 "where enterprise leads, financefollows". accord view, economic development create demand particular type offinancial

crucial ensure smooth transmission monetary impulses.the best contribution monetary policy make smooth function integration ofeuropean financial market economic growth maintain steady medium-term

important role growth perspective. supervisionis guardian financial stability, turn crucially determine capability financialsystem allocate resource efficiently absorb liquidity shocks. financial crisis deepand protract impact economic growth, illustrate several episode financial instabilitythat occur many countries. the contribution prudential supervision economic growthproceeds along two dimensions. from preventive perspective, supervision ensure acontinuous comprehensive monitor potential threat financial stability. the role ofsupervision also crucial emergence crisis, order provide swift orderedresolution. supervisor effective two respect able pay sufficientattention systemic issues, namely risk contagion effects. in order address issue aneffective way, able bridge gap information micro-prudential nature,namely information safety soundness individual institutions, macro-prudentialanalysis, encompass activity aim monitor exposure systemic risk atidentifying potential threat financial stability arise macroeconomic financial developments.this line argument would support large role central bank supervision, since havetraditionally play large role macro-prudential analysis preservation financial stabilityand acquire strong expertise field. furthermore, smooth access central banksto micro-prudential information would also profitable perspective another traditionalcentral bank task, namely oversight payment systems.in spite argument support large role central bank supervision, debate hasremained broadly inconclusive economic literature far, owe existence oppositeconsiderations. the first important argument large role central bank so-called"conglomeration argument", crucially rely idea blur distinction betweenbanking, insurance security firms. in order preserve level-playing field, segment thefinancial industry would supervise aegis common supervisor. accord tothis line reasoning, "umbrella" could central bank, since latter traditionally incharge supervise monetary organisations. i embark upon thorough analysis issuenow. let say i convince argument lose relevance current context bi review 48/20015characterised market-based conduct supervision – alleviate level-playing fieldconcern - increase relevance systemic risk issues.the second major argument large involvement central bank supervision allegedconflict interest monetary policy prudential supervision. many author arguedthat institution charge monetary policy cannot entrust supervision, themonetary policy stance would "contaminated" supervisory issues, instance need tosafeguard liquidity individual banks.the advent euro, however, shift balance argument decisively favour largeinvolvement national central bank (ncbs) supervision, two main reasons. first, argumentof conflict interest monetary policy prudential supervision become irrelevant withinthe euro area, supervisory responsibility national level. since geographicaljurisdictions

invite annual conference ifo institute munich. the ifoinstitute among renowned economic research institute germany. in addition toparticipating production joint spring autumn report german economic researchinstitutes, also play major role financial market compile economic analyses,particularly account ifo business climate index. moreover, ifo institute, itsacademic research number current economic policy issues, make valuable contribution todiscussions economic polices.1.introduction"european economic monetary union: success story" - many might ask whether anassessment make early stage. i know germany particular, manycitizens view changeover deutsche mark euro banknote coin muchscepticism. in opinion, question loss something well-established, i.e.the deutsche mark, real concern new currency. this sort reaction veryhuman. nevertheless, hold onto something well-established hind progress andchange bring many advantages. the participant european economic andmonetary union (emu) already come long way overcome number difficulties.the cash changeover simply complete process, begin begin 1999 thestart stage three emu. it mainly account technical reason euro banknotesand coin could introduce simultaneously start stage three emu beginningof 1999. despite this, national currency member state emu beenrepresenting denomination euro since then. the euro therefore already "our money".i like refer briefly period introduction single currency beginningof 1999. of course, talk past. the monetary policy european centralbank (ecb) forward-looking thus i shall take forward-looking stance myself. followinga brief review history emu, i like explain ecb's assessment monetaryand economic situation. in accordance ecb's strategy, i shall use two-pillar strategy asthe basis explanation analyse potential risk price stability. in respect, i liketo elaborate one important issue year next year cashchangeover.2.milestones path towards european economic monetary unionthe major plan establish european economic monetary union conceive thirty yearsago. in 1970 so-called werner plan draw chairmanship formerluxembourg prime minister, pierre werner. it mid-1980s, however, idea ofeuropean economic monetary union find sufficient political support able graduallymake concrete progress follow years. the single european act 1986 milestoneon path towards single european market. the latter characterise free movement ofgoods, services, labour capital. at end 1980s, delors report, draw upunder chairmanship president european commission, jacques delors, lay thefoundations introduction single currency. in respect, three stage process wasenvisaged together establishment european central bank primary objective ofmaintaining price stability. the first stage emu begin 1 july 1990 free movement ofcapital member states. this mark important step towards efficientallocation capital within european union. however, exchange rate risk remain animportant determine factor decision investors. 2bis review 58/2001when look back process towards single european currency, difficulty andtemporary setback forgotten, including, particular, em crisis autumn

financialmarkets see serious member state really issue integration.in november 1993, maastricht treaty come effect follow ratification memberstates. the treaty lay convergence criterion prerequisite join emu. on 1january 1994, begin stage two emu, european monetary institute (emi) wasestablished. the latter give task, forerunner european central bank, ofpreparing framework ecb, within european

interest rates, convergence inflation rates, reduction inthe general government budget deficit debt ratio well relatively stable exchange ratesbetween country join emu.given convergence long-term interest rate towards relatively low level, market participantsgave ecb vote confidence start stage three emu. moreover, inflationaryexpectations remain low since begin stage three emu. i shall elaborate thisissue late speech. this show ecb achieve high credibility term itsprimary objective maintain price stability. i like explain economic monetarydevelopments euro area outlook price stability context two-pillarstrategy.3.the first pillar ecb's strategy - monetary development give grind afavourable outlook price stabilityas know, ecb assign prominent role monetary development euro area within thecontext monetary policy strategy. empirical evidence monetary development euro areapoints towards stable relationship demand broad monetary aggregate m3 pricedevelopments well towards good lead indicator property m3 growth inflation themedium term.the ecb pursue monetary targeting, instead, set reference value growth ofthe broad monetary aggregate m3 variety reasons. this reference value derive thebasis eurosystem's definition price stability, i.e. increase harmonise index ofconsumer price (hicp) euro area 2% compare previous year andassumptions trend potential output growth 2% 21/2% well trend declinein velocity m3 1/2% 1% per annum.the reference value m3 constitute anchor analysis communication monetarydevelopments euro area. the monetary analysis is, however, restrict comparison ofthe current growth m3 reference value, rather incorporate much broad approach.because, order able interpret monetary development accurately, crucial know theprecise reason developments. this mean that, addition broad monetaryaggregate m3, individual component m3 counterpart money, particular thedynamics loan private sector, must analyse respect implication futureprice developments. allow briefly explain detail analysis force behind monetarydevelopments important.not every increase m3 growth excess potential growth effect consumption andhence, necessarily pose threat price stability. great dynamic monetary development can,particularly short term, attributable portfolio movement example, temporaryand therefore tend problem inflationary developments. this probably case inthe first month 2001 uncertainty stock market temporarily increase theattractiveness short-term secure assets. the aim analysis must, therefore, trace thegrowth m3 back underlie factor order ass extent component ofthe monetary development relevant future domestic price developments.the revision m3, ecb make publication monetary data april, also beconsidered light. the ecb recently come position indicate extent bi review 58/20013money market fund shares/units hold non-euro area resident exclude theseshares/units m3. all national central bank (ncbs) euro area regularly report data onthe money market fund share/unit hold non-euro area resident accordance generalreporting obligation context money bank statistics. from conceptual point view,m3 capture money hold household firm locate euro area. aboveall, close link domestic private consumption domestic price developments.the money hold non-residents are, contrast, likely use portfolio purposes.these revision bring back monetary aggregate m3 close theoretical concept,thereby tend strengthen information content m3 domestic price developments.purchases money market fund shares/units non-euro area resident increase follow startof stage three emu, whereas previously little importance. the demand forshort-term, high-quality instrument likely stimulated, one hand, structural factor suchas, fiscal consolidation industrial country result decline issuance ofgovernment debt securities, other, economic factor flatten yieldcurve.one correction m3 statistic still need made. to date, provisional data areavailable purchase money market paper short-term debt security non-euro arearesidents. by end year, revise m3 figure publish take full account ofnegotiable instrument hold non-euro area residents.one important general challenge produce interpret statistic maximise theireconomic content. the revision monetary statistic order take account purchase ofnegotiable instrument non-euro area resident step direction. the monetarystatistics among advance statistic available euro area. they base afully harmonise consolidate balance sheet fully harmonise money-issuing andmoney-holding sectors, well harmonise financial instruments. in view close link withinflationary development good lead indicator property future inflation, monetarydevelopments must also play prominent role monetary policy strategy ecb future.since second quarter 2000, growth m3 decline mainly account increasein short-term interest rates. adjust money market fund shares/units hold non-euroarea residents, m3 grow annual rate around 41/2% first four month 2001. if currentdata purchase money market paper short-term debt security non-euro area residentsare also take account, annual rate growth m3 recent month probably beenslightly reference value m3. overall, monetary development therefore point towards afavourable outlook medium-term maintenance price stability.growth credit private sector euro area increase relatively strongly since startof stage three emu. in particular 2000, credit demand can, however, attributedto finance need context merger acquisitions, partly outside euro area, tothe finance umts licences. these factors, however, likely affect domestic pricedevelopments. in respect, dynamic loan private sector euro area also supportthe outlook monetary development future price developments.4.the second pillar ecb strategy - real gdp growth around level trendpotential growthi like talk real economic situation. the analysis second pillar theecb's monetary strategy also confirm current level key interest rate remain appropriateto ensure euro area economy able maintain price stability medium term.macroeconomic projection development euro area recently publish thejune monthly bulletin expert eurosystem. a announce last year conduct indecember 2000 first time, projection produce twice year expert thenational central bank euro area member state collaboration expert ecb.they serve input assessment economic development risk price stabilityconducted govern council ecb within framework second pillar themonetary policy strategy ecb.when interpret projections, always take account base aset technical assumption therefore "unconditional". the projection areproduced, example, basis unchanged short-term interest rate unchanged bilateral 4bis review 58/2001euro exchange rates. the projection eurosystem expert therefore "conditional" notdirectly comparable "unconditional" projection publish institution theeuropean commission, imf oecd, example. moreover, projection publishedin form ranges, order take account degree uncertainty. the range reflect theaverage forecast error previous period therefore differ projectedvariables projection horizon.compared december 2000, growth expectation 2000 2001 reduced. it isprobable 2001 real gdp growth euro area decline compare strongincrease observe 2000, recover slightly 2002. overall, year next year willbroadly line trend potential growth euro area. at time, hicp inflation willprobably somewhat high 2000 expect end last year. the expectation thatinflation fall 2001 remain 2% 2002, has, however, remain unchanged,meaning ecb meet objective maintain price stability medium term.i like go detail prospect growth euro area. eurostats firstestimate growth real gdp first quarter 2001 confirm economic growth inthe euro area moderate since second half 2000. moreover, industrial production declinedfurther april. the sentiment indicator available euro area also confirm weak economicgrowth. the survey provide ass situation prospect economy constitute avaluable source information up-to-date economic analysis. you also make valuablecontribution towards up-to-date assessment economic development germany theproduction ifo business climate index. in context, emphasise thegoverning council ecb adopt area-wide perspective assessment economicconditions outlook price stability.it likely course year decline global economic growth show asomewhat large extent case net export developments. while globaltrade (excluding euro area) increase last year around 12%, probably rise justunder 6% year accord eurosystem's projections. this negative impact onexport prospect euro area. while growth export (including intra-trade) rise double-digitrates last year, growth rate current year, basis unchanged euro exchange rate,are expect lie somewhere 5% 8%. the contribution net export togdp growth should, therefore, decline considerably compare previous year largelyneutral current year.as illustrate economic growth euro area first quarter 2001, subdue exportprospects put pressure domestic demand particularly investment. despite thesenegative factor one not, however, forget positive factor contribute towards astabilisation domestic demand. these factor include still favourable finance condition forinvestment consumption slight increase employment euro area.furthermore, fundamental economic imbalances, particularly respect personalsavings ratio, could put pressure consumption euro area.against background, consumer confidence euro area relatively robust recentmonths. despite slightly weak assessment general economic situation late surveyin may, consumer confidence euro area still historically high level. in respect, thesepositive factor make valuable contribution towards ensure growth remain broadly inline potential.i like elaborate price development year next year. follow averageannual hicp inflation rate 2.3% euro area last year, temporary pressure likely causeinflation 2% long period time expect end 2000 allinstitutions. strain factor ease factor battle time. theheavy impact energy price development ease considerably year. for time atleast, renew increase energy price second quarter year delay fall inthe inflation rate euro area. in addition, increase food price result bse theoutbreak foot-and-mouth disease member state impact ondevelopments hicp. furthermore, increase administer price indirecttaxation country euro area cause inflation rate rise pastfew months. these factor should, however, temporary effect inflation euro area.lower economic growth also seem point decline pressure price level. bi review 58/20015in spite fact factor temporary effect price developments, cautionis warranted. above all, important inflation rate 2% long period time doesnot lead high wage demands. until now, wage development euro area beenrelatively moderate. important wage negotiation will, however, take place second half 2001and 2002. further development wage therefore closely monitor ecb. hence,we continue remain vigilant.despite long period time inflation stand 2%, inflation expectation sofar hardly change euro area. the difference nominal french government bondyields correspond real yield french index-linked government bond use anapproximation measure inflationary expectations. this so-called break-even inflation rate hasremained 2% ten-year government bond since start stage three emu andcurrently stand around average level see 2000. this imply financial market areconvinced ecb able keep inflation euro area 2% medium term.this success monetary policy, particularly difficult time externaleconomic influence temporary factor transitory impact hicp inflation.the relatively low long-term interest rate arise low inflation rate expectation hencefavourable finance condition valuable contribution monetary policy possiblymake achieve sustainable sound growth prospect euro area.in addition monetary policy responsible behaviour part social partners, fiscalpolicy also responsible ensure sound long-term growth. in order achieve this, fiscal policymust continue process consolidation lay stability growth pact thenational stability programmes. at time, fiscal policy must create attractive economicenvironment business investment supply demand labour. in respect, mostnational government euro area already take step right direction. low tax rateson business household is, respect, welcome. however, reduction taxrates require appropriate adjustment make order meet objective fiscalconsolidation, example expansion tax base cut expenditure side. until nowthis take place sufficient extent. the reduction expenditure ratio past fewyears euro area has, all, achieve low interest payment lowerexpenditure unemployment benefit course strong expansion economy.structural spend cut must ambitious order meet objective sustainable fiscalconsolidation.the budget deficit euro area probably rise slightly 2001, exclude proceed thesales umts licence last year. this would mean euro area member state maynot able meet fiscal consolidation objective current year, despite fact thateconomic growth euro area probably broadly line potential. in order achievea sound sustainable fiscal position, however, euro area member state require tocontinue fiscal consolidation effort lay medium-term fiscal plan accordancewith stability growth pact.other area effort need make national governments, particular thelarge euro area member states, include good labour markets. also areas, firststeps right direction taken. the deregulation good market must, however, beexpedited order increase competition strengthen growth economy. this theonly way increase long-term growth potential euro area. with regard labour markets,unemployment fall considerably past year stand 8.3% april 2001. thenumber unemployed decline one million compare april last year, eventhough, recently, decline unemployment actually decrease slightly seasonallyadjusted terms. an unemployment figure 8.3% is, however, much high. further incentive needto make respect demand taking-up employment. this require onlyfurther reform tax systems, particular also social security systems.5.the implication euro cash changeoverfinally, i like talk issue which, begin next year, focalpoint: euro cash changeover. by 1 january 2002, 14.25 billion euro banknote 50 billion coinswill produce 12 member state euro area. the introduction banknote andcoins enormous logistical challenge. a know, ecb has, therefore, decide thefrontloading euro banknote coin credit institution euro area sub-frontloading 6bis review 58/2001of euro banknote coin credit institution special condition professional cash userscan begin 1 september year.owing monetary nature, euro cash changeover present logistical challenge,but also affect economic analysis within framework monetary policy strategy theecb.a visible sign potential impact cash changeover monetary development annualrate growth currency circulation negative since end last year stand at-2.9% april. preparation euro-area resident cash changeover could factor thesedevelopments. it possible factor become even important course theyear, grow number population pay liquid reserve banks, notdirectly need cash hand. the effect transaction overall development m3should, however, relatively minor, large part liquid reserves, hold cash onhand, invest deposit also include m3. if case, m3 growthshould largely remain unaffected.not citizen euro area, also non-euro area resident cash hold thecurrent national currency euro area country prepare cashchangeover. in particular, affect inhabitant central eastern europe use deutschemark banknote parallel respective national currencies. accord estimate make bythe deutsche bundesbank, deutsche mark hold abroad mid-1990s account around30% 40% german currency circulation (see franz seitz: the circulation deutschemark abroad, discussion paper 1/95, deutsche bundesbank, may 1995). that equivalent aroundeur 45 billion, could potentially flow back euro area, presume amount hasremained unchanged since then.according available sources, actual flowback cash hold abroad should, however,be lot lower. owe geographical proximity close trade link central easterneurope, deutsche mark use many country store value also atransaction currency. therefore, unlikely demand deutsche mark completelyreplaced demand non-euro area currencies. in addition this, exchange nationalcurrencies euro area euro equally possible outside euro area willprobably also use large extent population. it difficult speculate behaviourof informal side economy. at time, however, forget aretalking relatively small part economy, even though part economy us cashto relatively large extent. in addition, empirical find have, date, give hard evidence anysignificant flowback deutsche mark banknote abroad. in light this, unlikely thatthere major effect growth m3 significant impact exchange rate ofthe euro result euro cash changeover.in addition, ecb also closely monitor potential price risk relate euro cashchangeover. in principle, cannot rule business try use changeover theeuro order introduce price increases. this would temporarily affect inflationary development inthe euro area. in respect, use dual price display method benefit forthe consumers, allow make direct comparison price respectivenational denomination euro euro. against background, ecb appeal theconsumers vigilant respect possible price increase result euro cashchangeover.it forgotten, however, conversion price former national currency ofthe euro area euro sometimes lead favourable round effect point view ofpsychological price setting. in addition, hard competition retail sector make possible forprice increase introduce easily. comparison similar conversion past, theintroduction decimal system unite kingdom begin 1970s abolitionof cent netherlands 1983 show, all, effect price level generallynegligible. finally, many euro area member state intensify monitor prices. theirgovernments also guarantee overall, general government will, context euroconversion, waive receipt arise fee charge levy convert price aneutral manner smooth favour consumer. overall, possible short-term price costburdens should, therefore, see longer-term favourable price effect result lowertransaction cost great price transparency euro area. without doubt, however, pricedevelopments relate euro cash changeover need closely monitor come bi review 58/20017months participants, include general government

prosperity population. i confident fiscal policy social partner also maketheir contribution, longer-term prospect euro area favourable euro area willbecome increasingly attractive dynamic location. i doubt suchcircumstances success emu past shall continue future. i say view also ofthe enlargement european union towards central eastern europe. major reform euare need order achieve integration. the fact european integrationconstitutes positive growth potential enhance competition result interplayof force not, however, overlooked. i like refer back open lines: holdingonto something well-established hind progress change canbring many advantages. this apply introduction euro also theenlargement european union.ladies gentlemen, thank attention. bi review 58/20011hermann remsperger: the evolution inflation measurement: centralbanker's viewaddress professor hermann remsperger, member directorate deutsche bundesbank,at symposium “hedonic method price statistics” hold wiesbaden, 21 june 2001.* * *ifive year ago, boskin commission remind u inflation measurement anything butsimple. although expert know many problem quite long time, take boskinreport reawaken public awareness. this force statistical office – and, course, also centralbanks – sit take note situation countries. the boskin report prompt thebundesbank, too, devote attention problem inflation measurement.in mid-sixties, bundesbank submit report federal fiscal court thefollowing opinion reached: “in general, consider reduction value ofmoney cost-of-living index rise by, say, 1 per cent per annum; annual increase ofbetween 1 2 per cent index regard indicate deterioration value ofmoney certain reservations.” in bundesbank’s annual derivation monetary target,this factor reflect medium-term price assumption 1½ 2% per year.in 1998, research group arrive conclusion range uncertainty measuringinflation western germany clearly 1 per cent. there hardly thorough empiricalstudies topic germany time. and much change meantime.yet exactly reason problem measure german price remain researchagenda. we certainly wish take easy way doctor inflation figure downward,nor wish overstate germany’s real economic performance. instead, duty run realitychecks statistical methods, analyse implication economic policy general andtheir importance monetary policy particular.this work also important calculation real aggregate national accounts. in may2001 monthly report, present result new study topic. it show real growthwould develop second half ninety u method calculate nationalaccounts apply germany. the quantitative outcome hedonic price use ofchained index increase germany’s statistical growth second half 90’s nearly½ percentage point per annum.we present result research together federal statistical office press. andthis one indication excellently federal statistical office deutschebundesbank cooperating, field german economic statistic general pricestatistics particular. and let point bundesbank’s inflation study 1998 would nothave possible without generous support helpful comment give u membersof staff federal statistical office. our joint sponsorship conference, sobrilliantly organise chair wolfgang brachinger, another example good closecooperation.iii know, however, central bank research paper take critical look statistical methodsare always welcome open arm statistical offices. for instance, often argue thatstudies orient towards ideal world cost-of-living index hardly relevant official statisticssince price statistic found principle pure price comparisons.i want go detail rather fundamental discussion stage. however, i believethat economic policy perspective possible generate meaningful consumer priceindex without take recourse economic criteria. the minute one encounter problem ofadjusting quality changes, centrepiece conference, get arounddrawing picture consumer assessment consumers’ sellers’ behaviour market. 2bis review 58/2001by token, i don’t think would desirable look perfect “cost-of-living” index,meaning index base sophisticate theoretical structure microeconomics, without takinginto account feasibility aspect. for reason necessary open dialoguebetween statistical practitioners, researcher users.if look way, price statistic never static. some year ago, alan greenspandelivered speech frankfurt, quote official u government compare anation's statistical system tailor, measure economy much tailor measure person asuit – difference “person” measure run try measure him.the way statistical system succeed, u official said, fast twice asflexible. that challenge lie ahead, is, indeed, large one.iiinow, five year publication boskin study, certainly allow ask follow twoquestions: what lesson actually learned? and practical implication pricestatistics?the first thing we’ve learn statistical distortion occur uppermost level ofprice aggregation use fix basket good generally quite insignificant, index arechanged new, up-to-date basket good timely manner. this condition sufficientlyfulfilled harmonise index consumer prices. and indicator inflation use theeuropean central bank define stability target.as low level aggregation, ernst diewert remind u something already preachedby irving fisher: we cost avoid calculate arithmetical mean unweighted rate ofprice change. and exactly reason, hicp base exclusively geometricmean rate change average prices. so european way calculate figure fulfillsa second important condition proper price measurement.however, big challenge arise vast field new products, new type product newchannels distribution. this pose whole set problem official price statistics, notyet possible solve fully satisfactory manner. for instance, hardly feasible totake due account new good new type outlet “real time” measure inflation. in thehicp, therefore, turn uniform threshold value: share new product exceed 0.1 percent total expenditure, product include price index. it true methodfails capture increase consumer surplus generate new product early pricedecreases. however, i see way solve problem. incidentally, remainingmeasurement bias likely large, since fundamental product innovation tend rare.all mention 0.1 per cent provision seem adequate.the major problem new product variants, thus adjust quality difference whenreplacing obsolete item remains. and big issue environment mark rapid productinnovations. and i envy statistical office jobs. our research germany hasshown that, practice, even uniform quality adjustment method lead diverge result dependingon individual “price collector”. therefore, centralisation quality adjustment path oftenproposed. however, reach european level time being. another way toeliminate unreliable method quality adjustment apply method individual “pricecollectors” balance result unbiased estimate true price change. this germanyhas try solve problem, also eurostat’s method far.in view, pragmatic approach carry

advance emerge economy last twodecades, israel among them. 2bis review 57/2001such crisis characterize wide fluctuation price asset (real estate shares) inthe exchange rate, bankruptcies, severe hardship, financial institutions. a list mostprominent example crisis israel last twenty year includes:(cid:1) persistent government difficulty sell bond begin 1980s thebackground two-digit deficit

en route, as:(cid:1) the banks’ “special offer” loan purchase mutual fund 1993;(cid:1) the large devaluation october 1998, grow awareness significance ofexchange-rate risk, hitherto consider problem bank israel totackle. this refer threat banks’ stability result exposure, butof customers’ unrestrained exposure.(cid:1) the lack resource mortgage market add problem face realestate industry try

ofsupervision, i go question supervision financial markets, except tosay mechanism proper coordination various supervisory authority israel’seconomy sorely needed, pity yet activated.the second artificial restriction impose authority time themechanism market. the removal restriction essential financial crisis beavoided. the major one are:1. earmark bondsthe arrangement regard bond earmark pension fund provide clear example ofsuch restriction market mechanism. this arrangement systematically destroy market fortradable government bonds, existence one precondition market privatebonds, provide bank system basis price system medium- long-termdeposits credit.this phenomenon earmark bond spread even quickly(cid:1) require tax reform assign tax benefit pension save mainly save

thegovernment support pension save wish beyond grant tax benefits,it would good directly vis-à-vis pensioners, mean test basis.2. the crawl exchange-rate bandthe band intend contain, currently within fairly wide limits, possible fluctuation rate ofexchange. it well know condition bring creation banddisappeared long ago:(cid:1) initially band serve advance version exchange rate, nominal anchorfor inflation. the exchange rate role play many years;(cid:1) then, transition upward-sloping band, slope band define asreflecting difference inflation israel countries; havedisappeared;(cid:1) next, wake

exchange-ratefluctuations it;(cid:1) while change take place, agree 1994 allow market todetermine rate exchange, domestic foreign-exchange market developed. it involveddomestic bank foreign financial institutions. daily turnover growing, markethas low volatility. the fact bank israel avoid market intervention, theexperience external financial shock lead good awareness among public ofexchange-rate risk. this dual effect:a.speculative activity rarity market.b.when asset liability portfolio put together, interest-rate differentialsbetween israel abroad, exist long time still exist areoutweighed exchange-rate risk. consequently, difficult discern change inthe composition asset liability portfolio response change interest-rate differential around current level, component capital flow hashardly affect rate exchange.in words, interest-rate differential explain actual rate ofexchange close bottom limit band. the main reason closenesslie inflow long-term capital couple upward slope limit theband. for sake accuracy add recent weakness euroagainst dollar.on hand, protect low limit band cause financial complications:(cid:1) the purchase foreign currency lead towards new equilibrium must undertakenwhile price falling. the current positive slope, even fall zero, allow thisto happen, non-stabilizing factor.(cid:1) the obligation purchase foreign currency mean initiative implementingmonetary policy transfer importer capital, although intention ofparticipating management. they import capital accord needs, notto inject economy order manner liquidity requires. it clear undersuch condition monetary control may affected.(cid:1) the instrument absorption available bank israel neutralize injectionderiving purchase foreign currency form banks’ deposit thebank. the bank

withthe loss inherent activity. it could transfer bank pay asimilar rate interest ni deposit bank israel rate receive itsforeign-currency investments. the bank would course pas customer bycutting interest pay depositor raise interest charge borrowers.and would complaint high bank spread. alternatively, bankof israel could record loss books, previous occasion. in finalanalysis cost course bear taxpayer, i believe last thing thegovernment want raise tax burden roundabout way.we bear mind cannot evaluate advance importance course action.we know last occasion, bank israel purchase $ 16.5 billion. an increase $ 1billion money supply would currently mean rise 4 percent, whereas annualincrease 10 percent consider fast. the simple solution abolish exchange-rateband. if bank israel defend it, end result would abolition case, afterincurring high unnecessary price. it preferable take step initiative, andnot pressure market.3.the ceiling treasury bill issuesby law treasury bill instrument

well nation integrate new technology intoour society.in remark today, i would like offer perspective challenge create theinteraction new technology skill american workforce, educationalsystem past

imply need strengthen cognitive skill ofour overall workforce. an increase proportion workforce must equip simply withtechnical know-how, also ability create, analyze, transform information

today'srecipients diploma expect many job acquire use ever-expandingrange skill work lives.it may seem credible educational system show many study stifle learn betweenthe fourth twelfth grade relative

18 june 2001.* * *in remark today i would like discus conduct monetary policy interaction thefinancial markets. a know, monetary policy effective work financial market andtherefore market key part transmission process. the smooth conduct monetarypolicy therefore support well function financial markets. thus one major challenge formonetary authority interact financial market way foster effectiveconduct monetary policy pursuit objective price stability.my remark concentrate three main aspect relationship monetaryauthority financial markets.(cid:1) firstly, i begin address question whether financial market shouldreact monetary authority monetary authority react financialmarkets. perhaps surprisingly, i argue leadership part monetaryauthority key order ensure price stability medium term. however, beclear – paraphrase alan meltzer – policy conduct context aconsistent strategy lead systematic decision-making process us information ina consistent predictable way.(cid:1) this link second point i review evidence financial market onthe predictability credibility ecb policy since start stage 3. i shall argue theevidence strongly suggest ecb policy credible throughout – andlarge – also predictable.(cid:1) thirdly, i shall discus motivation behind decision cut official interest rate the10th may year i believe offer interest example surprisingthe market unavoidable.in discussion interrelationship monetary policy financial market one seetwo distinct strand argument. the first monetary authority lead financialmarkets. in case monetary policy lead signal intention – impact – thefinancial markets. in case ecb intention clearly signal market participant viaour stability orient monetary policy strategy. the commitment price stability medium termand systematic analysis available information induce ‘rule like’ behaviour behalfof market participants. this lead react new development manner consistent themonetary policy strategy, thus aid smooth conduct monetary policy. for example, themarkets correctly anticipate new piece information lead change official interestrates ‘much work’ change term structure.in environment, communication monetary authority utmost importance isdirected towards inform market assessment outlook price stability andpreparing market future policy moves, thereby avoid unnecessary volatility supportingthe smooth conduct policy.another idea financial market lead monetary authority follows. in world, themonetary authority seek satisfy expectation financial market – extreme case:whatever – never surprise them. if monetary authority expectedthe financial market ‘punish’ – example demand high risk premia cover greateruncertainty. an important point bear mind sometimes appear financialmarkets lead monetary authority fact reverse true. this ‘rulelike’ behaviour i mention early lead market correctly anticipate monetary policydecisions hence react advance monetary authorities. nevertheless, still themonetary policy strategy monetary authority determine reaction.as i already indicate i support idea monetary authority ‘follow themarkets’. to explain i rely quote allan blinder, put argument verysuccinctly: 2bis review 55/2001“...following market may nice way avoid unsettle financial surprises, alegitimate end itself. but i fear may produce rather poor monetary policy, several reasons. oneis speculative market tend run herd overreact almost everything. central bankersneed cautious prudent. another financial market seem extremely susceptibleto fad speculative bubbles, sometimes stray far fundamentals. central banker mustinoculate whimsy keep eye fundamentals. finally, trader infinancial market – even long-term instrument – often behave ludicrouslyshort time horizons, whereas maintain long time horizon essence proper centralbanking.”obviously people would argue make sense monetary authority toslavishly follow expectation financial markets. nevertheless, clearly desirable policy tobe predictable order reduce uncertainty volatility financial markets. so, themonetary authority always satisfy expectation financial markets? there number ofpossible explanation i would like highlight. however, so, one point iwould like emphasise strongly. this interest monetary authoritydeliberately aim surprise financial markets. it sometimes suggest central bankersoccasionally set ‘trick’ market expect one policy outcome deliver quitedifferent one. let u quite clear monetary authority would merely increasevolatility financial market damage credibility. it would nothing aid smoothconduct monetary policy pursuit price stability.turning plausible reason financial market sometimes surprise monetarypolicy decisions, first point i would like highlight informational asymmetry themarkets monetary authority. more specifically, monetary authority piece ofinformation disposal market participant not. with rapid effective method ofinformation dissemination available situation likely emerge veryoften. nonetheless, i shall discus little later, asymmetric information sometimes explain whymarket expectation fulfilled.the second point – even information set – monetary authority thefinancial market may share assessment economic, financial monetarysituation. there may simply difference dominant view market view ofthe monetary authority regard significance new piece information theirimplications conduct monetary policy. the occasional emergence difference viewis inevitable may lead central bank surprise market policy moves.a third reason relate credibility – perhaps financial market believe monetaryauthority decide policy accord announce decision make framework. maybe thinkthat vulnerable outside pressure may lead deviate state objectives.one way address point good communication markets. this leadsto fourth reason monetary authority may sometimes surprise market – someform communication problem monetary authority markets. perhaps thefinancial market fully understand decision framework use monetary authorityand/or assessment current prospective economic, monetary financial developments. iwould argue ‘teething problems’ communication financial market inevitable anew institution. the ecb still learn best communicate message markets.the financial market still learn – track record – application ecb’smonetary policy strategy.i turn attention evidence extent ecb monetary policy bothcredible predictable eye financial markets.a key indicator credibility ecb monetary policy come expectation inflation imply bythe difference return real nominal bonds. in regard, break-even inflationrate french index link bond consistently line ecb’s quantitativedefinition price stability, indicate persistently high degree credibility ecb monetary policy.moving question predictability seem fair say policy move generally beenanticipated money markets. this see one look imply short term interestrates subsequent official interest rate move seem exhibit high degreecorrespondence. accord work undertake gaspar, perez-quiros & sicilia (2001) whoexamine behaviour overnight interest rates, market appear make systematic bi review 55/20013errors respect monetary policy announcements. furthermore, development volatilityimplied option 3-month euribor future indicate degree uncertainty amonginvestors respect future development short-term interest rate generally decline followingan interest rate change ecb. indeed, extent uncertainty around time interestrate change seem diminish magnitude time. this consistent notion thatinvestors become confident forecast future short-term interest ratedevelopments prior ecb monetary policy announcements.nevertheless, one could claim every single occasion policy always wellanticipated money markets. this see fact two occasion year – onthe 21st 22nd february 12th 17th april – underbid theeurosystem’s main refinance operations. it appear market participant expect areduction interest rate therefore prefer participate auctions. when theseexpectations fulfil shortage liquidity market.policy move also seem generally well anticipate bond markets. since startof stage three emu, official ecb interest rate change appear limitedimmediate impact nominal bond yield measure average yield 10-year governmentbonds issue euro area.furthermore, ecb rate change appear induce noticeable additional volatility inthe break-even inflation rate french index link bonds. this would seem suggest themonetary policy action ecb bring significant revision among investorswith respect objective ecb. in sense, action ecb appear beentransparent markets. bond market volatility also declined. imply volatility 10-yeargerman bund future fell markedly course 2000 subsequently stabilised.in sum, i would argue evidence financial market support idea since thestart stage 3, ecb policy always credible usually predictable. by andlarge communication strategy market work surprisingly well new institution.nevertheless, occasionally necessary central bank surprise markets. a i alreadymentioned, recent monetary policy decision attract attention felt thatthey well anticipate markets. most notably decision low official interest rateson 10th may year come surprise financial markets.the decision make 25-basis-point rate interest rate see ecb adjustment ofthe level interest rate somewhat low inflationary pressure medium term. a regardsthe first pillar monetary policy strategy, felt monetary development long poseda risk price stability. a regard second pillar, felt upward risk price stability overthe medium term diminish somewhat.the change assessment risk price stability first pillar provide interestingillustration problem face central bank communicate policy financial markets.however, circumstance monetary policy decision unusual change inassessment come become possible quantify significant upward distortion m3 moneysupply growth. for time, indication monetary growth figure aredistorted upwards non-euro area residents’ purchase negotiable paper include m3. aroundthe time preparation govern council meeting, become clear magnitude ofthis distortion significant high previously expected. a regard hold ofmoney

similar size relate non-resident hold money market fund units/shares.given magnitude distortion clear information need place thepublic domain without delay. however, create dilemma – whether release

move. however, imagine press conference follow govern council 4bis review 55/2001meeting revise m3 data released. you sure one first question tothe president would been: ‘against background new

trichet, governor banque de france, europeanfinancial market convention (efmc 2001), paris, 15 june 2001.* * *ladies gentlemen,it great pleasure participate european financial market convention. theimpressively dense program convention illustrate integration financial market ineurope major multi-dimensional challenge. the banque de france eurosystem havea strong interest issues. in particular, safe efficient function clear andsettlement system euro area crucial stability efficiency financial system andfor good implementation monetary policy. the consolidation market infrastructure,currently underway, contribute reach objective foster market liquidityand reduction transaction costs. there however single path consolidation: willbe market select way best fit needs, regulator tothe eurosystem make sure result infrastructure adequately safe, efficient reliable.i would like share view broad perspective financial globalisation.as know, globalisation world economy development financial market weredriven two key factors:(cid:1) firstly, financial deregulation -reinforced europe set single market andsubsequently economic monetary union- liberalise capital flow andenhanced competition among financial sectors;(cid:1) secondly, technical financial innovation, simultaneously pave way thecreation financial market deep, liquid interconnected.what interest stress

consumers.last least, growth market finance allow save channel directly intoinvestment. reduce share bank financing, consequently money creation, hasenabled le inflationary finance economy. thus increased, monetary stability hasproduced tangible positive effect contribute decisively strong sustainable growthof world economy.however, globalisation financial integration decisively contribute improve overalleconomic efficiency, experience also suggest financial asset price experience somecircumstances somewhat erratic developments. the rapid emergence "new economy" bubble in1999 early 2000- follow series sharp corrections- illustrate potential market forproviding fund real economy, particularly innovative sectors; demonstratedagain tendency market over-react, move excessive optimism disproportionatepessimism, ensue negative consequence behaviour firm households.thus financial authority confront boom-bust episode must carefullymonitored, since could affect global monetary financial stability. i would like therefore toconsider two issue here:(cid:1) first, factor encourage excessively homogeneous market behaviour may hind asmooth efficient function markets, 2bis review 54/2001(cid:1) second, authority might reflect way foster diverse behaviour onthe markets.some factor encourage excessively homogeneous market behaviour may hind smoothand efficient function marketseven though fix interest rate market tendency somewhat contra-cyclical, financialasset price tend fluctuate widely sometimes deviate economic fundamental forlong period time.experience suggest asset price cycle continue substantialin last two decade market force indeed tend cause misalignment betweenequilibrium actual asset prices. stock market particular experience phenomenon.but foreign exchange market well, price also tendency diverge substantially fromtheir “equilibrium level”, although divergence contain fruitful g7co-operation last 15 years.in addition, market see increase volatility frequent volatility peaks.although cyclical move clearly distinguish volatility, latter may somecircumstances exceed consider optimal, make price determination mechanismless efficient thus contribute misalignments.moreover, demonstrate number financial crisis last two decades, contagionamong country across financial market frequent. a result, investor havefaced asset price fluctuation might synchronise before.lastly, connection credit, asset price business cycle tend amplifycyclical swings. credit, particular, play important role asset price fluctuations. observedin particular “speculative bubbles” 1980s early 1990s, trend persisted.another example provide boom-bust cycle asset price often associatedwith sharp economic contractions.several factor play financial asset price experience amplify movesi shall give examples.some market participant become incline engage "short-termism", is, mightbe preoccupy short-term results. this trend might result, particular, growingpressure yield immediate financial result necessarily sustainable. marking-to-market allassets liability also contribute widespread focus immediate financialperformances. this focus short-term performance translate additional volatility pricediscovery process: short investment horizon market participants, big impact ofany new information prices.mimetic behaviour mean new phenomenon financial markets. however, technologicaldevelopments market may gradually reinforce type behaviour. the spread ofbenchmarking, allow fund manager client measure performance otherfunds, together grow competition within sector, appear increase suchmimetic behaviour. some operator come conclusion good wrong alongwith everybody else, rather take risk right, wrong, alone. a strike example ofrational mimetic behaviour influence hedge fund enjoyed, year ago, "opinionleaders" trend makers. by nature, trend follow amplify imbalance may somepoint affect market, potentially lead vicious circle price adjustment liquidation ofpositions.the spread certain fund management techniques, particular index management, hasproven popular equity markets, may contribute amplify movement financialasset prices. this technique endeavour match accurately possible development stockmarket benchmark indices. it therefore mechanistically lead manager accentuate current pricetrends buy stock rise sell falling. it argue bi review 54/20013index fund distort price target index that, result, index might end upcreating rather measure performance.the impact risk management technique market dynamic particularly enlighten regardto question asset price overshooting. value-at-risk calculation become crucial elementof standard approach use market participant evaluate risk inherent marketactivities set exposure limits. of course, central bank financial institution continueto encourage use instruments. but, time financial turmoil, grow use ofhomogeneous risk management technique financial intermediary paradoxical effectof amplify initial shock spill-over effect. regardless intrinsic quality riskmanagement tools, grow use may produce adverse consequences. when marketplayers rely converge risk evaluations, tend take decision time,thus amplify initial shock price trade volumes.all factor one consequence common: encourage homogenous behaviour andreactions detriment diversity indispensable smooth function financialmarkets.for reason, authority might reflect way – conjunction financialindustry – foster behavioural diversity global marketsmonetary policy alone cannot guarantee stability financial systems, may jeopardisedby shock financial real economies. however, must stress anadequate monetary policy fundamental prerequisite smooth financial cycles. anappropriate monetary stance crucial bank monetary participant base decision onsolid ground. the objective price stability low economic agents’ uncertainty regard future pricedevelopments. in addition, commit long-term objective, central bank reducesmarket uncertainty, source disruption financial economy. interest rate andmoney supply le volatile result, benefit long-term growth economy.however important, sound monetary policy enough. to safeguard smooth function ofthe markets, particular efficient price mechanism, essential protect, evenreinforce, diversity behaviour markets. this necessary diversity merely echo ofthe different time horizons, strategy reaction function market players. on point, i wouldlike explore possible avenue future action.strengthen continue effort aim market transparencyexperience show uncertainty incomplete information determine factor mimeticbehaviour. these shortfall market transparency make mimetic behaviour seem rational agents,who prefer follow big participants, think good informed, rather developtheir analysis. strengthen transparency therefore continue priority.one objective transparency enable good differentiation borrower creditworthiness. akey feature mimetic behaviour borrower "tarred brush". so oneemerging economy encounter difficulties, neighbour countries, country share commoncharacteristics, treat way – regardless actual economic financialsituation. the apply business operate economic sector. transparency hassubstantially increase since asian crisis, thank solid global consensus. let u continue andreinforce efforts.take account medium long-term perspective market participantssome investors, pension fund insurance companies, invest fund order toenable customer build wealth medium long term, notably preparation forretirement. consequently, type investor suppose behave differently tradersand short-term investors, work different time horizon. but time seem thatthey push behave much way, basis short-term horizon.to preserve, even restore, specific investment approach, investor might moreshielded excessive short-term pressures. this objective raise considerable difficulties, becauseit touch way performance medium long-term fund

perhaps happen value-at-risk base techniques,which massively adopt financial industry. because use le similarparameters suffer weakness – example, take inadequate account ofmarket liquidity time 1998 crisis –, tool tend give converge signal thatuse them. they thus encourage mimetic behaviour i discuss previously.the fact market participant sophisticate average guarantee thatstandardisation remain limited, since develop technique little use others. inthis respect, i must stress basle committee, illustrate new capital accord, isencouraging bank use sophisticate accurate risk measurement

let stress important role play central bank preserve monetary andfinancial stability increasingly globalise world.the recent year show benefit monetary stability term growth globalisedworld. it course

open market committee.you ask set stage discussion brief review extraordinaryperformance u.s. economy second half 1990s. from 1995 1999, real grossdomestic product grew, average, 4 percent per year. this pace significantly thatin previous five years, would go back 1960s find even closelycomparable period consistently robust economic expansion. in environment, theunemployment rate fell 4 percent, underlie rate price inflation slowed, net, despitevery high rate resource utilization. even optimistic forecaster could anticipatedsuch favorable confluence economic events.productivity growth cost reductionsso confluence positive event come about? the dominant force late appear havebeen significant increase structural rate productivity growth. output per hour nonfarmbusiness sector – conventional measure productivity – increase annual rate almost 3percent 1995 1999, roughly twice average pace prevail thepreceding two decades. the important explanation increase rate productivitygrowth, i suspect, longer-term structural change arise boom capital spend therevolution information technology. let turn evidence point.technological change productivity growthbob solow – mit economist nobel prize economics work theory ofeconomic growth – quip see computer everywhere except productivitystatistics. a year ago situation begin change, strong evidence thefaster productivity growth economy experience is, fact, due partly informationtechnology revolution.research federal reserve board economist steve oliner dan sichel shed light thesources fast productivity growth. the high (and rising) level business investment raisedthe amount capital per worker thereby boost productivity. about ½ percentage point theincrease productivity growth 1995-99 period attribute so-called "capitaldeepening," reflect great spend business computers, software, andcommunications equipment. the balance pickup reflect factors, include technologicalinnovations actual production computer hardware semiconductor well bettermanagement – perhaps assist high-tech investment – nation's capital laborresources. oliner sichel estimate consolidate influence information technologyinvestments account two-thirds acceleration productivity since 1995. this researchsupports view fundamental change way economy.what's special capital?that trend productivity pick high-tech investment source theacceleration important facts, new observations. perhaps stage itwould useful explore great detail positive "shock" ability economy 2bis review 54/2001produce good services. what special computer information technologiesthat strong influence economy?let highlight three special characteristic high-tech equipment. first, computer andcommunications equipment depreciate rapid pace. the current best estimate thatcomputers probably depreciate 30 percent annually, although estimate might low, whileother equipment probably depreciate rate le 15 percent annually. therefore, computersare retired, average, three years, useful life equipment seven years.firms must invest computer fast rate form capital maintain agiven level capital stock. the rapid replacement high-tech capital mean technologicalprogress become "embodied" capital stock fast rate case longer-livedassets.the second feature high-tech equipment set apart class capital thesensitivity demand fluctuation cost capital. for decades, economist debate themagnitude cost-of-capital effect traditional capital goods. a past consensus thecost-of-capital effect small difficult identify empirically. but somewhat different conclusionhas arise lately basic model investment apply spend computersalone. the late research suggest demand computer quite sensitive movement inthe cost capital. the combination apparently high price elasticity rapid decline relativecomputer price – 20 percent per year past decade – likely lead boom high-techinvestment.a third characteristic high-tech investment magnitude external spillover effect thatit generates. some high-tech equipment generate benefit owner machine butto agent economy well. i think particular so-called network effects-theobservation four computer network together twice valuable two.supporting structural changesthe technological change inspire investment computer enhance ability ofbusinesses reduce operate expenses. in many industries, investment informationtechnologies help firm cut back volume inventory hold precautionagainst glitch supply chain hedge unexpected increase aggregatedemand. product development cost probably also reduce use bettercomputer hardware software, new communication technology increase speedwith firm share information – internally customer suppliers.moreover, give intense competition result lack price leverage, ongoing program toreduce cost become key part corporate strategy maintain improve profit margins.the focus cost reduction work head development inflationary pressure thisexpansion.productivity current macroeconomic settingas aware, unite state experience period subpar growth. for last threequarters, annualized growth rate 1¾ percent, well trend rate growththat many think economy sustain. during period, productivity grow annual rate ofabout 2½ percent second half 2000 decline annual rate 1¼ percent duringthe first quarter year. this slow productivity growth lead number observer askwhether acceleration productivity latter part 1990s cyclical phenomenon,which bind come end economy slowed, structural one. cyclical forces,such inability business add payroll rapidly would like inresponse rise demand, probably play role productivity gains. in addition,some enthusiast make overly optimistic statement benefit new technologies.however, i believe answer question growth productivity wasstructural, trend, cyclical. we also mindful even period between1995 2000, productivity increase quarterly basis fluctuated; trend increase soclear progress unabated.two fundamental factor lead cautiously optimistic much improvement inproductivity likely sustained. notable advance microprocessors, semiconductors, bi review 54/20013been key enhance productivity growth experienced. semiconductor industryexperts indicate improvement performance describe "moore's law," predict thatthe capacity chip double every 18 24 months, continue hold true. my understand fromconversations with, announcement by, leader semiconductor industry late thisyear early next year chip manufacturer plan begin use large wafers, allow reducecosts 30 percent. they also plan adopt thin circuit lines, allow manufacturer toetch transistor single chip.a second reason expect much improvement productivity growth trend notcyclical business indicate word deed commitment improvingproductivity maintain cost substitute capital, mainly it capability, labor. overall growthof economy slow pace 1 percent 2 percent annual rate mostrecent three quarters. however, investment equipment software hold relatively highlevels still sufficient maintain relatively rapid growth capital services. moreover, end-usedemand communication service seem remain strong. since early 1990s, volume ofdata send network unite state double year, reason thattrend abate.the role government policyyou note i mention role government policy create high rate oftrend productivity growth. a policymaker, i'd like think well-executed monetary fiscalpolicies – focus importantly respective long-run goal – play role creatingeconomic condition foster noninflationary economic growth. it important note, however,that although sound policy undoubtedly help create condition growth, macroeconomic policycannot create growth itself. only business consumer that.the economy unite state also benefit past action government toderegulate industries. the intense focus removal unnecessary government regulationstarted twenty year ago, administration president ford, gatheredmomentum carter years. deregulation alter business landscape byallowing – indeed force – business focus clearly competitive marketplace withfewer constraint increase flexibility. again, macroeconomic policy, policy ofderegulating industry cannot create great potential growth, create condition underwhich growth might occur.a third way government private sector together assist process oftechnology adoption foster highly flexible system education train focus onboth theoretical practical skills. in part rapid change technology, today'sstudents worker long expect keep job life, keenly aware that,throughout careers, new skill require advancement. employers, too, recognize thevalue add develop human capital complement fix capital. thus, unite stateshas experience demand educational service cater participant various stage life.the demand skill development upgrade meet number way – throughon-the-job training, so-called corporate universities, range public private institutionsof high learning. survey conduct u.s. department education show participation inadult education program expand past decade, 46 percent adult reportedlyhaving engage adult education program 1998-99. in part much trainingis work-related, rate participation positively relate formal educational attainment. thetrend toward lifetime learn also show enrollment statistic high education.today, 20 percent student u.s. institution high education age 35 orolder, le 15 percent 1985. in part, increase fuel rise numberof part-time student enrollee two-year colleges. the latter group schools, particular,has low cost education work student night weekend course thedevelopment contract employer provide skill training. another way meet need forskill train come year involve distance learning. in 1995, one-third u.s. institution ofhigher education report use distance education – two-way one-way videos, on-lineconnections, like. another one-fourth plan offer course subsequent three years,with eye target worker seek re-certification skill updating. 4bis review 54/2001in addition, u.s. government influence increase productivity growth support earlydevelopment late become know internet. in mid- late 1960s department ofdefense's advance research project agency (arpa) create small network, arpanet, whichwas intend promote share computer among researcher unite states. in 1969,arpanet connect first four university participants, researcher campusescreated first host arpanet. over time, process link computer evolve theinternet. importantly, much work create standard drive early creation theinternet lead private sector, commercial academic.finally, federal government report active user internet sell products,including financial products. a recent study indicate government unite state made$3.6 billion transaction web 2000, significantly large revenue ofany web-based retailer.the macroeconomic implication fast productivity growththeory teach u step-up growth rate productivity important pervasiveimplications performance economy. the main reason policymakers economist areinterested growth rate productivity crucial determinant rate change inthe general standard living. if productivity increase 1 ½ percent per year average, standardof live double every 46 year – every two generations. on hand, trendproductivity growth step 3 percent per year, standard live double roughly every 23years – every generation. that certainly difference worth study understanding,and stage understand woefully incomplete.a second important reason interest growth rate productivity nearterm affect supply demand good services. on supply side, effect isfairly clear immediate: an increase trend productivity growth imply rapid pace ofgrowth economy's productive capacity. in short, economy produce more, overall,without run production bottlenecks. of course, effect tend cumulate time,with progressively large increase supply come time go by. separately, business mayrespond increase trend productivity growth step pace investment inplant equipment, boost growth supply potential economy.how increase trend productivity growth play demand side economy? oneimmediate effect step-up capital expenditure i noted, business perceive andreact new profit opportunities. in addition, stock market investor react pickup inproductivity growth look ahead, recognize improve prospect future earnings, andbidding equity price today. the run-up equity price imply reduction cost capital forbusinesses, could support increase investment demand, especially part offirms rely market least part funding.the increase stock market wealth also operate household sector. a know,economists often speak "wealth effect." econometric model indicate consumerseventually tend raise level spend approximately 3 5 cent every incrementaldollar wealth. give change stock market wealth large one see recently,this wealth effect noticeable effect consumption macroeconomic performance. totake prominent example, wealth effect important reason personalsaving rate unite state fall roughly 8 percent 1990 -1 percent firstquarter year. and put rough number impact aggregate activity recently,simulations board staff use econometric model economy suggest wealthgenerated equity market past four year add 1 percentage point growthrate real gdp.overall, stock market, work spend decision household andbusinesses, act bring forward demand effect improve outlook supply, potentiallyeven push demand ahead increase supply.it important emphasize high productivity growth translate high real income growthfor employees. this add income see clearly high wage pay growingnumber worker whose cash compensation tie company performance, either directly orthrough stock options. but real income increase even worker whose compensation bi review 54/20015directly link company performance, profitable business opportunity bolster demand forscarce labor.conclusionobviously history productivity surprise unite state long complex one.indeed, premature write entire story. but, role federal reserve saga willcontinue unchanged. we give responsibility provide monetary condition thatwill promote maximum sustainable growth output. we continue perform duty. bi review 53/20011donald t brash: promote financial stability: new zealand approachaddress dr donald t brash, governor reserve bank new zealand, conference forcommonwealth

useful context within todiscuss new zealand approach financial sector regulation.causes financial instabilityas indicate commonwealth secretariat's paper corporate governance financial sector,financial instability cause combination factors. these include:(cid:1) rapid financial sector liberalisation unsupported measure encourage prudent riskmanagement financial sector;(cid:1)

systemsthe broad range factor contribute financial crisis suggest need equallybroad set policy responses. of course, particular policy vary country country,depending country's stage development, nature economy structure itsfinancial system. there single "right" policy prescription. each country must develop policy thatsuit particular circumstances. however, general level, safely say thefollowing type policy need order promote financial stability: 2bis review 53/2001(cid:1) sound, sustainable credible macroeconomic policies, include monetary policy aimedat promote price

system; and(cid:1) effective well-enforced bank supervision arrangements.it would tempt discus policy areas, give importance promotion ofsound efficient financial systems. but would need great deal long one day dojustice broad range complicate policy issues. instead, i want focus main themeof conference – corporate governance financial sector.corporate governance financial sectoras note commonwealth secretariat's report, improve corporate governance importantway promote financial stability. the effectiveness bank's internal governance arrangement hasa substantial effect ability bank identify, monitor control risks. althoughbanking crisis cause many factors, beyond control bankmanagement, almost every bank failure least partially result poor risk management withinthe bank itself. and poor risk management ultimately failure internal governance.although bank supervision regulation banks' risk position go way towardscountering effect poor governance, supervision external official agency asubstitute sound corporate governance practices. ultimately, bank system risk likelyto reduce acceptable level foster sound risk management practice within individualbanks. instill sound corporate governance practice within bank crucial element achievingthis.as commonwealth secretariat's report notes, number way corporategovernance financial sector strengthened. these include:(cid:1) well design enforce company law;(cid:1) code principle develop professional industry associations, set outdesired attribute corporate governance, associate educational andconsciousness-raising

sound governance risk management practices; and(cid:1) leadership example, include adoption sound governance, accountability andtransparency practice central bank regulatory agencies. bi review 53/20013new zealand's approach financial stabilityagainst background, let briefly summarise new zealand approach promote financialstability. this three main strands:(cid:1) promote self discipline bank management risks;(cid:1) foster effective market discipline bank system; and(cid:1) supervise bank purpose promote financial stability, seek avoidsupervisory practice might erode market discipline weaken incentive bankdirectors take ultimate responsibility management risks.let elaborate turn.banks' self discipline manage risksbanking supervision new zealand place considerable emphasis encourage banks' selfdiscipline manage risks, primarily reinforce role bank director take ultimateresponsibility stewardship banks. since mid 1990s, new public disclosureframework introduce banks, key mechanism encourage bank manage risksprudently need bank issue public disclosure statement quarter.the disclosure statement two forms: brief key information summary, aim theordinary depositor; comprehensive general disclosure statement, aimedprincipally professional analyst.the key information summary contain short summary information bank, including:(cid:1) bank's credit

financial statements;(cid:1) credit rat information;(cid:1) detail information capital adequacy, asset quality various risk exposures; and(cid:1) information bank's exposure market risk.one important feature disclosure framework role accord bank directors.each director require sign make certain attestation disclosure statements, including:(cid:1) whether bank comply prudential requirement impose thereserve bank;(cid:1) whether bank system place adequately monitor control bank risksand whether system properly applied;(cid:1) whether bank's exposure connect party contrary interest bank;and(cid:1) whether disclosure statement contain require disclosure false ormisleading.directors face potentially severe criminal penalty civil liability disclosure statement isheld false

herzegovina, 1/1student initiative, sarajevo university, sarajevo, may 2001.* * *introductioni please opportunity talk top student sarajevo university aboutmonetary policy bosnia herzegovina (bh). a hour half all, i wantto leave plenty time questions, i time comprehensive discussion allpossible monetary policy issue bh. so i decide talk follow four inter-relatedissues:(cid:1) currency board option;(cid:1) macro-economic sustainability bh;(cid:1) role bank sector bh ;(cid:1) institutional design economic institutions.the currency board optionas i sure know, cbbh operate monetary policy bh currency boardarrangement. the three essential feature currency board, specify thecbbh law, are:(cid:1) the bh currency, convertible mark (km) tie deutschmark (dem) fixedexchange rate 1km= 1dem. it also tie euro rate dem (1 km = 0.511 euro);(cid:1) the km liability cbbh fully back convertible foreign assets;(cid:1) the cbbh prepare convert km dem time amount (i.e. it afully convertible currency)it interest remember back sort payment bank sector operate bhbefore cbbh establish 1997:(cid:1) four currency use bh one use wholecountry dem;(cid:1) three payment bureau monopoly domestic non-cash paymentsbut could settle electronically other;(cid:1) around 70 organisation call bank smalland none operate whole country.linking km dem currency board easy choice bh dmwas already extensively use country currency people trusted.it successful choice too:(cid:1) km stable currency dem euro since introduced;(cid:1) inflation bh relatively low stable;(cid:1) km use rise rapidly within bh dominant transaction currency allparts country. our km liability rise km 132 million start inaugust 1997 km 1,023 million end february 2001;(cid:1) even trade number country europe; 2bis review 51/2001(cid:1) km remain fully convertible. since km currency introduce haveissued around km 3.44 billion convert back dem around km 2.66 billion.i think type monetary policy, except adoption dem thecurrency bh, could give country like bh stable trust currency quickly.why currency board work bih?i think four main reasons:(cid:1) first, people face many financial traumas. they therefore value stable currency. thecurrency board consequently high level public political support within bh;(cid:1) second, people complete trust anchor currency, dm strict currency boardhas allow cbbh, new institution track record, gain credibilityof dem bundesbank;(cid:1) third, people say cbbh foreign governor. i think asmall part reason.(cid:1) view, major reason work good legal institutional frameworkthe cbbh has.– goal cbbh simple, clear specify law;– law limit activity would potential conflict currencyboard requirements;– within statutory goal limitations, cbbh independent politicaldirection;– sensible sound internal decision-making processes;– easily firmly hold accountable. a breach currency board requirementswould quickly obvious all. within current economic jargon, verytransparent form policy implementation.some economist others argue currency board disadvantage thelimitations place economic role cbbh example:(cid:1) cbbh play role provide liquidity bank sector (i.e., act aslender last resort);(cid:1) cbbh finance government;(cid:1) cbbh play direct role finance economic development;(cid:1) exchange rate use tool adjust economic shock poor economicperformance.these area policy discretion, use wisely moderation, could advantage economicdevelopment bh. there lot project bh ‘little bit’ cbbh finance may behelpful. but problem would keep cbbh credit ‘little bit.’ the experience theregion excess central bank credit usually create result inflation. that doesnot help business, employment confidence bh. so view, strict currency board thebest approach bh.will currency board continue bih?i believe follow reasons:(cid:1) widespread support provide one element stabilitythe people bh time;(cid:1) would risky change it. confidence km would drop people wait see howany alternative monetary policy would work; bi review51/20013(cid:1) currency board work well eastern european country latvia andbulgaria. currency board become acceptable, even fashionable;(cid:1) long-term goal bh policy take economy close europe. the km alreadytied euro. it would therefore seem sensible maintain link.macro-economic sustainability bihwhile i believe strongly bh maintain currency board, need changesmade area bh macro-economic sustainability medium term. thecurrency board requirement mean cbbh issue km currency quantity itchooses economy needs. the amount issue tie net position bosniaand herzegovina’s external accounts. this currency board arithmetic.what currency board arithmetic mean central bank country? if net positionon country’s external account positive, central bank’s foreign reserve increase theforeign inflow change domestic currency. there nothing stop currency boardhaving 100% back domestic currency liabilities.(indeed, present cbbh foreign reserve equal 106% km liabilities.) so theoverall foreign account good shape, pressure currency board andmedium term economic sustainability easy.but, country’s overall foreign account negative, situation different. if people wishto buy foreign exchange km currency, cbbh without limit. that fullconvertibility means. the level cbbh’s foreign reserve fall volume thedomestic money supply. the currency board rule still met, balance sheet cbbhwill decline could continue decline foreign reserves. at stage, bhcould meet foreign expenditure earn gain foreign exchange.the current position balance payment bh cause concern. the trade deficit isvery high. the amount foreign private capital come country still low. the flow thathave make situation work large amount official capital repatriation bosniansliving abroad.looking ahead:(cid:1) know level official capital flow slow, uncertainty exactly whenthis occur:(cid:1) difficult rapidly increase export receipts, though could do sofar occurred;(cid:1) country heavily dependent imports. a slowdown reconstruction slowimports extent. but rapid slowdown import would also hurt consumption andliving standards;(cid:1) difficult predict rely repatriations;(cid:1) item potential change rapidly foreign private investment. but forbh attract foreign private investment environment private investment willhave change substantially.if bh attract large quantity private foreign investment, pressure come level offoreign reserve official capital flow slow down. this turn decrease domestic moneysupply put upward pressure interest rates. monetary policy implement acurrency board arrangement pro-cyclical economy foreign exchange problem i.e. itwill increase contractionary pressure economy.the situation face bh economy critical urgent. most policy-makers someunderstanding foreign exchange problems. but still seem think policy choicesand sense urgency lacking. in view choice make bh attractive place forprivate investment everything necessary attract foreign private capital. if nothappen, bh economy major foreign exchange problem currency board beunable protect country shocks. indeed, could become one victim thoseshocks politician look scapegoat explain country’s economic problem people. 4bis review 51/2001foreign investment increasing. in 1999 example, direct foreign investment 50% high thanin 1998 though yet figure 2000, i sure rise strongly again. butwhile growth rate sound spectacular, low base. direct foreign investment bhin 1999 estimate km 170 million. the current account deficit year

responsibility central bank oflarge economic area current slowdown world economy?speech dr willem f duisenberg, president european central bank, internationalmonetary conference, singapore, 4 june 2001.* * *the topic introduction i invite provide central bankers' panel bothchallenging welcome. the challenge answer question hover around inrecent months: euro area assume role "global growth engine" currentslowdown world economy? the opportunity address issue directly welcome, itallows elaborate role european central bank (ecb) must play field. in doingso, however, i shall start first briefly recall objective monetary policy ecb, whichprovides essential background analysis responsibility challenge ecbfaces respect current slowdown world economy.the primary objective ecb, treaty european union define it, maintain pricestability euro area. the govern council ecb define price stability "year-on-year increase hicp euro area 2%". furthermore, make clear theoutset price stability maintain medium term. by unambiguously assigningthe primary objective price stability independent central bank, treaty recognise thatfocusing monetary policy maintenance price stability euro area ensure monetarypolicy make best possible contribution improve economic prospects.this view root fact, support decade practical experience empirical evidence,that benefit price stability growth substantial. without put forward arguments,allow highlight, particular, maintenance price stability help allocate resourcesefficiently across us across time. inflation cause economic agent confuse transitorywith permanent price changes, therefore distort decision-making process. in evaluatinginvestment opportunities, firm need confidence signal convey relative pricechanges, discriminate relative price adjustment general change overallprice level. this process facilitate situation overall price stability. price stability thereforeimproves transparency relative price mechanism promote adequate environmentto increase growth potential euro area economy. moreover, experience shown,stable price minimise inflation risk premium, thereby low long-term interest rate helpingto stimulate investment growth.in order maintain price stability, ecb design monetary policy strategy wherein risk toprice stability assess basis two pillars. the first pillar assign prominent role tomonetary developments. the second pillar broadly base assessment wide range othereconomic financial indicators. this all-encompassing systematic approach guarantee thatthe govern council ecb take consideration relevant piece information whenassessing outlook price stability medium term.all show clearly ecb need focus euro area conduct monetarypolicy. focus domestic objective is, fact, mandate major central bank world,and rightly so. i strongly believe best contribution euro area make worldeconomic growth ensure macroeconomic stability "at home" pursue policy lead tosustainable non-inflationary growth euro area. give size economy euro area, astability-oriented policy help create favourable environment conductive non-inflationarygrowth global level. the mandate ecb fully consistent principle. this theonly reasonable allocation responsibility among large economy world. anything elserisks blur responsibility dilute accountability, would turn distort incentive aperverse way.this notwithstanding, euro area not, course, economically speaking, island globaldevelopments affect euro area economy. hence, let also stress one therequirements globalise world frequent exchange information view among policy-makers. the ecb currently participate meet international organisations, theinternational monetary fund (imf), organisation economic co-operation development(oecd) bank international settlement (bis), different fora, g7. such 2bis review 50/2001exchanges important, among things, good understand economic development tofully analyse spillover effect economy arise different policies.the ecb position fine tune economic activity euro area, theinstruments so. any attempt would prove counterproductive, lead inefficientmedium-term outcome characterise high inflation low growth. two main factor supportthis view. first, economic development surround great deal uncertainty. thisuncertainty affect analysis current state economy future course. andsecond, monetary policy operate relatively long lags, little effect economy inthe short run. past experience show attempt fine-tune economy might place injeopardy commitment maintain price stability medium term, essential well-functioning economy. once inflation exist inflation expectation prevail economy, theeconomic cost subsequent necessary stabilisation far exceed whichever temporary benefitsmight previously obtained.therefore, ecb need remain focus maintenance price stability medium term.the ecb pursue objective consistent forward-looking manner, ensure confidenceof policy-makers, within outside euro area.experience far suggest ecb able keep inflationary expectation lowlevel. although current hicp figure euro area adversely affect energy foodprices, current outlook compatible maintenance price stability medium term.this view support analysis bond yields. it comfort see market participantsexpect medium-term price development remain line ecb's definition price stability.currently available forecast give rise expectation inflation fall 2% 2002.hence, appear right track. however, must ignore exist risk price stability.the govern council ecb therefore always stress vigilant take intoaccount new information might affect outlook price stability medium term.let conclude recall that, ecb cannot hold accountable growth theeuro area, interest rate euro area relatively low, cannot, means, beconsidered obstacle growth. currently, although uncertainty remain high, generalexpectation growth euro area remain at, slightly above, trend potential growth inthe period ahead.having say that, ecb would welcome increase already substantial contribution theeuro area global economic growth. however, achieve last way, increasingthe growth potential euro area. the growth potential economy, however, determine bytechnological structural factors. raise growth potential important challenge euroarea faces, achievement would spread benefit throughout world.while reform already take place, additional effort needed. ongoing comprehensivestructural reform labour product market remain essential order improve thefunctioning market euro area. responsibility reform lie governments,and key national economic agent side labour industry. it crucial increaseinvestment incentive structural policy measure deregulation privatisation.fiscal policy continue along path diminish adverse incentive provide tax, benefitand pension systems, reform expenditure side budget also need forprogress along way towards medium-term objective attain budgetary position "close tobalance surplus".to sum up, although monetary policy cannot lift euro area's growth potential, benefit pricestability growth evident, stable price provide proper environment structural reformsto work. while ecb maintain commitment maintenance price stability, otherpolicy-makers assume responsibility increase growth potential euro area. this,in turn, best allocation responsibility contribute sustainable non-inflationary growth inthe euro area and, thereby, also global level. bi review 50/20011lee hsien loong: financial centre today tomorrow: singaporeperspectiveaddress mr lee hsien loong, deputy prime minister singapore

debate horizontal versus vertical integration, thedistinctions – nevertheless important – trading, clear settlement. and thereare other, le technical, influence too, include perception national

(as know, last week government bank agree torenew inflation-control target 1 3 per cent target range 2 per cent target midpoint.)the great transparency inflation target also anchor bank’s approach tocommunicating monetary policy try achieve, mean achieve ourassessment state economy.while target continue define inflation objective, condition economy constantlychanging. both international domestic development affect economic outlook canada.the bank continually ass change implication future inflation. ifrequired, take appropriate policy action consistent achieve inflation-controltarget medium term. the role communication is, therefore, explain whycircumstances change relate bank’s action inflation target thewell-being economy.i’d like suggest least three important relate way goodcommunications help monetary policy effective. 2bis review 46/2001first, good communication help put bank financial market wavelength. that isvery important because, generally speaking, monetary policy effective financial marketsunderstand bank ass economic development relation policy objectives. whenwe wavelength, market anticipate, rather simply react to, interest rateactions bank.if bank good job keep market expectation broadly line direction policy,there tend le volatility financial market smoother, rapid incorporation anyshifts policy interest rate exchange rates. in words, effective communicationsimproves monetary policy transmission process lead response exchange rate andin term structure interest rate consistent bank’s intentions. this greaterstability predictability everyone’s interest.a second reason communication become important effect publicexpectations behaviour bank’s ability meet policy objectives. improve publicunderstanding acceptance bank try increase chance success inachieving inflation target little economic disruption possible. it largely matter thecredibility bank’s commitment targets.let specific. if consumers, investors, workers, businesses, government believe thataction take ensure inflation remain close target, likely tomake economic financial decision accordingly. price decision producer supplier willreflect inflation expectation consistent target. wage bargain employee andemployers tend line inflation target. the net effect stablemacro-economic environment great success keep inflation low.keeping touch expectation also entail good two-way communication. the bank consultscanadians business, finance, government across country regular basis. by sowe keep inform economic development perspective ground, contribute toour understand happen “real” economy.a third reason communication important accountability. a public institution highdegree autonomy conduct monetary policy, bank canada bear obligation toaccount canadian well job. an explicitly define agree upon inflationtarget provide clear basis accountability. this clear basis judge bank’s performance isextremely important credibility. but bank fully accountable, must provide publicwith information need aware of, understand, bank’s policy objectives, factorswe take account make decisions, progress meet objectives. that jobof communications.challenges communicate monetary policyrecognizing understand importance good communication mean job iseasy. in fact, open transparent create wide range communicationschallenges.one challenge stem medium-term time frame monetary policy operates.when bank raise low interest rates, take 12 month change itspeak impact aggregate demand 18 24 month fully affect inflation. in words,when bank acts, basis assess developments, gauge impact theeconomy inflation 1 2 year road, take action achieve inflation targetover horizon.if public go make inform economic financial decisions, need understandand take account time frame monetary policy effects. yet continue tobe tendency view bank action short-term response immediate event rather inthe context medium-term trend objectives.adding communication challenge fact assess economic trend future notan exact science rather highly interpretive exercise. unforeseen development “shocks” arealways occurring, always element uncertainty order magnitude andpersistence developments. thus, say communicate future bephrased conditional terms. and picture look forward cloud uncertainties, bi review 46/20013impossible central bank provide financial market public high degree ofprecision certainty.a second key communication challenge could formulate question something like this: inbecoming transparent, bank best ensure value communicate?at risk sound touch glib, i would argue that, come monetary policycommunications, “more” isn’t necessarily “better.” it “quality” great importance intransparency “quantity.”as i already noted, monetary policy need view medium-term perspective.therefore, bank provide substantive value communicate see key trend inthe economy inflation conduct monetary policy relate trends.usually accumulation information give understand trends. for reason,the bank cannot, not, comment every piece new economic data information thatbecomes public. but transmit view large trend economy, bank canpromote good anticipation direction policy.our concern quality also influence approach flow information prior to,and time of, policy announcements. the bank consciously refrain make publiccomments issue relate monetary policy week announcement officialinterest rates. this sensitive period, particularly financial markets, comment could easilybe misinterpreted.the point i would stress quality information relate bank arrive atmonetary policy decisions. the decision-making bank’s govern council process ofconsensus building. member govern council full-time employee bank meeton daily basis. in two week prior policy announcement, series meet atwhich information several source present bank staff discussed. out processa consensus develop within govern council appropriate policy decision. therefore,what great value communication perspective clear statement substantivereasons policy decision. that statement press release announce decision.four time year, announcement supplement two week late publication ofour semi-annual monetary policy report (in may november) update full report (infebruary august). these publications, finalize policy announcement date,elaborate great detail govern council’s assessment factor shape interestrate decision.another challenge revolve around fact bank`s communication differentaudiences may different degree interest bank say does.the general public, example, generally interest inflation, value dollar, whetheror interest rate go – development impact dailydecision-making.financial markets, hand, intensely interest direction intricaciesof monetary policy tend highly sensitive bank action comment bear theseissues. they scrutinize bank publication speech senior bank official shade ofmeaning monetary policy might heading. this make communicate monetary policya difficult task, subtlety complexity relate direction monetarypolicy simply can’t reduce words.the challenge tailor message communicate clearly possible bank’sassessment economy direction policy, bear mind specific concernsand information need different audiences.this challenge difficult come media, audience instrumental inwhether communicate successfully.there two way it. the bank rely heavily medium get message thepublic, whether via tv radio, newspaper magazines, various wire service thatfeed financial institution trade room well news outlet across country.we also recognize medium act filter say often determine ourstatements reported. it part media’s job interpret decision perspective 4bis review 46/2001to comment see bank execute mandate. it also job reflect view ofthird party say do. that healthy democracy, healthy accountability, andcan healthy raise public awareness monetary policy issues.in rather complex communication environment, squarely bank’s interest themedia cover monetary policy fully accurately possible. and chance full accuratereporting enormously good medium well inform monetary policy factorsaffecting bank do. bear mind comment moment ago thefrequently complex conditional nature monetary policy, i don’t underestimate challenge –either u media.for bank’s part, take number step recent year strengthen relation withthe medium furnish information necessary high-quality report andcommentary. we provide information past occasion weexplain information directly medium respond questions.thus, example, institute regular medium brief prior release key bank reports.we instal special “lock-up” facility bank enable medium read release writetheir story advance official publication. we increase number pressconferences medium session give governor deputy governors.the medium tell u change helpful. but i would suggest still someprogress make ensure canadian receive accurate insightful coverage ofmonetary policy every right expect. for example, medium might ass whetherinvesting time intellectual capital could strengthen deepen report commentaryon monetary policy issues. and may well additional thing bank could promotebetter understand monetary policy. indeed, look great use theelectronic medium reach public, new governor already do fair number ofinterviews radio television. our goal continue move great openness bankcommunications time careful stay clear short-run, market-sensitiveissues.we continue consult journalist reporter improvement wemight consider.the bank’s communication strategy – evolve processto point, i’ve underline communication important effective monetary policy someof challenge face communicate complex subject variety interest audiences.now i’d like say word we’ve bank canada tocommunicate monetary policy open transparent way.as i’ve already indicated, override objective focus attention, debate, understand onthe canadian economic financial situation mean keep inflation low stable.to this, bank take number initiatives. in 1995, introduce semi-annualmonetary policy report, many way become centrepiece communicationsstrategy. it bank’s full interpretation recent development economy well ouroutlook medium term, horizon monetary policy effects.between report, publish update bank’s views. intersperse thesereleases speech press conference governor, speech deputy governors,press releases, regional outreach activities, greatly broaden audiencecoverage.as part communication strategy, try schedule publication andcommunications event throughout year achieve regular, continuous, integrate programof public communications. this permit u communicate continuous basis evolvingviews economy trend inflation.on operational side, 1994, introduce operate band overnight rate interest togive great clarity financial market bank’s desire rate setting. in 1996, set bankrate – rate lend financial institution – upper limit operate band. andin 1999, set target overnight rate midpoint band. currently, movingto place focus target overnight rate announcement since bi review 46/20015appropriate policy rate international comparisons. for example, target overnight ratecorresponds u.s. federal reserve’s target federal fund rate.we also put lot emphasis develop maintain web site. it give public atlarge direct access publication speech also easily understandableinformation bank monetary policy. (by way, i encourage take look ourweb site www.bankofcanada.ca. it recently rank second among 24 central bank sitesreviewed london-based organization, lombard street research ltd.)fixed announcement datesour recent innovation strategy, launch 5 december last year, new system forannouncing decision official interest rates. any change target overnight rate ofinterest announce eight pre-specified “fixed” date year. on date, apress release issued, indicate bank’s decision either change rate leave themunchanged give short explanation reason decision. this approach replace theformer practice make announcement change interest rate withoutany warn public financial markets.the new, fixed-date approach extremely important step bank implement monetarypolicy actions. from communication perspective, provide number important benefits. first, itgives public, media, financial market certainty know exactly bank willmake announcement interest rates. this allow plan efficiently make moreorderly assessment announcement approaches.a second communication benefit fix date increase emphasis bring economicsituation canada primary focus canadian monetary policy. we believe would lead toincreased commentary canadian economic circumstance implication monetarypolicy period lead fix announcement date. that, turn, would contribute tobuilding public awareness economic development canada role monetary policy.a third benefit fix date provide bank regular opportunity put recenteconomic financial development medium-term perspective. a i say earlier, isimportant effect monetary policy action usually spread 1 2 years. thepress release fix date, together bank’s communication vehicle themonetary policy report updates, enable bank position recent development term ofthe underlie trend time horizon. if communicate successfully, shouldultimately public focus trend time important monetary policy lessreaction near-term developments.finally, eight new fix date increase number opportunity bank communicate itsviews economy. whether change policy rate, analysis pressrelease stimulate frequent continuous dialogue key audience shouldgenerate regular commentary among analyst media.we experience four fix announcement date belts. while still early todraw conclusions, generally please way fix date work thepositive reaction generated. we already see focus public commentary thecanadian economic situation, extremely encouraging. with benefit furtherexperience new approach feedback financial market public, ableto ass improvement might made. but convince ever thisnew approach increase effectiveness monetary policy.conclusionto conclude, i want emphasize bank continue look way build progresswe make increase openness transparency monetary policy. communication willplay increasingly vital strategic role help achieve progress. it role weat bank extremely serious about. for final analysis, monetary policy effectivewhen effectively communicated. thank you. bi review 80/20011willem f

capital market global perspective.finally, i shall address issue oversight financial market recent institutional andregulatory developments.need reform pension system europeover last fifty year witness unprecedented era growth, technological progress,prosperity welfare improvement across generations. notable demographic change takingplace europe also across western world raise many important issues. inparticular, improve economic welfare associate long life expectancy. combinedwith low birth rates, lead age populations, far-reachingimplications. it raise issue concern possible resource constraint may face futureand question sustainability prevail live standard environment currentprojections point future population decline europe. relate issue concern thesustainability current pension systems.as member pension fund industry undoubtedly aware, current trend ratio elderlypeople working-age population set increase significantly. in euro area, ratio over65 year old 20 64 forecast rise prevail level 27% around53% 2050, maximum 67% italy. this expect result combination effects.most importantly, life expectancy increase considerably last half century trendlooks set continue. at time, number birth decline substantially throughout thedeveloped world even return high birth rate future would likely come late tosolve problem face many pension system come decades.pension system europe rely heavily state-run pay-as-you-go arrangements. fund pensionarrangements, publicly privately managed, generally le developed. pay-as-you-gosystems particularly vulnerable demographic change: decline ratio labour forcerelative number pensioners, tax base shrink number recipient increases,leaving policy-makers adjust system reduction benefit increase

anticipate unsustainability delay pension systemreform require high risk premia new debt. in respect, helpful government theeuro area commit refrain excessive public deficit maastrichttreaty stability

change contribution benefits, adjustment indexation ofexisting pension benefit formula new pensioners. two approach particularlynoteworthy, swedish pension reform impressive respect the first 2bis

labour markets. indeed, labourmarket reform also need counter detrimental effect age population. oneshould, instance, consider measure aim stimulate supply labour. moreover, limitingbenefits run risk increase poverty among elderly.an alternative complementary route secure future pension consist systemic reforms,namely move toward fund systems. this would partially replace labour taxation anaccumulated capital stock source finance pensions. several countries, asdenmark netherlands, use private save future pensions. germany move thesame direction recent pension reform. in finland, part social security contribution ischannelled publicly administer fund. france decide create fund equivalent 10% ofgdp 2020. ireland's public national reserve fund asset 7.5% gdp, irishgovernment commit

european country pursue balance budgets,but also surplus. this would allow either reduce public debt, would lead lowerinterest payment scope increase expenditure relate population ageing, toestablish

however, apart seekexplanations low inflationary pressure increase competition internationalise andderegulated market support development information technology. we appear able livewith low growth

indication inflation begin rise. theprice increase could extent attribute non-recurring factor - high food pricescaused bse (“mad cow disease”) crop failure -but price increase difficultto explain. when exchange rate also weaken substantially june, justify uneasethat could impact form rise inflation expectations.given developments, majority executive board riksbank decide 5 july toraise repo

quite reverse, economy theeuro area japan weakening. the asian economy strongly it-dependent intheir export also unable act pacemaker.when executive board make decision regard repo rate time,

prolong themajority board believed. the signal regard development u economy mixedand assessment hang balance rapid recovery long-drawn outsequence events. in opinion, every reason wait clear indication beforechanging interest rate. others concern weak exchange rate would animpact inflation.the role krona inflation target policyas krona long come focus, i would like briefly remind role exchangerate play monetary policy. we inflation target, development krona aneffect inflation, partly import prices, partly influence demand swedish goodsand services. for instance, krona low value,

thismeans riksbank must make assessment krona develop relation othercurrencies forecast period, ass effect development krona haveon demand swedish goods, well impact krona consumer prices. none

protect israeli industry foreign competitionby tariff non-tariff barriers, use past.* * *nevertheless, still bridge completely crossed. we already understand thatto get integrate world economy follow rules. paramount among aremaastricht-like criterion relate fiscal discipline, public debt price stability. however, since weare member eu, even one accession country wait join in, isno external

public debt ratio gdp. the publicdebt ratio israel still high, 90%, although lot high embark thisroad. this mean cannot pause, certainly change direction, attempt maintaina low deficit. raise deficit option, especially public spend level isalready one highest, highest, world. our estimate current year,2001, ratio public spend gdp amount 54%, compare average 42% 20 ofthe oecd countries, individual

government spend deficit.* * *a good reason resist temptation give fiscal discipline implication financialmarkets:- the first, immediate, effect increase deficit increase interest rate ongovernment instrument finance deficit. this already start take place thelast months. the outcome hold increase public debt, also thatpart debt need recycle every year. interest payment take already 15%of government current resources, large education budget verymuch large government investments.- the increase interest government instrument reverberate private ones. this thesecond effect. we know yield government bond serf benchmark forpricing long-term loans, like mortgages. the increase deficit level current year castsalready doubt future trend cost mortgages. another example hasto government initiative commission private entrepreneur invest ininfrastructure (the so-called p.f.i.). these need capital resources, long-term loans,and price base yield government securities. hence, increasedbudget deficit increase cost capital also privately finance long-terminvestments.- the third effect inflation and/or balance payments. it take time tomaterialize, certain outcome. we go period middle thelast decade where, follow expansionary fiscal policy first half decade,supported expansionary monetary policy, get large non-sustainable deficit inthe balance payment increase inflation. to avert crisis, back theeconomy slow down. this important government add itsdecision, increase deficit 2002, commitment low three consecutiveyears. the question whether market believe.- if

determine potential growth rate. wemust take account potential growth rate, even influence mean ofmonetary policy price stability established. correspondingly, must take accountchanges condition competition, change influence inflationary trend directlyand indirectly. any measure take strengthen potential growth come economic policythan monetary policy. such measure include avoid limit competition would lead apoorer allocation resources.the swedish economy show favourable growth last winter. today, growthhas slow down, may worthwhile remember start point growth wassubdued. we put even perspective compare situation beginningof 1990s. condition difficult characterise rise unemployment, highinflation rate poor public finances. the situation strain government turn theacademic world advice report economics commission deliver spring1993.1this report, usually refer lindbeck commission, contain le than113 proposal – many controversial, stimulate debate day. thelindbeck commission take view crisis base problem three fundamental areas;stability, efficiency growth. the proposal also group measure create stability,measures increase efficiency resource utilisation measure increase growth theeconomy.price budget stability attainedif one read report today, one strike many proposal actually beenimplemented. when come measure attain macroeconomic stability,

amount 3.1 per cent. this verydifferent average growth rate 1.8 per cent prevail previous ten years. ifdevelopments since 1993 limit 1.8 per cent, would currently gdp levelaround sek 174 billion low now, i.e. eight per cent lower, situation wouldhave look radically different areas. open unemployment would twice high one 1 "new term economics politics", proposal economics commission, sou 1993:16. 2bis review 78/2001utilises "okun relation" - approximately 8 per cent rather roughly 4 per cent. it doubtful,however whether okun relation relevant long period time. the great part thedifference would probably result low real wages, i.e. disposable income would havebeen substantially lower. it possible make many calculation nature, illustratehow difference growth rate provide strong effect number years.there therefore good reason discus factor contribute favourabledevelopment. it probably possible agree definitive answer, i believe likelythat structural reform implement even 1993 (in particular tax reform 1990/91) andthe proposal economics commission implement contributed.a efficient economyone interest condition total factor productivity really take 1993 thereafterdeveloped strongly previous decades. total factor productivity concernsthe quality available resource efficiently utilise them, respect developmentsshow mark improvement. from mid-1980s 1993, general term increaseat factor productivity, mean limit increase productivity arise due toinvestment, i.e. increase capital intensity. from 1993 onwards, relationship beenreversed. we impressive annual increase factor productivity per cent2, capitalintensity increase modest 0.1%.the fact change begin year economics commission present itsproposals probably mainly coincidence, fact macroeconomic stabilisation rapidand endure effect development productivity prove economist easterly,amongst others. that say, combination price budget stability importantexplanation development total factor productivity. it probably due stable price provide abetter information value relative prices, improve allocation resources. the combinationof price stability budget stability also increase willingness household sector corporatesector make long-term decisions.if consider factor stimulate rise total factor productivity, number ofchanges play central role. in general, one tend seek explanation increase factorproductivity among factor technological developments, education, competence andincentives among labour force, allocation resource society, well withinbranches companies. there therefore large group possible factors, many areconnected general incentive behind transformation capacity utilise technologicalprogress world around us.the allocation resource society include area important change implementedmainly day lindbeck commission. i refer deregulation financialmarkets development recent years. a number international study indicate thata deregulate well-functioning financial market clearly stimulate development factorproductivity.with regard efficient use labour force, several change implement thathave probably stimulate development. these include reform pension system, tax systemand social insurance system. the burden taxation subdue economic returnon high education increase - particular technical education. in addition, wage formationhas improved, facilitate monetary policy focus price stability.at time, pressure company use resource efficiently increase the1990s. tough competitive pressure result increase internationalisation andderegulation number sector increase need company economise scantresources. le wastefulness resource mean labour force capital employ inother areas, good contribute national economy. the development investmentis another factor may contributed, even capital intensity increase slow rate.one factor contribute long-term improvement resource allocation thedevelopment exchange rate. the devaluation 1970s 1980s follow afloating exchange rate, undervalue swedish krona. the long krona remain 2these calculation base cobb-douglas production function constant return scale. bi review 78/20013undervalued, great risk bad investment make domestic businesses. i notintend go issue great detail now, would nevertheless like point outthat undesirable effect business arise misalign currency give flaw relativeprices. company may make decision regard investment employment basis theserelative prices. the foremost risk many resource draw export sectorand import competition sector return equilibrium exchange rate tocorresponding relative prices. at point, resource overinvested sector betransferred sectors. we know previous structural change in, instance, shipping, steelmanufacture property sector, development would result considerable cost tothe real economy. one underestimate importance welfare correctly valuedswedish krona.openness importantfactor productivity also affect country's capacity utilise technological progress theoutside world. this capacity turn depend open country impulse outside,which determine barrier exist ideas, goods, service production factor movingfreely across borders. a number study show countries, open havea great capacity imitate technological progress. the capacity renew regulatory framework andinstitutions enable country embrace change important part openness.obstacles ideas, goods, service production factor move freely across border havedeclined 1990s, partly thank membership eu, reasonable assumethat positive effect factor productivity. for small country like sweden,internationalisation increase international competition expect lead particularlyfavourable productivity effects. various measure indicate mark increase degree ofinternationalisation swedish economy. both import share export share risen,which mean trade degree specialisation increased. moreover, foreign directinvestment sweden multiply mainly direct investment eu country hasincreased.although increase international openness pronounce sweden with, instance, arise 13 percentage point export share gdp 1990s, several smallercountries show even rapid increase equivalent figures. this reflect theglobalised world live, reduce significance openness thedevelopment factor productivity.internationalisation thus contribute ensure increase percentage trade andindustry expose competition. increase competition mean company must become moreefficient cost-conscious, turn positive effect productivity. in addition, anew competition act come force sweden 1993, contain express prohibition ofco-operation company limit competition, well ban misuse dominantposition. there also deregulation number areas. for instance, governmentmonopolies abolish freedom establish business introduce withregard to, instance, transport, communication energy.changed condition competition thus affect productivity growth, also affect pricetrends direct manner. despite fact gain much tough competition legislationin 1993, appear development field move rather slowly. swedish price continue tolie high level country areas, without fully explain bydifferences vat rate wages. increase competition could contribute convergence pricelevels.high food pricesswedish food price were, instance, 18 per cent high average price theeu 19983. the difference decline somewhat since then, apparently slow rate. ifone regard 1998 price current term aid hicp development since then, one find 3eurostat's survey price level index 1998, publish 2000. 4bis review 78/2001we probably still approximately 17.5 percentage point 18 percentage point difference infood prices.another field competition appear weak construction sector, particular theconstruction material sector. this area characterise high company concentration withconsiderable entry barrier new company weak import competition. with regard price forconstruction materials, one also see much rapid price rise industrialproducts number years, may indicate rise profit margin considerable inefficiencyin resource utilisation.in fields, telecommunication service electricity, deregulation apronounced dampen effect price development time. this long case. themost recent statistic available indicate price increase 7 per cent 20 per cent respectively forthese areas. in addition, telia announce large rise subscriber fee effect fromoctober. i therefore see natural investigation underway plan intocompetition condition markets.vested interest versus consumer interestsalthough thus achieve improvement certain areas, appear descriptionin economics commission's report 1993 (page 10) still apply large part economy."it evident number important market swedish economy function poorly thisleads

foreign exchange market give rise widespread criticism europeancentral bank - least british press, also quarter continent. thatcriticism view wholly unjustified. it classic example expect much

policy strategy ecb help govern council ecb itsmonetary policy deliberation communication public. then, i like discus thecurrent monetary economic situation implication monetary policy. finally, i would liketo give information introduction new banknote coins.let turn monetary policy strategy ecb. the primary objective ecb tomaintain price stability euro area. this objective choose price stabilitysupports high live standard number channels. it enhance transparency ofrelative price thereby foster competition. inflation risk premia would ask byinvestors presence uncertainty inflation minimised. firm individual notneed heavily invest hedge inflation deflation, thus allocate resourcesto productive uses. in environment price stability possible distortion tax system reduced.the relate improvement efficient allocation production factor may help enhance theproduction potential economy. also social point view, inflation welcome. it leadsto 'random' redistribution wealth economic actors, detriment mostvulnerable.since start 1999, ecb apply monetary policy strategy, centre around aquantitative definition price stability analysis risk price stability. this monetary policystrategy help govern council derive explain monetary policy decisions. it hascontributed lot successful master task trigger academic debate whetherelements strategy introduce monetary authorities.the key element ecb's policy framework precise quantitative definition price stability. itclarifies govern council aim keep annual increase harmonise index ofconsumer price (hicp) euro area 2%. moreover, govern council announcedthat price stability accord definition shall maintain medium term. thereby, itprovides public clear guidance inflation expectations. in addition, ecb's transparentframework facilitate process accountability ecb provide yardstick whichits performance assessed.the statement "price stability maintain medium term" acknowledge theexistence short-term volatility prices, result non-monetary shock price level suchas effect indirect tax change variation international commodity prices. there goodeconomic reason monetary policy orient towards medium term. monetary policyaffects price "long variable lags", policy fine-tune economy is, practice,neither viable desirable option. it evident ecb cannot hold responsible forshort-term shock price level, since little control them. rather, assess theoutcome monetary policy ecb medium term ensure meaningful genuineaccountability.having well-defined goal vital. in addition, ecb, like central bank, also require ananalytical framework facilitate achievement goal. the ecb's strategy recognisesthat, environment change uncertainty, single model view world likely befully adequate capture ongoing economic process implication price stability.the need adopt diversify approach analyse assess information uncertain worldwas main reason behind adoption ecb's two-pillar strategy. the distinct, yetmutually-reinforcing perspective complex change environment provide two pillarsare best tool ecb distil master information relevant monetarypolicy-making. 2bis review 76/2001under first pillar, ecb assign prominent role money. a broad array aggregates,ranging m3 component counterparts, notably credit, analyse order assessthreats price stability. assign prominent role money guarantee

ecb's commitment tobeing transparent institution, ecb publish eurosystem staff macroeconomicprojections since last december. however, analysis carry second pillar notonly involve production projections. the staff projection cannot, practice, include latestdevelopments economic indicators. it therefore useful monitor individual indicator parallelwith produce projections, least analysis also provide insight forcesdriving projections. moreover, second pillar ecb's strategy, govern councilalso evaluate indicator financial market expectation derive financial yield prices. thegoverning council also look forecast euro area produce international organisationsand private sector. all information assess simultaneously govern council underthe second pillar, complement monetary analysis first pillar.in discussion lead policy decision govern council systematically incorporate theanalyses conduct complementary pillar underlie ecb's monetary policystrategy. it regard strength strategy multiple framework embodiedand result need decision robust across different model economybecomes obvious.a good understand ecb's monetary policy public enhance effectiveness fostersthe credibility ecb's monetary policy. experience collect time since start stagethree emu suggest anti-inflationary credibility ecb high. indeed, long terminflation expectation remain line price stability since early 1999.finally, let briefly explain govern council's assessment provide two pillar theecb's monetary policy strategy.as regard first pillar, growth monetary aggregate somewhat pick recent months.in period may july, three-month move average m3 growth 5.9%. however, thisfigure need correct upward distortion relate non-euro area residents' hold ofmoney market paper short-term debt security

implication price stability medium term.lastly, annual rate growth loan private sector, although still high, continue todecline recent months. bi review 76/20013as regard second pillar, clear signal low inflationary pressure demandside. recent data economic activity indicate real gdp growth 2001 likely lowerthan expect month ago. the deceleration reflect global slowdown, hasaffected euro area

concern regard outlook price stability come year possibleemergence second-round effects, via wages, current level consumer price inflation. theinformation available show wage moderation prevail first

second, encourage signs, come data consumerand producer prices, confirm increase consumer price inflation temporary. in theabsence unfavourable price shocks, likely price stability restore nottoo

review 75/20011lars heikensten: the swedish krona monetary policyspeech mr lars heikensten, first deputy governor sverige riksbank, seminar créditagricole indosuez, hold stockholm 5 september 2001.* * *over past year swedish krona weaken markedly. both riksbank otherplayers currency market surprise this. in exchange rate importantfactor assessment future inflation, also play part direction monetary policy. thefact that, first time years, riksbank intervene currency market alsocontributed recent heighten attention exchange rate.today i shall first endeavour clarify krona’s role riksbank’s intellectual framework formonetary policy. a policy target inflation require u forecast exchange rate, mynext theme mean easy task. in context i shall also say something theriksbank’s view krona’s long-term real equilibrium exchange rate course pastyear. another question i shall consider exchange rate movement affect inflation. beforeconcluding, i also talk bite intervention transparency - topic feature thedebate since take decision june.the krona’s role change 1990sin period since fix exchange rate abandon riksbank target level ofthe krona. for monetary policy primary consideration inflation prospect relate the2 per cent inflation target. but riksbank’s assessment inflation exchange rate is, ofcourse, important factor.through producer consumer price import good services, exchange rate adirect effect inflation normally comparatively rapid. moreover, exchange rate influencesinflationary pressure indirectly usually long lag via effect level economicactivity. all else equal, weak exchange rate lead strong demand swedish good andservices thereby rise resource utilisation. the exchange rate also influence inflationexpectations indirectly, effect first place price setting.since riksbank introduce inflation target, view exchange rate inflation haschanged degrees. in early year flexible exchange rate, monetary policy influenceda good deal practice short-run exchange rate fluctuations. the focus shift today isclearer matter monetary policy entire path exchange rate inflation thecoming years.the monetary policy reaction shift exchange rate depend cause shift, itsperceived duration economic situation general. exchange rate movement beconsidered isolate events, neither monetary policy’s reaction mechanical. if adepreciation stem international slowdown, example, consequence monetarypolicy differ case root lie lack confidence sweden’s economic policy.the situation begin june serve illustration. the problem simply thatthe krona under-valued. that case, though dramatically, long time.what lead u conclude situation sufficiently serious warrant action conjunctionof several factors. the depreciation occur rapidly receive newinformation justify mark movement. that mean future, relatively optimisticpath krona monetary policy formulate appear le realistic. thedepreciation was, moreover, particularly troublesome coincide substantial price riseand accordingly heighten risk inflation expectation shift rate price increase thatexceeded riksbank’s target. the increase inflation stem transitory factor andfrom persistently high resource utilisation. 2bis review 75/2001forecasting exchange rate difficultas i said, exchange rate’s path come two year important monetary policy.so one arrive picture exchange rate several year ahead? the central bank thattarget inflation say three main approaches.• one alternative assume exchange rate unchanged forecastperiod, quite simply adopt cut-off rate. this, however, raise number problems. asexchange rate liable shift rather rapidly assume rate considerableimportance forecast rate inflation, approach may entail sudden change theassessment inflation thereby repo rate. another problem risk beingtrapped game situation market. so sound reason resort toa short-term pattern reactions. sooner later, central bank generallycome conclusion.• another alternative base exchange rate forecast market price otherassessments market expectations. this approach, use number centralbanks, reduce eliminate risk associate rapid fluctuation andspeculation. another problem picture expectation liable vary withhow measured. on hand, approach advantage presumablybeing credible eye market players; is, all, base assessments!• the riksbank choose third alternative, make independent assessment.here initial position - cut-off rate - naturally one important component arethe market’s expectations. in addition, consider relevant information isavailable, least exchange rate say fundamentally reasonable.which three approach appropriate - give game situation risk ofsudden shift could disregard - self-evident. personally i cannot see nottreat exchange rate much way forecast variables. we normally try considerall relevant information gather particular variable. it seem reasonable soin case, too. another matter considerable degree uncertainty surround virtually allforecast variable particularly exchange rate. that also produce assessment ofrisks. our policy base overall assessment, include valuation various risks.exchange rate theoriesit often say conduct economic policy, best help practice good theory. in thecase exchange rates, however, relevant theory particularly successful eitherexplaining predict movement swedish krona currency recent years.a basic difficulty theory determine exchange rate fact exchange rate anominal price, whereas economic analysis construct explain relative prices. for reason,exchange rate analysis tend focus real rates, principle define basket ofgoods particular country provide order obtain give basket abroad. in anexpression real exchange rate, numerator usually write product nominalexchange rate suitable price index foreign currency denominator suitabledomestic price index.a common approach real exchange rate constant. the term equilibrium use todenote internal balance full employment external balance stable external debt. so afixed real equilibrium exchange rate, nominal exchange rate ultimately determine thecountry’s rate inflation relative inflation abroad. if inflation low rest world, thenominal exchange rate depreciate real rate remain constant. this doctrine ofpurchasing power parity. while common start point determine exchange ratein long run, theory know rather poor explain nominal exchange rate boththe short medium term.in practice real equilibrium exchange rate liable affect many different factors, two ofwhich seem particularly self-evident.terms trade. suppose country export car import wine. a deterioration term oftrade mean price car fall relative price wine common currency. in bi review 75/20013order able sell car view buy unchanged quantity wine therebyleave balance current account unchanged, country’s real exchange rate depreciate.productivity growth. suppose instead country become efficient manufacture cars.this lead good quality car give input resource give price domesticcurrency. the car command high price world market real exchange ratecan appreciate. in practice, high productivity growth tend associate high potentialgdp growth rate. in country growth high rest world, real exchangerate therefore expect show appreciate trend. however, relationship betweenproductivity growth exchange rate stable. economic theory clear cut point -some line reason could lead opposite conclusion.an additional factor closely relate real exchange rate balance current account.a succession current-account deficit lead grow external debt rise interest payments.the real exchange rate must depreciate country achieve enough additional export tofinance interest payments.besides fundamental explanation link theory purchase power parity,there numerous notion connect le closely flow currency markets. thenominal exchange rate price currency; like price goods, price naturallyaffected time time le temporary fluctuation demand supply. it isexplanations type market player prone put forward short-run exchange-ratefluctuations.the general flow-related explanation probably short-term interest rate differential.textbooks teach international currency flow nominal exchange rate susceptible todifferences current expect monetary policy. today, monetary policy throughout theindustrialised world focus price stability, interest rate differential country aretending decrease, explanatory power variable presumably weaker.another factor major importance nominal exchange rate time time thestate government finances. high grow government debt lead expectation asuspension payment monetary policy realignment inflationary direction. that turnresults depreciation exchange rate.the picture swedensince 1975 swedish krona weaken nominal term much 90 per cent. but atleast half depreciation explain sweden’s high inflation. and respect therehas decisive change. we policy commitment price stability rest ofthe world.that leaf around 40 per cent depreciation account for. our work riksbank suggeststhat 1970s ’80s, major part real exchange rate’s weaken attribute todeteriorating term trade, low gdp productivity growth compare rest world andgrowing external debt. one model use indicate three-quarters thedepreciation stem relatively poor growth sweden quarter worseningterms trade.the picture 1990s look different. a far tell present, past decade neitherproductivity gdp growth poor rest world (fig. 1). so respect,too, seem change better. it partly background thekrona’s persistently weak average path latter part 1990s surprising. 4bis review 75/2001in recent discussion medium markets, attention focus specificflows. this discussion always completely accurate. one reason theindividual flows, rather complete picture include flows, various currency strategies,etc. determine developments. we little knowledge extent player theeconomy take exchange rate position buy sell various type securities. we knowfrom financial theory large fluctuation financial price often occur without connectionto large flows.concern government finance hardly crucial factor latter 1990s.neither probable short-term interest rate differential play sizeable part, though aneffect time cannot rule out.in recent discussion, attention focus specific flows. there period lastyear, example, path stockholm stock exchange swedish krona wererather closely related. it look krona tend fall foreign investor quit market. thesizeable purchase foreign security swedish investor similar effect; recently, thesepurchases mirror opportunity provide new pension system. flow

seem bea consequence generally heighten aversion risk major financial centres, newyork london. money withdraw country whose currency economy take abeating similar situation past; since crisis early 1990s sweden unfortunatelyincluded category even though current macroeconomic situation warrant this.finally, generally strong dollar mention partial explanation weak krona.many economist consider accord conventional theory dollar’s strength inexplicableand dollar markedly over-valued. in situation swedish krona, like currenciesin oecd area, depreciate dollar.one problem explanation kind come

sweden continue large trade surplus and, aconsequence unduly under-valued currency, profitable firm rest worldwithout lead reversal occasional flow recently go krona. inforecasting work monetary policy decision-making then, i mention earlier, tocombine assessment risk scenarios, different risks, include possibility thekrona weak main scenario, weigh other.smaller pass-through consumer pricesas i indicated, exchange rate concern u influence inflation. since 1993exchange rate fluctuation comparatively mark effect price developmentshave small expected.consumer price import good dependent variety factors. besides exchange ratemovements, include development world market price level resource utilisationin sweden. the importance domestic resource utilisation do, example, fact thatmost import good handle process sweden reach consumer thatraising price generally difficult demand weak.when look back 1990s order draw conclusion future, factor haveto bear mind. let cite couple examples.during 1994 much 1995 comparatively weak exchange rate lead rise import price thepass-through consumer price small riksbank anticipated. one explanation wasthat capacity utilisation turn riksbank’s assessment wasoverestimated initially demand weaker, partly result riksbank’s interestrate hikes. another explanation krona’s mark appreciation towards end 1995.in 1998 krona weaken connection russian crisis. on 12-month basis thedepreciation amount 10 per cent. even so, import price rise; thecontrary, actually fell good way 1999. this largely reflect factor trigger thecrisis: one large price fall modern time commodity markets, include barrel price ofoil towards usd 10. the result markedly decrease international export price - theequivalent import prices.a factor may contribute exchange rate pass-through consumer price beingsmaller asian russian crisis importer turn away traditional tradingpartners unite states, instance, favour country whose currency notappreciated krona. our import eastern europe southeast asia, example,have increase markedly since 1995.it conceivable krona’s depreciation time asian russian crisis beenexaggerated tcw index measure exchange rate importantindustrialised country us weight base export import share 1989-90. in order tothrow light this, construct simple, broad preliminary import-weighted index thatcovers 44 countries. the result show krona weak 1998 1999 asweak tcw index indicated. one reason exchange rate pass-through consumerprices become small expect may change composition imports.there are, however, also reason suppose krona’s direct pass-through inflation hasdecreased. simple estimation indicate mark reduction early 1990s, follow somefurther fall (fig. 2). a variety factor may contribute this.• exchange rate movements, upwards downwards, may perceive moretransient phenomenon, whereas devaluation fix exchange rate regimewere regard permanent. if importer expect price change temporary, theywill doubt prone absorb exchange rate fluctuation profit margins.that may case indicate preliminary studies. 6bis review 75/2001• generally increase confidence low-inflation regime may also tend reducethe exchange rate’s pass-through inflation. more stable expectation future inflationshould make price le volatile.• during 1990s, moreover, competition swedish economy generally increased,for instance consequence eu membership, continue tariff cuts, reduction ofother barrier trade deregulation domestic economy. increase it trade theadvent new low-cost producer similar effect. although

concluding, i would like say something reference discussion arise inconnection riksbank’s currency intervention june.first i underscore number year take great pain open andclear monetary policy

minute new executive board’s monetary policy meetings. a ihave explain contexts, transparency clarity serve several purposes. they enhancemonetary policy’s credibility legitimacy. they also make monetary policy predictable. inmy opinion, moreover, favourable effect riksbank’s internal atmosphere andefficiency.fig 2. exchange rate impact onconsumer

economic convergence. and, often view national inflation rate, ireland beingcited example. 2bis review 75/2001well, then, exactly mean “convergence”? the term one many facets. the treaty ofmaastricht

equity finance “new economy”. in end, accordingto paper, information available, quality deteriorated, reduce benefitfrom information technology market efficiency.because incentive produce distort information strong, author doubt marketmechanisms alone correct problem. they advocate two-pronged strategy enhanceddisclosure requirement investor education improve market efficiency. these recommendationsare sensible. the emphasis disclosure long cornerstone regulatoryframework unite states, lie behind recent initiative sec combat thecommission view variety conflict interest threaten integrity financial markets.the authors’ recommendation - great education investor - also important, especiallygiven broaden participation financial markets. the federal reserve, along othergovernment agencies, work promote financial literacy several way - issue regulationsthat make compare financial product easier, produce educational material public, andby support private-sector initiatives, program design disseminate coursematerials use schools.although i certainly concur policy recommendation paper, i suggestion fortightening analysis lie behind recommendations. for example, paper imply thatfinancial disclosure generally weak past, us medium focus pro formaaccounting one proof increase weakness financial disclosure. increase pro formadisclosures necessarily imply mislead information always disclosed. while theauthors demonstrate that, small number firms, earn pro forma number highrelative gaap earnings, clear paper severe problem exist regard tothese disclosures. similarly, paper attempt show earn management fool themarket, virtually evidence base data 1970s, 1980s, early 1990s, thus itmay relevant late years. moreover, analysis recent effect earningsdistortions tend loose. for example, paper argue high turnover share option-intensive company may indicate shareholder relatively unsophisticated - thethought omission option-related cost gaap earn overstate firm’s trueincome uninformed investor trade heavily noise-ridden news. perhaps. but paperignores plausible explanation high turnover may unrelated sophistication 2bis review 73/2001of shareholders. one explanation option-intensive firm concentrate high-techsector, flow news and, hence, trade opportunity great elsewhere theeconomy.my second suggestion author careful assert information technologyhas greatly expand presence uninformed investor equity market. base readingof available data, occurrence seem far clear, i would like spend couple minutesindicating why.let’s begin look aggregate data household equity hold federal reserve’sflow fund accounts.1 these data include direct hold households, along variousforms indirect equity hold involve professional management (such invest throughmutual funds). if uninformed individual play grow direct role equity market, asthe paper argues, might expect see direct hold household become largershare total equity outstanding. however, chart 1 shows, see opposite. thisresult may reflect fact, indicate chart 2, past decade, household beenreducing portion equity hold directly increasingly invest throughmutual fund variable annuity (which essentially mutual fund combine life insurance).that is, household hand equity portfolio professionalmanagers, tend relatively well inform investors.household-level data equity ownership paint similar picture. it true, show table 1 thepaper, number u.s. household own equity form increase substantially.however, table also show relatively little increase reflect broad direct ownership ofequity. accord federal reserve’s survey consumer finance - original datasource table - 19 percent u.s. household own individual stock outside retirementaccounts 1998, barely 17 percent share 1989. like aggregate data, figuressuggest new investor largely put money manage accounts. 1technically, data combine nonprofit organization household sector; however, nonprofit small partof aggregate, safely regard data pertain households. bi review 73/20013what actually know new investor choose buy individual stock recentyears? to knowledge, best source information “equity ownership america”survey

course, crude proxy really want tomeasure - degree market knowledge sophistication. still, survey provide little reasonto believe new purchaser individual stock especially likely dupe misleadinginformation. the survey results, combine data indicate shift toward institutional holdingsof equity, cast doubt authors’ assertion information technology “broughtunsophisticated investor drive stock market”.i would feel comfortable alternative story, go follows. the late 1990s aperiod optimism prospect u.s. economy, reflect pickup productivitygrowth generated, large part, information technology. the resultant optimism theeconomy’s growth prospect accompany complacent attitude toward risk, feed longbull market date back early 1980s. in environment, many investor - merelynewcomers - purchase stock belief business plan would become reality. the problemwas not, part, new investor come dominate market many investors’attitude toward perception risk change markedly. this explanation recent events, whichavoids less-compelling aspect paper, appear provide strong foundation theauthors’ observations.given panel topic finance information age, i would like broaden discussion byconsidering actual likely effect technology product attributes, pricing, welfare inmarkets financial products. since i read paper focus mainly retail market, ishall continue vein.for number retail financial products, new technology surely lead general increase inwelfare. new delivery technologies, internet, combine automate underwritingand credit scoring, give borrower opportunity select broad set provider ofcredit cards, mortgages, even type small business loan - one mostinformationally opaque financial products. competition enhance new technology makesit easy non-banking institution offer product out-of-market financial firm tocompete local financial institutions. in addition, securitization - also dependent onadvances information technology - broaden pool lender allow loan originator topackage risk shift risk party best able bear it.at time, automate underwrite credit score improve ability lender toevaluate price credit risk, allow credit extend wide range borrowers.the rapid growth market subprime mortgage one example broad access tocredit. in effect, advance information technology help ameliorate key imperfection inloan market - namely, outright denial credit relatively risky borrower face limitedinformation. recent event indicate product market still evolving.automated underwrite credit score also substantially reduce time cost involve inmaking credit decisions. these save contribute overall welfare improvement bring aboutby information technology. in area mortgage lending, example, credit decision today areroutinely make minute rather day much low cost decade ago. freddie macreports cost originate mortgage loan process system fall hundredsof dollars, help overcome one main barrier homeownership - lack availablesavings meet close cost downpayment requirements. another benefit automatedunderwriting credit decision become transparent, lender potentialborrowers. individual easily obtain credit report credit score, check whether anyinformation report incorrect, learn improve credit standing.in short, paper raise important concern equity markets, area financeprovide evidence information age bring significant benefit form increasedtransparency competition, low costs, appropriate pricing, broad access credit.technology also expand way customer conduct business financialinstitutions, potential increase welfare. for example, need “in-person visits”has diminish financial service provider establish centralize call center facilitatetelephone banking, develop web site allow internet bank software permit pc banking,and promote use direct deposit pre-authorized debits. accord recent statistics,nearly 40 percent u.s. bank provide form web site cancommunicate customers, almost 15 percent provide web site use conductbanking transactions. these number grow rapidly. of bank $500 million inassets, nearly 50 percent provide web site use conduct transactions. a 6bis review 73/2001need in-person visit declines, might expect customer broaden geographic area withinwhich search provider financial services, lead increase competition. clearly,mortgages credit card already fall category financial product.nonetheless, implication new delivery channel bank product thanmortgages credit card seem potential real vast majority bank retailcustomers. for example, despite expand option make available customer result oftechnological advances, data collect federal reserve’s 1998 survey consumer financesand 1998 survey small business finance indicate household small business still relyvery heavily

quarter 2000, slowdown largely confine agricultural sector. but inthe first quarter year, weakness spread sector economy. of worry isthat sector bore brunt slowdown manufacture sector. the growth rate

meaningfully theslowdown import inflation.4.exchange rate developmentsthe performance rand/dollar exchange rate disappoint recent times. it hastraded r8.01 4 july 2001 r8.45 22 august. whilst i often say thatcommentators focus trade-weighted value rand, deterioration value ofthe rand u dollar might merely reflect strength u dollar internationalexchanges, traded-weighted value rand also succumb negative sentiment. it iscurrently around 8 per cent weak end last year.why exchange rate rand currently pressure? the reason cite market arethe following: first instance, currency perceive belong emerge market asset classhave adversely affect by, particular, development argentina turkey. there areconcerns market that, notwithstanding official aid packages, accompanyingconditionalities, argentina’s economic problem could prove difficult resolve. sentiment towards therand clearly affect fear contagion.secondly, development zimbabwe, particular respect land-reform programme, havealso cite explanatory factors. the impact development compound weekfollowing report bloomberg. mr thami kaplaatjie, secretary-general pan-africanistcongress south africa, reportedly support zimbabwe’s approach land reform criticisedthose oppose negate interest africans. furthermore, reportedly also toldjournalists problem land south africa will, explodes, enormous proportions- “too ghastly contemplate” words. (i believe mr kaplaatjie speak officialcapacity but, i must stress, damage done.)i would like repeat i say yesterday annual african investment conference hold instellenbosch. i concern development zimbabwe tend adverse effecton markets, particular currency bond markets. i would like reiterate firstly, theland question zimbabwe need resolve accordance law orderly fashionwhich find solution beneficial political economic imperative zimbabwe theregion.secondly, current state restlessness zimbabwe really bring end allowthe economy southern africa stabilise. thirdly, market need learn differentiatebetween development one southern african country another. here south africa politicalleadership consistently state land reform take place accord law guide bythe constitution need historical redress food production. i hope market player arelistening said.fourthly, reserve bank’s point view highly appreciative effort thesouthern african development community try assist resolution zimbabweanquestion. and finally, always aware financial market affect amultiplicity factors, one factor. since development one emerge market time totime affect another, therefore important emerge market design policy bi review 72/20013programmes receive maximum benefit globalisation. an “injury one tend injuryto all”.the final factor mention market perceive increase strikeaction

intervene currency market endeavour strengthen swedish krona andthereby avert threat 2 per cent inflation target.this even i shall attempt present riksbank’s action i see widerperspective convey view

relation short time horizon, would oblige u adjust interest ratemore markedly well frequently. both i many others believe would bad foroutput employment.as know, assess future difficult prediction almost always questionedand debated. interest rate decision riksbank’s executive board precede extensivediscussions opinion sometimes differ. disagreement obviously intrinsically desirablebut group people decide complex matters, liable reach differentconclusions times. that happen business also apply economic policy. the differenceis riksbank open institution, mean task-masters - ultimately swedishnation - can, minute meetings, see basis decision, precede discussionand position board member taken. i see basically advantage people’sconfidence sweden’s monetary policy. have say that, i also want underscore broadagreement among member executive board fundamental framework efforts. itis important bear mind.after preliminary remarks, i shall turn development swedish economy recentyears.sweden’s rapid economic expansion slowedeconomic growth sweden strong number years. and although demand risenrapidly, inflation low. this partly explain cyclical factors. by i mean plentifulsupply unutilised resource - least lose job economic crisisthat ravage sweden early 1990s. that lessen risk upswing production soonleading economy reach potential output. but far judge present, morefavourable trend also economy function efficiently.sooner later, however, demand growth unduly strong persistent generate economicimbalances, whereupon price wage increase usually tend accelerate. in time, adevelopment liable turn recession, fall output rise unemployment. rapidlyrising inflation often - though always - indication economy expand toorapidly economic policy sufficiently tight. economic overheat risinginflation fact recurrent problem 1970s ’80s. restrict economic activity whentimes good often prove difficult. but sooner late do way werethen dramatic. production employment fall unemployment risen. 2bis review 72/2001towards end last year judge time economic activity sweden startslowing growth rate commensurate stable long-term trend. continue growthat rate around 3 4 per cent reasonable. observer usually consider swedisheconomy capable long-term growth annual rate 2 2.5 per cent. a similar situationhad face time central bank around world. in unite states, example,the federal reserve raise instrumental rate successively 1999 2000 6.5 percent. in europe, ecb tighten rate last year 4.75 per cent, bank england’s ratewas raise 6.0 per cent. the type reaction also evident countries.i recall course last year many observer count relatively large interest rate hike insweden, too. they think saw clear sign swedish economy way tobecoming overheat argue fairly strongly riksbank therefore act quickly toincrease instrumental rate keep central bank around world.but riksbank arrive different assessment choose instead proceed cautiously withinterest rate increases. in opinion, relatively favourable inflation prospect last year simply didnot warrant tight monetary stance. we keep level 3.75 per cent practically whole of2000.in december, however, raise repo rate 0.25 per cent points, 3.75 4.0 per cent. inother words, small increase level good bite low comparablecountries. that apply least relation unite states, i take example becausethe central bank cut instrumental rate markedly spring, development coursehas see light relatively large increase earlier. it late spring therate unite state come level sweden. and little month ago thatthe federal reserve cut rate become somewhat low swedish rate. theswedish repo rate fact low american rate almost five years, sinceseptember 1996. that something sometimes ignore public debate.so swedish economy move towards situation risk total outputultimately rise rapidly. there nothing dramatic this. consider strength ofeconomic activity, expected. an adjustment demand long-term growth path canoccur either spontaneous economic slowdown - instance sweden affect aweakening international activity - consequence monetary policy adjustment; alsoresult combination two.we note economic activity rest world, least unite states, weakenedappreciably first half year. the swedish economy affect this, evidentfrom statistic sweden’s late quarterly gdp data. the recent figure national accountsare admittedly preliminary tendency behind clear: gdp growth fell back annualrate 3-4 per cent recent year 2 per cent first half year.thus, world economic slowdown help bring downward adjustment demandgrowth sweden towards long-term path without riksbank need lift repo rate tobetween 6 7 per cent, central bank number country oblige todo.how krona come it?but interest rate influence development demand ultimately rate ofinflation. the exchange rate also play important part. among things, weak exchange ratetends stimulate export segment swedish production expose internationalcompetition. that could limit impact international economic slowdown. conversely, anappreciation krona act brake modify pull economic improvement therest world. another effect weak exchange rate concern price import good andservices, risk pass-through consumer prices.in 1970s ’80s, currency devaluation frequently use instrument stimulate theeconomy. the development demand boost via production export time asimported good become expensive. in time, however, inflation begin move up. now thatsweden flexible exchange rate regime, thing work somewhat differently. if krona weakensand firm household perceive transient movement, effect inflation asstrong before, currency write-down see permanent measure. this bi review 72/20013contributed, example, import price pass-through consumer price 1990s wassmaller earlier. but magnitude effect demand inflation flexible exchangerate regime obviously depend much value krona changes. even aregime, large shift - upwards downwards - value krona effect ondemand prices.since last summer swedish krona weaken 10 15 per cent relative aweighted currency basket. all else equal give depreciation permanent, thestimulus swedish economy would fully equal effect unite state economy ofthe federal reserve’s interest rate cut spring. against background accordingly difficult toclaim aggregate monetary condition sweden become tighter, even though riksbankraised repo rate last december and, recently, begin july.i point krona’s current value feature riksbank’s overallinflation forecast monetary policy. what use instead, describe inflation report, anassessment krona’s future path. the krona’s future path invariably major factor behind theriksbank’s inflation forecast. and inflation forecast form foundation monetarypolicy. thus, development exchange rate, demand, inflation expectation allaffect interest rate decision indirectly via inflation forecast.it never simple matter determine path exchange rate come one two yearsthat ought use assessment inflation. but long reasonable assessment pointto swedish economy good shape, long term also motivate exchangerate considerably strong see past year. in words, beengrounds count inflation report somewhat strong krona even period one totwo year ahead guide monetary policy. but krona begin fall almost 5 per cent inthe course fortnight early summer, ultimately become difficult count exchangerate become strong forecast envisage come two years. the weak initialposition, large requisite appreciation. to quote press release 15 june, executiveboard consider “the krona’s depreciation since late inflation report importantsingle factor may lead inflation target threaten 1-2 year now”. the riksbankhad initiate currency market intervention view strengthen krona.when executive board meet 5 july krona still weak. in light current forecastsof resource utilisation, exchange rate demand, majority board member concludedthat repo rate raise 0.25 percentage points, 4.25 per cent, order avoid riskof inflation exceed target 1-2 year ahead. the picture also include considerable priceincreases spring which, although mainly transient, liable influence inflationexpectations.the decision easy one executive board. a minute show, precede byan intensive discussion. three member different view. in opinion, risk rise inflationon account weak exchange rate balance risk economic activity become moresubdued. the members, i one, concluded, however, everything wastaken account, spectrum inflation risk shift slightly upwards. the increase aprecautionary measure. it also consider important send clear signal inflation targetis take seriously.it underscore decision imply anything repo rate’s future path. thatwould consider usual riksbank’s regular monetary policy meet light theoverall picture inflation prospects.in view comment suggest riksbank’s action wrongly interpreted, iwant emphasise particular interest rate increase

misunderstand that.during summer krona become somewhat stronger, welcome. a major factor herehas weaken dollar. a continue appreciation currency would also bewelcome. in relation swedish economy’s sound fundamentals, krona still weak. 4bis review 72/2001looking aheadbefore i take look future tendencies, may place emphasise swedish economy isfundamentally sound, good potential growth employment, accompany surplus onthe current account well public finances. the recent temporary increase inflation timeof slow activity problem sweden common country around world.global economic growth slowed, i

monetary stimulus, slowdown still seem hold grip onthe american economy. a know, however, take time interest rate cut exert fulleffect economic activity.in order form picture lie ahead, one start

final stage deregulation probably could happen good time– least point view protect regulator's peace mind. the ample liquidity thebanking system reduce risk aggressive price war deposits, hkma'sprincipal concern. so end little bang rather big bang. but i shouldemphasise le two month pass since interest rate control finally lifted.any conclusion impact deregulation tentative stage.some happen predict time decision deregulate taken.deregulation catalyst – cynical would say excuse – bank introducefees charge deposit accounts. most bank also introduce tiered save accounts, withhigher interest rate pay large balances. sometimes rate depend range thebank's product service customer uses. the converse bank nowpaying le standard rate small deposits. a innovation case thereare save product link hibor.banks rush pay interest conventional current accounts, though offeredcombined save deposit account pay interest. at least one bank offer auto-sweepingservice save current accounts. such product effectively offer interest currentaccounts. generally speaking, amount deposit innovative current save accountsare still quite small.perhaps big surprise far bank able low theirbenchmark save account rate 1.75%, probably 25bp would beenwithout deregulation. a year ago, debate deregulation take place, theconventional wisdom save rate artificially depress would rise close timedeposit rate cap lifted. so far case. indeed, appear theinterest rate rule effectively impose floor well cap.in current liquid conditions, therefore, large bank able cut standard savingsrate. they therefore see analyst winner deregulation since haveanother lever adjust net interest margin. the unanswered question whether ableto get away without significant erosion deposit save current accounts. a certain amountof switch account go on. but enough evidence stage concludewhether deregulation result significant redistribution deposit among banks. so wecannot tell interest elastic demand save account may prove be, particularly intoday's somewhat artificial condition high liquidity. however, say deregulationdoes offer small bank enhance ability compete save account thosecustomers large bank may le eager retain. while small bank may topay high rate save deposits, still benefit substitute fund foreven high cost, le stable, time deposits.consumers also benefit deregulation great choice save product and, forthose large balance least, high interest rates. however, face fact thatnot depositor good deregulate world. the harsh law economics mean thatthose small balance may suffer disproportionately new fee charge receive lesscompensation form high interest. competition help address concern someextent since bank adopt different charge interest rate policies. customer

growth toensure continuity macroeconomic financial stability. i remark early macroeconomic andfinancial stability gain make last years. they gain mustcontinue preserve.second, increase emphasis monetary policy towards external stability far put unduepressure key domestic interest rates. they remain broadly accommodating. this thelarge liquidity overhang bank system. i believe interest rate current level areappropriate consistent need support recovery domestic demand, provideincentives corporate debt restructuring, maintain economy’s cost competitiveness.and third, address issue growth stability, must look proper coordination offiscal monetary policies. at time, fiscal policy dominant role revive theweaknesses domestic demand. the government cautious balance fiscal stimulusmeasures within context longer-term fiscal sustainability. the role monetary policy toensure continuity macroeconomic financial stability.ladies gentlemen,one key concern thailand’s long-term fiscal sustainability issue thegovernment find solution remain cost financial restructuring. the cost, includesthe remain uncover loss plus contingent loss next three years, iscurrently estimate 774 billion baht 17.2 billion u dollar.on issue, yesterday, thai authority announce plan would constitute acomprehensive solution problem. the solution centre programme governmentguaranteed bond issue would provide full finance estimate cost. this programmeof bond issuance run maximum period twenty years, finance provide forin government budget. this incorporation project keep share debt-service ratio toan average 13.6% government budget first decade 11.5% second decade.this mean little crowding-out effect government’s investment expenditure inthe period ahead, public debt stock-to-gdp project trend long term.with programme, thailand’s long-term fiscal sustainability assured.with monetary stability place fiscal stability enshrine government’s long-term fiscalsustainability framework, i believe operate environment thailand period ahead bemore assure remain conducive growth. but really put growth engine back feet,notably recovery domestic demand, work do micro level toremove bottleneck inhibit real economy.this lead second challenge: put bank system back normal lending.our bank system return health profitability strengthen capital base, muchlower level non-performing loans. yet, growth credit minimal depositgrowth rise liquidity remain ample. find solution problem go easy.but effort revive domestic economy need focus on.new lend perceive risky give current negative factor macro front externalfactors, npl overhang preoccupy bankers’ attention keep renew clientrelationship.to address problem, authority choose approach problem three ways: 4bis review 70/2001(cid:1) first, accelerate corporate debt restructure improve legal frameworksand set national asset management corporation deal remainingunresolved problem loans. progress front visible. the law establish thethai asset management corporation, tamc, pass operation set beginsoon asset transfer complete september. a key benefit tamc theadvantage single creditor transfer asset. this would allow tamc dealeffectively speedily unresolved debt involve multiple creditors. also, thevast executive power give tamc law would make easy tamc take acomprehensive approach debt restructuring, ability deal case thatmight warrant corporate restructure change management.(cid:1) second, introduce scheme credit guarantee would provide facility risk-sharing corporate borrowers, government, bank base marketmechanism.(cid:1) third, work management state bank commercial bank facilitatetheir resumption lend without compromise banks’ risk management thebank thailand’s supervisory standards.on part, bank thailand improve credit information system foster theestablishment credit bureaus, provide much-needed infrastructure resumption ofnew credit. meanwhile, continue adhere best practice prudential standards, andlook improve standards.let turn third challenge: rebuild financial architecture.this area bank thailand take leadership role strengthen soundness andefficiency financial institutions. our leadership must lead outcome make practicalsense, measure international best practices, must market-oriented suitable tothailand.so far, lay necessary groundwork tackle short-term difficulties, thepersisting non-performing loan problems, lack credit growth, restoration financial sectorsoundness. long-term prosperity however require more. it require new financial architecture andcorresponding market infrastructure foster competition efficiency ensure non-recurrence past problems.specifically, world financial innovations, economic integration, technologicaladvancements bring nation market close define new paradigm competition forfinancial service industries, rebuild financial architecture become vital long-termsuccesses, survival.given challenge, direction heading?(cid:1) go forward, must improve financial architecture raise efficiency ensurenationwide access financial services.(cid:1) in term market competition, open bank system accelerate thetransfer technical knowledge ensure competition domestic financialinstitutions.(cid:1) in term market structure, new financial institution bill – currently senate isexpected pass course year – provide legal formal frameworkthat accommodate establishment financial conglomerates. financial institution willbe allow offer variety financial service insurance security theirsubsidiaries. though still step away universal bank model financialservices offer one entity draft law flexible enough make room forsuch eventuality, meantime boost competition.(cid:1) among major milestone law are: consolidate supervision financialconglomerates, unify legal framework bank finance companies, promptcorrective action weak financial institutions.(cid:1) a availability financial service product qualities, recent surveyof financial product availability within thailand indicate market participant keen toexpand product range, thus structural impediment obstruct need deal with. bi review 70/20015the bank thailand announce new rule internet bank – simply canbe do counter, allow internet. this facilitatedevelopment financial product area.(cid:1) and alternate form financial intermediaries, capital market, bond market, andequity market play great role future. they help increase efficiency ofour banks’ operation provide new instrument help manage, mitigate repackagerisks.(cid:1) the second agenda financial sector reform enhance risk managementcapacity, particularly thai regulatory body financial institutions. on front,our supervision group move regulation transaction-testing toward risk-based supervision early year.(cid:1) from preliminary assessment, change foster correspond andencouraging change thai financial institutions. several hire foreign consultantsto transfer know-how adopt best international practice risk management,while many import several standard off-the-shelves risk management software tohelp improve current practices. of course, remain several impediment change;these include scarce expensive human resource particular field, evenmore difficult re-engineer business process ensure resource areemployed productively.(cid:1) the new accord major challenge milestone area. the bank thailand hasbeen work closely bank community thailand, implement inpractices.(cid:1) though applaud basel committee effort create framework moresensitive risk incentive compatible, i believe many area wouldbenefit close consultation academia.(cid:1) first, apply internal rating-based approach irb approach new accordrequires substantial build-up capacity: human resource, database, business modelre-engineering, name few.(cid:1) a far data default probability credit risk concerned, country thatjust embark develop require database disadvantage shorterand probably le representative series. moreover, recover crisis suchas thailand, imply risk series collect crisis period higherthan average complete business cycle. thus, develop country find highcost emerge crisis.ladies gentlemen,(cid:1) this pro-cyclical aspect default statistic may important issue globaleconomic recovery.(cid:1) secondly, technical aspect remain unclear. in many cases, capital calculatedto support expect unexpected losses, overly costly.(cid:1) thirdly, propose capital charge operational risk need make refined,incentive compatible risk management, practical le cumbersome itsapplication.the third aspect financial reform market discipline.(cid:1) we recognise sound corporate governance, bank borrowers, willprovide discipline within, public disclosure allow market force discipline thefinancial institution outside.(cid:1) we launch new directors’ handbook financial community, furtherencourage understand motivation behind good governance, alsoendeavour improve transparency appointment compensation.ladies gentlemen, 6bis review 70/2001the last challenge i want share strengthen bank thailand meetfuture challenges.the crisis 1997 bring light weakness thailand’s financial management. the bank ofthailand like central bank region, go sea change wake ofthe crisis, undergo intensive reform operation organization. three area change inparticular stand major achievement internal reorganization, strengthen theframework monetary policy inflation targeting, enhance communication andtransparency operation.at onset crisis, bank thailand undergo major restructure organizationstructure, data management work process. these aim ensure good foundation inour decision-making process particularly monetary policy implementation financial institutionsupervision. a risk management unit establish manage operational risk moreeffectively, review monitor area risk central bank operation view takingforward look risk mitigation actions.another important area strengthen process monetary policy operation. theinflation target framework adopt thailand provide sufficient flexibility take care thechallenges face economy. through regular communication market opendiscussions public policy issues, central bank foster enhance participation ofacademic market interests.the bank thailand’s monetary policy-making process reform ensure balance oftransparency, independence accountability. this belief transparency operationlimits discretion lead accountability. the bank quickly move towards great openness theprovision data timely economic information. it belief public acceptance andunderstanding monetary policy important. and come greatertransparency predictability.conclusionladies gentlemen,in conclusion, i hope i give update direction head inthis current environment. the experience thailand significantly different othercountries emerge crisis i therefore welcome comment suggestion youmay have.before leave today, may i thank honour address

subcommittee financial institution consumer credit committee onfinancial services, u house representatives, 26 july 2001.* * *it pleasure, mr chairman, appear subcommittee present view board ofgovernors federal reserve system deposit insurance reform propose federaldeposit insurance corporation (fdic) past spring. at point, federal reserve board’sviews necessarily general fdic’s recommendation purposefully quite broad.that said, behalf board i want compliment fdic excellent report highlightsthe issue develop integrate framework address them. we urge congress usethat framework promptly develop detail legislative proposal address mostimportant deficiency current deposit insurance system. i hope comment morning willbe helpful so.benefits cost deposit insuranceas background suggestions, board belief important first understand benefitsand cost deposit insurance. deposit insurance play key – time even critical – role inachieving stability bank financial market characterize past almost seventyyears. deposit insurance, combine component bank safety net – federalreserve’s discount window payment system guarantee – enhance macroeconomicstability result monetary fiscal policies, mean period financial stress nolonger characterize depositor run bank thrifts. quite opposite: asset holder nowseek deposit safe haven strong doubt financial assets.looking beyond contribution deposit insurance overall financial stability, notminimize security bring million household small businesses. deposit insurancehas provide safe secure place household small business relativelymodest amount financial asset hold transaction balances.these benefit deposit insurance, significant are, come without cost. the verysame process end deposit run make insure depositor largely indifferent riskstaken bank fund risk institution unable meet itsobligations. a result, market discipline control risk insure depositor would otherwisehave impose bank thrift weakened. relieve discipline, bank thriftsnaturally feel le inhibit take risk would otherwise assume. no typeof private financial institution able attract fund public without regard risk takeswith creditors’ resources. this incentive take excessive risk so-called moral hazardproblem deposit insurance, inducement take risk expense insurer.because reduce market discipline moral hazard, intensify need forgovernment supervision protect interest taxpayer and, essence, substitute thereduced market discipline. deposit insurance component safety net also enablebanks thrift attract resource would otherwise case. in short, insure banksand thrift receive subsidy form government guarantee allow attractdeposits low interest rate would require without deposit insurance take riskwithout fear lose deposit funding. put another way, deposit insurance misallocatesresources break link risk reward select set market competitors.from beginning, deposit insurance involve tradeoff. on one hand, arebenefits contribution deposit insurance overall financial stability protection ofsmall depositors. on hand, deposit insurance impose cost inducement torisk-taking, misallocation resources, increase need government supervision toprotect taxpayers’ interests. the craft reform deposit insurance system must struggleto balance tradeoffs. moreover, board urges, reasonably certain 2bis review 68/2001reforms aim primarily protect public interest profit market share ofparticular businesses.the federal reserve board belief deposit insurance reform design preservethe benefit heighten financial stability protection small depositor without sametime increase moral hazard reduce market discipline. this view underpin response thefederal reserve board fdic’s recommendations. in addition, although time areresponding broad recommendations, urge implement detail keep asstraightforward possible minimize risk unintended consequence come withcomplexity.recommendations reformthe fdic make five broad recommendations.1.merging bif saifthe board strongly support fdic’s proposal merge bif saif funds. because thecharters operation bank thrift become similar, make sense continuethe separate funds. separate fund reflect past, neither present future. equallyimportant, insurance product provide two set institution identical, thus thepremiums identical well. under current arrangements, premium could differsignificantly one fund fell designate reserve ratio 1.25 percent insureddeposits fund not. merge fund would also diversify risk reduceadministrative expenses.2.statutory restriction premiumscurrent law require fdic impose high premium risky bank thrift restrict itsability impose premium well-capitalized highly-rated institution whenever thecorresponding fund’s reserve exceed 1.25 percent insure deposits. the board strongly endorsesthe fdic recommendation would (1) require premium impose every insureddepository institution, matter well capitalize well rat may high fund’sreserves, (2) eliminate statutory restriction risk-based pricing.the current statutory requirement free deposit insurance provide well-capitalized andwell-rated bank fdic reserve exceed predetermine ratio maximize subsidy providedto institution inconsistent effort avoid induce moral hazard. put differently, thecurrent rule require government give away valuable guarantee fund reserve meetsome ceiling level. this free guarantee value bank thrift even arein sound financial condition macroeconomic time good. at end last year,92 percent bank thrift pay premium. include group bank havenever pay premium their, case substantial, coverage fast-growing entitieswhose past premium extraordinarily small relative current coverage. we believe thatthese anomaly never intend framer deposit insurance fund act 1996 andshould address congress.the congress intend fdic impose risk-based premiums, 1996 act limit abilityof fdic impose risk-based premium well-capitalized well-rated banks. and twovariables – capital strength examiner overall rat – capture risk bank andthrifts could create insurer. the board belief fdic free establish riskcategories base well-researched economic variable impose premium commensuratewith risk classifications. although robust risk-based premium system would technicallydifficult design, close link insurance premium individual bank thrift risk wouldreduce moral hazard distortion resource allocation accompany deposit insurance.we note, however, significant benefit regard likely require substantial range ofpremiums fdic conclude report premium risky bank wouldprobably need cap order avoid induce failure weak institutions. we believethat cap premium may end cost insurance fund long run weakinstitutions fail anyway, delay increase ultimate cost resolution. the board bi review 68/20013concluded, therefore, cap required, set quite high risk-based premiumscan effective possible deter excessive risk-taking.3.designated reserve ratio premiumsthe current law establish designate reserve ratio bif saif 1.25 percent. if ratio isexceeded, statute require premium well-capitalized well-rated bank must bediscontinued. if ratio decline 1.25 percent, fdic must develop set premium torestore reserve ratio 1.25 percent; appear fund ratio cannot restore itsstatutorily designate level twelve months, law require premium least 23 basispoints impose least risky category banks.these requirement clearly procyclical, low eliminate fee good time bankcredit readily available fund reserve build up, abruptly increase fee sharply intimes weakness bank credit availability pressure fund resource draw downto cover resolution fail banks. the fdic recommend surcharge rebate beused bring fund back target reserve ratio gradually. the fdic also recommend thepossibility target range designate reserve ratio, premium may remainconstant, rather fix target reserve ratio abruptly change premiums.we strongly support increase flexibility smooth premiums. indeed, recommendthat fdic’s suggest target reserve range widen order reduce need changepremiums sharply. any floor ceiling, regardless level, could result require premiumsbe increase exactly time bank thrift could stress and, similarly, thatpremiums reduce time depository best position fund increase inreserves. build large fund good time permit decline necessary areprerequisites le variability premium. in addition widen range, board wouldrecommend fdic give latitude temporarily relax floor ceiling ratio basisof current anticipate bank condition expect need resource resolve failinginstitutions.4.rebatessince early days, fdic rebate “excess” premium whenever felt reserve wereadequate. this procedure replace the1996 law requirement premium beimposed well-capitalized highly rat bank thrift fund reach designatedreserve ratio. the fdic proposal would re-impose minimum premium bank thrift amore risk-sensitive premium structure. these provision would couple rebate thestronger entity fund approach recommend high upper end targetrange fdic suggested, surcharge fund trend suggest bea low end target range.the fdic also recommend rebate uniform strong entities. rather, fdicargues rebate small bank pay premium short periodsor past pay premium commensurate present size hencefdic exposure.the devil, course, details. but latter proposal make considerable sense, theboard endorse it. there 900 bank – quite large – never pay apremium, without modification would continue pay virtually nothing, net rebates, aslong strong capital high supervisory rat maintained. such approach bothcompetitively inequitable contribute moral hazard. it addressed.5.indexing insured-deposit coverage ceilingsthe fdic recommend current $100,000 ceiling insure deposit indexed. the boarddoes support recommendation belief that, time, current ceiling bemaintained.in board’s judgment, unlikely increase coverage, even indexing, today would addmeasurably stability bank system. macroeconomic policy element thesafety net, combine current, still-significant level deposit insurance, continue underpinthe stability financial system. thus, problem increase coverage design solve 4bis review 68/2001must relate either individual depositor, party originally intend protect bydeposit insurance, individual bank thrift. clearly, group would prefer high coverageif costs. but congress need clear problem increasedcoverage would solution.depositorsat federal reserve, frequently receive letter bank urge support increaseddeposit insurance coverage. but virtually never receive similar letter depositors, notshy share many concerns. this experience may reflect fact that, surveysof consumer finance suggest, depositor adept achieve level deposit insurancecoverage desire open multiple accounts. such spread asset hold perfectlyconsistent counsel always give investor diversify asset – whether stocks, bonds,or mutual fund – across different issuers. the cost diversify insure deposit surely nogreater assets. an individual bank would clearly prefer depositormaintain fund bank, would prefer eliminate need depositordiversification able offer high deposit insurance coverage. nonetheless, depositorappears great difficulty – want insure deposit – find multiplesources fully insure accounts.in addition, singular characteristic postwar household financial asset hold theincreasing diversity portfolio choices. the share household financial asset bank deposit hasbeen decline steadily throughout postwar period household take advantage ofinnovations make available attractive financial instrument market rate return.there break trend seem relate past increase insurance ceilings.indeed, dramatic substitution deposit recent year insure anduninsured deposit equity mutual funds. it difficult believe change ceiling duringthe 1990s would make measurable difference shift. in fact, bankers’ comment andthe data indicate weakness stock price recent quarter mark increasedflows bank thrift deposits.depository institutionsdoes problem solve increase deposit insurance coverage concern individualdepository institution? if so, problem would necessarily concentrate small bank thatgenerally access money market foreign branch network supplementaryfunds. since mid-1990s, banks’ u.s. asset grow average annual rate 7.7 percent.adjusted effect mergers, small banks, large 1,000, actuallygrown rapid average annual rate 13 percent. uninsured deposit small bankshave also grow rapidly large bank – average annual rate 20.5 percent thesmall bank versus 10.9 percent large banks, merger-adjusted basis. clearly,small bank demonstrate skill ability compete uninsured deposits. to sure,uninsured deposit expensive insure deposits, bank cost would decline theircurrently uninsured liability receive government guarantee. but different matter, andraises issue subsidy stark terms. i might add throughout 1990s, small banks’return equity well maintained. indeed, attractiveness bank evidence factthat 1,363 bank charter past decade, two-thirds since 1995, bank creditdemands begin intensify.some small bank argue need enhance deposit insurance coverage equalize theircompetition large bank depositor prefer put uninsured fund institutionconsidered big fail. a i noted, however, small bank hold themarket uninsured deposits. in addition, board reject notion bank big fail.in fdicia, congress make clear systemic-risk exception fdic’s least-cost resolutionof fail bank invoke unusual circumstances. moreover, theresolution rule systemic-risk exception require uninsured depositor othercreditors, much le stockholders, make whole. consistent view, market clearlybelieves large institution big uninsured creditor take least loss, withspreads subordinate debt large similar debt large highly rat nonbankfinancial institutions. indeed, aaa-rated u.s. bank organizations. bi review 68/20015another argument often raise small bank regard need increase deposit insurancecoverage inability match competition large security firm bank holdingcompanies multiple bank affiliates, offer multiple insure account one organization.while board belief offer misuse deposit insurance, raise coveragelimit account would also increase aggregate amount insurance coverage largemultibank organization would able offer, disparity would remain.conclusionthe board commend fdic review, analysis, recommendation reform thedeposit insurance system. there several aspect system need reform. the boardsupports, modifications, fdic’s recommendation except index current$100,000 ceiling. the thrust propose modification would call wide permissible range forthe size fund relative insure liabilities, reduce variation insurance premium therelative size fund change bank economic conditions, premium net ofrebates.there may come time board find household business modest resourcesare find difficulty place fund safe vehicle and/or reason concernedthat level deposit coverage could endanger financial stability. should either eventsoccur, board would call concern attention congress support adjustment tothe ceiling index methods.but today, judgment, neither financial stability, depositors, depository beingdisadvantaged current ceiling. raise ceiling would extend safety net, increase thegovernment subsidy banking, expand moral hazard, reduce incentive market discipline,without provide real public benefits. with clear public benefit increase deposit insurance,the board see reason increase scope safety net. indeed, board belief timehas come draw line expand government guarantees. bi review 67/20011lee hsien loong: credibility, confidence, dynamism: ma neweconomic financial landscapeaddress mr lee hsien loong, deputy prime minister singapore chairman

monetary policyspeech m eva srejber, second deputy governor sverige riksbank, färs & frostaspüarbank ab, lund, 25 september 2001.* * *firstly, i would like begin thank invitation come here. today i intend speakabout role bank system riksbank particular role monetary policy.the riksbank assign law task safeguard value money. we also havethe task promote safe efficient payment system. the bank play central role ofthese tasks. the objective monetary policy specify executive board cpiinflation rate 2 per cent, deviation interval plus/minus 1 percentage point. the instrument atour disposal achieve inflation target interest rate. of course also possibilityof use currency intervention mean achieve objectives, monetary policytool would normally use current monetary policy regime.i previous occasion discuss general term mechanism enable central bankto influence price trend economy. here i would like start briefly runningthrough channel assume monetary policy take effect. although believewe know channel are, little knowledge strength time-scaleinvolved. there clear empirical evidence monetary policy affect inflation time lagand certain efficacy, monetary policy effect difficult clarify.within riksbank's way thinking, consumer price influence primarily degree ofresource utilisation, import price inflation expectations. monetary policy assume havean effect factors, thereby inflation, many different channels. this know inthe academic world transmission mechanism. one usually talk monetary policy effectvia interest rate channel via exchange rate channel. this traditional description ofthe transmission mechanism.in addition, inflation expectation probably play prominent role price setting. and confidencein ability monetary policy meet price stability target extremely important. stable, lowinflation expectation effect company price behaviour wage formation. ifinflation expectation stable, consequence may degree resource utilisation theeconomy vary considerably without show impact inflation. in case, monetary policycan also influence, via credibility price stability target, exchange growth andinflation.one way maintain credibility support price stability target is, opinion, show ahigh level openness clarity regard conduct monetary policy. openness involves, forinstance, report consideration make regard prospect business climate,etc. make decision regard interest rates. however, also mean transparentwith regard source knowledge use basis decisions. clarity also oftenaimed create right condition analyst bank sector forecast monetarypolicy react various type new information. consistent symmetrical action regard tomonetary policy increase confidence price stability target, turn astabilising effect inflation expectations.my speech today see part endeavour achieve openness. in many cases, i willraise question answers. our ambition increase knowledge bystudying exist research stimulate others' research field.the bank important riksbank's tasksi move speak significance bank capacity maintain pricestability.the bank play important role enable monetary policy maintain price stability, number ofways. firstly, bank central capacity make payment economy generally. allactivity economy lead payment would possible maintain price stability 2bis review 80/2001without function payment system. it would lengthy go detail roleplay bank payment system connection riksbank's two tasks.but i would case like point financial stability necessary condition pricestability. secondly, bank participate riksbank's system large payments- rix system - practice affect interest rate company household meetwhen choose savings, investment consumption. thirdly, banks' credit grantingand lend rate play important role activity economy.thus, bank play important role interest rate channel. here i first describe theriksbank's steer interest rate work short interest rate interbank market.after i discus significance banks' credit granting.the riksbank steer short market ratethe fact central bank monopoly issue money usually state necessarycondition able determine price trend currency - e.g. calculate manygoods purchase particular sum money. it intuitively easy understand theamount money economy decisive factor price good produce thecountry. in modern economies, payment largely make electronically, monopoly onissuing banknote long equally evident condition enable monetary policy determineprice trends. today, instead right determine term system large electronicpayments bank opportunity influence much bank shall borrow ordeposit riksbank enable u steer interest rates. for electronic payment able tofunction money, necessary central bank perceive guarantor meansof payment way banknotes. this role fulfil central bank inthis way one say possibility determine price trend economy still lie themonopoly issue money.the riksbank govern short interest rate interbank market, normally remainsclose monetary policy-steered repo rate. the fact riksbank steer interbank rateis primarily due fact individual bank participate system handle largeinterbank payment - know rix system - always opportunity borrow depositmoney riksbank overnight lend deposit rate set riksbank. these lie at75 point 75 point repo rate respectively. the difference lendingand deposit rate sufficiently large bank normally view profitable balancedeficits surplus payment end day interbank market, rather thanutilising riksbank's lend deposit facilities. both bank surplus bank adeficit win deposit borrow bank rate riksbank's deposit andlending rates. the fact interbank rate normally lie centre corridor, i.e. close therepo rate riksbank usually offer bank opportunity borrow depositsufficient fund repo rate bank need utilise expensive alternativesoffered deposit lend facilities. the condition possibility theinterbank market exhausted.outstanding note coin item riksbank's balance sheet mean bankingsystem currently borrow riksbank. to avoid necessity convert large loanstock every day, riksbank every week offer bank possibility borrow via repurchasetransactions duration one week monetary policy-steered repo rate. in addition, throughwhat know fine-tune operations, riksbank normally offer bank system financingor investment deficit surplus arise daily payment flow banksand riksbank rate close repo rate. the riksbank us advertisement repo rateto provide signal regard monetary policy. the repo rate usually change themonetary policy meet hold executive board riksbank, mean rateremains 6-8 weeks. to summarise, therefore, interbank market rate steer thatit closely follow repo rate.the riksbank's steer interest rate – common many modern central bank -differs model describe macroeconomic textbooks. there start point oftenthat central bank affect volume money liquidity economy buy sellingbonds market. accord simple textbook model, bank maintain liquidity buff inthe central bank form deposit interest compensation - know reserves. when thecentral bank buy sell bond via banks, payment make banks' deposit bi review 80/20013accounts central bank– central bank thus steer size reserve bank haveinvested central bank. however, bank prepare buy sell amount bondsthe central bank desire - exchange money non-interest bear deposit account thecentral bank - interest rate must adapted. a low interest rate increase general public'sdemand mean payment lead increase banks' requirement liquiditybuffer, opposite occur interest rate rise. the textbook therefore assume thecentral bank affect interest rate influence banks' balance non-interest bear depositaccounts central bank.however, design steer interest rate system term payment system meanthat swedish bank need invest money reserve, i.e. liquidity buffer, deposit accountsat riksbank. the bank finance deficit payment flow arise day viainterest-free loan riksbank collateral securities. instead hold liquiditybuffer interest compensation, swedish bank hold liquidity buff form ofsecurities pledge riksbank – full yield. while cost banks' liquiditybuffer textbook model comprise nominal interest rate – alternative invest inassets provide interest- cost liquidity buff swedish system limit theinterest rate difference between, instance, treasury bond lending. the cost banks'payment service thus, else equal, low sweden country applysystems similar textbook one. we therefore say system cost-effective thanthe textbook's system.following tragic event usa week, central bank announce wereprepared supply liquidity avoid shortage liquidity market. during period unease thedemand risk-free investment normally rises. this lead investor demand highercompensation take credit risks. it also lead, consequence, increase interestrate interbank market. in extreme situations, access liquidity value highly thatbanks market participant prepare lend money price. a result thegreat uncertainty prevailing, daily lend market u dollar function poorly thedays follow terrorist attack, daily rate rise indication bank wereexperiencing difficulty obtain dollar all. give developments, federal reserveoffered u bank increase opportunity borrow dollar central bank. however, theeuropean bank also affected, therefore aim maintain dollar marketfunction, number central banks, include swedish riksbank, offer dollar facility themarket.in correspond manner, one imagine hypothetical situation one swedishbanks choose invest surplus kronor riksbank deposit rate rather lend themoney banks. those bank cannot find finance interbank market forcedto use riksbank's lend facility. firstly, loan riksbank expensive secondly,they require collateral. to avoid interbank rate rising, riksbank recourse number ofdifferent measures. in certain strain situations, previously choose increase supply ofloans monetary policy determine interest rate via normal operations. if bank shouldchoose invest surplus riksbank instead provide loan interbank market, whereloans normally offer without collateral, riksbank might choose offer correspondingcredit volume interbank market rate aim for. the condition bankborrowing riksbank offer eligible asset collateral. at start new millenniumwhen, might remember, great unease possible liquidity shortagearising, riksbank extend list eligible collateral. in system say mean thatwe increase liquidity bank system, measure increase possibility forborrowing riksbank. the extension list eligible asset riksbank accept ascollateral make permanent, mean liquidity swedish bankingsystem good.for swedish bank choose bear cost place large surplus deposit account theriksbank would assume lend money interbank market assess pooreralternative. one reason could fear bank want borrow would able torepay time, all. another reason could bank surplus unwilling, unablefor reason, provide loan require capital cover accordance capital adequacy rulesand therefore choose deposit money risk riksbank. normally, however, wouldbe little risk happen - firstly, swedish bank good solidity secondly sofew number good knowledge one another. 4bis review 80/2001the riksbank also opportunity - situation financial system face risk seriousdisruption - provide loan special term bank reason experience suchunexpectedly large deficit payment course day bank unable offersufficient already approve collateral borrow riksbank normal terms. however, thecondition bank consider riksbank sound. the riksbank crisisorganisation enable make rapid decision type situation.the banks' lend importantanother reason bank particularly interest monetary policy term lend fromthe bank play important role impact monetary policy interest rate changes. if theswedish bank reason reduce supply credit, company household cannot fullyreplace loss finance consumption investment elsewhere. small company areparticularly dependent swedish bank customer relation build up. largercorporations, hand, access source financing, borrow thebond market, foreign bank via new share issues.the banks' supply credit set interest rate therefore influence quickly andhow much monetary policy affect activity economy thus inflation. we begin statingthat repo rate one important determine factor bank decide lend rates.when lend rate determined, bank's internal rate crucial normallydetermined repo rate. this banks' finance deficit investment ofsurpluses arise end day normally do interbank market, pricingdepends repo rate. if bank lend money company, loan could finance theinterbank market. even loan long duration could principle finance short-termborrowing interbank market. the lend rate interbank market thus comprise thebank's finance cost loan therefore important factor bank decide thelending rate offer company. for loan long fix term, expectation thedevelopment repo rate duration loan affect finance cost thus thelending rate bank set long term loan. a bank surplus invest sameway choose invest interbank market lend money. the interbank rate willthus influence lend rate bank offer household company comprise analternative yield.in addition interbank rate, however, banks' lend rate determine many otherfactors. when set interest rates, bank must course compensate creditrisks connect loan time reserve fund capital meet anyfuture losses. the fact bank time time make differ assessment borrowers' creditrating affect much banks' lend rate change repo rate israised. the impact monetary policy not, therefore, change merely result bankschanging assessment credit risk.however, many theory indicate monetary policy affect banks' set interestrates channel go via interbank rate. one theory interestrates high level, percentage unreliable borrower increase – borrower awarethat able repay loan therefore insensitive high interest rates. tocompensate this, bank raise interest rate loan motivate themonetary policy steer rates, reduce amount credit supply.another theory suggest borrowers' creditworthiness via balance sheet affect bychanges interest rates. the idea company has, instance, high level debt, beless creditworthy interest rate rises. actually profitable investment project may thus get offthe grind company apply loan project already heavily debt andtherefore pay high credit risk premium, refuse loan.yet another theory indicate hike interest rate increase banks' finance cost whenthe general public's deposit decline. a large percentage finance thus obtain inthe bond market. the bank also assume case motive raise interest ratesmore central bank does.other mechanism certain situation reduce impact monetary policy normallevel include bank tighten credit standard - know credit crunch - theycannot increase credit risk exposure, example, result capital adequacy rules. bi review 80/20015following long period strong expansion credit, base lenders' expectation continuedgrowth high wealth levels, severe downturn economy fall asset price can, forinstance, lead bank limit lend due uncertainty quality existingloan stock. with hindsight, bank conclude probably misjudge credit risksearlier thus lend money interest rate low, well fail reserve sufficientfunds cover future losses. monetary policy relief situation le impact thanotherwise, bank prepare make loan even profitable investments.to summarise, good reason try learn affect monetary policy's impact,for instance, via banks, different situations. development financial market timeand difference various country indicate impact demand inflation aparticular monetary policy measure differ period countries. it difficultto estimate impact change interest rate growth inflation differ differentpoints time different countries, attempt indicate major differences. give thefact composition households' financial portfolios, method finance theiraccommodation, significance bank lend corporate investment formulation ofregulations tax differ substantially different period time different countries, thisis hardly surprising. a i point earlier, inflation expectation probably also play important rolein price setting. it therefore seem reasonable assume exchange interest ratesand inflation le country monetary policy aim stabilise inflationexpectations countries, point time, large fluctuation inflation rate.there also monetary policy interest familiar banks' method creditassessment, aid forward-looking assessment growth assumption unchangedmonetary policy. when riksbank make decision formulation monetary policy, arebased on, instance, assessment household company react rise price onshares property. one important condition enable optimism regard future growth andincrease wealth convert consumption investment financed. thisis banks' assessment credit risk come in. the extent bank preparedto mortgage share property minor significance. if bank manage capture risksconnected fluctuation asset price credit risk management, reduce likelihoodof fluctuation also reflect variation production employment.i mainly devote speech today role bank play monetary policy. nevertheless,from i say become clear many, close link riksbank's twotasks – promote price stability promote financial stability. this area analysis weare endeavour develop riksbank. however, i shall return anothertime. bi review 79/20011einars repse: link central bank financial market theestablishment financial capital market commission latviaspeech mr einars repse, governor bank latvia,

statutory body include public sector banks, certain regulatoryconstraints. for instance, reason legality reputational risk, regulator cannot cancela licence, say public sector bank, even fail meet capital adequacy norms. the recourseopen regulator case owner’s unwillingness inject capital meet capital adequacystandards unclear often lead regulatory forbearance. second, case uti anddevelopment financial institutions, legal basis jurisdiction regulator somewhat ill-defined.thirdly, government tend closely involve operation many institutions' andoverlapping accountability plausible. fourthly, long institution function withoutreference sound principle corporate governance though consistent individual statutes,inherent weakness persist. in fact, disinvestment consequently someshares hold

australia, university oftasmania/economic society australia (tasmanian branch), hobart, 18 september 2001.* * *let start thank university tasmania invite give lecture, whichcommemorates one australia’s truly remarkable men. my choice topic tonight make longbefore tragic event unite state last week. before move main body myspeech, comment order recent events.the first order business central bank time ensure financialmarkets payment system operate effectively. this accomplished. the federalreserve open u payment system operate day attack. central banksaround world operate assure market participant would ample liquidity. we herein australia likewise, add substantial additional fund cash market, arecontinuing ensure additional liquidity available required.assessing last economic impact event take longer. much hinge, obviously, onthe extent investor consumer unite state respond tragedy scalingback activity plans. that almost impossible predict. in unite states, whereeconomic condition deteriorate confidence wan prior attack, federalreserve bring forward ease monetary policy. some country already directlyaffected u weakness (canada), see unexpected weakness (continentaleurope) likewise ease monetary policy. these move help, course, toaddress risk global growth already exist — yet almost impossible toassess — may result reaction attack themselves.i know speculate whether australia might join action today, easingfurther already expansionary set monetary policy currently place. we have, usual,closely monitor event abroad home continuous basis. we good economicdata australia lately observe unite state europe. the weakness globalconditions short term affect australia, say statement announce ease ofpolicy two week ago. but seen, past week, anything relate australianmonetary policy’s field operation urgent warrant suspension normaltimetable deliberative process board.with said, let return main body speech.sometimes require effort find complimentary remark usually preface lecture suchas this. but case giblin. while remember principally economist, didnot take call full-time basis 47 year old, time alreadydone much areas.1 after graduate cambridge, time play rugby forengland, spend time prospect gold canada, become merchant seaman, aplantation manager solomon islands, orchardist tasmania, member tasmanianparliament, decorate bravery world war i. a economist, make contribution ina number area close association central bank membership theboard commonwealth bank. but another aspect extraordinarily gift man iwould like commemorate tonight – willingness communicate difficult economic idea thebroader public.giblin write series article 1930 call letter john smith 2 set economicissues face australia start depression. this series face economic issue head on, butdid talk readers. i try follow example evening. what i intend toanswer three question sometimes put member public, rather regularparticipants monetary policy debates. because question “lay” people, mayappear naive professional audience, i often find blunt untutored question hardestto answer, often force re-examination previously unquestioned assumptions. they 1see copland (1960).2ibid. 2bis review 77/2001can also open interest historical academic issues. i also add choice oftopic tonight prompt current economic events, outcome reflectionsgoing back decade two.the three question following:1. why reserve bank change interest rate all: can’t leftconstant?2. why reserve bank involve first place: can’t thedetermination interest rate leave market?3. why need set interest rate australia: can’t accept ratesof another country, e.g. unite states?obviously three question come quite different perspectives, people ask themare make different assumption alternative system set interest ratesshould work. but is, i think, common thread connect them. that view wouldbe desirable take away element discretion interest rate setting, whether make themconstant, "leaving market" sense, cede discretion another country. inother words, question arise certain scepticism whether interest rate set reallyrequires active decision make role central bank.one preliminary point deal go substance issue meanby "the interest rate". there are, fact, many interest rate – short-term, long-term, private,government, loan securities, etc. – one mean? in discussion, makesmost sense focus short-term interbank rate typically set central bank – inaustralia, overnight cash rate (usually refer cash rate). the rest ratestructure think key current expect cash rates, cash rate isthe main driver movement interest rate borrower actually pay. so question theappropriate system interest rate set context really amount, essence, question abouthow cash rate determined.let turn three question i outlined.question 1: why interest rate vary?a lot people unhappy change interest rates. when rate rise, always lot ofcomplaints medium draw attention plight people mortgages. when rate fall, themedia usually treat good news, i get lot letter retiree take oppositeview. one solution would instruct open market desk reserve bank operate waywhich keep interest rate current level indefinitely. why would wish this?there two answer question: one historical, theoretical.the historical approach ask whether ever monetary system involvevariations interest rates. the answer no. interest rate always move allthe monetary regime existed, whether regime gold standard, currency board, anormal fix exchange rate, monetary target, inflation target, regime pure discretion thecentral bank. if someone think example successful monetary system interestrates never change, i would interest hear it.but people instinctively appreciate point, are, doubt, would liketo know would wrong try hold interest rate permanently fixed, even notbeen do before. this bring second part answer, base economics: fixedinterest rate policy would unsustainable would inevitably lead either inflationary os deflationary spiral.this conclusion well establish theoretical literature,3 require greatfamiliarity monetary theory appreciate arrive at. suppose, example, centralbank attempt set interest rate low level impart strong stimulus demand 3the technical way describe weakness permanently fix interest rate say unstable rulebecause lead indeterminacy price level. this point appreciate least far back henry thornton(1802) analyse inflationary consequence fix interest rate policy favour bank england. bi review 77/20013activity. over time, maintained, would cause inflation rise, and, fix nominalinterest rate, real interest rate would decline, thus lead increase demand andinflation. this process would continue successive round result inflationary spiral.by similar logic, initial level interest rate set high, self-reinforcing process inthe opposite direction would ensue, culminate deflationary spiral rise unemployment. onlyif interest rate could set exact equilibrium point would two extreme avoided,and, even then, equilibrium would temporary. any economic event push economyslightly away equilibrium would set one two self-reinforcing process i justdescribed. one response line argument might suggest central bank try tostabilise real rather nominal interest rate, already concede main point: thatthe nominal rate adjust response information current prospective inflation.having make point, i concede many people would advocate thatinterest rate literally keep permanently fixed. but subtle version thisviewpoint much widely held: view policy always aim keepinterest rate stable possible. express way, idea sound reasonable, ithink fair say pervade commentary follow interest rate adjustment –the idea change interest rate (and especially increases) avoid possible. weneed clear incorrect view, reason i outlined. if policy wereto give great weight stabilise interest rates, end itself, would risk destabilise theeconomy, would fail keep inflationary deflationary pressure emerge.of course, would also fallacy jump opposite conclusion, interest ratevariation always better. obviously, policy make large hastily-decided change ininterest rate would also destabilise force, recognise interest rate bemoved much well little. how much variation, then, right amount?this sort question open precise quantitative answer, certainly possibleto give general principles.• first, depend size shock economy experiences. big interest rateadjustments probably need big shock responding.when shock imbalance small, interest rate need move much• second, depend responsive economy give change interest rates.arguably 1970s 1980s, inflation high variable, economy wasless responsive give change interest rate subsequently. hence,larger change interest rate need achieve give effect. since early1990s, interest rate change generally much small early period.• third, depend much uncertainty is. when sure yourreading economy likely effect change interest rates, may bepossible move rate quickly response important piece information. butwhen highly uncertain interpret events, pay cautious andgradual approach. to use analogy drive — slow fog.it follow "right" amount movement interest rate depend much thecircumstances. sometimes rate highly variable, 1980s, sometimesthey quite stable, recent decade. in this, interest ratestability see goal itself, by-product stable macro-economicenvironment.let turn second three questions.question 2: why leave interest rate market?this question, again, base plausible-sounding premise, proponent view areoften rather unclear "leaving market" would really mean operational sense. itmight mean several things.4 4one possible meaning, discuss here, open market operation direct actively tocontrolling growth money base thereby let interest rate determine residual. since suggestioninvolves active intervention central bank, hardly keep "leave market" approach. for 4bis review 77/2001in simple form, leave interest rate market would mean simply tell reserve bank tocease open market operations. it worth explore would consequence apolicy.in world reserve bank undertake open market operations, amount cashthat underpin money market (exchange settlement funds, academic call "high-powered money") would depend government’s fiscal balance, hard see thiswould likely result monetary instability. any government deficit finance exactlycoincident issue debt public, example, would mean rise cash fall interestrates. similarly, surplus exactly match debt retirement would lead shrinkage theamount cash escalation interest rates. in cases, would much short-runvolatility interest rate exist present. this day-to-day fluctuation thegovernment’s position, quite large, would long smooth reserve bankopen market operations.a point add even maintain balance fiscal position daily basis wouldnot ensure effect would avoided. even fiscal position balance, system couldbe destabilise change public’s demand currency. because public’s demand forcurrency expand growth economy, could accommodate regime bysome source cash provide rba open market operations. fail this, wouldbe continue upward pressure interest rate economic contraction.i spell detail proponent "leave market" view often donot clear idea position really means. but mean simply cease reservebank operations, leave interest rate market sense, clear asystem would workable. it would recipe interest rate volatility, less.5to fair say rate leave market, moresophisticated view. they would argue i make two assumption could easily changed.first, government bank central bank, fiscal position would affecthigh-powered money. and second, central bank issue bank notes, bank note wereinstead issue commercial banks, would involve central bank provide cashto system. these change would eliminate central bank picture entirely, bring usto world "free banking" beloved small group academics.among supporter free bank ideal, least two school think asystem work. one view money ultimately link commodity gold,so bank note issue commercial bank would essentially "gold certificates" redeemable ingold demand. therefore, supply gold would act discipline over-issue notesand system would ensure interest rate determine supply demand funds.while example resemble outline exist early bank system australia before1910, eventually give way conventional system base around centralbank.6 the reason "free" bank system find prone instability without acentral bank manage liquidity provide last-resort fund crisis. bank system tie acommodity standard simply flexible enough cope periodic bank run liquiditycrises. no doubt, true believer free bank would argue theory never properlytried, that, were, market would find solution apparent problems. but makethe theory unassailable pure assumption.the school think free bank even radical one.7 it propose system ofcompeting private currency would link standard value. the banksoperating system would compete one another offer sound currency term would like introduce money base targeting, see macfarlane (1984 1989) goodhart (1995) contraryview.5another interpretation "leaving market" could mean reserve bank move cash rate towhere market expect be. this could mean, example, move cash rate 90-day rate currently is.the problem approach current level 90-day rate mainly reflection market expectsthe reserve bank set cash rate 90 day hence. the process become completely circular.6see pope (1989) discussion "free banking" australia prior 1910. the commonly cite case free bankingis 18th century scottish bank system (see white, 1984). note, however, writer goodhart (1988)express scepticism true case "free banking".7the best know proponent view hayek (1976). bi review 77/20015were attractive public. in effect, country operate system would depend uponcompetition commercial bank ensure stability financial system low inflation.to mind, free-banking proposal really belong world technical curiosities. they canbe argue work theory, fact work example systemanywhere modern world. so i conclude say interest rate leftto market propose something either workable (if mean simply shut downcentral bank operations) something much radical people would preparedto accept.this bring third question.question 3: why accept u interest rates?the premise behind question could away discretionary role reservebank rule interest rate would always equal set u fed. my firstcomment hard see anyone would see particularly attractive goal. itcertainly would away central bank discretion, replace discretion one centralbank another. and would discretion tailor meet u conditions, policyrequirements australia.but leave aside question whether would desirable, main question i want focus onis: feasible? the answer is, depend done. if mechanism achieve equalinterest rate unite state adopt u dollar, establish fix exchangerate, technically achievable. interest rate convergence would by-product offixing currency u dollar, and, credible exchange rate peg, closelyour interest rate would shadow unite states. that interest rate convergencewas achieve within europe, though process prove extremely difficult argentina. so ifthe people ask u adopt u interest rate really argue change exchange rateregime, dispute could probably technically done. but really differentdebate one set interest rates.if, hand, someone argue adopt u interest rate exist exchangerate regime, i would say strategy would workable. the reason arequite similar i outline early question 1.suppose begin regime position equilibrium, australia unite stateshad inflation rate imbalance tend push exchange rate onedirection other. in conditions, could expect level interest rate twocountries same. but establish rule australian interest rate would alwaysbe equal unite states, system would extremely vulnerable event thataffected relative performance two economies. for example, contractionaryforces operate australia, unite states, level interest rate would able torespond, result would downturn australian economy, extremis, deflation. anexpansionary shock would likewise destabilise economy direction. the strategy couldonly maintain if, fluke, economic condition two country remain perfectlysynchronised.having make point, interest note interest rate australia unite stateshave time move quite closely together recent years. there nothing wrong that. we justneed clear occurs, result two country experience similar economicconditions, something set end itself.conclusionin history monetary economics shortage proposal make systemautomatic, thereby eliminate need central bank involve set interest rates. ihave look three simple proposal sort, try show would viable orwould different consequence imagine proponents. in modernmonetary system, possible interest rate automatic pilot, discretionary rolefor central bank set interest rate cannot sensibly avoided. 6bis review 77/2001all long way say decision-making process work: theobjectives process governed. i give view matter publicon many occasions, number colleagues, i go grind againtonight. here, i would note important modern advance ensure decision-making take place within framework well-defined objective clear accountability. this isindeed one strength inflation target regime adopt manycountries past decade. they recognise need decision-maker, interest ratescan adjust response unfold events, also place process within framework ofclear objective accountability.bibliographycopland, douglas b.

whereas natural toput money normal save account, long case. today, increasingly largeshare save invest various security rapid expansion mutual fundmarket important part development. one need look swedish mutual fundassociation's report mutual fund investment sweden realise this. the statistic show thatnew mutual fund investment increase gradually 1990s. in 1994 net investment inmutual fund

problems. this criticism cannot becompletely dismissed, i feel often fully take account importance thefinancial sector economic development. in addition, critic often speak sector thoughit play productive role, le disengage rest society. this notthe case. the financial sector much integrate part society. we participate ourselveswhen we, instance, choose different pension funds, withdraw money anatm, pay bill borrow money buy house apartment. to begin with, therefore, ishall briefly discus fundamental task carry financial sector society. when weeconomists try mediate knowledge field, usually talk three task roles, namelymediating payments, channel money want save want invest, andfacilitating management economic risk.easier payment investmentsthe financial sector mediator payment possibly role sector's significance forsociety easy understand. try imagine economy without type payment systemoffered by, instance, postal giro bank giro. in world like would need carry largeamounts

play important part financial system's role. this concernsconverting save investments. without financial market investment would befinanced actual investor, whether question buy house start

many project would nototherwise see light day. however, financial sector merely make possible todistinguish decisions; also make possible solve conflict interest thatoften prevail saver investor. a saver often want able get moneyback quickly need arises. an investor, hand, normally need money overa long period time, usually take investment pay off. the financial sectoroffers two possible solution conflict interests. the investor either turn bank, whichcan convert save long-term lending, investor issue security directly onto themarket. in cases, saver normally regain money relatively short notice. in firstcase, money withdraw bank work painlessly, unless savershave idea time. in second case, security sell secondarymarket. without possibility quickly realise savings, would much le

ofeconomic risks. a i mention earlier, swedish saver already realise importance notinvesting save place. when one distribute one's save across number offunds different allocation, instance various industrial sectors, le risk, one wouldnot suffer great loss one fund show poor development. however, financialmarkets also offer opportunity risk management. it possible pay someone else takeover financial risk. this do aid various type derivative. for example, inexport deal unusual payment make time good beendelivered. to avoid negative effect change exchange rate, exporter enter afutures contract establish rate future income exchange theexporter's currency. these opportunity risk management crucial economic importance.without them, many economic project would perceive risky would never realised.and would lead slow development economy.deregulation rapid development technology finance make possible transferthese role international stage much large scale before. thus, financial markets'capacity contribute increase global growth strengthened. country import capitalcan increase rate investment gain access modern technology, countriesexporting capital obtain high yield it. many people claim context thatcompanies countries, recently deregulate capital markets, tendency totake loan manage. this appear case. on contrary,empirical research indicate non-financial company access international capitalmarket increase borrowing, equity increase rate. it also appear thesecompanies increase duration loans. in perspective, difficult imagine riskof take excessively large loan increase result deregulation. the various type fundsmanaged many make contribution this, supply share capital company othercountries. bi review 75/20013economic policy content crucial significanceallow return criticism development financial markets. a i said, cannot bedismissed hand. it evident problem way market function.one look mexico crisis 1995 asia crisis 1997-98 see that. it is,however, important remember origin crisis lay domestic problem thosecountries hard hit. in asia, case sweden end 1980s, thecountries develop financial vulnerability rapid credit expansion, over-investment certainsectors, grossly inflate asset price short-term borrow abroad. this borrow turnchannelled via domestic bank project long-term funding. when foreign domesticinvestors begin show concern uncertainty regard growth potential countries,the course event move rapidly. this development show misdirect economic policy cansoon devastate consequence country. however, instead focus content ofthe economic policy, many critic single open capital market culprits. some thesecritics therefore consider capital control good mean avoid future crises. yet theexperiences 1970s 1980s show control cannot counteract effect aninadequate domestic economic policy long term. sooner late necessary adapt theexchange rate. it also doubtful whether capital control contribute increasingmonetary policy independence decades, one argument put forward favourof controls. in practice, probably case argument keep control wereoften use postpone necessary macroeconomic adaptation structural reforms.nevertheless, financial deregulation create opportunity increase welfare, importantnot ignore problem financial system. over years, authority organisation havetried minimise produce various international standard codes, continue todebate need do prevent far possible emergence spread anynew financial crises. i shall go work great depth here. instead, i discus somefactors could contribute strengthen movement financial market unhealthymanner, need find solution improve function markets. thesefactors also directly connect mutual fund investment.short-term evaluation “follow leader” behaviourthe first thing come mind way many operation financial market areevaluated. all often focus short-term result. this apply particular evaluationof various security funds. although many manage long-term save people intend liveon retirement, nevertheless evaluate result achieve pastyear, past month even past days. we see newspaper headlinesdeclaring winner loser mutual fund investment. medium coverage development thefinancial market certainly play important role transparency markets, focuson short-term result create vicious circle investor company constantlychasing best possible result short term, despite fact good long-termstrategy. such behaviour reinforce financial crises; instance, fund manager beinggiven scope wait crisis abated, could rational long-term perspective.many player financial market also appear govern “follow leader” principle.there probably avoid go way risk make badinvestments depict losers. it seem simple follow others, thing gowrong, least player one disgrace. the reward structure fundmanagement field probably also reinforce behaviour. a long person do worsejob average among competitors, look forward bonus. it would probably abetter idea personal

doubtless case player thefinancial markets, include mutual fund investment companies, live complicate world. in thisworld rational large player hope good informed.however, always case, mean strategy follow big player couldcontribute worsen financial crises. when everyone rush door time, isoften crush. and crush, easy panic. 4bis review 75/2001the broad use statistical risk model similar effect. it is, course, good thing userisk model aid conclude enable great progress managementof financial risks. however, evident problem here. when increase number playersare use models, also likely react

create national bankruptcy regulationsenabling business liquidate orderly manner. for reason, must assume thatfinancial crisis emerge even future. on hand, must course toavoid crisis spread unnecessarily. i also like stress i believe thatdifferent type tax aim reduce turnover market practicable route forward.they would probably result reinforcement fluctuations, activity - thus liquidity - onthe market would decline. a representative central bank, i would also like point nordo i believe monetary policy alone counteract exaggerate movement financialmarkets. on hand, clear monetary policy, aim price stability, necessary workon maintain financial stability. it facilitate economic decision-making society.however, part solution must lie break pattern cause player behave exactlythe way one another. increase transparency regard countries' companies'economic status important step right direction here. development technology havedemolished many barrier previously hamper spread type

create powerful instrument, use counteract 'follow leader'behaviour. when information long exclusive, become easy form opinion one's ownwith regard development risks, merely follow others belief

theseuncertainties great clarity criterion official lend crisis resolutionpolicies – theme i return below. if successful, one outcome reform would lowerborrowing cost emerge markets.investors also start differentiate among borrow country clearly before. thishas lead great dispersion spread emerge market debt. before russian crisis thesespreads tightly compress central 50% distribution emerge

correlation might rise significantly, focus attention recent crisesand cause lead investor appreciate many country-specific. although thereis room complacency, low correlation spread great differentiation riskassessments represent increase efficiency way capital market operate.the experience recent crisis prompt two questions. first, country protectthemselves risk financial crises? second, responsibility theinternational community towards emerge market economies? 4bis review 71/2001a new partnershipin describe new partnership emerge market economy develop economies, isuseful distinguish measure improve economic performance prevent financialcrises, one hand, way resolve crisis occurred, other. in thissection i deal former. crisis prevention heart policy bothemerging market international financial institutions.in term prevention, recent experience suggest five lesson future.1. first, important borrow countries, especially without track record ofinternational borrowing, monitor manage maturity currency composition theirnational balance sheet. this trivial matter. most country inadequateinformation composition external liabilities, especially privatesector. nevertheless, monitor manage exposure public financialsectors important avoid build potential vulnerabilities. in respect, imfcan play helpful supportive role provide assessment vulnerability part thearticle iv process, new joint imf/world bank financial sector assessment programmesand debt management guidelines, technical assistance data requirement impliedby need monitor national balance sheets.2. second, limitation official finance mean country think carefully theprovision self-insurance liquidity crisis. a simple, often expensive, way dothis build large foreign currency reserves, strategy take heart number ofemerging markets, include china also korea follow crisis. a potentially superioralternative creation contingent credit facility official private sectorcreditors. so far, even high spread emerge market debt, facility notproved attractive, ccl facility create imf lie dormant. the next fewyears test value facilities.3. third, experience show value borrow country establish goodrelationships creditor well possibility difficulty repayment arises. thecreation investor relation programme regular brief creditor aboutdevelopments economic policy play role provide information themarket require ass riskiness sovereign loans. it never early build arelationship actual potential creditors. the imf, collaboration privatesector, recently draw set guideline country might usefully follow whensetting investor relation programme. the second aspect relationship withcreditors insertion collective action clause sovereign debt contracts. thisproposal, advance originally g10 deputies' report 1996, gradually becomeaccepted sensible step forward. the uk introduce collective action clause itsforeign currency debt instruments. and last month, g7 finance minister agree onthe importance introduce collective action clause debt contract facilitate crisismanagement. again, time may side reform.4. fourth, long run, best way avoid problem liquidity crisis thecomposition capital flow emerge market move away debt, bank andbond, finance towards portfolio equity direct investment. shock borrowingcountry would take form fall equity prices, liquidity run associate riskof financial crisis need external finance. encouragingly, pattern capitalflows emerge market already evolve direction. bank lend representedaround 80% capital flow emerge market 1970s. but end the1990s, fdi account around 80% emerge market capital flows, portfolio equityaccounting much remainder. a ken rogoff, new economic counsellor theimf, point 1999 still several bias towards debt rather equity financein capital flow emerge markets. one deposit insurance creditor anddebtor country make difficult authority avoid see asproviding implicit support international loan domestic banks. there easyanswer problem, share concern borrow lend country theimplicit insurance side give large part financial system. themoral hazard create restrict international lending, affect theincentives form investment emerge markets. we need also guard againstinstitutional regulatory mechanism – international domestic – favour bi review 71/20015short-term longer-maturity capital flows. in long run, solution emergingmarkets create legal structure stable economic policy environment provide theconfidence support inward equity investment economies.5. finally, great transparency allow good inform decision borrower andlenders, reduce risk contagion allow market differentiate amongborrowers. much said, and, importantly, achieve area transparencyin recent years. there explosion code standard different aspect ofeconomic financial policy recent years. so much so, country claimingthat process need slow down. it certainly important recognise theappropriate code standard country one stage economic development maynot appropriate country stages. i say advisedly "may", eachindividual case argument made. but accept code standardsare likely reflect different stage development, even important thatcountries make clear code standard actually adhering. that whycountries able opt "transparency transparency". follow theproduction pilot transparency report number countries, include uk andargentina, imf make rapid progress produce report observance ofstandards code (roscs). a april 2001, 110 rosc module completedfor 43 countries, 76 publish cover 31 countries. india recentlyhad rosc

numberof emerge market pay term good relation creditors. ultimately, mostsuccessful route enhance influence emerge market development standard andcodes strengthen role imf world bank, twin institution claimlegitimacy membership 183 countries. under british chairmanship, effort beenmade increase effectiveness meet imfc represent country aroundone table.private finance public fundsthe second main area progress require resolution crises. the problemwould easy solve possible distinguish two rather different source ofcrises – liquidity-based problem cause currency maturity mismatch country's nationalbalance sheet despite sustainable macroeconomic debt position; fundamentals-basedproblem mean debt burden unsustainable exchange rate keymacroeconomic policy need altered. in former case, provision liquidity support theinternational community might help bridge position country could re-engage itsprivate creditors. in latter case, main requirement liquidity support change inmacroeconomic debt management policies. recent crisis see example type ofproblem.liquidity run typically occur co-ordination failure among creditors. there twosolutions co-ordination problem. the first lender last resort able provide liquiditysupport quickly large – indeed, potentially unlimited – scale short period enable theaffected country meet obligations. such loan would normally short-lived, bemade available above-market interest rate sort finance see last first 6bis review 71/2001resort. the second solution co-ordination problem borrower impose temporarysuspension payment create "time out" borrower negotiate directly withthe creditors, arrange new profile repayment debt. both approaches, understand andimplemented consistently time, provide efficient solution co-ordination problem andeliminate incentive liquidity run.but, ken rogoff point 1999, lender last resort approach carry risk ofintroducing significant moral hazard loan market. if lender believe sovereign borrowersare likely bail out, incentive ass riskiness loan diminish.equally, borrow country find attractive claim measure necessary tocontinue service debt "politically impossible" believe internationaldeep pocket will extend loan defer moment national balance constraint isbinding.there two good reason imf able play role international lender lastresort, least foreseeable future. first, moral hazard create lender andborrowers cannot simply assume away. it easy quantify, noteworthy thenumber sovereign default decline quite sharply 1990s. if sovereign risk ismis-priced private capital markets, sow seed future crises. the increase provision ofofficial finance would proceed hand-in-hand increase incidence crises.second, effective, lender last resort must ability extend sufficient resource thatthe market doubt whatsoever ability provide whatever take deal theimmediate crisis. the imf position. there political commitment provide imfwith unlimited funds. a finance minister central bank governor represent imfmember country say communiqué imfc last september prague: "the committeenotes fund resource limit extraordinary access exceptional …".in practice, however, exceptional access often norm recent years. normalaccess typically define 300% imf quota. during asian crisis, korea's programme wasalmost 2000% quota thailand's 500%. more recently, turkey's programme over1500% quota argentina's 500%. if creditor debtor continue believe exceptionalaccess readily available, international credit over-extended incidence crisiswill increase.one reaction extremely large package – "bailouts" – accompany moral hazard issimply say official sector part play essentially privateinternational capital market. official lend small relative private capital flows. over lastthree years, private flow around 7.5 time great official flows, accord iif data.against backdrop, argue imf abolished. this would throwout baby bath water.what need "middle way" full imf insurance insurance all. this middle waywould comprise imf lend within strong presumptive limits. a key principle underlie thisapproach international community need set clearly possible criterion willgovern size scope imf lending. since agree limit imf lending, thereis merit explain limit potential borrow country private creditors. thiswould enable debtor country good plan policies. it would also allow creditor ass riskmore accurately. indeed, put controversially, sovereign risk accurately assessedwithout clarity fund's role? a lack clarity likely response internationalcommunity potential crisis recipe inaccurate assessment risk. such uncertainty wouldadd (already high) cost borrow emerge markets.so far, "middle way" seem statement obvious – namely limit imflending merit, debtor creditors, clarity limits. the otherside coin that, occasions, country run unsustainable debtburdens, face severe liquidity pressures, little alternative restructure orreschedule debt. perhaps international community move significantly thedirection give "private sector involvement" great role resolution financial crisis thanwas typically case late 1990s. the imf communiqué prague last year, g7 financeministers statement last month, recent joint work bank england bank canada, and,significantly, speech new manage director imf, horst kohler, emphasisedthe need move direction great private sector involvement. a one example thereport g7 finance minister head state government last month state that, bi review 71/20017"while imf essential role play, official resource limit relation private financialflows. the engagement private investor thus essential resolution payment imbalancesin crises… official sector need avoid create expectation private creditor investorswill protect loss official resource would use finance large, sustain capitaloutflows. … we underscore need progress".the opponent approach raise two important questions. first, possible define limit onimf lending? second, acceptable official sector countenance default sovereignborrower consequence country international financial system could bedevastating? i shall try provide answer questions.it true recent crisis result development capital account rather thecurrent account. a capital flow grown, potential demand officialcommunity attempt fill capital account finance gaps. that many moreprogrammes involve "exceptional" access relation quota. so perhaps, world capitalaccount crises, exceptional access become norm?this argument superficially quite attractive. but implication need assess carefully. itwould mean imf resource would need increase line private capital flow even theimf maintain current role. and since 1970, capital flow grow around four time fast asworld incomes. the share world gdp devote resourcing imf would grow rapidly time.in fact, private capital market come understand this, scale private capital flow couldincrease even great extent. private creditor debtor would accumulate ever largerbilateral debts, safe knowledge multilateral insurance mechanism. the logical end point ofthis game international community would lock provide ever increase sum ofmoney country difficulty – short, international lender last resort would create bystealth. there evidence anyone wish go route.to guard this, crucial clear presumption scale "normal"access. that scale may well high case world current account crises. and theapproach define limit term multiple quota may unsatisfactory size ofquotas case need revisited. but argument principle ofpresumptive limits; case either reconsider quota or, practical vein, relatingaccess finance metric.the key limit lend strict rule strong presumptions. these presumption thenprovide backstop debtor-creditor negotiation help condition expectation financialmarkets. exceptional lend presumptive limit would possible order, provideoperational flexibility extreme case – example, threaten systemic stability. that whythe framework one presumptive limit rather strict rules. but grant exceptional accessshould require much great ex ante justification ex post accountability. for example, exceptionalaccess programme automatically refer new independent evaluation office theimf. this would raise hurdle grant exceptional access provide great clarity debtorsand creditor support country could expect official community.the logical consequence limit official finance inevitably time areprofiling sovereign debt may necessary countries. some argue sovereigndebt restructure default potentially disastrous contemplate, country indeed forthe world economy. the russian default 1998, disruption world market followedfrom it, often cite evidence prosecution.more careful analysis suggest two rather different conclusion russian experience. first, therussian default disruptive part come surprise market participants. privatecreditors plan one assumption – exceptional imf financing, "moral hazard" play itwas label market – surprise comfort blanket removed. greaterclarity strong presumption size form fund finance would reduce thesurprise accompany contagion. expectation debtor creditor would beenconditioned ex ante severity crisis thereby reduce ex post.second, russian experience illustrate importance orderly default mechanism inplace. in assess cost default, maxim be: "it's way thatyou it". in russia, default way it. the default wasdisorderly – neither efficient, equitable, expeditious. and contribute importantly thedisruption russia widely. but default need like that. there dead weight cost 8bis review 71/2001disorderly default. so lump-sum gain – debtor creditor – orderlymechanisms place.this official sector role play. a key principle crisis resolution framework isthat decision sovereign's debt responsibility borrow country, consultation withits private sector creditors. neither imf group country tell country torestructure debt. there range option open debtor deal creditor attimes crisis. country good track record repayment long stand relationship withtheir creditor may able borrow international market. others, face severeliquidity pressures, may seek undertake voluntary reschedule rollover debt bringingtogether major creditors, case korea brazil. those facingunsustainable debt position may seek negotiate market-based write-down debt, theca ukraine, pakistan ecuador. and yet another set cases, country may find itnecessary impose temporary timeout payment creditors, give somebreathing space address macroeconomic co-ordination problems. the decision exercise anyof option must rest debtor country.the role official sector ensure full menu finance option make know andavailable debtor, chooses. this menu include easy options– raise new private sector money – well hard one – suspendingpayments. each option backstopped limit imf lending, "pure bail-out"option heavily circumscribed. indeed, backstop help provide incentive forcreditors debtor seek alternative, market-based solution sooner.the imf stand ready assist countries, whichever option debtor choose toexercise, provide appropriate prior condition satisfied. for example, country facingsevere liquidity pressure decide suspend payment temporarily, imf will tosupport decision remedial policy measure put place. this support could take formof bridge finance – so-called imf lending-into-arrears. the pre-conditions lending-into-arrearscould design ensure payment suspension handle orderlyfashion – example, time-limited equitable, debtor negotiate goodfaith. this would reduce uncertainty part debtor creditor end gamewould play out, thereby reduce borrow costs.these set procedure represent evolution in, rather revolution of, international financialarchitecture. they ensure official sector's action clear, consistent andaccountable, contribute effectively resolution financial crises. these proceduresare fully consistent principle private sector involvement outline imfc communiquélast september recently g7 finance minister last month. the framework set outhere attempt begin add operational colour overarch principles.to sum up, borrow country private sector creditor must expect that, except inexceptional case systemic concern, limit official finance mean alonewill responsible deal resolution problem concern debt repayment. standstillsand debt restructure one many option open negotiation debtor andcreditors. the imf attempt impose solution borrow countries. it willingto lend arrears circumstance country choose route standstill itsassociated conditions. but create expectation

most importantly, look forward toengaging constructive dialogue commission staff assist inmodifying substance rule manner give effect congress' intent anddoes disrupt traditional customer relationship

useful.history bank exception bank security activitiesin 1934, congress first adopt federal scheme require entity act securitiesbrokers dealer register sec. the security exchange act 1934, however,specifically exempt bank definition "broker" "dealer" and, accordingly, notrequire bank provide security service customer register sec broker-dealers. although ability bank underwrite, deal in, purchase security limit theglass-steagall act 1933, bank continue ability buy sell security theaccount customer buy sell security account specificallyauthorized law. the congress recognize permissible security activity alreadysupervised examine appropriate federal state bank authority subjectingthese activity additional layer regulation necessary appropriate. in fact, one theprimary purpose security exchange act 1934 subject nonbank stockbroker andsecurities trader type government supervision examination already appliedunder bank law banks.long 1934 since, bank offer customer security service variety ofcircumstances connection bank activities. for example, bank long buy 2bis review 70/2001sold security trust fiduciary customers. these service essential part trustand fiduciary operation banks-operations long consider core bank function.banks discretionary investment authority trust fiduciary account purchase sellsecurities account ensure account properly diversify manage themanner require govern trust agreement applicable fiduciary principles. bank alsoprovide investment advice concern securities, real estate, asset non-discretionaryfiduciary accounts, long

trust rat system. these rat base evaluation of, amongother things, capability management; adequacy bank's operations, controls, andaudits; bank's compliance applicable law, fiduciary principle document governingthe account; management fiduciary assets.glb actit context exist regulatory framework congress, consideration ofthe glb act, review blanket exception bank definition "broker" "dealer" inthe security exchange act. this review blanket exception undertake becauseabuses concern exist concern traditional security activity banks. in fact, banksgenerally conduct security activity responsibly accordance bank-regulatoryrequirements applicable law, include antifraud provision federal security laws.rather, review bank exception undertake address concern that, blanketexception bank

intend ensure bank could continue toprovide customer most, all, service traditionally receive frombanks. for example, statutory exception permit banks, subject certain conditions, continue bi review

interest time, i focus significant concern thesubstantive provision rules. a detail discussion numerous concern includedin comment letter issue jointly federal reserve, occ, fdic.trust fiduciary activitieswe concern provision interim final rule implement statutoryexception trust fiduciary activity banks. in judgment, provision wouldsignificantly disrupt trust fiduciary customer relationship activity banks. a i notedabove, trust fiduciary activity part core function banks, bank longbought sell security trust fiduciary customer strong protection affordedby fiduciary law supervision examination bank agencies.in light history, glb act specifically permit bank effect transaction trusteecapacity, effect transaction fiduciary capacity department bank isregularly examine bank examiner compliance fiduciary principles. to ensure banksdid attempt operate full-scale brokerage operation trust department, glb actestablished two limitations. first, bank rely trust fiduciary exception must "chieflycompensated" security transaction effect trust fiduciary customer basisof certain type traditional trust fiduciary fee specify act. second importantly, theact prohibit bank publicly solicit security brokerage business conjunctionwith trust activities. the congress expect compensation requirement andadvertising restriction would interfere traditional trust fiduciary activity banks, norwere provision intend grant sec broad authority regulate "push-out" trust andfiduciary activity banks. in fact, conference report glb act specifically state the"conferees expect sec disturb traditional bank trust activities" exception.1the interpretation exception currently reflect interim final rules, however, wouldsignificantly disrupt customary trust fiduciary activity bank odds thelanguage purpose exception. most importantly, interim final rule provide bankqualifies exception trust fiduciary account independently meet act's"chiefly compensated" requirement. we strongly believe act's "chiefly compensated"requirement intend apply bank's aggregate trust fiduciary activity anaccount-by-account basis. an approach focus bank's aggregate trust fiduciary activitiesis consistent nature operation bank trust department would – conjunction withthe act's prohibition bank publicly solicit brokerage business apart trust fiduciaryactivities – effectively prevent bank run full-scale brokerage operation trustdepartments.the account-by-account approach adopt interim final rules, hand, bothunworkable overly burdensome. first, approach appear premise notion anindividual trust fiduciary account engage significant number security transactionsduring year traditional trust fiduciary account. this premise flawed, however. it isentirely natural bank engage numerous security transaction trust fiduciaryaccount. for example, may numerous security transaction account trust isinitially establish asset provide grantor initially invest investment 1 see h.r. conf. rep. no. 106-434 164 (1999). 4bis review 70/2001strategy fiduciary account alter reflect change beneficiary's investment objective.an account-by-account approach also accommodate complex, multi-accountrelationships bank's trust department frequently call upon establish achieve theindividualized wealth preservation transfer goal customers.the account-by-account approach also prof much. to put context, moderately sizedtrust department may order 10,000 separate trust fiduciary account largetrust department may 100,000 accounts. under account-by-accountapproach adopt interim final rules, change amount compensation receive ayear single trust fiduciary account could cause bank entire trust operation tobecome unregistered broker-dealer, thereby open bank threat enforcement actionby sec and, january 1, 2003, suit private party rescission security contractsentered bank. such result unreasonable, especially bank would ableto determine account's compliance rules' "chiefly compensated" requirement endof year, may single day restructure operation compensation fromone account meet rules' requirements.the propose account-by-account approach also would impose significant unnecessary burdenson banks. most bank system place track various category ofcompensation receive individual trust fiduciary account. in order complywith rules, continue provide traditional trust fiduciary services, bank would toestablish complex costly system procedure monitor amount type feesreceived trust fiduciary account cost likely would pass toconsumers.the commission recognize significant burden impose rules' account-by-accountrequirement use discretionary authority provision security law adoptan exemption bank comply certain condition establish commission. theseconditions, however, require bank establish procedure ensure trust fiduciaryaccount comply rules' chiefly compensate requirement, effectively maintain account-by-account approach exemption suppose provide relief. in addition, bankmay take advantage exemption significantly limit receipt fee wouldotherwise permissible glb act.the rule also impose restriction trust fiduciary activity bank simply notfound statute consistent nature trust fiduciary operation ofbanks. for example, although statutory exception is, terms, available account wherea bank act trustee, rule suggest sec review bank-trustee relationship maydetermine relationship qualify exception. accordingly, rule notonly cast doubt whether bank may continue effect security transaction wide variety oftraditional trust accounts, self-directed personal trust account charitable trusts, alsosuggest sec intend review regulate type trust relationship bank mayhave customers. the interim final rule also place restriction bank deem tobe act "fiduciary capacity" include statute contemplate thecongress.finally, rule interpret statute's examination requirement manner effectivelyprevent many bank take advantage statutory trust fiduciary exception all. a imentioned earlier, congress require security transaction exception beeffected either bank's trust department another department regularly examine bybank examiner compliance fiduciary principle standards. these requirement ensurethat customer's relationship bank continue subject fiduciary examinationprograms bank agency effectively protect customer years.the interim final rules, however, allow bank effect transaction trust fiduciary account onlyif aspect transaction – include associate data process settlement – occur adepartment regularly examine bank examiner compliance fiduciary principle andstandards. many bank trust fiduciary department outsource security settlement processingfunctions third party affiliate, delegate function department bank toachieve cost operational efficiencies. the customer relationship fully protect trust andfiduciary principle case, mechanic transaction handle cost-efficient manner. however, bank structure operation way would beprohibited rule take advantage exception grant congress, even though bi review 70/20015their relationship customer maintain trust fiduciary department regularlyexamined bank examiner compliance fiduciary principles.in view, end result narrow interpretation burdensome requirement bankswill force significantly restructure traditional trust fiduciary activities, banksmay well require cease provide traditional bank service customers. in addition,customers choose establish relationship bank force terminate theserelationships duplicate account bank broker-dealer, result increase costsand burden.2 we believe result intend congress.custodial safekeeping activitiesanother exception include congress glb act design protect thecustodial safekeeping service bank long provide part customary bankingactivities. in particular, act allow banks, part customary bank activities, providesafekeeping custody service respect security provide custodial relatedadministrative service individual retirement account pension, retirement, similarbenefit plans.3 in area, well, commission interpret exception manner isinconsistent language purpose act prevent significantly disrupt thecustomary bank relationship activity congress seek preserve.in particular, i note moment ago, act explicitly permit bank continue provide custodialand relate administrative service ira benefit plans. this language add billduring house-senate conference resolve ambiguity concern ability bank tocontinue provide security execution service custodial ira customer benefit plansthat receive custodial administrative

supervision plan's fiduciaries.these bank-offered service allow plan administrator obtain security execution otheradministrative service cost-effective manner, thereby reduce plan expense benefit planbeneficiaries.the commission, however, state custody exception allow bank effectsecurities transaction custodial ira benefit plan accounts. this position essentially read theexplicit authorization adopt congress statute, completely contrary thepurposes act, would disrupt long-standing relationship bank theircustomers.in addition, interpretation custody exception adopt commission would prohibitbanks execute security transaction custodial customer accommodationbasis. banks, part customary bank activities, many year effect securitiestransactions accommodation custodial clients. these customer-driven transaction occuronly upon order customer allow customer avoid go theunnecessary expense establish separate account broker-dealer effect occasionalsecurities trade associate customer's

custodial clients. these sec-grantedexemptions, could revoke modify sec time future, would benecessary rule give effect language purpose custody exception adopt bythe congress. furthermore, exemption subject numerous burdensome restrictionsthat contemplate act make difficult, impossible, many banksto take advantage exemptions. 2 the glb act already require bank send u.s. security trade trust fiduciary account registeredbroker-dealer execution. see 15 u.s.c. § 78c(a)(4)(c).3 see 15 u.s.c. § 78c(a)(4)(b)(viii). 6bis review 70/2001third-party network arrangementsthe glb act also permit bank

before attempt answer question, let stress that,while reserve bank make useful contribution economy's performance, never makethe difference 1.7 per cent per caput growth 3.6 per cent per caput growth. thereserve bank operate monetary policy maintain stability general level prices,and necessary condition new zealand maximise growth, produce adoubling growth rate. the reserve bank promote stability financialsector, vital contribution maximise new zealand's growth, produce adoubling growth rate. 6bis review 69/2001no, need change want double growth rate involve policy andbehaviour fall well outside reserve bank's area responsibility, i already noted.the second point i want make important talk opportunity affordedby "knowledge economy" forget many year come new zealander notbe employ software company biotechnology research firms. they employ "the oldeconomy". but mean employ industry lack scope forimproving productivity. on contrary: useful recall last 15 years, averageproductivity improve little 1 per cent per annum, productivity agriculture improve byalmost 4 per cent per annum – rate productivity growth which, achieve across economy asa whole sustain decade, would easily see per caput income reach oecd medianwithin decade.improving productivity involve whole host thing loosely group threeheadings – improve human capital, improve physical capital, improve technology.improving human capitalto improve human capital, urgently (i almost say "desperately") need improve quality ofour education system. and i say "improve quality education system" rather increase theresources devote education system. we might need increase resource devote toeducation, already spend high fraction national income government support foreducation great majority develop countries. despite this, international survey ofeducational achievement suggest get educational outcome consistent thishigh level expenditure.it must source grave concern many people come high school haveonly rudimentary idea write grammatical english; singapore, southkorea, taiwan, hong kong occupy top four place mathematics third internationalmaths science study, new zealand rank 21st (out 38 country study).8 it cannot good economic growth, employment prospect many young people,that, accord oecd report release april 1998, nearly half workforce new zealandcan read well enough work effectively modern economy.9 it must matter particularconcern 70 per cent maori new zealanders, three-quarters pacific island newzealanders, function "below level competence literacy require effectively meet thedemands everyday life".10the university auckland one two main host conference, would surprisedand disappoint i stress importance improve quality tertiaryeducation new zealand. and clearly, i believe vitally important, though whether thatmeans even public sector resource go tertiary sector kind reform i amnot good position judge.but i strongly suspect improvement pre-school, primary, secondary education evenmore important long term growth, long-term social cohesion society, areimprovements tertiary education. indeed, may well improvement pre-tertiaryareas fundamental prerequisite improve quality tertiary education new zealand.but although little doubt improve human capital secure improvededucational outcome would contribute new zealand's long-term growth, higher-growthdividend improve educational outcome would almost certainly accrue well future, notwithin next years, possibly even within next decade. indeed, sober reflect thatsome country particularly good economic growth recent years, asaustralia unite states, literacy level significantly high new zealand's. it maywell good educational outcome would important ensure peoplehave access high pay jobs, thus assist social harmony, assist economicgrowth directly. 8 iea third international mathematics science study, 1998-1999.9 human capital investment: international comparison, oecd, 1998.10 adult literacy new zealand, ministry education, 1998. bi review 69/20017improving physical capitalone obvious way increase output per person employ give people physical capitalto work with.

if small size andisolation new zealand market discourage investment new zealand, moreto encourage skill attitude assist growth immigrate newzealand? should vigorously seek economic integration much large market? we havemade great deal progress free trade arrangement australia, bilateral freetrade arrangement singapore, potentially hong kong country region, aregreatly welcomed. but really want encourage investment new zealand muchlarger market, perhaps devote every effort negotiate free trade arrangement andgreater economic integration unite state also. there little doubt one themajor reason recent economic success ireland finland membership theeuropean union, i mentioned. a close economic integration unite state would notmake new zealand close physically california, would carry potentially enormouseconomic benefits.it context time may arrive need give serious consideration thepros con alternative currency arrangements. far advocate abolition thereserve bank new zealand and, i say previous occasion, decision abandonthe new zealand dollar favour currency finally political decision, decision forcentral bankers. and frankly, i know whether would net economic benefit adoptingsome currency arrangement, no-holds-barred discussion toimprove new zealand's economic performance, one issue look this.another matter relevant might encourage investment physical capital taxregime. do need substantial change tax structure encourage investment newzealand new zealanders, immigrants, foreign companies? and so, might thatchange look like? this place go detail, would probably involve significantreduction corporate tax rate (it disturb new zealand's corporate tax rate thehighest asian region). the rate company tax rarely factor determine location 8bis review 69/2001of new investment, indeed often even dominant factor. but relevant factor, andis one issue look serious encourage investment new zealand.improving technologyand finally, might increase growth rate productivity, gdp per capita, furtherincreasing rate adopt new technology abroad, develop new technology ofour own? roger ferguson, vice chairman federal reserve board, cite research do fedeconomists suggest "the consolidate influence information technology investmentsaccount two-thirds acceleration (us) productivity since 1995".11 and belittle doubt radical improvement new zealand's productivity growth rate require morerapid adoption new technology case recent years.to extent, would see rapid adoption new technology saw investment inhuman physical capital. the three thing often go together. but thing weprobably need encourage this.to begin with, least try ensure obstacle development andadoption new technology. in particular, need ensure regulatory framework notclose development biotechnology, area must surely potential worldleaders. this not, course, mean restriction whatsoever onexperiments area, mean remember every restriction costa well potential benefit, sometimes cost substantial.do need go further, provide positive incentive undertake research development innew zealand? our unhappy experience government provide incentive particular privateactivities inevitably rightly make u nervous suggestion, might "externalities"associated research development – economic benefit individual firm notitself capture retain – justify exception case? recent oecd data suggest australianbusinesses spend double new zealand business spend, relative gdp, researchand development, ireland spend three time much, finland spendabout six time much, sweden spend nine time much. even allow forsome over-statement arise business incentive re-classify expenditure r & dwhere tax benefit so, new zealand business seem spendingsubstantially le r & d business successful economies.12do need take step encourage adoption new technology encourage moreentrepreneurial, risk-taking, culture? at minimum may need try make entrepreneursfeel love – national hero least among national heroes! we also need tofoster understand financial matters, interest business activities, schools,through programme run enterprise new zealand trust.we need consider whether personal income tax structure provide appropriate encouragementto entrepreneurial new zealander stay new zealand, encouragement entrepreneurialpotential new zealander come here. our top rate personal income tax particularly high bythe standard develop countries, cut level income manycountries tax system allow relatively deductions. compare rapidly growingeconomies hong kong singapore, top rate personal income tax high.perhaps also need think innovative move tax area. the unite kingdomattracts many entrepreneurial people world live work country byexempting uk tax income generate outside uk people bear uk. iunderstand switzerland effectively "negotiates" tax pay wealthy foreigner wantto live switzerland. it may accident many entrepreneurial new zealander move tothese country recent years.another idea suggest discussion paper issue mcleod committee recently,namely establish maximum amount income tax pay individual course 11 "the productivity experience unite states: past, present, future", speech u embassy the hague, 14june 2001.12 a new economy?

"briefly" i surewhat role national save play economic growth world capital free move fromcountry country. we know japan one high save rate world, hadone bad growth record develop world decade. we know theunited state australia rather low national save rate recent years, bothcountries grow strongly. we certainly know save channel investmentswhich yield little growth benefit.on face it, national save

japan’seconomy back sustainable growth path one easily answered, especially whentaking account political economy. the difficulty lie simply cannot make clear-cutdecision choose either macroeconomic policy structural reform. today, i explain viewson role monetary policy structural reform play current harsh circumstances.1.current monetary ease measuresas start point, i explain current monetary ease measures.current monetary policy managementas know, bank japan take successive monetary ease measure february tomarch year, march decision decisive one. there three point whichcharacterize series monetary ease measures.first, bank change main operate target monetary policy operation theuncollateralized overnight call rate outstanding balance current account hold bank ofjapan. in addition, bank increase average outstanding amount account about25% 4 trillion yen 5 trillion yen.in response ample provision funds, nominal short-term market interest rate decline tovirtually zero percent. in addition, consider necessary smooth provision liquidity, thebank increase outright purchase long-term government bond previous 400 billionyen per month subject certain conditions.second, bank clearly state continue pursue new monetary policy frameworkuntil consumer price index register stably zero percent increase year year. this aimsat guide long term interest rate decline promise continuation monetary ease intothe future, thus often call ‘commitment effect’ ‘policy duration effect’. 2bis review 68/2001third, bank introduce ‘lombard-type lend facility’, bank extend loan atthe request counterparties certain condition official discount rate. thank thisfacility, even turmoil market, counterparties flexibly borrow fund thebank long eligible collateral. a result, official discount rate shoulder new roleof set ceiling short-term money market rate. this facility play big role nurture asense security among market participant respect finance also stabilize interestrates, thus strengthen effect monetary easing.effects monetary easingthese monetary ease measures, unprecedented central bank history home abroad,were receive considerable surprise announced. though initial surprise tend fade,these monetary ease measure potentially powerful effect evidence initialsurprise. at time, however, also true limit effects. we hope allconcerned correctly balance judgement recognize favorable effect thelimits current monetary ease measures.let begin favorable effect current measures. since monetary ease march,various interest rate substantially decline level low level see thezero interest rate policy period. for example, overnight call rate 0.01%, yield 1-yeargovernment bond 0.01-0.02%, 5-year government bond decline 0.3% hasrecently 0.4% mark. yield 10-year government bond move thelow level 1.1-1.4%. in addition, difference yield corporate bond cp andyields government securities, namely ‘credit spread’, also narrowing, imply acontinual improvement fund raise market.as such, abundant liquidity financial markets. what typically reflect abundant liquidityis phenomenon ‘under-subscription’ bank japan operation provide liquidity themarket. for example, competitive yield auction may 21st provide liquidity, bankoffered one trillion yen, financial institutions’ bid le 400 billion yen even rate of0.01%, virtually zero percent. in words, under-subscription expression financialinstitutions’ view “liquidity already provide sufficiently need foradditional liquidity even rate 0.01%.” under-subscription frequently observe thebeginning middle may, bank respond situation reduce unit forevery bid 0.001%. a consequence, low interest rate bank would accept alsoreduced 0.001%, and, thank effort market participant termed‘nano-technology’, under-subscription cease thereafter. however, guarantee thatunder-subscription occur future. in event, liquidity amply provide tomarkets discussion gear toward focus marginal difference 0.01% and0.001%.limits monetary ease measuressuch experience also imply might practical limit central bank cannotunlimitedly provide liquidity beyond demand financial institutions.despite practical limit, would problem liquidity reach corporation resideoutside financial market contribute rejuvenate economic activity, regrettably hasnot case far.let quote plain number typically illustrate this. in last five years, current accountdeposits private financial institution hold bank japan increase 12% anannualized basis. the expectation development account affect creditcreation function financial institutions. monetary base, sum bank japan currentaccounts banknote issued, increase high 8% year. however, despite extremelyample liquidity provision bank, lend commercial bank decline half percent ayear money supply grow

institution inactive, economic activity cannot robust, evidence nominal gdpgrowth 0.6% year consumer price index almost flat. such figure illustrate thefact even bank japan provide ample liquidity market guide nominal interestrates extremely low level virtually zero percent, action cannot lift economic activity.keynes use term ‘liquidity trap’ point possibility effectiveness monetarypolicy might hampered, current state japan’s economy quite close situation.policy duration quantitative easinghowever, even though japan’s economy situation close liquidity trap, central bank cannotbe bystander economy anticipate deteriorate further. against backdrop, thebank thus take decisive monetary ease measure march.in regard, let bring attention two points.first rationale behind outstanding

increase bank japancurrent account positive effects. if financial institution hold excess no-risk no-returncurrent account balances, incentive emerge increase hold asset loans,corporate bonds, stocks, foreign currency-denominated asset generate return eventhough accompany risk. in addition, quantitative increase might affectexpectations public. of course, situation long- short-term interest ratesare quite low credit intermediation function financial institution also hampered, sucheffects might large. however, circumstance room decline ininterest rate almost exhausted, bear mind severe outlook economy, bankjudged necessary dare decide take measures.second commitment effect.as i previously mentioned, bank japan adopt policy incorporate so-called ‘policyduration effect’ bank commit continue monetary ease future. thisshould regard best effort situation central bank try hammer furthermonetary ease effect despite conventional monetary policy instrument almost beenmobilized limit. with commitment place, public’s expectation respect towhen price start rise adjust economy deteriorates. in case, thepublic anticipate monetary ease surely protracted, lead flatten yieldcurve, thereby strengthen monetary ease effects. a current commitment say tohave sort automatic adjustment function change economic conditions.2.role structural reformas such, potentially powerful monetary ease place term interest ratesand quantity, essential resolve structural problem face financial system industry inorder allow monetary ease permeate real economy full extent possible.structural reform is, put simply, establish function effectively allocate resource suchas labor physical financial capital, raise productivity economy whole.the content structural reform shape juncture point emphasisdiffer. here, i go specific measure depth take two point respect thebasic thrust structural reform.importance expectationsthe first point condition successful structural reform. there could various waysof look this, view key successful structural reform positively affectthe expectation economic agents. 4bis review 68/2001at present, expectation firm household bearish. when i say work onsuch expectation change i mean restore situation economic agentscan hold normal expectation economy grow future. however, theexpectations private economic agent far normal state. make rough back-of-the-envelope calculation, expenditure firm household increase additional 2%, thennominal gdp growth would 2% higher. accord household survey, monthly consumptionexpenditures average japanese household fiscal 2000 317,000 yen, 2% increasewould 6,000 yen. and, take account multiplier effect, expenditure necessarywould less. but thing simple.how expectation form difficult question. for example, realize itboom u would eventually come end, relatively bullish view still dominant lastautumn. in fact, last november meet fomc, responsible set short-term interest rate, inflationary concern point potential risk factor u economyrather economic weakness, november private forecaster revise theirforecasts downward. subsequently, fomc successive occasion since januarysubstantially reduce target ff rate, though yet succeed revitalize activity ofit-related firm drive bullish expectations. look back experience japanduring bubble period, expectation economic agent become extremely bullish, extentwhich seem incredible hindsight, face completely opposite situation.then, expectation firm household become bullish?at moment, i clear answer. but one belief bullish expectation naturally emergewhen economy grows, i think key simply make effort raise productivity. measuresto end outline cabinet’s ‘basic plan’ structural reform announce thisjune. what important make clear emphasis market mechanisms, publicunderstand government direct effort toward increase productivity economyas whole mechanisms, implement policy measure consistent adirection.speed structural reformthe second point concern speed structural reform.in regard, economist abroad voice concern various structural reform areimplemented simultaneously, would substantial deflationary impact economy theshort run deflationary gap japan’s economy, already suffer lack ofdemand, might become wider.we certainly understand background concern. indeed, look example ofstructural reform overseas, seem many case deflationary impact theshort term. and, contrast u uk, economy cannot expect receive additional‘dividends’ substantial decline long-term interest rate accompany fiscal consolidation,since japan little room decline interest rates. however, bond market isnot market ass structural reform. if stock market favorably evaluate specificefforts toward resolution structural problems, might positive effect economyfrom channel even short run.moreover, note that, case japan, delay effect structural reform madethe problem weak demand serious.in context, i would like refer fact private consumption slow increase.of course, various factor might behind this, one uncertainty respect pension andthe tax burden future rapidly age population. therefore, order stimulateprivate consumption, essential reduce future uncertainty much possible.according textbook keynesian economics, expansion fiscal expenditure finance theissuance government bond stimulate economy unless taxpayer hold back consumptionreflecting expectation future increase tax burden. however, public investment generatedby fiscal deficit inefficient, production capacity economy whole increase the‘wealth’ generate future income consumption accumulate. and, investmentclearly suggest increase future tax burden delay structural adjustment, wouldhave adverse impact current consumption. bi review 68/20015from viewpoint, become clear content fiscal expenditure go shiftedfrom le efficient efficient objectives, result prospect increase future ‘wealth’might favorable effect economy. compare situation little room tomobilize conventional monetary policy instruments, room effect policy focus the‘quality’ fiscal expenditure seem significantly large, mention ‘basic plan’.nevertheless, i say mean i optimistic enough consider thepromotion structural reform immediately ignite improvement economy. presumably, inthe process reform, cannot deny might ‘pains’ increase bankruptcy andheightened unemployment short run. however, time, appropriate singleout emphasize short-term deflationary impact economy among variousmacroeconomic effect structural reform. in short, long protract stagnation japan’seconomy root structural problems, stage productive todiscuss general term whether structural reform deflationary not. what important is, basedon specific structural reform measure present future, make well-balancedassessment respect economic consequence measures.3.relationship structural reform monetary policyi explain role monetary policy structural policy, relationshipbetween roles? some would say pain stem adverse impact economyas structural reform progress mitigate monetary easing, emphasize inthe process pursue structural reform mainly role monetary policy ensure economicstability. bear view mind i explain i see relationship monetarypolicy structural reform.at start i would like say monetary ease policy currently pursue bankwill, effect i previously explain detail, also give considerable support tostructural reform.first, current monetary policy framework determine take account scenario theeconomy might substantially deteriorate, include short-term deflationary impact stem fromstructural reform. in process discussion reach monetary ease decision march,because cyclical adjustment it-related area worldwide coincide japan’s structuraladjustment, i could help forecast economy would worsen considerably future.based recognition, i felt strongly, viewpoint forward-looking policy making, itwas necessary make move ahead foreseeable economic development vote fordecisive monetary easing.second, even deflationary pressure intensify short run result structural reform,current monetary policy automatic adjustment function ease effect strengthenthrough policy duration effect.third, process structural reform, liquidity concern might increase financial market whennon-performing loan dispose of. in regard, previously mention lombard-type lendingfacility effect drive structural reform contain liquidity concerns.and fourth, corporate household confidence respect future strengthen andeconomic activity pick parallel progress structural reform, current monetary ease willprovide strong support. put differently, benefit recent decisive monetary ease willsurface full private sector decide take advantage opportunities.while relation current monetary policy framework structural reform i justmentioned, i dare add one thing, i vote monetary ease march, i didso strong hope since stretch almost limit adopt suchdecisive monetary ease measures, structural reform ought implement expeditiously. i astrong feel exert leadership promote structural reform effort invarious areas. look back, seem desire structural reform was, is, also hold thepublic. view conventional monetary policy thinking, view might regard asunconventional, i doubt decisive monetary ease contribute progress ofstructural reform. 6bis review 68/20014.central bank responsibilityso far i discuss role play monetary policy structural reform. in last part ofmy speech, i would like address issue central bank responsibility consider theargument since japan’s economy worrisome state bank japan mobilizeall measure disposal even might choice normal times.when consider outlook economy, show april outlook risk assessmentof economy prices, various risk factors. bear mind every possible eventuality,including risk factors, bank japan carefully examine, without presumptions, theeconomic outlook pursue appropriate monetary policy. this responsibility centralbank discharge.at time, term monetary policy management, also responsibility central bankto underline fact almost exhaust conventional monetary ease measure asreducing nominal interest rates. the reason i say listen debate concerningmonetary policy, somewhat puzzle many seem consider interest rate befurther substantially lowered. of course, even current level nominal interest rate arevirtually zero percent, manage devise way create monetary ease effects. however,such effort obvious limits. among various monetary policy option proposed, argue thatthe bank freely increase money supply discretion rain money sky. however,as evidence figure i previously introduced, reality.then, address assertion since inflation deflation monetaryphenomenon, bank japan prevent price decline. a one considershow actual monetary policy conduct watch actual economic developments, i avery mix feel i hear view.for sure, one take extremely long period time, relationship good services,and quantity money major factor determine price level. the fact pricestability goal bank japan’s monetary policy base understanding.however, time, also true price level considerably affect shortand medium term various factor cost change productivity.in fact, bank japan ease monetary condition utmost term interest ratesand quantity current account bank japan monetary base. in addition, notedin march statement, current monetary ease determine illustrate bank’s firmdetermination prevent price decline continuously. however, figure i previouslymentioned show, far effect monetary ease able lift economic activity andprices continue soft. our agony monetary policymakers lie exactly here.now, focus solely raise price pursue monetary operation buy type ofasset, price eventually start rise, though cannot say sure. however, isuncertain whether price rise would lead sustainable economic growth. the question wehave answer are: would extraordinary measure desirable japan’s economy awhole? would consistent pursuit price stability contribute sounddevelopment national economy, bank’s mission state bank japanlaw?of course central bank always open-minded examine new policy measures. in fact,both time adopt zero interest rate policy decisive monetary ease march, ibelieve bank adopt innovative posture. at time, however, cannot make quickdecision pursue extreme policy effect uncertain simply think isbetter something nothing.for example, increase outright purchase government bond central bank mighthave effects, induce market uncertainty respect future fiscal discipline, would leadto interest rate rise way increase risk premium thus entail risk adverseimpact economy. in fact, look recent development long-term interest rates,they often sensitively respond view concern future issuance government bond suchthat rise recently reflect budget discussions. of course, recent rise interest rate canbe regard within range extremely low interest rate thus worryabout adverse impact economic activity. however, necessary policymaker toremember market participant sensitive uncertainty future fiscal management andresulting bond supply demand conditions. bi review 68/20017in march, bank decide increase outright purchase long-term government bond ifdeemed necessary smooth provision liquidity, condition outstanding amountof long-term government bond hold bank keep outstanding balance banknotesissued. and decision arrive take full account i far mentioned.in sum, monetary policy enter uncharted territory responsible policymakersare require conduct careful examination possible favorable effect side-effects ofall likely policy responses. in so, important recognize that, increasingly globalizedfinancial markets, policy japan expose harsh assessment market participant athome abroad. in sense, conduct monetary policy, policy action asindividual policy measure also principle behind every policy action become important. in away, principle might constitute policy.at present, production decline substantially reflect fall exports, economic adjustmentsare intensifying. needle say, bank japan continue carefully examine overalldevelopments economy, include adjustment it-related area effect structuralreform, conduct appropriate monetary policy. at time, i would like emphasize that,during process, ensure monetary policy credibility whole become critical realizingsustainable economic growth.thank attention. bi review 67/20011david clementi: debt workout corporates, bank countries: somecommon themesspeech mr david clementi, deputy governor bank england, insol internationalsixth world congress hold hilton

difficult achieve one without other. the bank particular closely involve thedesign regulation financial infrastructure, payment settlement systems, ensurethat robust system is, result, good able

fromunnecessary corporate liquidation may enormous.my speech morning, therefore, provide opportunity signal bank’s support insol’smission take leadership role international insolvency credit issue bring aboutgreater international co-operation among main players. the grow interest number ofinternational organisation design orderly effective corporate insolvency regimes, inthe encouragement great co-operation cross-border corporate insolvencies, suggest havebeen successful objective. i think greatly assist important work whichthe insol lender group coordinate develop set principle governingcorporate workout pre-insolvency stage.but corporate workout represent one strand financial restructure generally. there aretwo others i want cover; are, first, restructure financial institutions, include banks,and, second, sovereign debt workouts. indeed, many instances, restructure corporatesector need proceed tandem financial sovereign sectors. i would arguethat, three cases, collective approach different participant private publicsectors, effective co-ordination among creditor debtors, help preserve value. so iwould like consider today extent differ approach raise common themes, andalso whether distinguish feature could affect interaction threestrands.i recognise, course, progress make corporate context area offinancial institution sovereign debts; i think reflect great credit many individual andorganisations represent congress. so i start offer think corporateworkouts, link bank england’s long-standing involvement london approachand responsibility maintenance financial stability. i turn look thedesirable features, incorporate agree principle govern international corporate workouts,might apply financial restructurings; finally similar way look whether principlescan carry across field sovereign workouts. this raise issue role thevarious different party debt restructurings, include official sector. by draw somecommon themes, i hope put insol’s work corporate sector broad context ofdiffering approach resolve debtor difficulties.corporate workoutslet start corporate workouts; let begin say word bank’sinterest issue. a i note moment ago, arise mainly financial stabilityresponsibility, although i would argue role promote efficiency effectiveness thefinancial system also relevant. episode incipient actual financial instability often 2bis review 67/2001accompanied failure corporate sector may lead generally loss throughoutthe financial system. in cases, corporate failure reflect inability resolve temporaryliquidity problem affect company remain viable longer-term. creditor may actwithout benefit available information company’s solvency. this imbalance informationavailable company creditor compound conflict interest different typesof creditors, banks, bondholder financial institutions. the end-result often thesame: unnecessary liquidation viable companies, represent market failure capable ofamplifying financial instability. that, nutshell, explain bank’s interest involvement thisarea.a country’s insolvency regime seek limit cost arise potential market failure, forexample support effective private sector mechanism reorganise viable companies. i wouldsay partly provide incentive debtor creditor negotiate workout thepre-insolvency stage. this hopefully reduce risk unnecessary corporate liquidation andavoid benefit one group creditor expense others.most you, course, know that, guide principles, bank take lead developinga framework govern corporate workout 1980s early 1990s – ”london approach” or”london rules”. we jingoistic this; equally supportive variant whether hongkong guideline jakarta initiatives. we draw line, however, aussie rules; reference toaustralian sport jangle nerve bank! in case, ”rules” definitely wrong word,since london approach legal statutory back – merely informal codification aset practice come widely accept vast majority large corporate workoutsundertaken uk recent years. this include arrangement informal standstill anindependent review company’s long-term viability finance need carry out. but isperhaps le well-known that, develop london approach, bank build tradition ofinvolvement industrial restructure date back 1920s. indeed, cursory glance atr s sayers’ excellent history bank 1891-1944 reveal montagu norman’s involvementin corporate restructure inter-war period probably take time hisother duties, often consternation conventional colleagues!since recession early 1990s, reflect stable macroeconomic condition inrecent years, bank’s direct participation mediator corporate workout declined. we do,however, remain will take role invite appear necessaryto help resolve potentially conflict problem company’s creditors. where try toadd value recent year promulgate london approach abroad work todevelop framework light recent innovation development global financial markets.several issue loom large. one applicability unanimity requirement give theproliferation number type creditor large international workout. another lackof formal moratorium part period resolution company’s problems, distinctfrom informal standstill london approach initial period collect availableinformation evaluate company’s long-term prospects. more broadly, extent theapproach affect development securitisation, loan trade credit derivative isexercising mind others closely involve corporate workouts.these issue raise potentially tricky questions. for example, loan trade arguably make thecreditor co-ordination problem challenging, time provide exit route thoseunwilling involve restructure entry specialist turnaround investors.credit derivative raise different set issues, need involve transfer thecompany’s debt until, case physical settlement, credit event occurs. the knowledge thatdebt change hand follow credit event might, however, affect incentive face thecompany, ”pre-credit event” creditor potential ”post-credit event” creditor unpredictableways. one possibility bank purchase credit protection via credit derivative mayhave incentive put ail company liquidation order obtain payment itscounterparty rather participate restructuring, result uncertain. for manybanks, approach would incompatible build bank relationships, recentdebate whether restructuring, rather failure, constitute credit event purpose acredit derivative contract show matter highly topical. at least, active market creditderivatives secondary loan might make difficult identify organise creditor orderto negotiate debt workout. bi review 67/20013these are, i noted, awkward issues. but i encourage see insol lendersgroup attempt address course draw statement principlesfor global approach multi-creditor workouts. i also encourage discussion theprinciples involve large global banks, also range finance providers,including insurance companies, institutional investors, hedge fund secondary market debtproviders. a governor note provide bank’s endorsement ilg’s initiative inoctober 2000, past experience suggest collective approach major creditor debtorcompany financial difficulty help preserve value, benefit creditor wholeand others interest company. although i know tricky issue toresolve negotiation – notably relate standstill, debt trade provision ofnew money – end, principle seem broadly consistent london approach, base asthey enlighten self-interest creditors. ultimately, although debt providersmay able gain individual case strike own, long run co-operativeapproach ensure great recovery creditors, include bondholders, aggregate.just great international co-operation produce net gain workout stage, need tobe back great co-ordination cross-border corporate insolvencies. that wewelcome uncitral model law cross-border insolvencies, which, know,has implement uk insolvency law. the model law consistent uk insolvencyregime contain many helpful provision relate co-operation insolvency court indifferent jurisdictions, grant recognition foreign insolvency practitioners. we wouldtherefore urge country enact uml.in context, also welcome ongoing work international organisations, include imfand world bank, design efficient effective insolvency regime worldwide. it is, course,difficult establish international standard area, approach adopt differentcountries reflect different legal tradition also different policy choices, especially onthe extent system favour debtor creditors. indeed, debate live inseveral countries, include uk new measure announce last month queen’sspeech, i sure occupy mind congress. but imf work argues, rightly myview, insolvency regime, whether debtor- creditor-oriented, enhance financial stabilityeffectively protect value benefit interest party economy general;and require allocation risk among market participant do way ispredictable, equitable transparent.financial sector restructuringslet turn second area: financial sector restructurings, i would like start notingthe importance confidence smooth run financial system. confidence important inmost industries, heart financial industry. it confidence permit bank tooperate, matter course, gear many time capital, maturity mismatchbetween asset liabilities, often concentrate short-term sight deposits. they thuspeculiarly vulnerable loss confidence, individually group. the potential forcontagion – threat trouble one bank result run others might endanger thesystem whole – make monitor banks’ solvency liquidity core activity central banks.whether responsible day-to-day supervision not, central bank still need stand ready act aslender last resort. however, operation must carefully considered. any decision tosupport institution, particularly circumstance underlie insolvency, create moral hazardthat undermine market discipline. design effective arrangement restructure financialinstitutions thus particular challenge – need act quickly finally; intermediatearrangements much difficult sustain.the challenge complicate degree financial market global financialgroups operate number different jurisdictions. the g30 report international financialinsolvencies, publish march 1998, raise several theme rather similar relatingto cross-border corporate insolvencies. in particular, emphasise close degree internationalco-operation necessary prevent disorderly failure bank insurance company.effective co-operation would help bring reorganisation necessary orderly disposal ofassets, avoid delays, uncertainty loss value often associate formal legalproceedings. if financial institution fail, view provision model law, 4bis review 67/2001especially relate judicial cross-border co-operation, potentially helpful provide astarting point negotiations.there use clear distinction bank security houses, fund management andinsurance, financial institution different nationalities. restructure could extentcontained within one market one jurisdiction. now distinction different market andtypes firm become blur increase consolidation financial group give riseto range large complex financial institution lcfis. restructure one group would befar straightforward. the step involve wind lcfi subject recentdiscussion among central banks. this involve co-ordination information sharingarrangements also wide risk system would assess circumstances.winding firm scale could large undertake itself. but wide repercussion interms dislocation market could enormous.thankfully, yet, little experience restructure wind lcfi. aswith corporates, however, first step would assessment long-run viability theinstitution prior restructuring. this determine whether liquidity support lcfi may bejustified, whether closed, much way independent review acorporate restructure determine whether company reorganise liquidated. withfinancial institutions, time available make assessment reach decision providingsupport may limited.other common theme two strand need co-operation relevantparties, base full exchange information, need equitable treatment similar classesof creditors, investor depositors. it may also possible envisage, wind orrestructuring lcfi, authority play facilitate role private sector solution, raisingparallels bank’s role london approach.there has, yet, little in-depth exploration linkage corporate sector andfinancial sector restructurings. i believe effort explore complementarity twoapproaches would reap dividends. a well-designed corporate restructure framework, byrehabilitating viable company face short-term problems, maximise value creditors’claims preserve go concern value companies. by provide orderly recognitionand allocation losses, also improve banks’ ability ass value impair assetsand determine appropriate level loan loss provisions. a imf noted, shouldencourage accurate predictable price distress claims, assist development adeeper secondary market financial institution trade distress claim therebytransfer loan specialist turnaround investors.of course, complementarity may difficult exploit countries, especiallyemerging market economies, bank face major problem arise corporateloan books. bank inadequate loan loss provision low capital ratio may reluctant toparticipate corporate workouts, may force recognise actual losses. therole public authority often crucial cases. in practice, bank restructure programmeshave often transfer distress corporate sector debt separate government agencies. indeed, thishas happen recent year g10 countries, notably us, japan sweden. this canlead tension maximise short-term debt recovery limit public cost bankrecapitalisation preserve longer-term corporate value. effectively, public authority mayliquidate company prematurely, effort secure immediate cash recoveries, alonger-term restructure company might effective way preserve value boththe corporate sector wide economy, include bank sector. to avoid conflict,corporate bank sector restructure need effectively co-ordinated. i would arguethat lead synergy facilitate rehabilitation viable company mannerbenefiting creditor – include public authority – long term.having say that, doubt financial restructure insolvency contain severaldistinguishing feature compare corporate reorganisations, besides importance ofconfidence i started. indeed, probably explain much debate modellaw whether principle apply insolvency bank financialinstitutions. different view mean law contain effective opt-out banksand insurance companies. i would certainly agree depositor policyholder differentposition ordinary creditors. they likely le information, great number, beless well organise recover asset professional creditors. so application corporate bi review 67/20015workout insolvency principle international financial insolvency would allow fordepositor policyholder protection schemes.the role supervisor would also, course, need recognise explicitly. in particular, theprinciples underlie corporate workout insolvency would consistent withinternationally recognise principle bank insurance regulation. in eu framework, thatrequires consistency cross-border corporate sector initiative model law ilgprinciples eu passport system principle home state responsibility bank andinsurance supervision. relevant eu directive would also need take account.all strengthen view although synergy realise consistency theapproaches corporate financial sector workouts, need recognise bank (andinsurance companies) different. i note that, corporate insolvencies, country may differ inthe extent legal statutory arrangement favour debtor creditor. but theywill also differ extent insolvency law embody universal territorial approach tocross-border insolvencies. exactly distinction relevant international financialinsolvency. in ”single-entity” approach, bank branch several jurisdiction woundup accord universal principles, creditor depositor worldwide entitle equalclaim bank’s worldwide assets. by contrast, ”separate-entity” (or ”ring-fencing”) approach toliquidating lcfi proceed accord territorial principles, creditor depositor anindividual bank branch particular jurisdiction take precedence distribution lcfi’sassets within jurisdiction, local liquidator authorise turn excess asset tothe home country liquidator.this imply that, corporate sector financial sector insolvencies, bank supervisor andinsolvency practitioner subject vary legal responsibility may make co-ordinationproblem difficult. i would argue initiative ilg uncitral moreconsistent spirit universal approach. in fact, i would go suggest theapplication initiative international financial restructure insolvency possible,in respects, country adopt single entity approach liquidation international banks.continued adherence separate entity approach could therefore make difficult achievegreater consensus principle govern cross-border corporate workout internationalfinancial insolvencies.sovereign debt workoutsi would like stray even uncharted territory turn third area, sovereign debtworkouts. i hope i already say enough clarify establishment effective frameworkgoverning relationship non-sovereign debtor creditor provide mean ofinvolving private sector resolution financial crises. but relate currentvery live debate private sector involvement (psi) sovereign debt workouts? the potentiallinkages three strand financial restructure amply illustrate asian crisisof 1997-98, involve widespread default corporate sector domestic liabilitiesand obligation foreign creditors. this impact bank sector’s balance sheetsand capital positions, feedback effect corporate sector, also sovereignsector, need involve bank recapitalisation corporate sector restructuring. ontop that, contagion effect public private sector hold sovereign debt atime public finance many country deteriorate independently.i think important appreciate exist framework govern sovereign debt workout inemerging market economy (emes) evolve world official finance dominate privatefinancing provide relatively small number develop country banks. but private claimsnow outweigh official claim major emes – ratio 70:30 recent years. and theseprivate claim increasingly bond investor rather bank – direct portfolio investmentflows dwarf bank lend source finance emes. bondholder disperse oftenanonymous, potentially great creditor co-ordination problems. to contain potentialsystemic consequence future crises, public private sector incentive todevise new framework deal effectively sovereign debt workouts, mostespecially role psi, private claims, particularly bondholdings, substantial.this similar kind challenge adapt london approach, whose original principleswere relevant creditor group largely consist fairly small group relatively 6bis review 67/2001homogeneous banks, world creditor group become much disparate andinternational, involve large number bondholder financial creditors. it seem sensible,therefore, consider extent sovereign sector borrow ideas11 discuss bythe ilg others develop principle govern multi-creditor global corporate workout aremore appropriate modern financial markets.i take considerable encouragement fact that, recent months, number different privatesector group publish view ”best practice” principle might underlie sovereign debtworkouts. although inevitably difference various groups, case acollaborative framework facilitate negotiation co-operation sovereign debtor itscreditors, also overcome possible co-ordination problem different creditor groups,seems envisaged. these general principle seem much common thethemes underlie ilg’s corporate workout principles. they also include several suggestionsto enhance creditor co-ordination, inclusion collective action clause bond contractsand, widely, use ”creditor country clubs” conduit information exchanges.the key is, view, creditor co-ordination issue. a failure creditor co-ordination inthe sovereign context lead cancellation longer-term investment project protractedexclusion international capital markets. the private sector group argue that, sovereignencounters financial difficulty likely trigger debt default, encourage process ofdialogue affect creditor sovereign. that involve co-operation tofacilitate full exchange information analysis relate current financial situation andprospects sovereign. this easy country already take necessary action toimprove data availability transparency meet relevant imf data standard codes. thereis close parallel way corporate financial sector restructure govern byindependent review base full exchange information corporate’s bank’s financialposition. in cases, essential analyse debtor’s financial position (the imf thesovereign context independent accountant corporate case) able distinguishbetween different type default. more effective monitor improve discipline thedebtor facilitate extension lend private creditor cases.another area sovereign debt workout could borrow corporate financial restructuringsis possible recourse neutral mediator, charge facilitate co-operative creditor solution.in sovereign context, one possible facilitator might imf. it would certainly theresources expertise job, although one possible drawback imf, unlike anarbiter corporate workout, sometimes claim debtor, case thesovereign. and raise separate issue whether, circumstances, imf mightprovide financial support sovereign debt workout – so-called lend arrears. such anapproach would design limit moral hazard implications, incorporate strictconditionality. but useful mean support country take remedial policyaction bridge finance.the issue standstill is, many know, controversial sovereign context,notwithstanding fact informal standstill play crucial role corporate workouts. voluntarydebt rollover agreement creditor bond restructure are, i believe, useful aspect effectivepsi. but historical experience involuntary sovereign debt standstills, form paymentssuspensions, exactly encourage – process often inefficient andinequitable. nevertheless, circumstance sovereign debt crisis immediatepayments relief provide standstill may make important contribution. an example would bewhere capital flight pervasive immediate policy adjustment insufficient bring aboutadequate voluntary private sector refinancing.in circumstances, standstill may realise advantage corporate workout itprovides breathe space remedial policy measure evaluate put place; promotescreditor co-ordination avoid unjustified creditor preference treat creditor typeequitably; provide incentive creditor debtor reach voluntary arrangementsooner rather later. that lot ifs and, i noted, provision thestandstill support imf lend arrears, would need subject strict conditionality.but condition could usefully borrow correspond provision attach tocorporate workout standstills. in cases, standstill subject strict time limit; itshould allow full release relevant information debtor creditor timely basis; itshould facilitate equitable treatment similar type creditor (for example formation bi review 67/20017bank creditor bondholder committees); provide seniority new money; andabove deliver rapid presentation restructure plan creditors.what mean sovereign debt standstill would need orderly, efficient, equitable andexpeditious. easy say done, course, especially give fact generally singleorganisation represent disparate group private creditors. but, corporate workoutstandstills, key reduce incentive creditor rush exits.of course, argue attempt negotiate standstill could opposite effect, inother word could prompt rush exits. but longer-term investor benefit country runsbeing forestalled, net effect might beneficial switch short-run long-run investors.others suggest standstill create moral hazard alter debtor incentive processby undermine primacy debt contracts. but, i note before, well-designed frameworkfor sovereign debt workouts, involve voluntary standstill think helpful, mightbe likely provide perverse incentive sovereign debtor default insolvency lawdoes corporate debtors. but would clear standstill option would usedsparingly tightly-defined circumstances; otherwise, could self-defeating.having highlight common themes, i could accuse wear rose-tinted spectacle idid also acknowledge important distinguish feature sovereign andcorporate workouts. unlike company, sovereign, course, cannot liquidated. public policyapproaches crisis management recognise argument sovereign debt restructuringin case crisis arise poor performance policy. in cases, generally,crisis management involve careful combination official finance, policy adjustment thedebtor psi. this rather different corporate case, creditor might well decide toliquidate, rather restructure, company whose problem arise solely poor management.the lack correspond insolvency law back-up sovereign case might mean theincentives repay weaker, moral hazard effect induce voluntary default morecommon, corporate case.such factor might compound difference corporate sovereignframeworks, include lack collateral (or mean acquire it) underlie sovereign debt, andthe great uncertainty sovereign case issue creditor seniority, assess ongoingdebt sustainability burden sharing. this latter point also raise thorny issue paris clubcomparability, could regard impose form involuntary psi private creditors.the sovereign case also generally subject political factor simply present thecorporate case.the uncertainty surround question explain progress slow devise aframework govern sovereign workout capable command widespread support. ibelieve great scope develop framework draw heavily principlesgoverning corporate financial sector restructurings, relevant, withoutcompromising distinct feature sovereign workouts. i please see seem bethe approach take various private sector groups, i wish well efforts.conclusionlet try bring remark conclusion. in financial system become ever moreglobal inter-connected, central bank increasingly involve spot linkage betweendevelopments different countries, sector markets. usually matter identify anddealing threat emerge. but also opportunity take idea develop toaddress one set problem apply elsewhere. i try give flavour thesynergies i believe exist debt workout affecting, first, companies, financial

monetary policy international symposium, bank france, paris, 30 november 2001. * * * during past several years, change asset price attract considerable attention public, economic researchers, monetary policymakers. that attention well deserved: recent change asset valuation enormous, appear substantial effect economy. the observation asset price influence macroeconomic performance hardly new. undergraduate macroeconomic textbook generally teach increase wealth boost household spend increase stock price stimulate business investment. moreover, grow body empirical evidence aggregate level level individual household business support basic presumptions. but progress made, i believe understand empirical relationship theoretical underpinnings relationship still remain incomplete. my remark today cover three topics. first, i discus available empirical evidence unite state effect change asset price household consumption business investment. second, i highlight aspect relationship asset price household spend i believe merit research. third, i review monetary policy respond asset price fluctuation among element economic environment unite state past years. empirical evidence asset price spend at aggregate level, wealth effect consumption mainstay large-scale econometric model least thirty years. the forecast model use federal reserve board early 1970s incorporate 5-1/2 cent increase consumption dollar additional wealth. the econometric model u.s. economy use today federal reserve board include wealth effect well, although somewhat small size. not researcher agree, statistical study suggest additional dollar household wealth leads, time, permanent rise household consumption three five cents. an important question economist policymakers whether households’ net worth summarize information balance sheet useful predict spending, whether decomposition net worth various asset liability category improve forecast spending. unfortunately, question prove difficult answer. today i focus possibly different influence equity wealth house wealth, although component balance sheet may important well. in current version federal reserve’s econometric model, estimate marginal propensity consume stock market wealth virtually indistinguishable. however, i would want exaggerate ability either data statistical tool pinpoint separate influences, time past, model’s estimate marginal propensity consume non-stock-market wealth nearly twice large marginal propensity consume stock market wealth. moreover, recent research conduct outside federal reserve argue marginal propensity consume house wealth likely exceed marginal propensity consume equity wealth. the relationship wealth consumption reflect fed’s model certainly real-world analogue past years. for instance, sale luxury good jewelry expensive automobile brisk late 1990s, report indicate spend especially robust locale individual reap large wealth gain technology financial sectors. more generally, observe dramatic decline personal save rate late 1990s. personal saving--which measure u.s. national income product account difference disposable income outlays--dropped 6-1/2 percent disposable 2 bi review 100/2001 income end 1994 roughly 1 percent early 2000, equity price peaked. the magnitude decline consistent runup equity price marginal propensity consume equity wealth appear fed’s model. nevertheless, recently economist able marshal little formal evidence observe relationship aggregate spend aggregate wealth could trace change spend household actually experience wealth gains. but gap understand filled, least regard equity wealth. several recent papers--including economist federal reserve board--have document microeconomic relationship correspond relationship long observe aggregate data. for example, one study analyze response individual household change stock market wealth find that, 1983-to-1999 period, spend u.s. household stock respond movement stock market, whereas spend non-holders stock apparent link stock prices.1 a second study estimate that, second half 1990s, household top income education distribution unite state show large consumption increases, consistent fact household own stock experience large gain wealth.2 unfortunately, microeconomic evidence link house wealth consumption much limited. but substantial gain house wealth experience recent year disparate movement house equity price make issue policy academic interest. i hope future analysis add understand linkage. hence seem little empirical question change household net worth cause change household spending. to sure, every analysis link stock price spend come conclusion study i mentioned. moreover, certainly complete understand aspect relationship. for example, fairly limit evidence guide u important issue distinguish role house wealth equity wealth. on balance, however, link aggregate household wealth spend remain one sturdy relationship macroeconomics. when turn business spending, evidence support direct causal link equity price business investment weaker. indeed, neither tobin’s q approach formalize effect equity price business investment fare well empirical tests. other influence business investment aside asset-price fluctuations--such acceleration business output cash flow firms--often prove robust important explanators capital spend stock prices. however, careful research--again partly conduct federal reserve economists--suggests cost-of-capital effect investment come clearly empirical model base either natural experiment exogenous shock cost capital econometric technique identify exogenous part observe change user cost.3 other recent work suggest investment also affect least movement stock price reflect discount value expect profits.4 this important literature complex review detail today. let say simply that, despite empirical puzzles, i believe cost-of-capital effect likely work stock price rise fall significantly. 1 karen e dynan dean

100/2001 3 two unresolved issue regard link wealth consumption let return relationship household wealth consumption. although current body empirical literature topic send rather clear message, answer questions. let highlight two unresolved issue i find particularly intrigue deserve study. the first issue pertain underlie force cause value stock market change. the value equity change two basic reasons: market participant adopt new view future profits, market participant apply different set discount factor expectation future profits. the discount factor incorporate risk-free interest rate equity premia, i refer discount factor simply interest rates. consider effect increase expect profits, say spurt productivity. to extent high expect profit reflect high expect future output income--and redistribution income labor capital--both economic intuition formal model suggest desire household spend increase, else equal. consumer foresee future high income want spend now. that response straightforward wealth effect consumption. now consider instead effect decrease interest rates, set aside moment implication interest-rate decline investment future output. in scenario, household expect high future return simply discount stream return different rate, le clear truly good increase consumption. a complication evaluate two scenario aggregate response household spend investment generally fee back asset market generate change price discount rates. the nature magnitude interaction depend consumption investment decision household firms, extent unused labor capital resources, openness economy, factors. untangle connection difficult theoretically, even empirically. but basic point wealth change reflect future profit (or productivity) wealth change reflect interest rate could different effect consumption. analysis wealth effect often give insufficient weight complexities. i believe research theoretical empirical aspect issue could contribute significantly understand relationship asset price macroeconomic outcomes. a second area work warrant housing. the basic puzzle this: roughly speaking, population currently occupy stock residential real estate continue matter happen price. suppose rise relative price housing. there doubt rise would increase compute nominal net worth, support increase household spending? to articulate puzzle carefully, suppose i intend live current house forever price house increase decline discount rate future house services. in case, measure nominal wealth would greater, nominal value house service i consume currently consume future would also greater. thus, increase value home would provide additional resource great consumption real house service good services. yet, i note earlier, empirical evidence support view change price residential real estate affect household spending. so miss simple story? one possibility hypothesize increase price house reflect change house service house expect provide, perhaps individual come think house depreciate slowly future believed. in situation, high house price would accompany increase real consumption house service time but--as long i stay house--by change consumption good services. a second complicate factor many homeowner intend live current house forever. many expect move small houses, condominiums, retirement community get older. these individuals, plan “downsize” house time, truly good house price increase, standard theory would predict increase consumption. at time, many individual currently homes--or small homes--likely plan purchase home increase consumption house service future. these “upsizers” bad house price increase, reduce 4 bi review 100/2001 consumption non-housing good services. the effect change house price desire aggregate consumption depend relative number individual two group marginal propensity consume house wealth. a third factor, chairman greenspan recently emphasized, effect realize capital gain house sell one’s house borrow home equity loan. accumulate home equity liquid asset. in addition, value somewhat uncertain: although general trend real estate price easily observed, nobody receive statement mail say much home worth, nobody look value home newspaper. sell house, get one’s house appraise take home equity loan, convert illiquid home equity uncertain value liquid fund know value. recent experience response monetary policy let turn recent u.s. experience, include macroeconomic consequence movement asset price since mid-1990s response monetary policymakers. a know, second half 1990s saw record-breaking run-up equity value unite states. in early 1995, net worth u.s. household 4-1/2 time after-tax income, quite close average ratio precede quarter century. roughly five year later, early 2000, ratio wealth disposable income peak 6--the high value fifty year comparable wealth data available. now, approach end 2001, wealth-income ratio fall back nearly 5--still bite high historical standard well peak. the primary driver recent development dramatic advance partial retreat value publicly trade equities. between early 1995 peak early 2000, wilshire 5000 stock-price index (which broad measure equity prices) tripled, add nearly $12 trillion wealth u.s. households. since peak, wilshire 5000 drop one-third, correspond loss wealth roughly $6 trillion.5 not recent movement u.s. stock price extremely large, arguably affect household past movement stock market broaden ownership corporate equity unite states. accord survey consumer finances, conduct every three year federal reserve, roughly 32 percent american family own equity 1989 (either directly indirectly mutual funds, retirement accounts, manage assets). by 1998, 49 percent own equity form.6 thus, le decade, unite state evolve society one-third family own stock one one-half family own stocks. during period, value residential real estate rose, slowly steadily value equities. ten year ago, value residential real estate twice value household sector’s corporate equities. a stock price soar 1990s, share equity hold household portfolio surpass share owner-occupied housing. however, recent combination strong house market falter stock market put aggregate house wealth back par aggregate equity wealth. now let turn influence movement asset price conduct monetary policy. the fundamental goal policy achieve maximum sustainable output employment, reach best environment price stability. therefore, federal reserve must take active interest factor affect economic performance, include business consumer confidence, economic growth abroad, foreign exchange value dollar, fiscal policy, and, course, asset prices. we take level stock market account consider economic outlook monetary policy. but let clear: we target particular level equity prices. we attempt simply judge likely influence stock market well important factor level aggregate demand aggregate supply and, hence, economy’s ability achieve price stability maximum sustainable employment. in respect, stock market play role analysis influence outlook. while goal price stability foster favorable environment business investment, make 5 these calculation include equity hold directly equity own indirectly mutual funds, define contribution pension plans, define benefit pension plans, life insurance companies, personal trusts. 6 figure 2001 survey consumer finance yet available. bi review 100/2001 5 pretense able control play stock market. we cannot avoid gauge effect stock market economic performance, target stock prices. the dramatic movement asset price past several year affect aggregate demand and, extent, aggregate supply unite states. in late 1990s, growth rate u.s. labor productivity increase beyond expectation observers. an important source fast pace productivity surge capital spend foster development new technology. fast productivity growth among factor boost equity valuations; turn, large expect productivity advance low cost equity capital provide stimulus investment. the pickup investment combine wealth effect consumption boost aggregate demand. the rapid pace investment also help hold inflationary pressure increase growth productive capacity. however, summer 1999, persistent strength domestic demand tighten resource utilization unite states, especially labor, heighten concern among policymakers inflationary pressure could undermine impressive performance economy. accordingly, federal reserve raise short-term interest rates. the objective bring stock market rather bring growth aggregate demand aggregate supply good alignment. of course, u.s. economy slow sharply. one factor apparent reconsideration expect profitability high-tech sector. this reassessment depress equity price high-tech firms, significantly restrain investment type equipment, substantial contributor previously rapid rate economic growth. slow investment shift positive negative wealth effect consumption significantly damp growth aggregate final demand since late last year. the associate inventory correction accentuate decline production. since september 11 terrorist attacks, heighten uncertainty concern also weigh u.s. economy. these factors, many others, inform decision shift stance monetary policy aggressively reduce target federal fund rate 4-1/2 percentage point since begin year. conclusion hence question asset price influence macroeconomy. they theoretically, clearly seem empirically. but one would think wealth change come investors’ re-evaluation future profit would different effect come interest-rate change change relative price housing. this puzzle should, i feel, loom large research agenda academic economist and, obvious reasons, policy agenda central banks. alan greenspan: the euro international currency remark mr alan greenspan, chairman board governor u federal reserve system, euro 50 group roundtable, washington, 30 november 2001. * * * today i would like address basic consideration confront euro emergence key international currency. i know i follow number contribution relate subject trust comment overlap much already said. an international currency emerge solution economic problem. in world multiple currency multilateral trade, engage cross-border transaction face problem coordinate purchase sale currencies. because sale give currency customer unlikely match nearly simultaneous purchase currency another customer, foreign exchange trader must make customer wait must hold costly inventory currencies. when volume transaction give currency large, however, wait time buy sell order currency typically shorter, small stock currency held. thus, efficiency gain channel international transaction single currency, pass demand supply currency trade involve so-called vehicle. in addition, transaction work vehicle currency, currency become increasingly acceptable international transaction bid-ask spread narrow liquidity increases. because attractiveness vehicle currency grow liquidity increases, international currency tendency become natural monopoly. if underlie demand one two compete vehicle currency falter reason clearly perceive transitory, bid-ask spreads, accordingly, increase relative competition, demand shift competitor. but shift, turn, widen bid-ask spread falter competitor still more, induce shift transaction alternative currency. this process end demise weak currency compete vehicle strong two become sole survive vehicle. however, even emerge international currency displace another, transition draw out, result two vehicle currency exist side side protract period. between two world wars, example, sterling dollar active international currencies. this period, course, clearly transitional, dollar subsequently become dominant. but important factor inhibit emergence persistence single vehicle currency throughout world attraction portfolio diversification. this powerful counterforce, especially currency offer far great opportunity diversification assets. the average price currencies, construction, trendless, tend increase negative covariance within portfolio currencies. in contrast, equity instrument often drive direction, debt instruments; often debt equity price move together. this point bring u question: how currency become international currency? the question particularly intrigue because, reign fiat currencies, answer unlike explanation currency become dominant within country. when gold, silver, commodity normal mean exchange, unit currency define commonly understand weight commodity circulated. soon equivalent warehouse receipt precious metal circulate currency. under commodity standard generally value paper currency financial claim derive value standard. contract write term ounce gold or, conveniently, term unit exchange. the pound sterling, course, originally pound silver. the u.s. dollar originally define legal purpose coinage act 1792 either 0.05 ounce gold 0.77 ounce silver. in today’s world government-issued monies, unit currency not, need be, defined. it circulate legal tender government fiat. it value infer value present future good service command. in international arena, however, overarch sovereign exist decree money. instead, myriad private agent must somehow reach agreement currency use international currency. in modern world fiat currencies, number factor enhance attractiveness currency private agents, make easy settle international currency. first foremost, international currency must perceive sound. to acceptable, market participant must will hold store value. a necessary condition willingness currency’s future value term good service view predictable. loss purchase power tend discourage use currency, excessive price fluctuation raise risk hold it. in addition, currency see viable store value time general uncertainty, attract investor even time uncertain. clearly, many currency meet test; yet emerge international currencies. other factor govern selection among body sound currencies. one strong, competitive economy open to, active in, international trade finance. such economy naturally generate large quantity foreign exchange transaction least one leg home currency support wide-ranging business activity. this factor evidently go long way toward explain dominance dutch guilder seventeenth eighteenth centuries, british pound nineteenth early twentieth centuries, dollar today. another factor presence open well-developed financial system, factor, course, tend part, perhaps necessary part, strong competitive open economy. a well-developed financial system increase attractiveness business currency least two reasons. first, system offer number ancillary service participant international markets, may want borrow invest currency hedge foreign currency positions. to extent activity accomplish efficiently currency, currency attractive currency conduct business. second, deep liquid financial market offer full array instrument service attract business abroad might otherwise stay home. because financial market constraint home barrier efficiency, example, borrow invest abroad international currency exchange proceed domestic currency might cheap conduct transaction directly home currency. thus, currency support well-developed financial system likely encourage great international use, beyond need associate directly international business activity. a consequence, volume gross international capital flow denominate currency likely high, add desirability, regardless whether, net, capital flow positive negative point time. these international currency determinant clearly interrelated. strong financial system tend develop strong economies, well-developed financial system tend enhance economic development. the development economic financial system support soundness domestic currency, turn fee back economic financial activity. so, extent, element bootstrapping here. ultimately, however, currency’s success international arena require success home, strength efficiency home economy home financial system source strength currency. return specific focus conference, clearly euro readily meet key qualification major international currency. indeed, little doubt euro sound currency. the mandate european central bank maintain stable purchase power currency doubtless firm federal reserve major central bank. the economy twelve country embrace euro roughly size u.s. economy, financial system rapidly approach magnitude unite states. continue advance european telecommunication payment system result financial system potential highly integrate across borders. the introduction euro successful implementation target payment system also contribute potential, link firmly financial market continental european countries. the tremendous growth bond market euro area past three year show potential employ successfully. in addition, great depth liquidity financial market euro area facilitate development financial instruments, mutual fund commercial paper. but brief history, euro area financial system difficulty well. expansion across national border important financial markets, equity trade security lending, apparently restrain difficult negotiation regulatory legal differences. a resolution difference would add attractiveness stature euro international arena. many concern euro, however, little euro pertain certain european economic condition affect value currency. follow inception, euro, contrary expectations, decline significantly dollar. through first year euro’s existence, weaken dollar exchange rate widely attributable boom american economy. but, contrary expectations, euro materially strengthen american economy weakened. have endeavor forecast exchange rate half century, i understandably develop significant humility ability area, sentiment i suspect many room share. with caveat mind, i agree hypothesize evident strengthen demand dollar, relative euro, reflect market expectation productivity growth unite state likely great continental europe year ahead. the steady flow capital europe unite state recent year is, presumably, consequence european find many investment unite state persistently attractive home. a i argue forums, outcome may well result important degree particular legal structure custom govern labor relation much europe. for example, decades, europe seek protect worker presume harsh aspect free-market competition. to discourage layoffs, discharge employee make difficult costly compare unite states. by law custom, american employer face far few impediment recent year release employees. this difference important new high-tech world much, most, rate return new technology result cost reduction, consolidate basis largely mean reduction labor costs. consequently, legal restraint ability firm readily implement cost reduction low prospective rate return new technology and, thus, incentive apply them. a result, even though technology available all, intensity application clearly evident unite state country few impediment implementation. a dividend, level employment unite state turn high firm find hire le risky and, hence, will add employee rosters. the persistent strength dollar face unite states’ unsustainable current account deficit underscore impressive propensity accumulate dollar investments, relative denominate euros. i assume previous speaker address as-yet-unfulfilled expectation substantial diversification large hold international portfolio dollars. some analyst predicted, introduction january 1999, euro would rapidly displace part dollar hold many portfolios, include particular official hold reserves. these expectation probably overstated. history show u currency achieve status international vehicle currency, guilder pound previous centuries, establish infrastructure deep liquid market favor continue used. we yet reach three-year mark since euro appear currency--a short time standard international monetary history. a i indicate earlier, see substantial development market euro-denominated bond fixed-income instruments. advancement market slow proceed time. i also note introduction euro create motive diversification dollar investor previously obtain portfolio balance hold several european currencies. a stability exchange rate currency increase late 1990s become absolute january 1999, investor induce substitute dollar regain diversification lose euro-area currency become closely correlated. we leave question international role euro unfold. the attraction invest dollar-denominated asset depend upon relative rate return. to extent capital flow observe europe unite state critical piece story, future determined, least part, success europe match expect rate return u.s. assets. but market pressure toward portfolio diversification clearly also go play major role future relative position dollar euro.

de france “new technology monetary policy”, paris, 30 november 2001. * * * when think new technologies, information communication technology (ict) probably first thing come people’s mind. and, see acceleration diffusion ict equivalent concept ‘new economy’. for purpose conference, i would prefer take wide perspective, new economy see interaction several mutually reinforce factors. these include advance ict, financial innovation liberalisation, globalisation trade, improve function market enhance macroeconomic management. the interplay factor potential raise speed limit economy. that is, new economy operate high growth rate past without generate additional inflation. therefore, initial hype surround new economy pronounce demise business cycle, well elimination new economy together response current economic circumstances, seem misguided. the jury still question whether detect new economy europe. without want prejudge outcome, i would argue intrinsic economic reason expect new economy materialise. so, assume take root, indeed new economy imply monetary policymaker? i couple general observation make. first, new economy influence transmission monetary impulse economy. it argue new economy take le time monetary policy impulse impact inflation output, impact give impulse smaller. since separate panel discussion devote topic, i leave move second observation. that is, policy maker bring new economy. it result private sector behaviour, drive innovative entrepeneurship or, fashionably, ‘creative destruction’. policy general conducive new economy. in market-based economy, private sector decision guide allocative role play price mechanism, perform best environment price stability. hence, monetary policy objective price stability, serve u well old economy, help foster new economic environment. it coincidence, therefore, champion new economy, unite states, achieve great advance era low inflation. a third issue, crucial monetary policymakers, question react new economy. let simplify matter conceptualise new economy shock productivity. the economic consequence shock felt long run well adjustment towards new steady state economy. let start long run.the new equilibrium characterise structurally high growth rate productivity, imply high profitability investments. in order attract capital need finance investments, achieve macro-economic equilibrium, high interest rate needed. the central bank must take upward movement interest rate account formulate monetary policy. before new equilibrium achieved, economy go complex adjustment process. analytically, adjustment involve outward shift aggregate supply curve, imply low inflation high growth. it could also elicit stimulus aggregate demand, example due wealth effects. the latter would imply high inflation high growth. so, depend circumstance stage transition old steady state new one, monetary policy react. it important note monetary strategy eurosystem devise order conduct monetary policy particularly uncertain economic environment. the monetary strategy well-suited, therefore, cope uncertainties, include uncertainty surround effect new economy. a such, definition price stability need alter two-pillar structure continue serve u well. there could, however, need re-assess information content individual variable within pillar. let try illustrate this. 2 bi review 99/2001 advance spread ict lead new form money, i.e. electronic mean payment. anticipate this, electronic money balance hold euro area resident already include definition euro area monetary aggregates. however, new economy could change information content monetary aggregates. for example, electronic money could increase velocity money, people able economise money holdings, access money need spend it. also, structurally high productivity growth eventually lead high trend growth euro area. in due time, effect could independently elicit adjustment reference value m3. this issue cover yearly review reference value m3 ecb govern council. under first pillar, valuable information also distil counterpart broad money, credit variables. the development new financial instrument could change information content variables. for example, securitisation place bank asset outside bank balance sheets, could complicate observation central bank credit flows. in second pillar, new economy could widen range useful indicators, i.e. wealth effect gain importance. the information content indicator must re-evaluated order take account possible increase speed limit economy. the new economy could, example, lead downward adjustment nairu – non-accelerating inflation rate unemployment. at time, variable measure current economic situation could become important, first reveal new economy land europe. let conclude three key points. first, new economy could have, view have, important implication monetary transmission. second, implication new economy conduct monetary policy clear-cut. especially transitional period new economy. what clear, however, price stability remain heart central banking. third, ecb monetary policy strategy well-suited take uncertainty surround new economy account policy-making. there reason amend two-pillar structure account new economy. within pillars, assessment incoming information continue evaluated. this exemplify art monetary policymaking, ‘old’ ‘new’ economy. bi review 99/2001 1 yutaka yamaguchi: the economic situation monetary policy japan1 speech mr yutaka yamaguchi, deputy governor bank japan, economic seminar japan research institute, tokyo,

stop deteriorate fiscal 2002 overseas economy start recover fiscal 2002. even case, time need clear sign recovery confirm price expect continue decline gradually fiscal year 2001 2002. this outlook clearly involve high degree uncertainty exist upside downside risk baseline scenario. among risk factor need watch closely 1) development overseas economies, especially u.s., it-related industries; 2) development financial market home abroad, especially stock prices; 3) impact structural reform economy, fiscal consolidation, npl disposal. ii. problem price decline if consumer price index falls, albeit modestly, fiscal year 2001 2002, post-war record continuous decline three years. to consider relation price monetary policy, need examine factor behind price decline. the project continuous decline price cause two factors. the first downward pressure price bring weak demand. give baseline scenario i mention earlier, output gap economy likely widen fiscal 2002. the second downward pressure supply side, example, import low-priced goods, deregulation, streamline distribution channels. these two kind pressure important factor behind price decline. but relation short-term economic outlook, concern downward pressure generate weak demand gradually intensify. 1 english translation prepare bank’s staff base japanese original. 2 bi review 99/2001 this analysis price decline mean bank worry pressure due weak demand supply side. the bank well aware necessity stop continuous price decline view severe economic situation, take strong monetary ease measure unprecedented history central banking. then, problem current continuous price decline? a loss price stability, regardless whether due deflation inflation, could cause follow problems. firstly, price stable, signal function price work properly efficient resource allocation hampered; secondly, uncertainty heighten make difficult economic agent take decision future. in words, fluctuation price interfere important function market mechanism: resource allocation. we examine whether ongoing gradual price decline could cause problems. however, bank’s recent concern danger vicious circle might generate price decline: deflationary spiral emerge price decline lead recession turn trigger fall prices. a deflationary spiral develop various reason background common various contract economic transaction mostly agree fix nominal value cannot adjust flexibly price declines. i explain focus three economic variables: interest rates, debts, wages. the first point concern interest rates, so-called “zero interest rate constraint.” currently, market interest rate zero, short-term rates, bank control policy, virtually zero cannot decline further. once nominal interest rate decline zero, room leave monetary policy affect aggregate demand level price low nominal interest rate and, consequently, real interest rates. the second point concern debts. debt hold firm household usually fix nominal value, cannot adjust price declines. hence, repayment debt become difficult price decline corporate sale and/or household income decrease. to make matter worse, japan face associate problem excessive debt corporate sector large amount npls bank sector. the gravity debt problem aggravate heavy debt burden due price decline hamper recovery economy. in past, case credit contract substantially economy deflationary spiral, due vicious circle increase debt burden interact price decline. the third point concern wages. nominal wage downward rigidity. in general, corporate profit decrease case nominal wage remain rigid sale decrease due price decline. in japan, nominal wage adjust certain amount flexibility careful analysis need examine whether wage rigidity exert downward pressure corporate profit heighten risk fall deflationary spiral. from i say clear development nominal income, include corporate profit employee’s income, important yardstick judge whether economy fall deflationary spiral. for example, 2000, despite negative inflation rates, profit firm mark increase 34 percent, employee’s income one percent. therefore, probability economy fall deflationary spiral low. after turn year, situation change begin give cause concern, corporate profit start decrease year-on-year increase wage remain negative since summer 2001. thus, although pace price decline almost calendar year 2000 2001, implication different year. be high probability japan’s economy fall deflationary spiral future? in outlook report october, policy board members’ assessment that, fiscal 2002, economic growth remain negative price continue decline. however, assessment include emergence deflationary spiral assume deterioration economy would stop second half fiscal 2002 overseas economy start recover. that baseline scenario associate downside risk factor forgotten. if recall early explanation deflationary spirals, i deep concern development corporate profit financial system problem situation nominal short-term interest rate reach zero. in sense, cannot totally rule possibility economy fall deflationary spiral, situation warrant vigilant monitoring. bi review 99/2001 3 iii. effect limit current monetary ease measure a. outline current monetary ease measure the bank japan take strong monetary ease measure central bank ever adopt before, background bank’s severe economic outlook. the framework current monetary ease measure summarize follow four points. first, main target market operation change overnight call rate amount outstanding current account bank. in addition, new target raise four trillion yen five trillion yen march, six trillion yen august. since september, response surge liquidity demand trigger terrorist attack u.s., bank provide market ample liquidity “aiming six trillion yen” without set upper limit. a result, amount outstanding current account bank average 9.2 trillion yen september 8.8 trillion yen october reserve maintenance period. second, bank commit continue mention framework monetary operation rate increase cpi rise remain stably zero percent. this commitment aim drive interest rate long maturity clearly state bank continue current monetary ease measure future. this monetary ease effect often call “the commitment effect” “the duration effect.” third, bank decide could increase outright purchase long-term japanese government bond (jgbs) bank find necessary smoothly provide ample liquidity market, condition amount outstanding long-term jgb hold within amount outstanding banknote issued. in accordance framework, august bank increase amount frequency jgb outright purchase twice month amount 400 billion yen three time month amount 600 billion yen. fourth, bank establish so-called lombard-type lend facility. by utilize scheme, financial institutions, certain conditions, able borrow fund bank official discount rate long eligible collateral. this measure strengthen monetary ease effect sense financial institution ensure access ample liquidity money market interest rate stabilized. the official discount rate, apply lombard-type lend facility, low twice 2001, february september, currently 0.1 percent. b. the strong monetary ease effect financial market current monetary policy achieve extremely easy condition financial markets. in money markets, short-term interest rates, include long one term instruments, decline low level zero-interest-rate period 1999-2000. since unit transaction overnight call rate change 0.01 percent 0.001 percent early september, rate decline low 0.001 percent 0.004 percent, microscopic world indeed. in bond markets, interest rate jgbs continue move level close historical low although decline level mark march year. furthermore, medium-term interest rates, jgbs five year remain maturity, move 0.4-0.5 percent, low level march. in cp corporate bond markets, credit spread narrow decline short- medium-term interest rate investor become will take risks. therefore, demand issuance new security firm relatively high credit rat increase amount outstanding issuance cp corporate bond maintain high level. in japan, share corporate finance capital market still relatively small. however, become important channel monetary ease measure permeate economy credit intermediation function bank weakened. by contrast, effect current policy asset price stock price foreign exchange rate relatively limited. although stock price rise somewhat announcement monetary ease measure march year, decline steadily may onward reflect deterioration business condition successive downward revision outlook corporate profits. stock price show positive response increase outstanding balance 4 bi review 99/2001 current account bank since august. foreign exchange rate yen also depreciate compare level march, u.s. economy show faster-than-expected slowdown. c. ease effect corporate household sector the crucial point assess current monetary policy whether ample provision liquidity bank consequent ease financial market affect economic entity outside financial market corporate household sectors. regrettably, ease effect fully permeate economy. the monetary base, sum banknote current account bank, increase 14 percent year-on-year basis. however, growth rate money supply 3.6 percent basis, somewhat high begin year, mainly due shift fund mature postal savings. more serious fact bank lend contract 1.9 percent year-on-year pace decline accelerate somewhat. gdp price condition also show improvement. business capital spend house construction seem stimulate historically low interest rates. iv. the monetary policy price a. be deflation monetary phenomenon? i return reason behind weak response economy strong monetary ease policy. instead, here, i would like pose question: be fair say insufficient monetary ease cause continuous price decline stagnant economic growth? for example, often hear argument “both inflation deflation monetary phenomenon price decline stop increase money supply,” simplify form quantitative theory money. be kind argument correct? a part argument “both inflation deflation monetary phenomena” hold long-term economic relationship amount money change significantly. in fact, policy objective many central bank include bank, attain “price stability,” base understand relationship. however, relationship hold sufficiently long period time interpret sort definitional identical relationship. therefore, practical level, cannot apply conduct monetary policy. the first problem argument that, i mention above, make clear distinction relationship long term short term. for example, look relation money prices, close relationship emerge amount money increase decrease extremely large scale dominant impact: the hyper-inflation experience germany world war i one example. when amount money increase decrease certain extent extremely large scale, loose relationship observe look sufficiently long term. however, period one year couple years, unless amount money increase decrease extremely large scale i explained, relationship money price stable. the second problem present underlie mechanism argument work theoretically assumed: central bank’s effort expand liquidity, current account balance bank monetary base, increase money supply broad sense, liquidity hold corporate household sectors, and, consequently, push price level business activity. needle say, monetary policy cannot actually resort drop banknote sky--this kind policy call “helicopter money” economics textbooks. if policy implemented, people rush purchase good service receive cash, price expect rise immediately. however, actual monetary policy, money broad sense provide series “transactions”: central bank purchase financial asset government bond financial institutions, turn create money narrow sense, current account balance central bank, financial institution make lend security investment. however, happen currently japan’s economy that, although fund abundant financial markets, permeate outside markets, is, corporate household sector money supply increase sufficiently. this cause result stagnant growth expenditure decline prices. give mechanism increase money work properly, i think follow logical step ignore reality argue increase money could solve problems. bi review 99/2001 5 a i mentioned, various factor affect movement prices, fundamental factor determine price development balance aggregate demand supply good services. a supply capacity change slowly, movement demand mainly determine short-term supply-demand balance. in fact, time-series data japanese economy, price begin rise economic growth rate recover output gap narrows. statistical analysis dynamic correlation economic growth rate rate increase price show correlation coefficient high economic growth one two year ahead consumer price increase. on hand, rate increase price seem lead economic growth rate. in discussion, clear order halt continuous decline prices, important promote sustainable, temporary, growth aggregate demand. the implementation monetary policy bank far aim halt decline price provide ample liquidity market low interest rate thereby stimulate aggregate demand. the current difficulty conduct monetary policy cannot stimulate aggregate demand even measure employed. we need face fact. b. inflation target currently japan, often hear argument call adoption inflation targeting. however, argument peculiar sense focus first raise price use every measure. i believe devise way stimulate economic activity first price nature result economic activity. with understand environment surround price development monetary policy, bank currently reluctant accept recent argument inflation targeting. more fundamentally, inflation target regard short-term policy tool framework improve transparency conduct monetary policy. a possible tool improve transparency, bank consider inflation target worth examine one option future. however, currently, short-term interest rate already reach zero percent, bank option monetary easing. in addition, effect current monetary ease policy limit npl problem. in circumstances, unlikely adoption ambitious target improve confidence monetary policy. at point, i would expect counter-argument however limit room available additional monetary easing, adoption inflation target directly affect “expectation” economic agent produce inflation expectations. i would admit “expectation” one important channel effect monetary policy permeate economy. however, control “expectation” solely announce policy unlikely succeed. i think bank affect people’s expectation announcement accompany effective policy measures. the bank fact already strongly affect people’s expectation promise continue current monetary ease framework year-on-year increase cpi rise remain stably zero percent. in fact, i mentioned, interest rate jgb five year remain maturity currently 0.4-0.5 percent. this interest rate level clearly indicate market participant expect current historically low interest rate continue extend period time. in spite market development, actual expect inflation rate show sign upward movement. i understand argue bank cause inflation purchase kind assets. i touch upon issue later. a example successful introduction inflation targeting, cite price level target adopt sweden first half 1930s. we bank also interest swedish experience study it. what find great similarity swedish policy bank’s current policy framework. the important similarity that, swedish authority bank japan declare firm determination prevent price declines, neither adopt numerical target. in swedish comprehensive program price stability, state “monetary policy tie systematically particular index figure. a formal simple rule monetary policy appear feasible.” more specifically, riksbank, swedish central bank, stress importance carefully monitor various price index take account economic variable inventory figure productivity data. it state implementation policy 6 bi review 99/2001 depend specific price index cpi. therefore, clear distinction make swedish policy idea overcome deflation adopt rigid price target scheme use specific price index. when compare sweden 1930s japan’s current situation, careful critical difference two regard economic financial environments. the significant difference following: (1) swedish economy time, level nominal interest rate relatively high sufficient room interest rate cuts, (2) swedish financial system face serious problem, (3) relatively small open economy, depreciation currency foreign exchange market contribute prevention price falls. in sum, difficulty apply specific measure use sweden 1930s current situation japan. v. why japan’s economy able exit deflation now, i would like raise question: what kind economic policy require exit ongoing deflation, japan’s economy unable so? a i already mentioned, three factor particular stand important: constraint impose zero nominal interest rates, npl problem, weaken sentiment. a. constraint zero nominal interest rate first let u consider constraint impose zero nominal interest rates. short-term interest rate already virtually zero, five-year interest rate also decline close zero--the term debt finance japanese firm many case five year less. a standard mechanism monetary ease is: (1) induce decline short-term interest rate provide ample liquidity money market, (2) thereby influence financial variable medium- long-term interest rates, stock prices, foreign exchange rates, (3) consequently, expect change financial variable affect behavior financial institutions, firm households. now nominal interest rate reach point decline possible, monetary ease also reach point little additional effect expected. moreover, real interest rate could rise price decline continue economic setting. by way, face limit monetary ease zero interest rate constraints, kind mean massive amount liquidity provision financial market have? it premature give definite answer question. the current policy adopt bank unique try countries. the effect policy, especially situation serious problem exist financial sector, assess empirically accumulate sufficient experience data draw concrete conclusions. at time, mean clues. one example surge liquidity demand financial market associate increase outstanding balance current account bank terrorist attack us. the surge liquidity demand take place u.s. also country major central bank include bank provide huge amount liquidity order secure stability financial markets. while federal reserve european central bank return normality term liquidity provision within week, japan, contrast, liquidity demand continue high. it appear two factor work here. the first factor wan incentive invest lend fund market decline uncollateralized overnight call rate 0.001 percent. thus, financial institution hold excess fund would prefer deposit current account bank even bear interest. once behavior spread market participants, borrower feel worry might able borrow fund markets, subsequently, increase number financial institution start defensively accumulate fund current account bank. the second factor fact cost yen fund yen-u.s. dollar swap become negative foreign banks. foreign bank capable fund yen negative interest rate earn interest margin without worry credit risk deposit fund current account bank. in case, negative yen fund rate work “sweetener” give incentive foreign bank provide japanese bank dollar funds. these two factors, disincentive invest money market negative yen fund costs, give u interest insight mean current market operation ample liquidity bi review 99/2001 7 provide current account balance operate target. that say, disincentive lend fund market largely cause ample liquidity provision bank. at time, major reason bank provide ample liquidity without face under-subscription open market operation demand foreign bank excess reserves, expect lead revitalization economic activity. of course, still cannot deny possibility demand excess reserve lead change portfolio economic entity ultimately stimulate economic activity long run. the bank closely examine possibility continue current massive provision liquidity. b. the npl problem the second reason japan’s economy unable exit ongoing deflation npl problem. it case npls dispose of, deflation end, economy recover right away. i think widely understand disposal npls rather associate short-term pain. it also true, however, economy recovers, npls decrease. sustainable economic growth cannot expect situation large amount npls remain credit intermediation function fully, follow reasons. first all, case, financial institution face risk capital impair external factor decline stock price emergence new npls follow downturn economy. capital last line defense unexpected risk losses. it difficult management financial institution take risk concern capital position. from macroeconomic point view, sustainable economic growth may achieve continuously favorable external condition require delicate policy management. secondly, npl disposal completed, difficult adjust lend rate level adequately reflect risk return. currently japanese bank compete one another lend blue-chip company credit spread become extremely narrow. on hand, japanese bank cautious extend new loan firm low credit rat bank increase credit spread adequately lend exist le creditworthy borrowers. in current situation, bank drastically increase credit spreads, borrower likely go bankrupt bank pay price end. however, long-term perspective, unless lend rate set economically rational manner, lend attitude financial institution cannot aggressive consequently hard achieve sustainable economic growth. c. weaken sentiment the third reason deflationary trend japan weaken sentiment. look households, expenditure restrain reflect anxiety future include viability social security system employment concerns. in corporate sector, investment appetite recede partly economic stagnation low expect rate growth. i understand list weaken sentiment part background deflation sound like talk two side coin. but i think current weak demand cannot fully explain zero interest rate constraint npl problem remain kind residual factor explain weaken sentiment. such decline demand cause weaken sentiment hardly solve unless people become confident economy return clear recovery path. at time, consider state typical household firms, i think difficult deny that, together stagnate economy, various institutional barrier hamper challenge spirit. for example, corporate sector, public corporation deprive private institution business, review legal, taxation, regulation system cope era globalization lag behind. a household sector, consumption seem stagnate due uncertainty future cause problem relate social security system pension benefit health care system. vi. conduct monetary policy i talk various issues, focus decline prices. finally, base discussion, i would like talk bank japan do, i expect government, responsible economic policy monetary policy. 8 bi review 99/2001 a. the role bank japan should play first, role bank japan play. i would like reemphasize bank government share goal prevent decline price bring economy back sustainable growth path soon possible. base precede discussion, i would like express think role bank play. first all, although may sound like something go without saying, current monetary ease policy tenaciously continued. the effect current strong monetary easy measure fully permeate real economy. but positive movement accordance progress structural reform npl disposal improvement productivity economy, expect monetary ease policy support movement powerful effects. it extremely important tenacious maintain current monetary ease conditions, could support positive movement economy appears. the second role provision liquidity swift timely manner. should uncertainty concern financial market one reason another, liquidity provide swift timely manner, uncertainty concern disrupt markets. it one central bank’s important role maintain stability financial market financial system liquidity provision. maintain stability also important make effect monetary ease continuously permeate economy. now, could monetary policy do, economic condition deteriorate risk deflationary spiral heighten result? the bank aware argument bank increase outright purchase long-term jgbs also purchase asset foreign-currency denominate assets, stock even npls prevent deflation. a i already express think issue different occasion, i reiterate conclusion follow three points. first, give increase amount liquidity give limit stimulus economy, major benefit purchase asset mainly influence prices. if, however, one expect influence asset change supply-demand balance thereby produce effect monetary easing, purchase must do large scale. second, taxpayer may ultimately pay price possible loss result large-scale purchase also affect microeconomic resource allocation. and third, policy imply central bank would conduct activity close enter domain fiscal policy. the basic rule democratic society fiscal policy use taxpayer’s money need approve part budget parliament compose member elect people. i worry inflation deflation concern, claim policy purchase various asset discuss publicly context governance democratic society. b. the role government should play a i mention earlier, government bank share common goal prevent price decline bring economy back path sustainable growth soon possible. the role government play also quite large. the first role foster business condition competitive attractive order induce business fix investment. to this, important deregulate, review taxation system drastically, ensure reform public corporation progress steadily. another important challenge relieve anxiety household future review social security system, include pension benefits. furthermore, i would like reemphasize importance ensure npl disposal proceed expeditiously smoothly possible. the follow point need bear mind. progress economic fiscal structural reform npl disposal likely lead decline demand exert downward pressure price level short term. on hand, positive outcome structural reform bear fruit lead increase productivity economy whole, significant mean prevent price decline revitalization economic activity. when consider economic issues, always check viewpoint aggregate demand productivity. of course, aggregate demand productivity independent other. even growth rate recover result inefficient public investment, productivity could fall consumption expenditure could reduce due concern future tax burden. on bi review 99/2001 9 hand, growth rate decline substantially, firm reduce business fix investment r&d expenditure necessary improve productivity future. whether put emphasis aggregate demand productivity need judge objectively base economic conditions. no matter emphasis put, economic consequence need objectively recognize share among people. give price decline inevitably continue extent structural reform proceeds, policy initiative focus prevent decline price lead deflationary spiral. monetary policy, go without saying, must play important role efforts. on hand, limit achieve monetary policy alone. improvement social safety net measure secure employment necessary prevent sharp decline consumption. it essential stability financial system whole secure npl disposal push forward. finally, one important issue role fiscal policy play. john maynard keynes assert liquidity trap, monetary policy lose effectiveness fiscal policy necessary. however, scope mobilize fiscal policy limit japan give high level public debt. i would like expect that, give capacity additional fiscal outlay limited, government review component expenditure drastically. it widely accept internationally function built-in stabilizer utilize recession. give current economic situation country, i think worth examining, leave room function work. in conclude speech today, i would like add that, bank continue utmost nation’s central bank provide foundation stable sustainable growth japan’s economy. thank attention. bi review 99/2001 1 m r pridiyathorn devakula: how central bank see monetary policy new world economic environment speech mr m r pridiyathorn devakula, governor bank thailand, make shangri-la hotel, bangkok, 29 november 2001. * * * your excellency distinguish guest lady gentlemen, introduction i would like thank thailand board investment, department export promotion tourism, well nation group invite speak conference. i believe important time increase global uncertainty bank thailand share public assessment current economic situation outlook, well think future course monetary policy. the opportunity today therefore timely greatly appreciated. in short, today i would like discus i see challenge face thailand period ahead we, bank thailand, prepare meet challenges. in doing, i briefly review progress past months, say word appropriate policy mix need implement help steer thai economy difficult times. the new world environment let begin outline two key aspect current world economic environment i think important. the first one fundamental concern close degree financial economic integration countries. globalization world economy drive variety force include rise trade goods, increase international capital flows, great technological spillovers, grow labor mobility. while factor bring efficient allocation resource across national border facilitate high growth development across countries, also create world environment shock become global nature crisis one country easily affect others. the end product great international economic interdependencies, especially financial markets, therefore enhancement underlie international business cycle linkages. which bring second aspect world economic environment i would like touch today. this aspect concern immediate state world economy. the globalization information technology (it) production mean correction unsustainable boom it spend particularly widespread impact world economy. all major industrialize country experience synchronize slowdown business cycles, adversely affect country asian region rely heavily export high-tech products. these development accompany steep decline growth world trade. fall commodity price increase competition world market also put pressure external sector exporter grapple weak volume low prices. finally, re-pricing asset world equity bond market create unfavorable condition raise capital have, extent, hold back consumption negative wealth effects. access world capital market become limit develop country observe major reduction capital flow countries. over past months, external environment seem deteriorate quite considerably. the event september 11th development thereafter put global financial market edge exacerbate already weak u economy, primarily effect consumer confidence. global demand continue stagnate difficulty latin america heighten market uncertainty, increase investor’s risk aversion tighten finance emerge markets. in situation, important government come forward play major role stabilize support economy. in light, i believe authority thailand do 2 bi review 99/2001 commendable job provide economy timely fiscal support adhere fiscal discipline. fiscal policy expansionary decision increase budget spend year warranted. the central government deficit 159 billion baht (equivalent 3.2 percent gdp) 2001 fiscal year provide need support economic activity budget disbursement rate 88.4 percent relative target 89 percent improvement past. in regard monetary policy, global slowdown heighten market uncertainty increase thailand’s external vulnerability prompt bank thailand pay increase attention issue external stability; particularly balance payment international reserves. healthy outlook country’s external financial position always useful maintain investor’s confidence time great uncertainty. the one time increase 14-day repurchase rate june 2.5 percent partly intend foster increase support thailand’s external stability face challenge global environment. indeed, since distortion interest rate structure corrected, negative differential domestic international interest rate reversed, capital outflow seem decelerated, baht become stable, real effective exchange rate continue competitive, level international reserve remain comfortable level, reserve short-term debt ratio high 140%, inflationary pressure well contained-headline inflation third quarter stand 1.5 percent year year, core inflation remain well target 1.6 percent. with firm position macroeconomic stability, economy expect grow around 1.3-1.8 percent year. however, economic recovery process remain fragile undermine weaken global environment well decline consumer confidence. look future: more do go forward, i believe face significant challenges. unfortunately press concern also happen one least control of, external demand. with uncertainty regard time economic recovery unite states, japan still undergo real arduous reforms, europe yet step locomotive engine resumption world growth, prospect export lead rebound remain clouded. with region together constitute 52 percent market share thai products, export 2001 expect fall value approximately 6 percent compare last year. assume economic rebound us, japan, europe mid-2002, export grow around 3-5 percent 2002. real gdp growth project 1-3 percent 2002. against backdrop increase uncertainty weak external demand, safeguard economic recovery require steady resolve, reliance domestic demand, supportive set measure reform. the main challenge local authority ensure proper coordination fiscal monetary policy well acceleration structural reform effort bank corporate sector facilitate pickup domestic demand, enhance confidence, bolster foreign investment. mr. bosworth mention yesterday resolve crisis, bad loan must place asset management company amcs must get rid them. this one top priority policy government. almost npls government bank transfer amcs, multi-creditor npls private commercial bank transfer tamc. and speed effort clear out. however, please inform similar financial crisis occur u 1982, u economy bad shape thailand experience past four years. at time, japan, europe middle-eastern economy strong contribute certain capital flow u economy. but now, current world economic conditions, every country problem solve, know well cannot expect foreign investor help u clear npl mess, help ourselves. i see cannot it. and it. back economic forecast next year. one important source growth 2002 fiscal spending, project central government deficit 224 billion baht 4.4 percent gdp strike good balance improve economic infrastructure, raise external competitiveness, foster economic recovery. it important, however, fiscal stimulus program meet spend target. bi review 99/2001 3 safeguard recovery would require timely well effective disbursement 58 billion baht emergency spend plan. the propose reduction corporate tax rate company seek list stock market well already listed, postponement restoration vat rate september 2002 set stage support revival domestic demand. additional stimulus come 71.3 billion baht village fund design boost investment facilitate job creation rural areas. it important emphasize plan increase fiscal spend compromise government’s commitment fiscal discipline. total public debt remain 60 percent gdp debt service (principle interest) account le 16 percent budget. in regard monetary policy, inflation target framework give bank thailand sufficient flexibility respond quickly fast change domestic external developments. with inflation remain subdue likely remain contain range 1.5-2.5 percent 2002, emphasis near future strike proper balance domestic growth external stability. while current stance monetary policy inflation target framework emphasis external stability accommodative appropriate give current conditions, bank thailand constantly monitor development move decisively circumstance change. in light information currently available, background bank thailand’s long-run goal price stability sustainable economic growth, i believe risk present weight mainly toward condition may generate economic weakness foreseeable future. such weakness could come retrenchment business consumer confidence, undershoot fiscal expenditure targets, slow expect recovery industrialize countries. whatever risk ultimately materializes, would make timely decisive adjustment monetary policy. with strong international reserves, 140% short-term debt, afford adjust monetary policy support growth, needed. at juncture, i would like stress bank thailand remain commit open transparent monetary policy framework serve u well since may 2000. let emphasize inflation target framework, rule. just case real-life anchor, inflation target keep economy desire growth path long run, permit respond short run unpredictable tide currents. a long inflation rate within target range, i believe monetary policy allow sufficient flexibility address challenge currently face economy. give supportive policy mix, recovery process thailand remain track next year. however, monetary policy gear safeguard recovery keep sight external stability, fiscal discipline impose limit government spending, much room maneuver domestic front. to substantially improve long term profitability, increase investor confidence, enhance success economic recovery, nation also need unify pursuit real corporate restructuring, improve financial sector discipline reform, well strong legal framework resolution debt negotiation restructuring. need close regional cooperation in addition, growth outlook remain dependent, importantly, revival world demand improve global financial environment. in respect substantial risk uncertainty persist, world remain vulnerable unexpected developments. this possibility must consider prepare for. we must therefore consider possibility meet challenge may arise face deteriorate external environment. such alternative would ideally incorporate increase close cooperation among government regional level. this make good sense since country asian region open nature would feel impact slacken world demand. there certainly seem scope close coordinate effort improve resilience economy external shocks. a previously mentioned, one major vulnerability lie area capital flow, especially develop countries. in regard, regional swap arrangement already sign number country step right direction. by strengthen credibility central banks, arrangement scope impart positive impact term reduce volatility regional 4 bi review 99/2001 financial markets. in light large pool save international reserve region currently has, may room initiative front. in addition, seem scope good mobilize regional save improve intra-regional capital flows. in past, save rate country asia-pacific region high. but save channel first unite state europe eventually return asia. i believe look way good channel regional save help cushion country excess volatility capital flows. i glad yesterday mr. kuroda propose establishment co-operation capital flow streamline foreign exchange policy among asean plus three group. thailand welcome move would help reduce excess volatility capital flow country region, also provide exchange rate stability support intra regional trade, constitute 50% exports. we will move forward asean plus three direction. you may take official response, i already discuss issue minister finance. conclusion lady gentlemen, before ending, i would like emphasize thailand gain significant grind since aftermath 1997 crisis. macroeconomic stability restored, progress achieve financial restructure strengthen bank supervision, external vulnerability substantially reduced. at juncture, however, room complacency. the key challenge face authority maintain macroeconomic stability accelerate pace reform amidst global slowdown heighten market uncertainty. through careful management domestic policies, great regional cooperation, well consolidation restructure efforts, thailand surround region weather global slowdown return sustainable growth path. i would like thank opportunity address distinguish forum wish best. thank you. bi review 98/2001 1 ernst welteke: germany financial centre – european perspective japanese market lecture mr ernst welteke, president deutsche bundesbank, finanzplatz-dinner, tokyo, 29 november 2001. * * * i lady gentlemen, first all, i would like thank sincerely opportunity speak distinguish audience. it always pleasure tokyo. i especially appreciate opportunity discus financial elite japan chance prospect germany financial centre. look financial centre germany (which call “finanzplatz deutschland”), take european perspective. germany eleven european state form european monetary union european central bank locate frankfurt. this union one month completion. on january 1st, note coin single european currency circulated. european able pay bill use single domestic currency twelve member state eurosystem. for man street, sea-change. in economic terms, however, cash changeover virtually minor-event. europe de facto common currency single monetary policy nearly three year now. the eu develop common market half century. however, member state closely-knit economic network (almost) use currency own. in 1999, economic financial integration make huge leap forward, eleven – greece joined, twelve – country decide embark common currency. ii clearly, enlarge currency area integration process utmost importance growth stability german economy expansion financial market germany. therefore, let start figure euro area. it size population, roughly 300 million people, quite similar unite states. the twelve country twelve national governments. people euro area speak eleven native languages. the euro area open three large currency area – unite states, japan europe. japan unite state important non-european trade partners. 17 per cent gdp six-and-a-half billion euro generate exports, current account roughly balance. the euro area generate almost one-fifth world exports. average per caput gdp stand somewhat € 20,000 (roughly y 2.2 million), third le japan. difference individual country considerable. the public sector share euro-area economy account nearly fifty per cent gdp, aggregate budget show small deficit. aggregate gross public sector debt stand 70 per cent gdp. individual country figures, however, differ. for instance, gross public sector debt range four per cent gdp (luxembourg) 100 per cent gdp (belgium, italy). heterogeneity fact life euro area. but homogeneity far outweigh heterogeneity one crucial respect: unite intention form integrate europe common market strong reliable partner world economy. germany 82 million inhabitant 28 per cent euro area’s combine population. germany’s share domestic product third euro area. in term foreign direct investment trade, german economy even intertwine world economy euro area. about third national income generate exports. this share may even rise integration central eastern european states. within foreseeable future, neighbour country join european union maybe also 2 bi review 98/2001 monetary union. germany, moment still border territory euro area, become geographical centre union. since country midst catching-up process, clearly benefit dynamic economies. iii i well aware important effect currency union market performance – mainly degree price stability achieved. at start, eurosystem saw period hitherto unprecedented price stability. in 1998 1999, consumer price rise 1.1 per cent; year 2000, inflation rate, 2.3 per cent, run little two-per cent ceiling wake sharp increase oil prices. this year, peak may 3.4 per cent, inflation rate decreasing. in october, price 2.4 per cent high year before. in current environment weak world economy, ecb govern council expect moderation price increases. at meet november 8, govern council therefore decide cut rate half percentage point. it low key interest rate year 150 basis points, 3.25 per cent. a generally stable currency, market trust stability-orientation central bank, make low price increase time crisis. in brief history, eurosystem already deal successfully three external shock crises. we witness asian crisis 1997-99, oil-price shock 1999-2000 and, recently, terrorist attack usa. europe escape unscathed events. however, low level turbulence within euro area contrast sharp reaction similar event period emu existed. this mean withstand regard worst-case scenario new currency. the european currency area exhibit great macroeconomic stability, benefit citizens, also benefit world economy large. iv three year life, euro second important currency world. it take role deutschmark. the euro share roughly 13 per cent international currency reserve – much deutschmark before. in field, dollar unchallenged leader, two-thirds international reserves. the size, depth liquidity dollar markets, well widespread habit use dollar intervention price commodities, explain predominance. the need diversify grow importance european financial market make rise share euro reserve central banks‘ portfolio possible. a regard use store value, find evidence grow importance euro. 30 per cent international security outstanding denominate euro. this share slightly aggregate share predecessor currency shortly emu launched. that leaf euro second-most-important currency international security markets. again, dollar dominant currency, account one-half international security outstanding. the currency composition international bank asset present similar picture. again, dollar lead currency, share 40 per cent, euro process catch up. from slightly le one-quarter end 1998, share rise 27 per cent. what see figures? although habit international use currency change gradually, euro already respectable market share. it market share roughly equal economic weight euro area. further progress development broad, deep liquid financial market precondition expansion euro’s international role. increase international use euro, currency international reserve holdings, investment finance purposes, might bear monetary policy, potential impact seem manageable. hence, eurosystem, adopt neutral stance towards internationalisation euro. we regard market-driven process, neither hind foster it. bi review 98/2001 3 v the function european monetary union depend heavily high degree financial market integration. it smooth function enable monetary transmission work. progress field tremendous, yet come. correspondingly, financial market benefit common european currency felt clearly. the implication euro obvious: rise liquidity, deepen widen money, bond stock markets, reduction transaction cost abolition currency risks. the euro speed financial market integration. those part european financial market crucial transmission eurosystem’s monetary policy already integrate satisfaction. the wholesale market interbank liquidity euro area actually single european money market. in addition, european bank interconnect common payment-system infrastructure. and improvement euro-area-wide payment system undertaken. a day ago, bundesbank launch new payment system rtgsplus (real time gross settlement), improve security, reduce liquidity need expedite settlement large-value gross payments. through system, 8,500 bank credit institutions, include branch world, accessible. vi the impressive progress, term integration, witness euro-area bond markets. yield difference among government bond different participant narrow five percentage point emu 30 basis point now. the remain spread mainly due vary liquidity paper issued. currency risk divergent monetary policy long disturb euro-area-wide diversification. in term outstanding amounts, euro-denominated bond market still significantly small denominate u dollars. but term new issuance, market par. one reason sharp rise new issuance corporate bonds. here again, diversification within euro area increased. the issuers' nationality, determinant yield performance bonds, supersede factors, especially sectoral view. country diversification substitute industry diversification. the volume german government bond second europe italian bonds. nevertheless, ten-year german government bond, know “bund”, enjoy benchmark status emu low yield remarkably liquid market. the “bund” main underlie product contract eurex, derivative exchange frankfurt. since three-quarters bond future trade europe euro-bund futures, eurex become far lead derivative exchange world. with almost 500 million contracts, eurex clearly outperform derivative exchanges. eurex good example international attractiveness german capital markets. more 60 per cent participant eurex non-germans. look corporate bonds, recognise emergence "high-yield" bond segment europe especially germany. corporates become increase popular among issuer investors. in way, firm become independent bank finance investor esteem high yield opportunity diversify. much new issuance generate high growth rate segment. the volume non-public bond germany sixth correspond figure usa, twice much european country. a speciality german capital market mortgage-backed bond municipal bond know “pfandbriefe”. both kind asset-backed-security. the german “pfandbrief” become popular european country copy idea. investor gain additional yield public bonds, without much risk. about 38 per cent issuer triple-a-rated. “pfandbriefe” issue large volume place internationally. there three development increase german bond markets’ attractiveness issuer investors: (cid:1)(cid:2)a high turnover therefore increase liquidity, 4 bi review 98/2001 (cid:1)(cid:2)many new issuance therefore opportunity diversify, (cid:1)(cid:2)a wide range products, therefore chance satisfy need investors. vii a bond markets, investor equity market shift perspective country benchmark pan-european sector benchmarks. european equity market still small compare usa. the market capitalisation domestic shares, ratio gdp, reach 90 per cent. the match figure usa japan 152 per cent 68 per cent, respectively. however, equity market euro area grow fast. the ratio new issuance market capitalisation average 4 per cent. this twice much achieve usa japan. germany outperform within euro area term number list companies, new stock issues, market capitalisation. the impressive feature, however, ongoing growth capital market potential continue growing. market capitalisation ratio gdp germany 60 per cent. this reflect bank-dominated financial system. however, market capitalisation domestic stock grow last decade 17 per cent per year. the turnover growth german equity market also reflect rise importance investment fund assets. in germany 6,800 fund manage asset 800 billion euro. over last decade number fund almost tripled, asset rise 18 per cent per year. the german capital market able provide bulk start-up finance europe. more 200 venture capital company operate country. they serve catalyst new company – event success – pacemaker initial public offer (ipos), especially “neuer markt”, high-tech innovative segment german stock exchange. germany benefit high degree international attractiveness capital markets. about 235 foreign company stock list germany, number top usa uk. germany is, course, among lead centre central east european business. in comparison equity market lead industrial countries, german equity market remarkable potential growth. of 3 million company germany, one-fifth organise corporations. some one per cent stock corporations. a little tenth list exchange. clearly, stock corporation important economic term number suggests. but equally clear even small additional number ipo would cause real surge issuance capital markets. there many initial public offer pipeline. quite lot medium-sized firm think use financial opportunity offer liquid well regulate equity markets. two year ago, witness first municipal company go public (mannheim utilities) hundred possible followers. a result, shareholder culture emerge fast. compare usa unite kingdom, percentage shareholder total population low germany – like japan. the percentage usa uk quarter population, country show little le ten per cent. however, judge number germany need look historical development. the number people hold share mutual fund unit double since 1997 still increasing, even year. this clearly prof emerge equity culture. what equally important change structure shareholding germany. investment funds, private household foreign investor rise share, former dominance company shareholder vanished. the old picture “germany incorporated” disappear market-based culture emerging. this process accelerate even capital gain sale corporate shareholding tax-free 2002. bi review 98/2001 5 the overall picture german equity market high quality market, le important anglo-saxon world high growth potential. the realize growth rate recent year indeed impressive. for investor provide good opportunity join markets. a potentially high growth rate mean good chance gain market share saturate market. one important medium long-term effect come change statutory pension schemes. japan, italy, germany country rapidly age population. in 2040 – accord demographic estimate – every work person germany support one pensioner. and pension system mainly finance pay-as-you-go basis. probably le 20 per cent pension pay fund pension schemes. this share rise recent reform pension system rise number pension funds. that also justify expectation ongoing growth rate turnover stock german capital markets. one major asset capital market highly efficient exchange structures, include high-technology systems. but apply national markets. look europe euro area whole, must admit segmentation stock exchange clear settlement systems. even germany, besides dominant frankfurt stock exchange, seven regional stock exchange focus special service specialisation particular strength regional economy. this segmentation hamper financial market integration considerable extent. a consolidation process start boost legal harmonisation field financial services. this weakness overcome step step: the european commission’s financial service action plan provide 42 proposal frame legislation aim establish uniform european capital market 2004. viii let share insight european german bank sector. the degree european integration bank sector mixed. on one hand, wholesale market investment bank largely integrated. on hand, commercial credit retail bank still operate national, segment markets. however, european bank create cross-border merger slowly start offer retail service standardise level customer one country. the financial system euro area still highly bank-dominated. at end last year, credit finance total 108 per cent gdp. this much japan, twice much usa. the picture similar deposits. in euro area, account 80 per cent gdp, 110 per cent japan, u figure 40 per cent. however, capital market increase importance euro area. disintermediation gain ground. financial market boom recent year investment bank (as well non-bank financial firm like institutional investors, pension investment funds) enlarge market share. disintermediation enhance need pension system rely fund retirement schemes. another trend centralisation consolidation within bank sector. the financial centres, among especially frankfurt, benefit trend. ix one could argue financial service provide location demand centralisation necessarily improve efficiency. however, economy scale, economy scope, motivate innovation-stimulating effect personal (face-to-face) contact add large benefit financial centres. globalisation world financial market therefore mean concentration. there room large financial centre world, probably one two time zone niche minor player actors. there couple hard fact prove qualification germany (frankfurt) lead financial centre euro area: 6 bi review 98/2001 (cid:1)(cid:2)a stable currency, (cid:1)(cid:2)a full range multiplicity financial institutions, instrument products, (cid:1)(cid:2)a high volume fund available investment, (cid:1)(cid:2)an innovative financial culture, (cid:1)(cid:2)an efficient legal framework, (cid:1)(cid:2)a sound competitive bank system, (cid:1)(cid:2)a strong national economy background. the german financial centre restrict frankfurt. important location financial service example düsseldorf, stuttgart, berlin munich. munich third large location insurance company worldwide lead world term insurance premia. there 280 insurance company locate city, 80 maintain head office munich. among large reinsurer world. in addition, internationality frankfurt munich important aspect. frankfurt host head office many 136 foreign banks, among 13 japanese banks. frankfurt lively (english speaking) international financial community. this grow considerably since ecb locate downtown frankfurt ecb watcher join former buba watcher city. frankfurt “city euro”. a couple international trade fairs, international school university and, last least, large airport traffic hub “rhine-main” provide necessary international flair. what work improvement intellectual infrastructure. this comprise need internationally comparable education degrees, concentration finance bank well professional school education. much achieve field, improve serve recruitment need financial centre. x lady gentlemen, the new currency symbol european integration. that attract lot interest currency union europe world. we please proud see heighten attention unique historic event ongoing integration process europe. today i want draw attention integration development financial market europe, focus germany. i hope i manage give reliable true picture financial market germany. but part story. listening, talk hear nearly interest informative go gain insight yourself. you always welcome. lady gentlemen, thank attention. bi review 98/2001 1 willem f duisenberg: the ecb accession process speech dr willem f duisenberg, president european central bank, frankfurt european bank congress, frankfurt, 23 november 2001. * * * lady gentlemen, let first thank organiser frankfurt european bank congress give opportunity address distinguish audience. today i would like share think process eu accession central banker's perspective, review issue particular relevance ecb. little ten year begin transition market economy central eastern european countries, successful model european integration process extended. this testify attractiveness european union sound framework provide political stability economic progress. in weeks' time, 1 january 2002, new milestone reach euro, money, become truly tangible. the introduction euro banknote coin indeed constitute historic event process european integration, represent key accomplishment already long european experience. the changeover come approach situation inflation fall 2% price stability restored. in line forward-looking strategy cut interest rate basis reduce risk price stability. recent data line expectation confirm decision 8 november take account relevant information. a president ecb, i would like confirm euro indeed eventually "go east". a many 12 country central, eastern southern europe mediterranean currently negotiate accession eu. they make remarkable progress, negotiation strengthen economy policy-relevant institutions. however, road towards eu membership and, later, adoption euro still pose number significant challenges. what challenges? let focus briefly three economic area notable difference still prevail accession country eu member states: first, real convergence, second, nominal convergence and, finally, structure function financial sector. by "real convergence", i mean broad adjustment structural reform economic development economy towards structure prevail eu. this requires, inter alia, completion market economy transition agenda, privatisation sectors, strengthen institutional legal framework. real convergence see facilitate economic cohesion among member state join emu, thereby help minimise risk effect asymmetric shocks. hence, order enhance process real convergence much possible, accession country ensure make progress restructure economy gradually align euro area. real convergence often interpret catching-up real income eu. such narrow measure is, however, rough proxy concept real convergence i refer to. indeed, different income level compatible monetary union, know experience euro area. a nominal convergence, accession country achieve remarkable process disinflation last decade. inflation expect reach around 6% average end year. nevertheless, progress disinflation might turn complicate come years. first, several macroeconomic microeconomic factor well transition-related factor continue push inflation many accession countries. second, know "balassa-samuelson effect", is, potential inflationary pressure arise high productivity growth catching-up economies, also hold responsible high inflation accession countries. however, research show effect overestimated. these factor bear mind design monetary policy strategies. in context, disinflation accession country promoted, pace determine overall economic situation particular need country foster real convergence. in addition, maastricht inflation criterion regard immediate requirement, rather medium-term objective central bank accession countries. this mean, however, 2 bi review 98/2001 accession country pay attention progress nominal convergence. on contrary, balance monetary fiscal policy stance wage increase support productivity gain favour disinflation process accession countries, allow make progress nominal real convergence parallel. a specific topic great relevance ecb accession process, i would like mention structure function accession countries' financial sector. significant progress make restructure consolidate bank sector past years. this progress achieve large-scale privatisation state-owned bank extensive opening-up bank sector foreign ownership. this process contribute great financial integration eu significant gain term efficiency stability. however, level financial intermediation remain relatively low provision bank finance represent much small share gdp accession country euro area countries. furthermore, financial sector accession country remain dominate bank industry, capital market yet fully developed. from ecb perspective, deepen accession countries' financial market need ensure proper transmission monetary policy impulse join euro area, may also help country make full use growth potential. cop three challenge i mention significant impact design monetary exchange rate policies. take account different start point progress make far address challenges, accession country may well pursue different approach pre-accession phase. once eu, however, clear path define treaty follow eu member state towards adoption euro. first, immediately upon eu accession, new member state treat exchange rate policy matter common interest. furthermore, view final objective adopt euro, accession country expect join erm ii point follow accession eu. most accession country already express intention join mechanism soon possible entry eu. however, clear erm ii membership need happen immediately eu accession cases, erm ii membership need limit two years, minimum adoption euro. a long membership erm ii may, cases, helpful since would allow country retain exchange rate instrumental policy variable catching-up process. participation erm ii thus see meaningful flexible framework increase convergence euro area, tackle challenge face accession country road towards adoption euro. finally, outline path along euro go east, i would also like say word path i confident follow – unilateral euroisation. such adoption euro outside treaty process would welcome would run counter important process convergence prior adoption euro outline treaty. unilateral euroisation would also imply circumvent process multilateral assessment new member current eu member state would difficult reconcile co-operative spirit community fellow members. from perspective, i believe would also interest accession countries, would imply relinquish monetary exchange rate policy instrument early stage convergence economies. it would deprive country concern lender last resort function non-negligible seignorage revenues. finally, would make integration central bank concern eurosystem operational framework much difficult, impossible. lady gentlemen, i like end remark say eurosystem fully aware future implication ongoing accession process fulfilment statutory objectives. a historic process reunify europe unfold eyes, let assure ecb ready look forward play part. thank much attention. bi review 96/2001 1 guy quaden: central bank evolve environment speech mr guy quaden, governor national bank belgium, 23rd suerf colloquium, brussels, 27 october 2001. * * * lady gentlemen, i particularly please speak eminent forum opportunity address topic "technology finance" central banker's point view. technology challenge raise financial market appropriate theme colloquium. on one hand, technology closely intertwine evolution many factor affect financial market and, so, allow coverage wide range issues. on hand, farreaching consequence market participants, certainly include central banks. in first part i propose briefly recall technology impact macroeconomic regulatory environment. in next two part i would like sketch main consequence development colleague bank england describe two wing central banking, i.e. monetary financial stability. * * * technology powerful factor change macroeconomic environment. so, year ago, colleague federal reserve recognize something new happen u economy: persistent high growth low unemployment without emergence inflationary strains. this related, least partly, revolution information communication technologies, increase productivity growth foster efficiency labour market too. a third feature so-called new economy, reduction variability output growth, obviously prove short-lived! but wave over-pessimism submerge previous wave over-optimism. the question whether american economy still high trend productivity growth path remain open, well prospect european economy respect. europe benefit specific drive force, completion single market new single currency, trigger structural reform hence foster innovative energies. technology also radically transform financial sector, way greatly contribute new technological wave finance it. inew technique treatment, storage transfer information exert profound effect sector largely information base industry. in first stage, information technology make possible develop sophisticate products, build good market infrastructure, implement accurate reliable technique control risks, reach distant diversify markets, multiply value volume operations. in short, new technology radically transform three major function perform banks, i.e. access liquidity, transformation asset monitor risks. a new phase presently work emergence e-money, e-banking e-finance. it clearly new development represent great challenge come years. the speed adoption new product remain difficult forecast. contrary precede phase, new wave limit professional operator involve customers, include retail market. many scenario suggest it firm consult group prove overly optimistic. at time, would wrong become complacent. most new technology spread follow s-shaped curve. the base section s quite long practically horizontal; however, sooner late succeed steep section. the example nordic countries, specifically finland, show quickly e-finance develop, circumstance ripe. it important emphasize integration new technology financial sector take place isolation. rather, interaction technology another major development, deregulation, contribute reshape financial landscape. true, pressure market fully exploit new technology strong, probably even irresistible. however receptive 2 bi review 96/2001 environment also create lift rather strict financial bank regulation still prevalent end seventies. the increase awareness wide-ranging possibility offer new technology illustrate lot could gain removal distortion competition, directly link excessive regulation intrusion government. in combination, two evolution contribute emergence open, competitive globalise financial market, obviously improve efficiency world economy. the transition, however, smooth one. it easy authority cope frequent arbitrage operate market participant various currency financial instrument even different legal, regulatory tax regimes. neither easy financial intermediary work much competitive environment traditional protection barrier entry progressively lifted. in short, shift toward liberalise system together quick expansion new product market greatly increase uncertainty risk financial sectors. this immediately recognise many market participant previously shelter exist regulation. a result, individual bank failure bank crises, quasi non-existent end forty early seventies, become frequent past two decades. in context, absence significant problem within belgian bank sector recent period must consider exception rule. despite deregulation still major role play public authorities, among others field competition rules, consumer protection, fight money laundering... and, course, central banking. central bank indeed provide stability, certainly mean "no change" but, contrary, build best foundation sustainable dynamism. in so, central bank cope evolve environment shape technical progress, deregulation globalisation and, last least europe, single currency. * * * a regard first wing central banking, monetary stability, central bank provide durable anchor order price system appropriately guide economic decisions. a stable value money necessary preserve information value relative price change world, decision take rapidly. maintain price stability primary objective monetary policy, eurosystem - accord treaty maastricht- also every central bank. nowadays regulation central bank rely design operational framework monetary policy monopoly banknote issuance reserve requirements. the eurosystem fully respect principle open market economy free competition, enshrine treaty. it main instrument weekly allotment credit euro area-wide tenders. minimum reserves, remunerated, stabilisation function, thank average provision, enlarge structural liquidity shortage money market. a development e-money liable weaken leverage eurosystem order provide level play field, e-money issuer escape reserve requirements. a european directive last year rightly broaden definition credit institution order include e-money institutions. technological change financial market development affect monetary policy instrument also whole transmission process consequently strategy monetary policy. in complex change world eurosystem right reject simple rule adopt all-encompassing two-pillar strategy. central banker continuously reassess information content many economic indicators. let pick - output, money, stock price bond market indicator - variables, like wage development fiscal policy stance, le important, former affect technological financial market changes. central bankers, even govern council ecb, insensitive growth employment prospects, critic argue. but well aware two limitations: firstly, growth stimulate detriment price stability, stimulus would short-lived would imply longer-term costs; secondly, "à la plus belle fille du monde ne peut bi review 96/2001 3 demander que ce qu'elle a", monetary policy may exert influence demand side economy cannot solve structural problems, like persistent unemployment. central bank may nevertheless contribute output stabilisation, far risk price stability link business cycle. a central concept respect output gap, measurement, especially real time, surround large degree uncertainty. potential output growth, ingredient pillar eurosystem's strategy, know precision. should new economy materialise, high rate growth could become sustainable. in absence firm evidence new economy euro area - although drive force extent place - since emergence new economy drive monetary policy, eurosystem take risk pre-emptively accommodate it. nevertheless monitor wide range indicator order periodically reassess "speed limit" euro area economy. needle say, present circumstance growth unfortunately even old economy speed limit, associate decrease inflationary pressure already prompt 100 basis point interest rate cut three step since spring. the first pillar strategy ecb give prominent role money. it base conviction inflation monetary phenomenon long run underline medium-term orientation monetary policy inheritance respect deutsche bundesbank. recognise demand money subject short-term fluctuation harmless price stability, ecb announce "intermediate objective" rather "reference value" growth broad monetary aggregate. the recent rise m3 growth interpret short-term fluctuation, cause relatively flat yield curve weakness stock markets. technology financial market change obviously affect first pillar. they might increase volatility income velocity monetary aggregate and, blur frontier "moneyness", complicate definition key aggregates. to paraphrase former governor bank canada speak m1 twenty year ago, i would say ecb plan abandon m3, i cannot rule that, day, m3 could abandon us, already notice first pillar much reference value. it encompass broad monetary analysis duly take account developments. the first pillar also rest fact credit institution remain major player transmission process monetary policy. the development euro area capital market could however increase weight financial market indicator second pillar. the stock market still much le important channel transmission euro area us, hold share spreading, example mutual funds. i would attempt summarise vast debate appropriate monetary policy reaction asset price movements. i incline say central bank put variable emphasis warrant effect demand avoid asymmetric reaction - benign neglect case irrational exuberance, intervention case sharp downward correction - could pose moral hazard problem. the bond market provide indicator probably important within second pillar eurosystem's monetary policy. technical progress european integration lead sophisticate liquid market supply useful information market expectations. incidentally i notice that, many central bank look disapprovingly index bond prior monetary union, eurosystem welcome opportunity extract information inflation expectation comparison yield index nominal bonds. despite upsurge inflation euro area result oil price food price shocks, inflation expectation appear remain moderate, show eurosystem benefit high degree credibility. such capital credibility preserved. * * * about second wing central banking, safeguard financial stability, i would like adopt chronological approach. first, central bank currently adapt new environment reconsider role play financial market? second, could new technology affect relation come year market participants, central bank supervisory regulatory authorities? 4 bi review 96/2001 financial market development heighten risk associate rapid change lead central bank reconsider role play preserve financial stability. for central bank charge surveillance individual credit institutions, implication straightforward. they adapt modality micro-prudential activities. however, need proceed macro-prudential monitor also strongly felt central banks, like nbb, vest micro supervision. first, analytical level, central bank induce enlarge scope research. the use new technology cause spectacular expansion volume financial operations, certainly comparison growth real activities. this require reconsider direction link two fields. central bank traditionally focus consequence change financial condition could real economy. if analysis remain essential, central bank also increasingly concern vulnerability financial system fluctuation real activities. so, causality also reverse due attention must give impact evolution real economy could stability financial system. it coincidence increase number central bank complement traditional annual report centre monetary policy macro-economic development another report focus theme financial stability. this development nbb also actively embrace publication, possibly start 2002, new yearly financial stability report. at operational level, central bank contribute directly strengthen stability financial system development secure efficient payment settlement systems. here also new technology play crucial role. real time gross settlement systems, delivery versus payment mechanisms, cross-border connection various clear settlement institutions, instant world transmission information would practice unmanageable without possibility offer it technologies. these multiple layer network often consider mere plumbing. however, so-called plumb many respect spectacular sophisticate glamorous internet mobile phone networks. the oversight modern payment settlement system become key function modern central bank certainly apply nbb, belgium host two major international institutions, swift euroclear. the second step chronological approach also uncertain imply speculate impact new technology future organisation financial markets. it must recall outset introduction new technology bank sector one shoot phenomenon. on contrary, proceed waves. a already said, development e-money, e-banking e-finance represent great challenge. whatever speed, new wave strongly modify nature relation market participants. distant access financial product substitute close individual contacts. brand loyalty, still key asset business build trust, increasingly associate cherry picking. bank tend shift approach base long term stable relation strategy deal individually appreciate merits. the various financial institution also redefine core business. the technological wave eighty early ninety allow unbundling financial product various components. to unbundling product associated, thank second wave innovation, outsource production also distribution process. back office functions, distribution network it infrastructure easily subcontracted, create new web connection various category market participants. there also important change relation monetary prudential authorities, one hand, financial institution other. first authority rely, much past, market surveillance financial stability. one may legitimately feel concern evolution, sound like ask fox watch hens. however must realise financial market major factor change, also potentially powerful factor discipline. they force credit institution transparent communicate reliable information. the development new, sophisticated, risk management techniques, form internal models, been, roots, private initiative market participants. in order integrate model approach monitor bank solvency, basle committee bank supervision design new system scratch. bi review 96/2001 5 on contrary, refer best practice market benchmark calibrate proposals. now, authority delude themselves. best practice are, easy respect strong institution favourable circumstances, much hard maintain situation deteriorates. far lightened, burden prudential authority become heavier. the necessarily limit human financial resource authority call upon new basle proposal require individualise detail surveillance new internal risk management systems. the resource constraint finally also strongly determine relation various monetary supervisory authority maintain among themselves. a globalise financial market call globalise approach supervision. at international level, several co-operative body mechanism established, either form multilateral forum bring together competent authority field prudential control financial stability, mean bilateral protocol conclude supervisory body different country sectors. at national level, authority also carry in-depth examination supervisory structure procedures. i dwell subject devolution prudential tasks. different model exist across world bear witness trade-off make adapt market trend also take account specific national context. finally, exist national international framework need periodically review adjusted. whatever form, prevail structure fulfil two major conditions. on one hand, must efficient prevent either loophole redundancy supervision. on hand, must encompass combine microprudential control individual institution macroprudential monitor systemic risk face global financial market. * * * to conclude, let stress central bank fully aware close connection large convergence exist two goal financial stability monetary stability. keep inflation control, ultimate goal every central bank, prove best way reduce uncertainty market, alleviate distortion and, so, eliminate one fundamental source financial instability. conversely, central bank need sound efficient bank system ensure rapid transmission, whole economy, impulse monetary policy. this important give asset disposal central bank - monetary base jargon- become increasingly tiny compare total asset manage credit institution and, beyond that, financial market operators. in context, monitor financial stability may certainly consider by-product mere extension traditional monetary stability objective central banks. the two function closely relate distinct. in words, monetary stability financial stability wing belong bird. bi review 95/2001 1 donald t brash: monetary policy “interesting times” address mr donald t brash, governor reserve bank new zealand, manager small medium-sized businesses, whangarei, 21 november 2001. * * * lady gentleman about seven eight year ago, i visit share-broker tell great job reserve bank do explain action bank big corporates. i felt good, say “but frankly, do lousy job communicate small middle-sized business new zealand.” true, i protested, i can’t even get good mail list cover ten thousand small businesses. “fair enough”, replied, “but every small business bank account. put bank invite small business client meet host, speak.” and conversation grow idea meeting. we meet kind first time 1995. we repeat idea 1998. and third time year. in part, want use meet tell see world. and part, want learn, question comment i finished, see world. we acutely aware health vitality new zealand economy depend huge degree health vitality small middle-sized business represent room. we live “interesting times” you recall ancient chinese curse “may live interest times”. sadly, “interesting times” know why. just one week terrible event 11 september, reserve bank make unscheduled largely unexpected interest rate cut, 5.75 per cent 5.25 per cent. within reserve bank, briefly debate whether i hold press conference explain done. we decide to, large part would little i could usefully said. essentially, i could say time “we don’t know yet economic consequence event be, certainly don’t know mean inflation new zealand. all say confidence take huge knock; likely reduce price increase them; circumstance scope low interest rates.” that would make productive press conference. time move on, say now. last week, issue late assessment outlook economy inflation, reduce official cash rate 50 basis point 4.75 per cent. why that? interestingly, look shoulder historical data available us, hard see justification cut interest rates. the late comprehensive information economic growth show that, first half year, economy grow 2.3 per cent, equivalent annual growth rate 4 per cent. the late information also show unemployment low level 13 years. job advertisements, survey anz bank, run high level. many business report little unused capacity meet increase demand. in part country, report great difficulty find skilled even unskilled staff. the world price many commodity exports, low month earlier, hold surprisingly well. and top exchange rate far all-time record low, mean that, new zealand dollar terms, exporter tourist operator substantially insulate slow-down world economy. to extent, picture paint august monetary policy statement. there suggest might case early increase official cash rate threaten cloud international economy. and week know strongly economy grow first half year. but three month on, notwithstanding relatively robust historical data, cut official cash rate total 1 per cent. we do because, despite relatively strong position 2 bi review 95/2001 new zealand economy in, see real prospect economy slow quite significantly next year so. and slow-down occurs, interest rate low previously without jeopardise price stability objective reserve bank require achieve. the basic cause rather abrupt change outlook economy relate fairly substantial change outlook world economy. back early august, previous statement go press, consensus forecast 14 country dominate export trade suggest relatively slow growth year quite mark pick-up growth next year (figure 1). a go press last week’s assessment, general expectation growth significantly slow year previously expected, growth next year even markedly low previously expect (figure 2). and deterioration world outlook seem get somewhat bad every pass week. figure 1 export partner gdp growth - august 2001 monetary policy statement (annual average percentage change) source: rbnz, consensus. figure 2 export partner gdp growth - november 2001 monetary policy statement (annual average percentage change) source: rbnz, consensus. bi review 95/2001 3 moreover, deterioration confine single country. most economist expect recession unite states. almost economist expect recession japan. several big trade partner asia clearly recession already. europe continue slow down. only australia, among main trade partners, seem enjoy reasonably robust growth moment. (figure 3) figure 3 sum 2001 2002 export partner gdp growth (annual average percentage change) source: rbnz, consensus. and slowdown world economy bind impact new zealand economy, particular reduce demand export reduce price exports. we begin see already, occur expect see reduction growth new zealand downwards pressure price - include reversal strong increase price thing like meat dairy products, recent month do much push price average food-basket. so seem reasonable believe inflation much le problem look forward 12 month last 12 months. have explain decision reduce official cash rate last week, let use situation make four points. price stability mean neither inflation deflation the first point i want make reserve bank serious keep inflation zero keep 3 per cent. drop interest rate prevent inflation fall low. and inflation threaten go negative, sure would active indeed stimulate economy. it’s say fool keep inflation down, that’s true, task much demand that. i know rhetoric mostly economic social cost inflation, rather economic social cost deflation. that’s because, least new zealand, inflation much common problem, certainly last 60 years. also, new zealand go period quite high inflation seventy eighties, work hard persuade people serious keep inflation down, order bring inflationary expectations. but make mistake. inflation go zero would much breach reserve bank’s inflation target go 3 per cent. deflation cause set economic problem distortions, social economic damage. and policy deliberation always, without exception, mindful risks. we always try find policy set - interest rate - deliver inflation outcome neither hot cold. 4 bi review 95/2001 prevent deflation also part law i operate. the reserve bank act 1989 make clear monetary policy must deliver “stability general level prices”. and policy target agreement i minister finance, requirement reserve bank act, define “stability general level prices” inflation measure consumer price index zero 3 per cent. deflation “stability general level prices”, inflation is. this mean that, price stability achieved, rough rule thumb, reserve bank’s monetary policy seek restrain inflationary pressure raise interest rate roughly half time, seek restrain disinflationary pressure low interest rate roughly half time - second half 1998 year. new zealand go world slowdown strong position secondly, although new zealand affect world slowdown, completely hostage external events. it important don’t talk gloomy frame mind slowdown world economy could substantial, could last well next year. when world slowdown began, many sector new zealand economy rude good health economically, i mention - i haven’t even mention advantage strongly capitalise bank system government run fiscal surpluses. in words, start slowdown good position. figure 4 price new zealand’s export commodity (denominated u dollars) source: anz. yes, export price look likely fall, indeed already do number cases, u dollar

currently expect, scope stimulate additional demand without cause inflation accelerate. typically, monetary policy day policy instrument choice provide temporary stimulus economy. we ease monetary policy reduce official cash rate 6.5 per cent early year 4.75 per cent currently. there little doubt reduction help cushion effect international slowdown. but need reduce official cash rate further, clearly plenty room so, respect much easy position one japanese central bank find itself, official interest rate already zero, reduction possible. so good reason business new zealand optimistic future case many trade partners: new zealand start situation relatively strong growth, ample scope monetary policy stimulate economy needed, without jeopardise price stability. 1 new zealand business times, 2 november 2001. bi review 95/2001 7 but unfortunately policy unable provide complete protection but thirdly, say that, unfortunately quite impossible policy-makers, whether government reserve bank, protect business effect global slowdown. in part policy - whether government fiscal policy reserve bank monetary policy - work trade call long lag, delay. in words, time reserve bank change official cash rate change impact business almost certainly many week probably many months. i hear business believe change official cash rate almost instantaneous impact market, effect change confidence. but surely exception rather rule. in situations, lag delay change monetary policy impact change economy typically year. to make life even complicated, lag quite long also variable - vary somewhat situation situation. this mean that, offset effect of, say, world economic slowdown new zealand economy ease monetary policy, would need perfect ability see future year ahead, perfect understand precisely economy now, perfect understand economy works. well, best, i fortunate bright economist new zealand staff, try discern future. we study 6,000 data series. we look relationship look realistic recent history. we talk business country - 50 60 quarterly monetary policy statement. we use sophisticate economic models, stir large amount judgement. we constantly look update assessment real economy outside reserve bank’s doors. we get steady flow data relevant new zealand overseas economies. we believe well-informed economy organisation new zealand, good inform most. but still get wrong. let illustrate. one reliable relationship recent economic history world price commodity new zealand export tend rise economy trade partner buoyant, tend fall economy trade partner subdued. that sound pretty much one might expect basis common sense, consistent data (figure 9). figure 9 nz’s export partner growth world commodity price sources: rbnz, consensus, anz. 8 bi review 95/2001 figure 10 world export price index projection (previous monetary policy statements) source: rbnz. november 2001 central projection. so since least december 2000 monetary policy statement, expect price commodity export decline (figure 10). and project thing happen march year, even though intervene period price rise more, despite steady weaken world economy. and project price fall may statement, even though rise more, despite still weaken world economy. and august statement, project world price fall, even though august rise still world economy look quite seedy! and statement issue last week, still project slowdown world economy would produce fall export prices! indeed, expect export price fall, case reduce official cash rate last week would non-existent. should change expectation export price last year traditional relationship export price growth trade partner break down? obviously don’t think so, example good illustration difficulty forecast economy even “normal” times. and course anything normal times. no economic model, economic forecaster, could foresee event 11 september. by definition therefore, give long variable lag change monetary policy impact change real economy, inability even experience central banker foresee future, sometimes fail adjust policy sufficiently quickly protect business sharp downswing - matter, sharp upswing (though may well cause few complaints!). there another reason monetary policy protect business adverse effect world events. even super-human ability see future, reality world event quite different effect different industry different regions. monetary policy, single interest rate instrument, react balance inflationary pressure economy whole, pressure individual industries. in words, can’t high interest rate restrain buoyant condition dairy industry low interest rate support software export sector, adversely affect sharp deceleration spend information technology unite states. we interest rate seem appropriate economy whole - must accept interest rate seem far high part economy arguably low parts. we saw situation rather clearly mid-nineties, build sector experience quite strong inflationary pressures, many export industry experience quite strong disinflationary pressures. it would great able high interest rate applicable build sector low one applicable export industries. but long common currency throughout new zealand, option. so reserve bank help business try hard anticipate development new zealand economy, adjust monetary policy quickly look likely inflationary bi review 95/2001 9 deflationary pressure emerge. but can’t provide complete protection, either economy whole or, even clearly, industry region. monetary policy doesn’t determine economy’s long-run growth rate finally, important aware monetary policy economy’s long-run growth rate. there virtually unanimous opinion among economist policy-makers around world central bank can’t engender fast economic growth tolerant inflation. on contrary, virtually unanimous view best thing monetary policy economic growth keep inflation low stable. it myth, though one clearly believe new zealanders, unite state economy grow fast new zealand economy last decade u central bank mandate encourage growth maintain price stability, whereas new zealand central bank mandate maintain price stability. the reality country fully recognise best thing monetary policy encourage growth keep inflation control. in respect, federal reserve reserve bank new zealand think operate way. this place comprehensive discussion determinant trend growth output. essentially, economic growth depend growth input labour capital, advance productivity labour capital employed. and thing impact factor quite unrelated monetary policy. some study suggest high level taxation discourage growth effect incentive work, save innovate. others point importance protect private property right growth dynamic. still others note importance human capital, highlight role education determinant economic growth. and course many relevant factors, rule regulation may make undertake new investment slow cumbersome process. get policy area right crucial trend growth increased, none policy susceptible central bank influence. conclusion so conclusion, “interesting times” - • first, reserve bank commit avoid deflation avoid inflation, mean always lean wind best ability, tend tighten policy inflation look likely rise future, tend ease policy inflation look likely fall bottom target. • second, new zealand economy well-placed weather international slowdown, moderate growth, low unemployment, exchange rate provide useful support export import-competing industries, ample scope ease monetary policy prove necessary. • third, even best world, best economist world, regular contact company land, monetary policy never provide complete protection vagary life, whether vagary come form international crisis form dramatic domestic development. • and fourth, monetary policy doesn’t determine economy’s long-term growth rate - determine whole range factor nothing directly reserve bank. sometimes reserve bank need leave monetary policy unchanged month end. sometimes need adjust interest rate small incremental steps, early year. and sometimes need adjust rate aggressively, last couple months. different circumstance require different responses. but i say that, “interesting times” normal times, role monetary policy help hinder, commit doing. bi review 95/2001 1 birgir ísleifur gunnarsson: monetary issue european union iceland speech mr birgir ísleifur gunnarsson, chairman board governor central bank iceland, seminar organise iceland trade council, euro info office iceland eu commission theme: doe euro affect iceland?, reykjavik, 31 october 2001. * * * lady gentlemen: the evolution european integration second half last century remarkable many ways. this process begin soon end world war ii represent effort forge strong bond european nation thereby, among things, reduce likelihood conflict continent. although i shall go history here, many notable milestone cite along course taken. one notable formal establishment economic monetary union begin 1999. now abolition individual member nations’ separate currency sight. a next year replace euro note coin. not price good service calculate state single currency twelve emu countries, note coin use business all. one consequence price single currency member country facilitate buyer good service greatly make price comparisons, competition within eu certainly become active now. economic monetary union the emu population 300 million account 16% global gdp. by way comparison, usa population 280 million account 22% global gdp. export good service equivalent 19% emu gdp, correspond figure usa 11%. some 19% total world merchandise export come emu, 15% usa. twelve fifteen eu nation belong emu. the uk, denmark sweden remain outside it, position differ somewhat. denmark uk state reservation membership, reach agreement eu states. sweden, hand, opt remain outside emu, although special reservation agree upon them. denmark involve currency cooperation emu, one aspect exchange rate danish krone may deviate euro 2.25% define central rate. denmark therefore enjoy limit monetary independence. this reflect fact danish central bank invariably alter interest rate wake announcement change european central bank (ecb) policy rate. sweden uk opt inflation target monetary policy framework, therefore objective keep countries’ currency stable euro. european central bank the maastricht treaty stipulate monetary arrangement emu. the eu country create framework ecb’s activity extent model central bank germany differ many way arrangement others. various condition set eu member fulfil order grant emu membership. on one hand relate major component economic developments, inflation, fiscal deficit, government debt interest rates. on hand address framework maastricht treaty lay monetary policy implementation emu. this policy consistent grow support view natural set simple target central bank – i.e. promote price stability – increase independence political leadership pursue main objectives, strengthen financial independence. another emphasis that, time central banks’ independence strengthened, strict demand would need make regard transparency activity actions, regard accountability towards government general public. 2 bi review 95/2001 all reflect maastricht treaty. the european central bank, formally begin operation middle 1998, enjoy extensive independence subject requirement transparency accountability. even though sweden yet member emu, amend legislation central bank largely fulfil maastricht terms. the bank england’s legislation entirely fulfil term treaty, grant greatly increase independence year ago. denmark still amend central bank legislation, although need do event denmark join emu, least give legal sanction independence. price stability main objective the maastricht treaty set single objective european central bank, namely ensure price stability. price stability define treaty, however; do ecb itself, specify annual rise 2% harmonise consumer price index. a separate treaty stability economic growth stipulate emu member aim long-term fiscal balance surplus, public sector deficit le 3% gdp. the decisive viewpoint behind formulation european monetary framework also dominant many part world. example industrialise nation australia new zealand, numerous others, transformation economy eastern europe newly industrialise country latin america asia amend legislation reflect main principle simple target-setting, independence transparency. even though iceland party european monetary cooperation outlook change situation foreseeable future, central bank iceland felt ought monitor development closely possible. the forerunner ecb, european monetary institute, found begin 1994 central bank iceland soon establish formal relation it. this continue ecb begin operation. central bank expert also ready access ecb expert various issue concern formulation and, least, implementation monetary policy. one fruit central bank’s work area comprehensive report publish mid-1997 economic monetary union. the central bank iceland change monetary instrument in march 1998 central bank iceland make extensive reform monetary instruments. the guide principle bring instrument line already decide ecb, even though yet become functional. consequently, since time central bank iceland employ work procedure principle analogous use ecb. the main difference repurchase agreement auction format. hitherto, central bank iceland auction unlimited amount fix rate interest. initially ecb decide interest rate total amount repo auction time. the result ecb accept fraction bid make repos. this arrangement abandon recently ecb invite bid specific amount, predetermine rate interest. amount decide basis ecb’s assessment credit institutions’ liquidity requirement money market interest rate aim achieve. one reason ecb’s choice format various emu central bank operate different arrangement liquidity facility ecb established, different viewpoint need reconciled. regard aspect central bank activity effect iceland, perhaps first point central bank iceland begin increase transparency activity action long ago. among things, reflect bank’s effort explain clearly policy assessment economic monetary situation outlook. one step direction take towards end 1999 thorough review bank’s publish activities. it cease publication monthly statistics, appear since 1974, launch quarterly monetary bulletin provide much good forum early publication present in-depth explanation bank’s assessment economic monetary situation outlook, measure domestic market policies. furthermore, new bulletin create opportunity present material directly indirectly concern bank’s policy. it also decide bank’s quarterly inflation forecast would publish monetary bulletin. thus monetary bulletin describe main platform today central bank’s accountability towards government general public. bi review 95/2001 3 new central bank act the important milestone change affect central bank, however, reach year new legislation pass parliament. a committee appoint prime minister end last year submit proposal draft central bank act march. the bill present parliament begin april broad consensus reach pass unanimous vote 56 member parliament attend final vote. the new central bank act closely model legislative framework create central bank country recent years, include emu. a simple target set central bank iceland, i.e. promote price stability, grant full independence use instruments, financial independence ensure legal requirement make transparency accountability, along points. i think fair say new central bank act generate interest internationally, least speed legal review make broad consensus achieve reforms. the central bank act authorise declaration numerical target inflation, subject prime minister’s approval. this provision incorporate law policy introduce march 27 year monetary framework change flexible fix exchange rate replace inflation target float exchange rate. despite detail discussion framework change fundamental principle new policy, bank often notice widespread misunderstandings. i shall therefore outline broad principle monetary policy. inflation monetary phenomenon the central bank assign specific inflation target joint declaration issued, government, march 27. this stipulate bank aim rate inflation close possible 2½%. tolerance limit also set, 1½% high inflation target 1½% lower. the inflation target define twelve-month rise cpi. if inflation exceed tolerance limits, bank would oblige bring back within quickly possible. at time bank would oblige submit report government, would make public, state reason deviation, plan response length time expect take bring inflation back within target. when target set, inflation run relatively high iceland. bear mind, upper tolerance limit set 6% year, 4½% 2002 4% year 2003 onwards. upheaval foreign exchange market spring sharp depreciation króna cause substantial rise inflation, exceed upper tolerance limit june. the central bank submit detail report government june 20. other aspect joint declaration include provision that, notwithstanding abolition exchange rate target band, central bank would intervene interbank market foreign exchange buy sell currency deem necessary order contribute towards attain inflation target, view exchange rate swing threat financial stability. at time, central bank undertake produce quarterly inflation forecast project two year future. it remember one main reason simplification central bank target recent years, assign main objective price stability, inflation primarily monetary phenomenon long-term impact monetary policy prices. it impact economic growth employment therefore generally temporary. since central bank broadly speak one instrument, i.e. interest rates, therefore achieve single long-term macroeconomic goal, natural set price stability ultimate monetary goal. this say price stability important goal than, say, full employment, simply monetary policy instrument inherently good suit impact prices. it pointless set objective monetary policy cannot achieve. through price stability, forward-orientated monetary policy contribute towards create stable economic environment long-term growth potential economy based. from clear central bank’s main task achieve inflation target, aim do. there vocal call recently central bank ease monetary stance order soften even prevent loom economic contraction. the growth outlook impact output gap, i.e. deviation demand level consistent balance supply demand domestic good factor production. the output gap subsequently one factor play key role inflation cycle. all thing equal, growth outlook thus 4 bi review 95/2001 exert influence monetary policy, namely bad outlook, low interest rate, contrary. for long inflation remain present high level, however, unavoidable allow output gap shrink sufficiently central bank cannot apply instrument stage prevent happening. high interest rate counter-inflationary the central bank hold view that, clear sign emerge august inflation forecast hold good, still safe low interest rates. impulsive action could entail risk inflation magnify even further, dire consequence households, business economic growth conditions. claim also hear iceland’s high interest rate inflationary rather counter-inflationary. the central bank agree view, cannot support economic theories, study research. on contrary, every indication interest rate similar effect iceland elsewhere. the icelandic economy show sign strong overheat apparently peak last year. it beyond doubt tight monetary stance make major contribution towards cool economy. and wind necessary, too, since great macroeconomic imbalance emerged, reflect clearly unacceptable current account deficit inflationary pressures. it therefore inevitable output gap narrow order bring inflation, national income drop even order achieve significant reduction current account deficit, far beyond sustainable long-term level. high interest rate painful, least household business imprudent consumption investment recently rely heavily facility credit institutions. it question central bank base interest rate policy action least prudent member community. this base provision make law joint declaration government central bank march, i.e. promote price stability. this guide aim central bank activity industrial country around world, create climate economic growth great well-being citizens. in world free capital movement greatly enhance access credit compare early times, business households, credit institution too, must find bear themselves. understandably, many people complain high interest rates, lively debate recent week often reveal excessive faith effect interest rate cut would economic developments. a slowdown economic activity solely cause interest rates. other factor deserve mention contractionary impact fish quota cuts, downturn it sector closely link global trends, fluctuation power-intensive development project unaffected domestic interest rates. cut interest rate would limit immediate effect supply side economy, high interest rate act full force demand side serve reduce inflation domestic demand, contribute improve macroeconomic balance low inflation. iceland’s currency option i outline various aspect central bank’s monetary policy. a i mentioned, iceland take part european currency cooperation. various currency framework option iceland ought consider often name public discussions. a detail account give central bank’s 1997 report emu. it frequently say iceland ought adopt euro currency, either unilaterally associate membership emu. i strongly warn simplify option available u respect. even associate membership offered, seem likely, seem fair assume country interest would need fulfil maastricht treaty requirement emu membership. these include rate inflation high 1½% three eu country lowest, one-year record average nominal interest rate long-term bond 2% high three eu country inflation lowest, membership erm least two year without devalue currency without exceed deviation band. iceland obviously fulfil condition immediate future. some form emu membership future would therefore release iceland obligation bring inflation similar level among trade partner countries. it may add even iceland fulfil conditions, extremely unlikely would able negotiate, foreseeable future, associate membership bi review 95/2001 5 emu kind bilateral currency cooperation it. all sign point opposite direction, whatever phrase individual article treaty rome maastricht treaty might suggest. furthermore, point twelve eastern european country wait admit european union and, later, emu. the ecb community leadership firmly underline nation fulfil condition participation emu. thus eu highly unlikely agree set precedent nation could take advantage short-cut emu. iceland choose remain outside eu declare interest membership. if iceland show interest adopt euro currency, obvious course would join eu advantage obligation entails, include membership emu. such decision, however, depend factor national currency, process would take good many years. of course, highly political question therefore outside scope address. we need continue find bear global community nation currency, environment free capital movement call discipline economic policy implementation. lady gentlemen: representative eu country involve formulate develop economic monetary union. they create monetary framework within emu regard serve community’s citizen best. although iceland stand outside emu, incorporate monetary policy implementation much eu country agree best serve interests. i convince benefit this. bi review 94/2001 1 david klein: the damage rapid increase government expenditure cause economic growth speech mr david klein, governor bank israel, conference “israel’s economy 2002 approaches”, tel aviv, 31 october 2001. * * * the background every year question “what desire budget deficit?” raised, even though government last ten year adopt policy suppose reduce deficit. those favor rise deficit argue tax burden raised, certainly across board, government expenditure increase meet certain “needs”. such need natural understandable, whether one deal security, help family need, increase water supply hot, dry israel, provide aid factory encounter difficulty competitive market, improve education, particularly development areas, update item cover national health scheme, relieve traffic congestion major metropolitan areas, etc., etc.; list endless. if need criterion one, budget deficit, government’s debt, would rocket. the reason occur worldwide consensus policy increase government expenditure budget deficit rate growth economy will-beyond certain limit-cause harm good. but limit? the u provide interest example this. a result terrorist attack 11 september need arise increase federal government expenditure, voice already hear refer return “big government” us. to put matter proportion, however, anyone look figure publish recently oecd see public-sector expenditure u 2001 prior attack estimate 30 percent gdp, low world. the increase expenditure discussion result state emergency le one percent gdp, main support provide tax cuts-some temporary due concern rise long-term interest depress effect would growth. israel, hand, use yardstick, high figure, 54 percent gdp, member oecd. have cross limit? all israel’s government parliament approve budget last decade answer affirmative: share public-sector expenditure gdp israel high, reduce best way cut deficit huge government debt. lead process, entity responsible see broad picture, ministry finance, back prime ministers, insofar matters, also bank israel. however, always government ministers, member knesset, various experts, commentators, others think response must give meet specific needs. thus was, thus always be. the question “where limit?” clearly concern country too. follow several decade rapid increase government budget throughout world since middle twentieth century, increase exceed countries’ rate economic growth, accompany increase tax debt burden, process halted, good reason. we detail damage cause rapid increase government expenditure, relate current situation israel’s economy. finance rise government expenditure raise tax burden when increase government expenditure finance high taxes, two type damage caused: • people le will invest work, “underground” economy created, build-up strong pressure distort tax system grant exemption sort reason (the late example negev laws; next line recognition 2 bi review 94/2001 mortgage interest tax deductible. it estimate total tax benefit 2001 come ni 29 billion, 60 percent via capital market). the tax burden bear small small part population. • the second effect, expose last years, offer even serious threat: international competition taxes. this encompass type tax: individuals’ labor income; companies; income capital. failure meet competition provide incentive israeli israeli company build economic future abroad, important factor nonresident consider whether operate israel. it clear open economy israel’s tax burden cannot long run high abroad. the tax burden israel relative gdp high average oecd, although country (france, denmark, italy, sweden) high ours. distortion taxation financial income despite say above, main problem israel much total tax burden composition tax revenues. among numerous subject require attention regard (such sharp rise tax rate labor income latter increases, top tax bracket apply relatively low level income; heavy burden indirect taxes; low taxation capital), concentrate one, taxation interest income individual mutual funds. the current situation suffer follow distortions: • local-currency deposit tax exempt; foreign-currency deposit israel taxed. • save scheme exempt; tradable government private index bond taxed. • unindexed government bond tax free, similar private bond taxed. the tax, applicable, 35 percent, case higher. there thus grave distortion here. this situation cause serious damage function financial market follow ways: • it oblige business sector depend bank almost sole source finance israel, enable develop alternative via capital market. similarly create preference among household save via banks. the tax system thus strengthen banks’ monopolistic hold financial intermediation israel. • change composition asset portfolio, i.e., switch local-currency foreign-currency assets, affect consideration tax introduce period nis/foreign-currency market exist israel, needlessly affect exchange-rate appropriate israel time. in way one pillar support israel’s economic growth-foreign trade-is undermined. • the tradability government bond market adversely affect tax rule effectively exclude household market-another blow infrastructure advance capital market. • the tax distortion deter foreign financial institution develop service israelis, thus also impair financial market israel. these undermine financial stability economy’s ability withstand financial shocks, whether cause domestically abroad, place open economy israel’s great disadvantage. the opportunity iron distortion sacrifice together program sweep tax reforms, although quite simple necessary without reference reform. what need do introduce one low rate tax, say 5 percent average, interest income certain threshold; threshold determine way one hand worth trouble deduct tax source, justify social grounds. the change plan way neutral regard total revenue obtained, i.e., drop tax revenue one side match increase other. it important ensure collection system simple far definition tax bi review 94/2001 3 base concerned, set low rate, say 4 percent, nominal interest, slightly high rate, say 6 percent, real foreign-currency interest. this change could implement without much preparation, would great benefit economy. clearly make effective retroactively. finance increase government expenditure borrow public finance increase government expenditure borrow public (by sale government bonds) cause damage follow ways: • the first derive fact government already large debt ni 430 billion, 90 percent gdp, due budget deficit past years. this debt oblige government allocate part tax revenue year service debt. in 2001 interest payment total ni 30 billion, total education budget, several time large government’s investments. the increase debt cause budget deficit reduce government’s ability use source current purposes, create pressure increase debt enable expenditure rise nonetheless. • the second adverse outcome result effect government debt rate interest. in israel, every economy, rate interest government bond use benchmark fix interest private sector. mortgage interest rate determine way, interest long-term loans, advance directly bank issue form private bond stock exchange base interest market require government bond issues. in words, great government debt, great pressure cost capital whole economy. a rise price long-term capital eventually affect price short-term money, clearly harm investment growth. this effect clearly evident year: yield 10-year government bond decline first half year (from 5.6 percent january 4.3 percent june), go back (to 4.6 percent september) government increase borrow deficit significantly exceed level originally planned. • the third way damage cause increase government debt draw israel away international norm accord economy rated. this increase deviation norm require government debt/gdp ratio around 60 percent-and year first time many year record rise ratio-will make difficult improve israel’s rat may even combine factor exert influence opposite direction. this would mean rise price raise capital internationally, government private sector. • the fourth derive connection rise budget deficit rise balance-of-payments deficit. this clearly illustrate mid-1990s due expansionary fiscal monetary policy balance-of-payments deficit grow potentially critical level. a result adopt contractionary policies. a repeat first act performance unfold eye 2001, rise budget deficit contribute rise balance-of-payments deficit. we say “the first act” insignificant chance next year’s budget deficit high year’s, mean possible add pressure increase balance-of-payments deficit. in contrast us, print dollars, borrow finance balance-of-payments deficit, would occur time foreign investment israel falling. a decline foreign debt one indication stability israel’s economy; change. the relation two deficit explain quite simply: rise budget deficit normally derive increase current government expenditure. this expenditure generate exports, sometimes prevent it, always increase imports. this bear propose budget 2002: great part far increase expenditure level 2001 current expenditure, small part direct towards increase investment, propose rise total government expenditure almost certainly exceed rate economic growth. in words, budget 2002 propose increase government debt least 4 bi review 94/2001 ni 12 billion, burden it, follow budgets, additional interest payment close ni 1 billion year, increase government’s current expenditure. it thus possible contribute growth increase budget deficit thereby raise standard living, public private, time, cannot maintained, rise budget deficit create inflationary pressure, pressure financial markets, rise foreign-currency deficit. this short-term policy, part bill present immediate payment part carry forward. eventually outstanding balance bill paid, always come expensive. the composition government debt additional damage cause economy, derive directly existence deficit fact almost half government’s domestic debt tradable. a government move raise unindexed loans, share tradable index debt total debt falls. in 1995 make 30 percent total debt; middle 2001, 23 percent. the market tradable index government bond dry up, market determine long-term rate interest israel. a two-pronged course action required: 1. the process extend term unindexed government bond 10 year 30 year already start ministry finance must continue, provide additional benchmark long-term interest rates, addition disintegrate benchmark provide index bonds, encourage development long-term unindexed us mortgage market long-term projects. 2. at time, chapter earmark bond pension save bring close, do save channels, deepen stabilize tradable bond market. this apply exist funds, include launch 1995, new one introduce date change implemented. such change would enable realization important idea, cannot adopt long earmark bonds: mandatory pension scheme certain level income, cover employee self-employed. a superficial examination country’s support structure weak, elderly section population also show need situation change. mandatory pension scheme (without earmark bonds!) could provide another important layer meager support old-age social security grant currently offer low-income population. summary: importance order priority those responsible decide extent government expenditure rate budget deficit, government knesset (parliament), must balance gain losses, plus minuses. they must long-term view-based fact israel’s economy open one-of trend budget aggregates: tax burden, government expenditure/gdp ratio, budget deficit, government debt burden. the basic attitude government expenditure grow economic growth. no le important, however, clear order priority within four components: how composition tax revenue improve time meet international competition, broaden tax base, reduce inequality distribution income economy? should order priority government expenditure changed, different element (e.g., current expenditure investment) within (e.g., focus expenditure education specific geographical areas, ages, types), responsibility authority devolve government ministry field? the answer two question contain great potential regard government’s contribution economic growth. two questions: how budget deficit finance (long-term short-term debt; index unindexed debt)? how share government’s tradable debt vis-à-vis nontradable debt increased? bi review 94/2001 5 the answer two question contain key government’s contribution financial stability economy. the attitude towards trend aggregate order priority within guide by: • general aim place economy path sustain growth, • socially approach support weak section population work age, encourage others join labor force. this exact science. it clear, however, much do direction. finally, budget present knesset approval, basis growth 2002 reconsidered, provide basis estimate tax revenue. instead discuss probability sharp turnaround economy’s growth rate next year, budget could base modest estimate say 2 percent, instead 4 percent, certain amount government’s approve expenditure could freeze ascertain target deficit met, even rate growth forecast. it make clear government act tax revenue exceed forecast high rate growth. we would prefer extra revenue use broaden tax bracket individuals, part could also use increase expenditure favorable economic growth, provide certain decline share government expenditure gdp maintained. bi review 93/2001 1 ernst welteke: the

claim middle ground, certain tendency towards market-centered system. economic financial integration deepen fast. international trade grow considerably last couple years. foreign direct investment flow increase even faster. portfolio investment internationalized. stock exchange move le sync. growth rate dwindle simultaneously three large currency area point time. that much high degree global integration yet underestimate many policy makers. growth global trade probably diminish year two percent 12 percent last year. among major region world china, middle east russia, include neighbor countries, show substantially positive growth rates. there something like global business cycle. however, perfect synchronicity among different areas. causes, 2 bi review 93/2001 consequence repercussion different every currency area. therefore, policy reaction vary. the u business cycle close technical recession. remember, le year ago, forecaster wonder whether usa would see hard soft landing. the downward trend high tech industry, correspond overinvestment it prominent among cause downward movement growth rates. the save rate rise abruptly labor market perform increasingly worse. after september 11, additional negative psychological impact overcome. the usa respond quickly. the feed low interest rates, federal government low tax substantially. firm market adjust quickly. i doubt u economy show rise growth rate within months. japan — already prolong recession — could withstand downward trend. japan cope economy still recover effect severe bank crisis follow bubble economy late eighties. finally, euro area business cycle follow world trend closely observable recent years. this see outcome close link due increase foreign direct portfolio investment. growth rate diminished, employment gain come halt, prospect next year worsen last months. however, capacity utilization sentiment still high than, example, recession 1993. adjustment take place, although slow usa. a usual, expectation adjust fast production. for europe, psychological factor le important currency area. different cause require different policy reactions. this first reason vary response three central banks. another – equal important reason – pursue different concepts. the bank japan exceptional situation, anyway. the u federal reserve system set 1913. in accordance employment act (of 1946) humphrey-hawkins act (of 1978), must pursue several objective time: economic growth line potential output growth, stable prices, high level employment moderate long-term interest rates. the european system central bank "the new kid block" among large central banks. since 1999, pursue sole primary objective price stability. difference objective strategy main explanation perceive difference response current situation. for europe, monetary integration event historic dimensions. join force set common currency area promise prosperity stability 300 million people. the institutional feature escb provide framework enable keep promise. the success euro one drive force central eastern european state apply membership eu. it europe effort towards regional integration made, include notion of, move towards, monetary harmonization. such discussion likewise topical five continents: • a currency union russia belarus one concrete present. the two country decide set currency union 2005 onwards; first, russian rouble currency. • the member state gulf cooperation council contemplate arab gulf currency time. to initiative, recently set committee take charge study necessary requirements. however, political, economic financial convergence suggest early introduction common currency. • in south america, monetary integration envisage mercosur country time time; however, economic development brazil argentina diverge more, currency union look rather far away. • the idea develop american currency union nafta emerge then. obviously, pursue real zeal now. • talk possible yen zone come regularly asia. however, although trade financial integration well advance there, switch dollar orientation yen orientation look likely point time. bi review 93/2001 3 • deliberation form currency union australia new zealand, africa, preliminary state, political cooperate lacking. in africa, however, cfa franc zone south african rand zone, two currency union already exist. iii european monetary union (emu), start january 1st, 1999, origin 1970s, first plan single european currency drafted. not treaty maastricht — sign 1992 — notion european currency put concrete form. emu complete six week now, euro note coin circulated. monetary union europe, however, unprecedented. three set second half 19th century. today’s world resemble 19th century world certain respects. in age industrialization, rapid international integration witnessed. transportation cost sank, lead close trade relations. profound structural change result. a european country become similar, economy converged. in environment, naturally, monetary integration deem helpful. today, age so-called “globalization”. transportation costs, information cost communication cost come tremendously. structural change take place “information society”. trade investment relation become ever closer. this especially true european common market, freedom movement guarantee people, goods, service capital. the case favor monetary integration europe compelling. let’s look 19th century currency union europe, find learnt. just draw analogy international set far perfect, comparison monetary union themselves. we can, however, gain useful insight early experiences. in 1865, four sovereign state belgium, france, italy switzerland - greece join little late - set latin monetary union. the union cover coinage, common central bank. it originally construct forerunner political union — never established, though. the found treaty open interpretation several respects, leeway extensively exploited. overall, commitment treaty weak. one country able finance public deficit print - rather mint - money. what make altogether rather heterogeneous country stick together 60 year basically need tap french capital market. the issue scandinavian monetary union rather different. sweden, denmark norway - three country abstain emu - peg currency one another 1872. they aim economic, political cultural cooperation. in respects, scandinavian union weatherproof latin union. the three country pursue similar development strategies, export-oriented, show great adaptability exogenous shocks. today, would speak convergent economies. furthermore, union treaty spell practise before. what make scandinavian monetary union fall apart (in 1931)? against backdrop international bank crises, seem lack single monetary policy framework one reasons. monetary policy three country gain increasingly national flavor, as, first, pre-world-war-one export boom hit union asymmetrically. and so, little later, war itself. monetary policy diverge increasingly, union formally terminate 1931. a third example, let’s brief look german monetary union 1871. the grind currency union well prepared. first, german custom union already create common market, although hamper existence disparate coinage systems. labor mobility common market relatively high. second, germany unite politically lead prussia. the reichsbank act 1875 establish unify central bank complete german monetary union. it introduce german "mark" currency one year later. 4 bi review 93/2001 what insight gain stylize fact three early experience european monetary unions? we identify certain feature union seem conducive stability, success, monetary union. the european union take experience account design emu. iv a monetary union intend provide participate country stable monetary regime ensure price stability enable thrive. the maastricht treaty set european system central banks, european central bank - ecb - top. both ecb national central bank independent. monetary policy decision take ecb govern council, consist ecb executive board governor participate national central banks. unlike centralize decision-making, implementation single monetary policy decentralized. national central bank provide market liquidity, accordance decision ecb govern council. the primary objective european system central bank maintain price stability. the ecb council define price stability increase consumer price medium term le two percent year. unlike early monetary union europe, emu set watertight monetary regime. we one single currency, euro. the ecb sole right authorize issue banknotes. trouble similar latin scandinavian monetary union run into, countries’ central bank pursue divergent policies, cannot occur european monetary framework, decision-making centralized. a common stability orientation policy areas, member state committed, essential. the second stability-ensuring institutional feature emu stability growth pact. it spell member state suppose ensure sound public finances, treaty oblige avoid excessive deficits. a long national budget order, incentive member state pursue overly lax monetary policy, eye reduce interest burden budgets. wage policy another national responsibility. wage agreement general settle line productivity advances. low, stable, inflation expectation reflect confidence eurosystem’s policy, help negotiate stability-oriented wage settlements. research field optimum currency area come conclusion member state successful currency union need call convergent economies. convergent economy allow unify policy; divergent economy require differentiate policies. it relative homogeneity may explain scandinavian monetary union, long period, successful le convergent latin version. the european union develop single market half century. the four fundamental freedom - mobility goods, services, people capital - ensure previously custom union become integrate economic area. convergence progressing. entry emu conditional fulfillment “convergence criteria”. country will join monetary regime must display “high degree sustainable convergence”. that measure term price stability, exchange rates, capital-market rate sound public finances. in currency area, “one-size-fits-all” monetary policy, exchange rate cope asymmetric economic shocks. such shock may occur despite advance state convergence euro area. the country monetary union therefore need flexible goods, capital labor markets. the eu member state work improve flexibility markets. insofar price rigidity exist mobility, ensure four basic freedoms, call for. political union has, past, prove helpful preserve stability monetary union. the european union move slowly steadily towards long-term goal. it willingness assume great responsibility global context encourage respect. bi review 93/2001 5 overall, european policy maker create monetary union design last. feature which, former currency unions, prove destabilize avoid design emu. but institutional feature alone guarantee emu’s success. commitment union, true european spirit, call for. in ecb council, show european spirit. national interest relevant process shape monetary policy euro area — euro area whole. v lady gentlemen, at start, eurosystem see period unprecedented price stability. in 1998 1999, consumer price rise 1.1 percent; year 2000, inflation rate, 2.3 percent, run little two-percent ceiling, sharp increase oil price 1999 2000. this year, peak may, 3.4 percent, inflation rate decreasing. in october, price 2.4 percent high one year before. in current environment weak world economy, ecb govern council expect moderation price movements. at recent meet november 8, govern council decide therefore cut rate half percentage point. it low key interest rate year 150 basis point 3.25 percent. the escb assign one main policy goal: keep inflation check. if possible without compromise price stability, shall support general economic policiesthe reason behind policy mandate threefold. first, purely economic reason. keep overall inflation low best contribution central bank make sound economic growth. furthermore, inflation tend modify distribution unfavorable way. second, well-known principle reach bundle policy goal best institution assign one goals. and, third, argument base democracy theory: institution grant independence, give clear mandate return. a generally stable currency, market trust stability orientation central banks, make low price increase time crisis. they also anchor inflation expectation low levels. the large currency area able cushion external shocks. in brief history, eurosystem already deal successfully three external shock crises. we see asian crisis 1997-99, oil-price shock 1999-2000 and, recently, terrorist attacks. europe escape unscathed events. however, low level turbulence within euro area contrast sharp reaction similar event period emu existed. this mean withstand regard worst-case scenario new currency. the european currency area exhibit great macroeconomic stability, benefit citizens, also benefit world economy large. for great macroeconomic stability become reality, convergence paramount importance. economic convergence precondition “one-size-fits-all” monetary policy really fit region euro area. a currency union, stable beneficial, need convergence three respects: nominal, real structural convergence. vi the european single currency foster strong economic integration mean foreign direct investment. in 1999, world fdi flows, ε 888 billion, three time high 1995. intra-eu fdi flow grow significantly fast period. in 1999, five time size 1995. in addition, intra-eu direct investment rise significantly since start emu. in year 2000, actually rise 50 percent. today, intra-eu fdi account one-quarter world foreign direct investment. 6 bi review 93/2001 fdi stock show similar picture. intra-eu fdi stock make 22 percent world fdi stocks. almost one-half fdi stock originate european union invest another eu member state. the fdi statistic clearly show, first, economic integration eu intense, and, second, economic integration deepen fast introduction common currency. these observation bear trade statistics. about one-half external trade euro-area member state intra-euro-area trade. vii it financial market benefit common european currency felt clearly. the implication euro obvious: rise liquidity, deepen widen money, bond stock markets, reduction transaction cost abolition currency risks. the euro speed financial market integration. correspondingly, function european monetary union depend heavily high degree financial market integration. it smooth function enable monetary transmission work. progress field tremendous, yet come. those part european financial market crucial transmission eurosystem’s monetary policy already integrate satisfaction. the wholesale market interbank liquidity euro area actually single european money market. in addition, european bank interconnect common payment-system infrastructure. and improvement euro-area-wide payment system undertaken. a day ago, bundesbank launch new payment system rtgsplus, improve security, reduce liquidity need expedite settlement gross payments. through system, 8,500 bank credit institutions, include branch world, accessible. the impressive progress, term integration, witness euro-area bond markets. yield difference among government bond different participant narrow five percentage point emu 30 basis point nowadays. the remain spread mainly due vary liquidity paper issued. currency risk divergent monetary policy long disturb euro-area-wide diversification. in term outstanding amounts, euro-denominated bond market still significantly small denominate u dollars. but term new issuance, market par. one reason sharp rise new issuance corporate bonds. here again, diversification within euro area increased. the issuers' nationality, determinant yield performance bonds, supersede factors, especially sectoral view. accordingly, investor equity market shift perspective country benchmark pan-european sector benchmarks. european equity market still small compare usa. the market capitalization domestic shares, ratio gdp, reach 90 percent [2000]. the match figure usa japan 152 percent 68 percent, respectively. equity market euro area grow fast. the ratio new issuance market capitalisation average 4 percent. this twice much achieve usa japan. further integration equity market europe hamper segmentation stock exchange clear settlement systems. a consolidation process started, foster legal harmonization field financial services. the degree integration bank sector mixed. on one hand, wholesale market investment bank largely integrated. on hand, commercial credit retail bank still operate national, segment markets. only european bank create cross-border merger start offer retail service standardize level customer one country. the financial system euro area still highly bank-dominated. at end last year, credit finance total 108 percent gdp. this twice much usa. the ratio hold deposits. in euro area, account 80 percent gdp, u figure 40 percent. bi review 93/2001 7 however, capital market increase importance euro area. disintermediation gain ground. financial market boom recent year investment bank (as well non-bank financial firm like institutional investors, pension investment funds) enlarge market share. disintermediation enhance need pension system rely fund retirement schemes. disintermediation change transmission process. basically, speed up. and disintermediation change income structure banks. a rise share fee dividends, expense interest income, increase volatility banks' income. since capital market integrate bank sector, disintermediation foster integration entire financial system europe. change bank sector prospect new basle accord applied. in general, welcome new accord help improve allocation capital. however, two special feature german economy considered: 1. the german economy largely dominate small medium-sized enterprises, know „mittelstand“. 2. our financial system rely large extent long-term financing. this long-termism finance contribute successfully stability prosperity economy, well financial system. that bundesbank argue bank regulation discriminate long term financial relations. small medium-sized enterprise revenue φ 5 million make 95 percent enterprise germany. this „mittelstand“ form backbone german economy. however, share outside capital significantly high large firms. a low rat therefore expected, unless collateral risk-lowering factor take account. here again, favor differentiate approach put bank large disposure small medium-sized enterprise disadvantage. since want new basle accord endanger prosperity stability economy, financial system, convince partner agree differentiate accord. viii let u share think international role euro. three year life, euro second important currency world. it take role deutschmark. the euro share roughly 13 percent international currency reserve — much deutschmark before. in field, dollar unchallenged leader, two-thirds international reserves. the size, depth liquidity dollar markets, well widespread habit use dollar intervention price commodities, explain predominance. a regard use store value, find evidence grow importance euro. 30 percent [at end-2000] international security outstanding denominate euro. this share slightly aggregate share predecessor currency shortly emu launched. that leaf euro second-most-important currency international security markets. again, dollar dominant currency, account one-half international security outstanding. a look flow data underline grow importance euro mean international finance investment. in first year (1999) euro important currency debt-securities issue aim international market; year 2000, fell back somewhat, 40 percent. the currency composition international bank asset present similar picture. again, dollar lead currency, share 40 percent, euro process catch up. from slightly le one-quarter end 1998, share rise 27 percent, twelve percentage point intra-eu bank assets. 8 bi review 93/2001 what see figures? although habit international use currency change gradually, euro already respectable market share. it market share roughly equal economic weight euro area. further progress development broad, deep liquid financial market precondition expansion euro’s international role. increase international use euro, currency international reserve holdings, investment finance purposes, might bear monetary policy, potential impact seem manageable. hence, eurosystem, adopt neutral stance towards internationalization euro. we regard market-driven process, neither hind foster it. ix lady gentlemen, for europe, introduction single currency event historic scope. the launch european system central bank come promise stability prosperity. stability must earned, again, day day. the german “stabilitätskultur” - one may translate "stability culture" - one cherish export european partner countries. european people share firm stability orientation. prosperity must likewise earned, again, day day. the eurosystem contribute provide environment stability, price fairly accurate indicator relative scarcity. the ensue efficient allocation resource precondition prosperity. however, policy area - must - respect monetary policy. people european monetary union hold single market single currency, know good - individually - also countries. this, lady gentlemen, i expect long life european version currency union, shape late 20th century. bi review 93/2001 1 jürgen stark: the euro - new european money speech dr jürgen stark, deputy governor deutsche bundesbank, conference host deutsche bundesbank association generalkonsulat german information center, new york, 19 november 2001. * * * i greatly honor speak today distinguish audience. it good new york tonight – i see event also sign solidarity sympathy wonderful people great city. to u germans, unite state stand u many decade follow second world war, berlin airlift 1948/49 reunification 1990, solidarity – chancellor gerhard schröder put day ago – “one-way street”. with unconditional solidarity, give back support give u many years. i wish express heartfelt sympathy lose relative love one horrible terror attack september 11. my sympathy also go family friend victim last week’s plane crash queens. even terrible weeks, new york always always symbol peaceful coexistence people backgrounds, one shin example entire world. i therefore especially please today. i am, course, also glad show great interest event possible organize event despite difficulty involved. my thank go make happen. i hope event help bring u little close state normality. i would like talk even “the euro – new european money”. when i speak council foreign relation 4½ year ago subject european monetary union (emu), i still need provide lot background. at time, even fairly sophisticate american dictionary offer two definition emu. the first said: “emu = electromagnetic unit.” the second said: “emu: large australian bird run well cannot fly.” today hardly likely anyone who, upon hear emu, immediately think european monetary union. if you’re think come europe next year, meet euro wherever go – week exist physical form. paris, rome, brussels berlin: europe, able pay single currency – euro bill coin – start january 1, 2002. for unite states, natural dollar legal tender fifty state union. for u europe, though, monetary union quantum leap, politically economically. in speech i would like address follow issues: 1. the historical background euro. 2. the essential feature new system ramifications. 3. the future outlook euro – political agenda. the historical background euro the euro quite new title speech would lead believe. in fact, euro already reality. the new european currency bear nearly three year ago europe enter stage three economic monetary union. however, compare dollar long tradition, euro “rookie” monetary policy league. however, “rookie” take field go tough “training camp” field stability. nearly five decade ago, far-sighted european politician kick drive toward european unification. sure, drive repeatedly hamper setbacks. however, thrust towards great integration ultimately unmistakable. european economic integration firmly establish accord principle “open market economy free competition.” this obvious back then, seem today. here unite states, particular, people might say “what else?” in europe, though, would behoove u keep remind take market economy function properly. only pay attention fundamental principle - personal responsibility, individual initiative, entrepreneurial spirit, competition – social equity 2 bi review 93/2001 achieved; need overcome severe structural problem still beset europe. we european learn much sphere unite states. the late great step towards integration europe entry stage three economic monetary union. the euro-area country enter community solidarity without “exit.” there precedent unique project. in fact, rightly call significant innovation monetary history since creation bretton wood system 1944. this project also unparalleled clear precondition need meet emu could launched. the country participate monetary union need pas stability test beforehand. only could currency merge form euro. by contrast, past currency cease exist fail function store value. the historical, political economic dimension project extraordinary. i sometimes get impression give due either side atlantic – europe unite states. there still seem u investor think “emu crazy – particular germany.” a single currency europe mean waive political sovereignty national level. this particularly difficult step take many people germany. that come surprise: d-mark transcend economic importance symbolize postwar reconstruction germany. the d-mark stand grow prosperity germany’s reintegration international community. this success story also play substantial role negotiation emu. yet ultimately courageous political success convergence achieve run-up make possible turn vision “one market – one currency” reality. through well-prepared yet courageous step, europe receive positive stimuli. the elimination exchange-rate risk among country involve great integration financial market advantage immediately obvious. however, medium-term orientation monetary fiscal policy represent even great success. a european stability culture emerged! this signify paradigm shift european economic policy. the essential feature new system ramification the new european reality, new economic policy regime, rather ambitious one. the path choose usual “one political entity - one currency” route instead one single monetary policy contend budgetary economic policy still largely hand individual nations. this difficult concept explain outside europe, even keep development europe. in unite states, people sometimes wonder europe really functions. by way, europe also wonder sometimes make unite state tick. we must learn understand accept exist institutional structure side atlantic. a choose economic policy regime must judge background historical developments, tradition specific regional environment. naturally, asymmetry centralize monetary policymaking decentralize economic fiscal policy generate certain tension. the way overcome state tension closely coordinate decentralize economic fiscal policy european level. fiscal policy member state additionally require stability growth pact achieve medium-term goal budget close balance even surplus. one rationale stability pact would ask much single monetary policy sole defender stability. the keep government budget sustainable. public debt interest burden allow go every economic slump happen seventy early eighties. an additional factor unfavorable demographic trend europe. the aim regain fiscal policy room maneuver avoid place undue burden posterity. this fiscal policy self-commitment europe “revolutionary”. fiscal rule type probably unprecedented worldwide. yet rule straitjacket. in monetary union, government sector important role stabilize demand. through automatic stabilizers, government budget steady effect economic development. in europe, automatic stabilizer twice effective unite states. one reason lie high european general government ratio; another difference level social transfer payments. give 2 % decline growth, stabilizer restore ½ percentage point gdp unite states, whereas europe would provide fiscal stimulus 1 % gdp. bi review 93/2001 3 a see, expressly objective stability growth pact stifle ability budget breathe sync economic cycle. the stability growth pact see burden member state pass opportunity consolidate budget past year far fail achieve sustainable medium-term position. however, sustainable medium-term budgetary position basic precondition fiscal policy stimulus able generate additional demand first place. give unsound financing, private sector save ratio would increase – make impend tax increase cutback transfer payments. this aspect i afraid often overlook debate european economic programs. in addition, indeed serious reason object anti-cyclical fiscal policy. the time lag political decision-making process implementation generally great preclude pro-cyclical effects. the fact tend adverse impact interest rate underestimated, either. the situation fiscal policy start completely different argument. here, unite state entirely different position europe. in euro area, general government ratio 49 % gdp, thus 1½ time unite states. i intentionally place fiscal rule europe top agenda talk. one reason necessary implication monetary union often overlook properly understood. the fiscal rule occasionally perceive barrier great economic growth europe. it easy get across message monetary union require institutional change monetary policy. monetary union lead creation new institution europe, european central bank. it independent institution priority task maintain medium-term price stability. this approach base broad consensus among central bank – europe worldwide – best macroeconomic contribution monetary policy make towards improve economic outlook raise standard live credibly maintain price stability medium long term. within consensus various concept different strategy also variety ramifications. at rate, monetary policy cannot work wonders. chairman greenspan week ago put way: interest rate cut instant fix every problem. however, contribute low stable inflation expectations. and stable money core element functional viability market economy. transparency price formation improve give undistorted view supply demand real economy. keep inflation low possible hold long-term interest rate minimize distort effect tax social welfare systems. decade practical experience wealth empirical study lead europe mandate price stability priority objective lead transfer task eurosystem, free political influences. this mandate use develop stability-oriented monetary policy strategy tailor specific need eurosystem. the changeover single monetary policy involve pronounce regime shift. the structural institutional change result insecurity regard future transmission process need take account formulate monetary policy strategy. for able perform task, monetary policy need earn market participants’ confidence. the monetary policy strategy must therefore credible – time take due account particular environment monetary union operates. such strategy must clear, comprehensible, transparent, reviewable compatible institutional independence eurosystem. the ecb’s two-pillar strategy meet criteria. the first pillar, assign outstanding role monetary aggregate, design “nominal anchor” recognize inflation essentially monetary phenomenon. the second pillar undertake well-founded assessment outlook price developments, incorporate entire range relevant cyclical indicators. many critic claim strategy inconsistent. for reason, recommend strict monetary targeting, others say inflation target way go. i think strategy choose sufficiently clear reflect specific situation european monetary union find in. in insecure world, possible assign two pillar fix unchanging weight. therefore, information relevant price outlook recompiled every time use framework provide two pillar subject fundamental analysis. yes, concept new and, 4 bi review 93/2001 reason, take time get use to. however, euro launch completely new environment, too. and independent approach chosen. the assertion ecb’s govern council base decision arbitrarily whichever pillar convenient time completely unfounded. today i would like call see strategy independent approach alongside others accept such. critic cannot use – wishful – think benchmark. and assume global “one-size-fits-all” monetary policy. of course, strategy pursue eurosystem require communication policy meet high standards. monetary policy cannot successful long run public accept it. this particularly case young independent central bank. it must constantly seek dialogue public. what often overlook ecb one transparent central bank world, communication policy go beyond statutory obligations. among important central banks, ecb hold monthly press conference immediately take monetary policy decisions. however, “track record” say word can. credibility gain actions, words. for eurosystem, mean adhere primary objective maintain price stability “in time-consistent” manner. the decision past two month clearly demonstrate ability ecb respond quickly exceptional event without give medium-term orientation. the ecb take due account global development assume share responsibility stability international financial system. in view, ecb govern council’s monetary policy decision need shy away critical attention public. however, make mistake attempt transfer macroeconomic framework exist unite state europe vice versa. on one hand, long-term interest rate europe play important role investment decisions. on hand, europe heavily regulate le flexible labor markets. the european automatic stabilizer powerful. in unite states, wealth effect valuation stock price strong influence consumer behavior europe. in seventy attempt implement short-term anti-cyclical economic policy teach u tough lesson. the necessary adjustment come painfully high macroeconomic price tag. even today many country suffer major debt run period, which, cases, 100 % gdp. the medium-term orientation macroeconomic policy hard-won. it precisely trouble time orientation adhere to. the future outlook euro – political agenda well now, specific change take place europe still changed? today’s europe resemble sclerotic europe eighties. prior monetary union, considerable adjustment undertake real economy, go start impact medium term. 1. the economy europe converge form single internal market. there barrier free trade goods, service capital. in nineties, many countries’ state-owned enterprise privatized, market liberalize deregulate – particularly telecommunications, medium energy sectors. monetary union final stage achieve single market. the money market fully integrated, european capital market also make great stride toward integration. 2. monetary union mean exchange-rate adjustment long possible euro area. the exchange-rate distortion occur time due external shocks, attendant expansion interest-rate spreads, thing past. these advantage already evident 1998 follow russian ltcm crises. these advantage equally evident past couple months. 3. the euro-area fundamental quite strong. the result medium-term policies, implement far, rat positive. since inception, ecb largely guarantee price stability. interest rate low condition borrow favorable. wage development moderate, government budgetary consolidation make progress. however, cause complacency. bi review 93/2001 5 economic growth euro area around 1½ % year; germany figure ¾ % most. at time unemployment, already high begin with, continue rise - especially large economies. europe’s problem potential growth rate sluggish 2 2½ %. in event global downturn, europe therefore quickly push brink economic stagnation. the priority must therefore increase potential growth. this cannot do long term deficit spending, even easy monetary policy answer. economic reform road lead success. despite creditable step toward reform take nineties, european economy still struggle raft burden past: high structural unemployment, welfare state overstretch capacity many countries, future strain cause demographic developments. the euro current economic slump make structural problem even apparent. at time, euro prove ambitious reform program european union. any economy refuse become flexible leave behind. just day ago imf call european government tackle structural problem labor market through, words, “a consistent coherent set labor market reforms.” these problem “head list remain structural priorities.” especially germany, issue involve - among others - • degree job security • type, amount duration unemployment benefit • wage formation process wage differentiation • amount non-wage labor cost and, extension, social security reform. these task country tackle accomplish itself. monetary union require flexibility national level – since exchange rate long available adjustment parameter. prior emu’s inception, many critic point optimum currency area could afford forgo flexible exchange rate adjustment tool event asymmetrical shocks. the mobility labor factor production europe, argument, restrict cultural, linguistic legal barrier effect necessary adjustment single currency area. however, one strike effect history european integration real shock become increasingly symmetrical. in addition, european economy le regionally specialize certain sector industry than, say, unite states. therefore, need geographical mobility likely le important factor. divergence exist currency areas, even one long establish unite states. in euro area, inflation rate range present 1.6 % france 5.4 % netherlands. by comparison, unite state inflation rate 2.4 % chicago 5.0 % san francisco. divergence real growth rate unite state le pronounce euro area, either. forecast 2001 range 6.3 % ireland 0.7 % germany. in unite states, average growth gap individual state ninety high 7 % gross state product (gsp). of course, much remain done. there clear correlation politically urgent structural reform international stand currency. the development euro's exchange rate since 1999 satisfactory, yet measure success failure emu. the euro globalization exert pressure policy market europe become flexible. at time, however, reform - medium long term - accelerate pace economic growth enhance attractiveness euro area well single currency. what crucial factor, therefore, policymakers commit credible manner tackle necessary change and, time, safeguard stability euro. a monetary history repeatedly shown, stable internal value precondition gain sustain confidence international investors, also give currency external stability. one main task national central bank eurosystem present prepare cash changeover january 1, 2002. this tremendous logistical task. it great challenge us. but i confident. we smooth transition national currency euro. i also convince issue euro physical form help improve acceptance new currency europe particular germany. the result late eurobarometer opinion 6 bi review 93/2001 survey show already growth support euro. in euro area, 66 % people support single currency. germany still lag behind, 53 % favor euro; however, significant improvement compare previous opinion survey. from economic point view changeover non-event; merely technical process. it final historical step towards political integration europe. at least, i hope euro also function catalyst direction. after all, history tell u normally territory political entity monetary area identical. this - yet - case europe. a consequence, monetary union cannot stand alone. in medium term, emu need underpin political union. in particular, stage intergovernmental cooperation must overcome foreign defense policies, domestic legal policies. that mean national interest become manageable ultimately overcome order move truly common european policies. the deepen european integration enlargement eu offer unique opportunity integrate europe peacefully create region stability prosperity. slowly surely europe begin liberate political standstill. political process take time since need support public majority. the deepen integration enlargement eu need support suitable political macroeconomic framework conditions. this include particular, favorable growth employment trends, which, turn, bring environment price stability. for first time history, european lapland portugal ireland greece use currency. and also importance: first time since empire charlemagne 1,200 year ago, french german unite single currency. i convince euro become symbol identification europe idea deep european integration – euro stay stable currency. this symbol reflect strong political long-lasting process economic political integration: • towards open market economy, • towards free competition, • towards tolerance democracy, • towards freedom peace. bi review 92/2001 1 christian noyer: challenge ahead - accession process speech mr christian noyer, vice-president european central bank, foreign commonwealth office, london, 12 november 2001. * * * lady gentlemen, it great pleasure able today foreign commonwealth office share think process eu accession challenge process pose accession countries. while recognise process raise challenge eu itself, i elaborate speech today. undoubtedly, enlargement european union embrace number country central, eastern southern europe mediterranean constitutes, changeover euro banknote coins, one main challenge currently face european policy-makers. however, i would give somewhat mislead impression i devote speech today solely “challenges ahead” without first mention foundation european structure. the latter form basis capacity actually meet challenges. eu enlargement rest prove success european integration. the european union constitute unprecedented framework successful development regional co-operation. not original objective european integration achieved, namely ensure peace prosperity historically conflict-ridden part world, european union also show ability overcome various economic political challenge confront throughout almost 45-year history. such attractiveness european integration project that, since treaty rome sign 1957, nine country join original six, host others keen so. a key accomplishment progress towards “ever close union” become truly tangible weeks' time, 1 january 2002, citizen european union finally euro, money, pockets. in many ways, prospect eu accession also instrumental trigger reform 12 country currently negotiate entry eu, namely five central eastern european countries, czech republic, hungary, poland, slovakia slovenia; three baltic states, estonia, latvia lithuania; two southern european countries, bulgaria romania; cyprus malta mediterranean. follow troublesome year begin transition process, accession country make substantial progress build institution design appropriate policy. the accession country generally achieve macroeconomic stability. the significance achievement demonstrate resilience show accession country asian russian crisis 1997-1998 and, recently, adverse development argentina emerge market economies. however, number important challenge remain. the year come crucial ensure current significant momentum accession process maintained, remain difficulty deal effectively order permit smooth integration accession country eu and, late on, euro area. the forthcoming enlargement eu will, doubt, increase diversity complexity within union unprecedented way. in economic terms, discrepancy real per caput income price level accession country euro area magnitude never observe previous enlargement rounds. in regard, however, bear mind combine gdp accession country account around 5% eu. the enlargement also confront european policy-makers enormous challenge political institutional terms. the sheer increase number member state current enlargement represent render function decision-making body difficult. a know, substantial institutional reform need ensure eu continue function effectively enlargement. from eurosystem's perspective, five economic issue appear great relevance current juncture: real convergence, inflation development accession countries, monetary policy exchange rate strategies, capital account liberalisation, structure function financial sector. let elaborate briefly these. 2 bi review 92/2001 1. real convergence sustainable rate gdp growth key challenge accession country years, even decades, come. 2000 first year since begin transition process accession country experience positive growth. the degree real convergence euro area, is, catching-up per caput income price level accession country euro area, remain limited. look ahead, appear unlikely overall growth differential accession country euro area significantly high percentage points. overall, gap average gdp per caput accession country euro area remain large. on average, gdp per caput accession country is, term purchase power parity, around 44% euro area, figure even low current exchange rate take account. the size gap, combine limit growth differentials, suggest process real convergence slow one, likely continue far beyond tentative date eu accession adoption euro. hence, although difference income level compatible membership emu, important accession country progress process real convergence euro area. in particular, real convergence help create economic cohesion within emu promote integration member states. further real convergence also help minimise risk effect asymmetric shocks. against background, seem crucial accession country pursue structural policy enhance potential output growth economies. 2. inflation development with regard inflation developments, i like stress that, whole, accession country make remarkable progress bring inflation single-digit rates. inflation accession country expect average around 6%-7% end year. however, reduce inflation relatively low level even low one clearly difficult task. evidence point number micro macroeconomic factor affect current inflation rate accession countries. these include ongoing price liberalisation, privatisation processes, relatively expansionary fiscal policy stubborn inflation expectations. inflationary pressure stem high productivity growth tradable sector fast-growing economy – know balassa-samuelson effect – also cite one main reason high inflation catching-up economies, accession countries. a close examination inflation development accession country shows, however, balassa-samuelson effect alone cannot explain persistence inflation differential vis-à-vis euro area. moreover, notwithstanding importance, balassa-samuelson effect overstate explain current inflation rate accession countries. indeed, empirical study estimate balassa-samuelson effect within range 1 2 percentage points. this mean, however, pursuit real convergence conflict progress disinflation. on contrary, process disinflation advance accession countries, pace determine overall economic situation particular need country increase real convergence. the maastricht inflation criterion, revise take account possible balassa-samuelson effect, see immediate requirement countries, rather medium-term objective central banks. a experience euro area participant shows, progress nominal real convergence be, be, pursue parallel. indeed, experience country greece, spain portugal confirm key element successful entry euro area success control source inflation balassa-samuelson effect. in particular, balance monetary fiscal policy mix control real wage increase support disinflation process countries, allow advance process nominal convergence without compromise gradual catching-up real incomes. 3. monetary policy exchange rate strategy with regard monetary policy exchange rate strategies, accession country already indicate intention join erm ii early possible entry eu. the accession country also signal intention adopt euro soon possible, is, two year erm ii membership. bi review 92/2001 3 the whole issue time erm ii membership, join long remain system, dependent somewhat complex question, namely whether discipline erm ii impose member advantageous accession countries. the answer, view, “yes”. lady gentlemen, allow reflect question moment explain hold view. be small open economies, accession country cannot disregard exchange rate development make monetary policy decisions. the exchange rate generally potent transmission channel monetary policy decision domestic interest rates, also play crucial role explain pass-through price development accession countries. thus, order achieve disinflation sustainable growth, excessive exchange rate fluctuation need avoided. in view, view support previous experience ems/erm framework, erm ii provide useful mechanism anchor exchange rate expectations. at time, erm ii, adjustable central rate current fluctuation band ±15%, provide accession country degree flexibility ems/erm follow decision widen fluctuation band 1993. this may suitable accession countries. give accession country still need complete process restructure economy catch term real income, flexibility inherent erm ii wide fluctuation band provide accession country sufficient scope accommodate reforms. bear mind erm ii constitute multilateral arrangement, consistent regional integration process accession country deeply involved, erm ii likely few potential weakness alternative exchange rate arrangement show recent years. of course, exchange rate arrangement, coherence macroeconomic policy must ensure successful participation erm ii. with regard length period erm ii membership, view vary degree convergence accession countries, limit duration erm ii membership minimum permissible time qualify adoption euro – is, two year – may optimal choice accession countries. long membership erm ii may, cases, helpful since would allow accession country retain exchange rate instrumental policy variable catching-up process. indeed, option prove useful current euro area participants. again, worthwhile recall example greece, portugal spain. in case greece, final revaluation drachma 17 january 2000 take place request greece, agreement eu authorities, support country's effort preserve sustainable price stability progress real convergence without jeopardise competitiveness economy. portugal spain, participate ems/erm long period time, also use option realign respective exchange rate escudo peseta several point along road towards entry euro area. participation erm ii should, therefore, see mere “waiting room” prior adoption euro. instead, regard meaningful flexible framework increase nominal real convergence euro area, tackle challenge face accession country progress towards adoption euro. indeed, experience current euro area member country field inflation exchange rate development strongly suggest exist institutional framework accession euro area, include convergence criterion define maastricht treaty, sound. furthermore, framework sufficiently flexible accommodate challenge accession country face path eventual adoption euro. 4. capital account liberalisation lady gentlemen, fourth economic issue i would like refer capital account liberalisation. in several accession countries, capital movement still subject number restrictions. the relevant restrictions, monetary policy perspective, apply short-term portfolio investments. although transitional period may allow treaty early year eu membership, well prior accession europe agreements, thus far, country request them. in cases, transitional period mainly relate area particularly relevant monetary policy point view (e.g. real estate purchases). 4 bi review 92/2001 despite generally positive impact capital liberalisation growth prospect accession countries, one bear mind speed capital account liberalisation may carry risk country underdevelop financial sectors, especially context fix tightly manage exchange rate regimes. if carefully sequence support consistent macroeconomic structural policies, capital account liberalisation could pose risk macroeconomic financial stability accession countries. it therefore crucial right policy put place eu accession. 5. financial sector structure function the last issue i would like elaborate concern structure function financial sector accession countries. partly historical reasons, financial sector accession country largely dominate bank sector, whereas financial sector intermediary still need developed. over past years, significant progress make restructure consolidate bank sector. this progress accomplish large-scale privatisation state-owned bank extensive opening-up bank sector foreign ownership. undoubtedly, process contribute great integration eu significant efficiency gains. it also support strengthen financial stability provide bank sector know-how capital. however, degree financial intermediation remain rather low challenge ahead considerable. give major implication structure function financial sector may macroeconomic developments, strengthen accession countries' financial markets, include enhancement legal framework prudential supervision, needed. the principal reason twofold. first, weakness financial sector partly responsible relatively modest growth rate observe accession country last decade. in spite substantial structural reform real sector economy, yet insufficient development financial sector may make transition fully function market economy costly many accession countries. financial sector development is, therefore, crucial potential economic growth increase real income catch euro area. second, financial stability accession country great relevance ecb, since central aspect ensure smooth conduct monetary policy enlarge euro area. financial sector vulnerability avoid may complicate efficient work monetary policy transmission mechanism. they may also pose great challenge conduct monetary policy, central banks' credibility maintenance price stability. finally, accession country embark process develop modern financial market infrastructure. this essential order facilitate transition plan market economy and, time, support conduct single monetary policy enlarge euro area. set financial infrastructure is, however, difficult task. first, preparatory work field subject long lead time and, therefore, need implement year adoption euro. second, target preparatory work move one: certain component euro area financial infrastructure may need adapt new member state integrate euro area. furthermore, ongoing debate international forum optimal structure modern financial market increasingly integrate global financial system. more more, market pressures, economy scale efficiency gain point need consolidation financial infrastructure. in context eu entry, take account relatively small size financial sector accession countries, plan develop financial market infrastructure may need bear mind specific condition apply accession countries. indeed, risk accession country may invest considerable effort resource develop infrastructure similar euro area country try rationalise. conclude remark lady gentlemen, i shall conclude brief remark general nature. the ultimate goal entry euro area ambitious one and, reason, necessary start prepare prospect well advance. broadly speaking, prospect eu membership encourage accession country make macro microeconomic adjustment necessary join euro area. in way, eu accession may set motion virtuous cycle long-term bi review 92/2001 5 sustainable economic growth. a experience current euro area participant shows, accession country may encounter difficulties, even sometimes feel frustration, different stage process. however, difficulty discourage accession country go ahead project entry eu and, late on, euro area. undoubtedly, eu enlargement pose great challenge accession country european union itself. create right economic political condition adjust european institution eventual integration eu accession country certainly enormous task. however – i come back i mention begin speech – project european integration regard stimulate exercise face never-ending “challenges ahead”, rather historic opportunity deepen extend idea europe. i confident we, europeans, specifically central bank function ecb, able master “challenges ahead” and, way, contribute completion european project successful integration future member state euro area. thank attention. bi review 92/2001 1 stephen grenville: policy dialogue east asia what criterion determine number group policy dialogue east asia? and criterion participation? talk mr stephen grenville, deputy governor reserve bank australia, australian national university conference regional financial arrangement east asia, canberra, 12-13 november 2001. the reference speech find reserve bank australia’s website. * * * i want begin clarify issues, i see them. if define try achieve regional co-operation, good position determine nature regional group need achieve this. my brief today discus relevant criterion group carry policy dialogue east asia. in define area interest, i may widen brief somewhat, sort regionalism i hope develop time go well beyond policy dialogue, indeed policy dialogue narrow sense seem press need. policy dialogue, evolve post-war period, largely macro-economic policy co-ordination, really relevant large country – essentially g3. for rest us, case policy dialogue, rather monologue – g3 could term international co-ordination, wear results, principally form substantial fluctuation g3 exchange rates, often inconvenient many. so certainly remain major issue international macro policy co-ordination, perhaps might hope input periphery, central regional arrangements. there are, however, important area regional arrangement potential important development policy: trade (less certain) exchange rate arrangements. the first seem beyond scope brief paper, i leave untouched: second focus discussion tomorrow, that, too, i leave others. this still leaf important regional policy issues, include possibility policy co-ordination face repeat - variation - 1997/98 asian crisis - i certainly talk this. but much general, wide perhaps important issue relate globalisation – maintain momentum bring much benefit (particularly region); make work good good rules; get proper representation interest forum determine parameter – “rules game” – globalisation. this, view, central focus regional policy dialogue. with general introduction, let turn specific different function regional co-operation might serve, group two omnibus head “policy co-ordination” “globalisation”. policy co-ordination have downplay centrality macro policy co-ordination introduction, let try specific degree policy co–ordination still important. i leave aside trade exchange rates, acknowledge importance these. but beyond these, i see compel reason why, say, country asia run similar monetary fiscal policies, even coordinate different macro policies. the heavy-lifting macro policy-making is, broadly speaking, domestic matter.1 1 i argue minor role international macro policy co-ordination (and largely confine g3). but international interdependence increases, need know understand happen world economy increases. the current international conjuncture perhaps coincident cyclical shape would impose globalisation – coincidence downturn g3 is, large extent, idiosyncratic. but little doubt international linkage much strong ten year ago, probability much strong still ten years' time. for us, ability forecast rest world move critical policy-making. 2 bi review 92/2001 there is, however, one aspect policy-making regional co-operation might make real substantial contribution – i.e. surveillance. surveillance is, perhaps, unfortunate way describe process, connotation check look shoulder policy-making individual countries, i.e. something intrusive generally acceptable region. when “peer pressure” become interference? the principal objective surveillance “catch out” expose policymakers wrong thing, rather act advocate good policy catalyst reform: context positive supportive, negative, proselytising, adversarial.2 reluctance assertive is, degree, current characteristic, process need give content surveillance beneficial effect. perhaps i explain point clearly refer surveillance process occur oecd, particular occur relation australia 1980s. each year face interrogation peer (the oecd secretariat two “examining” countries), quiz u macro micro policies, invariably viewpoint hard-edged economic analysis. this say always right, always put forward viewpoint input best-practice economics. why valuable policy-making process? it make easy national bureaucrat (who, by-and-large, agree policies) get policy implemented, within diverse decision-making framework less-economically-rational view might well prevailed. the fact surveillance examination receive quite wide publicity add spice fire policy debate often inconvenient time (because bureaucrat defend then-current – imperfect – policies), almost always salutary useful move u towards good policies. the additional area policy co-ordination may well relevant crisis response. other session conference look issue detail. specifically, main area co-operation pool foreign exchange reserves. build large foreign exchange reserve clearly demonstrate response crisis: faute de mieux, international capital flow volatility handle substantial reserve-holding. this rather inefficient response make le inefficient pooling. it also true regional group share enough self-interest encourage go beyond simple altruism: go ready help neighbour participate kind collective action distant region (which argue regional arrangement supplement imf, rather universal approach new arrangement borrow). rather anticipate late debate issue here, let quote, approval, yung chul park (2000): “one development encourage regional cooperation east asia slow progress reform international financial system. the urgency reform g-7 country recede considerably rapid recovery east asia. … a long structural problem supply side capital addressed, east asian country remain vulnerable future crisis before. instead wait g-7 create new architecture, whose effectiveness best questionable, would interest east asia work together create system defence.”. globalisation a i foreshadowed, feel issue globalisation even important regional co-operation policy co-ordination. let record briefly characteristic globalisation, try establish policy must attune need new globalise world, order foster globalisation – time – ensure get maximum benefit it. first, point close tautology, full policy implication nevertheless: globalisation mean increase part economic relation external party (for many east asian economies, foreign trade (exports import take together) far exceed gdp. 2 a dobson (2001, p. 26) observes: “peers must will supply constructive criticism potential actual difficulty must will accept objective analysis. unless government will enter kind give take, regional mechanism simply become another overlay officialdom.” bi review 92/2001 3 foreign trade (per cent gdp) australia 36 china 42 hong kong 255 indonesia 79 japan 18 korea 84 malaysia 202 new zealand 54 philippine 99 singapore 296 thailand 108 unite state 20 domestic trade investment subject myriad control regulations, even “free market” economies. in contrast, international relation lightly regulated. “the dilemma face enter 21st century market strive become global institution need support remain large national.” (rodrik - quote the economist, 29 september 2001, page 19 'a survey globalisation'). be disparity regulatory density reflect innate characteristic – relationship are, say, simple – reflect great difficulty regulate across sovereign borders? it seem latter, address deficiency. the need “rules game” seems, anything, great globalise world le integrate world. one define characteristic globalisation importance scale, technology drive optimal business unit large large number important areas. the define characteristic “winner take all”, relate concept “first mover advantage”. these characteristic combine together produce area monopoly quasi-monopoly important. the old response monopoly – break force competition – preclude restrict inefficiency would result action. so alternative channel achieve network rule address issue raise imperfectly competitive firms. give increasingly international nature enterprise, need complement development international rules, specific one country, develop uniform way acceptable all. these would address issue monopoly, intellectual property rights, legal issues. prudential supervision, capital flows, tax “industry policy” may also suitable case treatment. in short, close relation impose great need uniformity (e.g. tax investment regimes), need develop collective international environment. tom friedman (1999) call rule “golden straitjacket”, capture two important characteristic process – degree uniformity globalisation impose; generally beneficial nature rules.3 rule govern global relationship generally need uniform multinational basis, preclude need important regional input, order ensure applicability universal rule countries. a good set rule require recognition great diversity circumstance institution countries. one specific example rule prudential supervision. it seem quite likely rule relevant bank region would somewhat 3 it would easy exaggerate universal all-encompassing golden straitjacket may be. it seem true, example, tax rate become uniform across countries. 4 bi review 92/2001 different (reflecting different degree complexity make-up banks). we certainly would want set international rule unfairly penalise bank region, simply grind bank london new york. at general level, collective wisdom worldwide experience need incorporate golden straitjacket effectively date. it part conventional wisdom various deficiency perception analysis international response asian financial crisis. the “one size fit all” approach come early latin american experience, poor fit east asia 1997. to extent deficiency drive either inadequate representation, inability voice hear confident assertion whose policy prescription drive either doctrinal interests, vest interests, sometimes simple ignorance. regional group principal way address “democratic deficit”. there seem little room debate region inadequately represent many forum determine important issue globalisation. there seem little doubt, also, region pay price this. east asia, imf quota le 15 per cent, account 20 per cent world gdp, almost quarter world trade, almost half world foreign exchange reserves. prominent american economist david hale (2001, p. 8) observed: “in past, u.s. government support major (imf) intervention country u.s. military base. during asia crisis, example, u.s. act aggressively support korea, play much le significant role thailand indonesia.”. the case i want make much effort regional group direct towards correct this. there important improvement international financial architecture since crisis. the imf add new lend facility good able handle demand capital account crises. the fund also start pay great attention work financial market financial system critically examine policy prescription general approach conditionality. representation greatly improved, additional eight asian country gain membership bis. the creation g20 (with six asian members) is, potentially, good breakthrough. at detail level, negotiation basel ii involve degree consultation entirely miss basel i (which tailor specifically g10). there push fsf, imf g20 improve countries' resilience crisis promote adherence standard code much discussion way secure great role private sector crisis prevention

ensure voice hear remain unresolved, imf still give inadequate place region, representative group (such g20) still find role world crowd compete overlap institutions, none ready diminish status power, many govern inadequately representative views. who represent council world? this simply depend gdp – important, equally important issue contribution participant make debate, production universally acceptable set rules. to specific, g10 representation deficient limit numbers, uniformity view european-dominated membership – many people viewpoint.4 the development globalisation rule two-way process – regional group give input rule-making, act put rule place individual country (or least adapt rule fit straitjacket). the regional group “spread word” order improve policy. this closely relate idea policy improvement come surveillance process, add extra point good policy also come process swap idea simply observe way country go things. the process globalisation force degree uniformity similarity policies, extent “best practice”, quick adapt better. 4 for discussion role rationale regional arrangements, see grenville (1998). bi review 92/2001 5 what mean shape regional arrangements? a preliminary issues, need note international dialogue take place multilateral, regional bilateral levels. we surprise concern “layering”. nor overly concern fair degree overlap group meetings. if issue important, probably need discuss variety forums, bring different insight bear. check balance important. group simply get together make decisions: often get together order learn decision discussion take place elsewhere. so surprise see, example, finance minister meet together separately central bankers, then, separately, two meet collectively. we certainly allow ill-defined principle “territorial exclusivity” constrain dialogue would otherwise useful. when asian monetary fund propose onset asian crisis, people argue would overlap imf (and doubt colour view fund itself, prominent position within fund would within asian monetary fund). we recall that, many countries, three level government, contribution make, interact others way fruitful – pass regional issue digest (in sense achieve degree consensus), pass nation-wide macro view regional levels. petty territorial jealousy place work proper number organisation relationships: issue relate bring together group commonality interest, ensure link (both upwards downwards) fruitful ways. this commonality interest important criterion useful interaction. this mean participant stage development, probably mean travel along much path, albeit different distance speed along path. this commonality interest allow possibility effective consensus, pass next level, represent group whole. what right number group? if issue revolve around trade currency unions, economic analysis offer useful guidance country included. who (or potentially could be) good trade partners? what country meet criterion optimal currency area? the original apec membership, example, make economic sense trade group establish trade ties.5 but suggest fruitful dialogue general nebulous. at one level, one might ask whether matters: membership european single currency indeterminate last minute - turn much numerous people expected, look ahead probably become far numerous original proponent envisaged. that said, seem lot say keep number manageable levels, practical purpose might define term many people comfortably sit around table (i tempt add “and communicate without use microphones”). what know get size universal “one country one vote” representation (as see un), effective decision-making become extraordinarily difficult “lowest common denominator” outcome often prevail. to give concrete example response vex issue numbers: g20 was, one stage evolution, rather larger, recognise contracted. for surveillance, relevant point small group much candid (and therefore useful) discussion large groups. “small may well beautiful”. if, time, various participant develop knowledge, empathy understand practical policy constraints, much better. when come task develop rule (see discussion globalisation), important thing rule develop expert technician – know nut bolt particular issue rather arm-waving generalists. if degree detail domestic rule regulation indication take ensure good efficient commerce within countries, international deal require le complexity? these rule may well one apply domestic jurisdictions, technician give accurate read whether appropriate not. when compromise needed, compromise basis technical expert issues, basis vote power table. 5 see garnaut (1993, p. 308). 6 bi review 92/2001 two historical analogy the obvious model policy co-ordination broad sense europe, period four decade progress economic union despite history hostile relation members. europe's success attribute two main factors. firstly, economic dynamic: exploit obvious economic advantage follow geographic proximity. a second important factor europe's success underlie political imperative – firmly hold view part number politician need pursue great integration reduce prospect future conflict. this actively support unite states. the g10 much specific genesis, form country agree provide loan facility back imf's resource 1962. these resource make available event potential impairment international financial system, therefore g10 country themselves. over intervene years, g10 come central issue govern world financial system, context imf bis. the enormously influential basel rule prudential supervision develop (and, initially, for) restrict club g10. the point emphasise group form one purpose metamorphose new function – case, far important initial function. (we note g10 also illustration important gain seat table outset, since incumbent member – particularly small one – try avoid power diluted.) the group's effectiveness extend period probably reflect relatively small focus membership. however, world developed, g10 look increasingly unrepresentative global economy, give disproportionate say small european economy say rapidly develop country asia latin america. a couple lesson might draw historic experience: • group need specific task weld together – “frank fruitful exchange views” good enough. the european start coal steel community: i.e. something real substance; • patience virtue: necessity world take time build institutions. progress steady: may stall time, group hold together wait tide turn; • sense community common interest stem geographic contiguity, go beyond simple economic linkages. if progress towards close international relation important, institution build important element. “virtual” secretariat may place, real bricks-and-mortar institutions, effective active secretariats, needed. charles wyplosz (2001) make compel case progress european integration hugely assist presence europe-wide institutions, could provide on-going momentum particular could “pull plan drawer” country representative ready discus next step. it bureaucrat on-going vest interest push forward plan ready – wait “bottom drawer” – put table circumstance propitious. how well current group “fit”? in detail discussion here, i put one side issue trade exchange rate co-ordination. but now, turn see exist regional institution meet needs, put full range regional arrangement table. • apec broad regional grouping, bridging, importantly, east asia north america, also incorporate like chile, mexico russia. it predominantly trade focus see fortune wax wane development global trade, although addition finance ministers' leaders' meet broaden coverage. it principal achievement date bogor declaration develop country agree strive free trade investment 2010 develop country 2020. however, even show tension inherent relatively disparate group, initial call country bind measurable process significantly water down. the finance ministers' process focus encourage regional bi review 92/2001 7 dialogue promote capacity build may suit substantive agenda, particularly give political tension china taiwan. • the manila framework group broadly similar east asian-north american structure. it genesis push asian monetary fund midst asian crisis. it see prove one good surveillance mechanism among regional group also take interest global architecture issues. it could (but yet) forum develop regional position take world forum imfc g20. one main initial function provide co-operative finance arrangement supplement imf resources. this initially reflect second line defence facility offer indonesia korea. more recently idea revived, discussion underway possibility formal on-going arrangement. • emeap narrow group two senses. it purely central bank forum, draw east asian core two groups. emeap's state goal strengthen co-operative relationship among central bank region, although various member hold ambition group become substantial organisation, along line bis. the furthest emeap move track system bilateral repurchase agreement u treasuries, provide short-term foreign currency liquidity support. emeap's strength specialist work groups, promote good practice good understand technical level. this is, potentially, forum develop regional consensus issue capital flow (chilean-style inflow taxes: deal extremis crisis resolution). the value forum high level test formation bi asian consultative council, draw asian country mainstream bi activities. this already forum develop regional position financial issues, close link bi natural logical.6 • compare regional groups, perhaps great uniformity interest view within asean, go longest. asean run board already asean free trade area (which strengthen since crisis) multilateral foreign currency swap arrangement. more recently, asean set surveillance mechanism, assistance adb, effort foresee forestall crises. • the broad agenda asean+3 cover economic, social political fields. however, important achievement chiang mai initiative, incorporates, among things, regional finance arrangement (building asean arrangements) supplement exist international facilities. the significant momentum asean+3 may reflect east asia's equivalent europe's “integrate avoid conflict” imperative. there also strong belief international institution set work asia's favour asia must therefore look – particularly give large proportion world reserve hold asia. this felt strongly since asian crisis co-incidence chiang mai initiative grow around country felt aggrieved. similarly, country group common group bridge pacific. it could also argue size arrangement make workable decision-making entity, although difficult determine whether reflect physical number simply great uniformity country interest embody group. reserve pool arrangement could occur within manila framework group emeap, asean+3 seem action present. just g10 gravitate original narrow specific purpose become centre prudential supervision, asean+3 might general foreign exchange rate discussion occur. for part australia, supportive moves, regardless forum evolve. obviously, would like seat table, since believe australia much offer experience resources. we also feel policy-making enrich engagement asia certainly appreciate input like-minded country region difficult international debate recent years. 6 seacen longstanding group central bankers, focus south-east asia, membership spread wide sri lanka, korea mongolia. one initial aim seacen establish asean vote group imf ibrd. the vote group still exist seacen governor continue meet annually, although seacen's significant outward contribution appear train research effort seacen centre. 8 bi review 92/2001 should chiang mai initiative continue develop towards ultimate goal become regional monetary fund, view support it. if major development regard, participant presumably would want ass whether manila framework group, apec finance ministers, emeap seacen still play unique role. the bottom line probably early ass group continue play useful role, give uncertainty future world trade round, g20's unformed mandate, future direction asean+3. we should, nonetheless, critically watch development among regional group next two three year view make tough decision time right. conclusion i try make case, here, rationale regional group achieve macro policy co-ordination. the powerful case wide one – commonality interest geography contiguity still matter, even world globalisation (or even before). it part general view “we alone”. we learn much experience around us, gain experience often nebulous formless process talk issue people common interests. we meet discus specific topic, end wide knowledge, good general understanding, other. if view correct, regional dialogue inimical globalisation: is, fact, hand-maiden ally. bi review 91/2001 1 david dodge: brief outlook economic growth

and i would like turn now, i discus economic outlook step bank take support growth canada. when i appear may 2001, incoming information broadly line bank's expectation modest pickup growth second half

bank expect output growth canada close zero slightly negative second half 2001. for 2001, imply growth 1½ per cent. a look 2002, time strength recovery depend crucially geopolitics soon confidence return normal north america. but uncertainty stem terrorist act dissipates, i expect healthy growth output, investment, employment resume, give canada's sound economic fundamentals. at present, one envisage two scenario respect confidence. in first, confidence could restore quickly, robust growth could resume, support substantial monetary fiscal 2 bi review 91/2001 stimulus already place. in second, confidence could stay weak time and, consequently, growth would remain sluggish 2002. under either scenario, end 2002, economy would still operate level capacity. core inflation thus expect fall 1½ per cent second half 2002. total cpi inflation also expect decline 2 per cent end 2001 move 2002, energy price remain early-september levels. base considerations, 23 october, low key policy interest rate ¾ percentage point. the cumulative reduction 3 full percentage point since january aim support growth keep inflation close 2 per cent target medium term. give many unknown current

ahead. since inception transition, oesterreichische nationalbank opportunity active partner central bank transition countries. at time, oesterreichische nationalbank actively participate another historic project, realization european economic monetary union (emu) introduction euro. the establishment euro single currency 12 sovereign country european union certainly purely economic move, rather another major step process european integration begin half century ago. lady gentlemen, the strong rise commodity prices, particular oil price, 1999 2000, recent economic turbulence emerge market tragic event september 11 compromise stability euro area. on contrary, i would like stress especially, emu, among factors, contribute avoid possible exchange rate financial tension europe. however, terrorist attack u.s. dampen global economic activity 2001 postpone economic rebound least one two quarter 2002. apart irreplaceable human loss, direct effect terrorist attack overall u.s. economy likely limited. however, indirect effect private consumption, investment save could significant confidence consumer business already state fade. due increase uncertainty, investor become risk-averse. but policy maker react quickly. central bank around world, include eurosystem, act swiftly provide ample liquidity financial institution low key interest rate decisively. this adjustment interest rate come top early significant rate cuts. the govern council ecb also low key interest rate 100 basispoints 4 ¾ 3 ¾ % since may 2001. moreover, unite state euro area grow increasingly resilient shock past decade. structural reform aim efficient flexible product labor markets, deregulate financial market improve public finance enhance ability economy cope adverse shocks. thus i confident world economy, temporary slowdown, return healthy growth rate course 2002. in assessment, single currency play pivotal role, since euro establish stable anchor european, also global economy. among benefit already reap emu following: • stable currency base price stability throughout euro area • stable factor international financial system, • huge domestic market 300 million inhabitant (with high purchase power), • deep integrate european financial markets, • low transaction cost intra-european trade, tourism investment and, last, least, 2 bi review 91/2001 • cross-border price transparency increase competition. lady gentlemen, these benefit assure number stability safeguards: the eurosystem follow monetary strategy whose primary objective maintain price stability medium term. price stability define year-on-year increase harmonize consumer price index (hcpi) euro area 2 %. currently, euro area’s inflation rate somewhat definition price stability (2.4 % october). this mainly due temporary supply shocks, among increase oil price end 2000 livestock diseases. but late forecast confirm inflation likely fall 2 % first half 2002. still, present moment early conclude risk inflation banished. but doubt risk diminish due economic slowdown weak pressure demand side. another stability safeguard fiscal policy euro area become good coordinate recent years. the stability growth pact oblige participate eu member state achieve budgetary position close balance surplus sustainable manner, order minimize risk breach budget deficit criterion 3 % gdp, accord treaty maastricht, course business cycle. sound budgetary position create enough leeway automatic stabilizer take full effect economic slumps, also contribute reduce debt-to-gdp ratio consequently interest burden governments, increase investors‘ confidence euro area, keep interest rate low would otherwise and, consequence, lead crowding-in private investment. thus, current economic slowdown distract government successful consolidation process witness far. lady gentlemen, perseverance structural reform product, capital labor market constitute important foundation vibrant strong euro area economies, underpin euro anchor stability. product market european union already undergo sizable improvements, though underestimate important fully implement internal market legislation and, example, reduce state aid. in concert independent powerful competition authorities, type measure would help make economy efficient competitive, would also play part ensure price stability. in addition, utmost importance eu continue commit trade liberalization support open new trade round within wto. moreover, introduction euro accelerate structural reform european financial markets. apart make financial market le fragment competitive, important development lead efficient stable financial system. the recent tragic event unite state show quickly financial market come severe stress – sound well supervise markets, back liquidity provide central banks, cope even dreadful events. a regard labor market euro area, continue high structural unemployment low participation rate many member country cause concern. obviously function labor market need improve allow high employment. wage settlement line productivity development appear crucial attainment sound macroeconomic policy mix. the social partner call upon continue act responsible manner, thereby enhance prospect healthy growth employment. if mention macroeconomic structural safeguard adequately keep place reinforced, euro area remain area sustain stability. lady gentlemen, where central eastern european country enter picture? i convince enlargement european union - late stage - emu strengthen central eastern european countries‘ position enhance importance euro anchor stability. this bring topic current east-west conference “convergence divergence europe” – pivotal issue regard afore-mentioned historic integration process europe. a know, nominal convergence inflation rates, interest rates, budget deficit debt level among initially 11, late 12 member state european union ensure launch bi review 91/2001 3 monetary union introduction euro. this process accompany long-term movement toward real convergence also income levels, i.e. poor eu member state partly catch live standard wealthy member states. yesterday, first two session conference deal various aspect relate history european convergence detail. the transition process central eastern europe preparation eu accession large degree convergence broad sense. the economic system region approach market economy standards; macroeconomic policy-making pursue along principle western europe; institution build human capital formation proceeding. a realize, structural change modernization may often painful. on hand, privatization largely complete country region strong flow foreign direct investment contribute impressive advance productivity competitiveness. real convergence balance real nominal convergence topic afternoon sessions. challenge monetary exchange rate policy deal with. a know, eurosystem propose three-step approach monetary integration accession countries: firstly, accession european union, secondly, entrance erm ii, thirdly, join euro area eurosystem. inflation continue average somewhat high income-per-capita level remain much low “transition economies” present-day european union. in view, pace disinflation accession country determine line overall economic situation, particular need country increase real convergence. the maastricht inflation criterion see immediate requirement eu-entry, rather objective central bank period erm ii participation. but stick definition formulate maastricht treaty must. the eurosystem’s policy position nominal real convergence pursue parallel accession country strive achieve price stability medium term sensible. over past years, significant diversity monetary policy exchange rate strategy accession countries. over period, euro become main reference currency countries, include operate manage float regimes. in pre-accession phase, consistency exchange rate strategy macroeconomic policy objective take precedence choice whether reduce exist exchange rate flexibility. however, certain degree exchange rate orientation toward euro would line economic financial integration would also consistent prospect erm ii entry. erm ii arrangement necessarily see „waiting room“ prior adoption euro, flexible framework achievement convergence. in particular, real convergence help promote economic cohesion within emu integration member states, thereby support effort minimize risk effect asymmetric shocks. lady gentlemen, this morning discussion focus role financial sector. this sector predestine provide key contribution speed real convergence accession countries. significant progress make past year rehabilitate bank sector encourage foreign ownership. the latter also contribute great microeconomic integration eu. but financial sector still relatively small segment underdeveloped. create condition sound expansion intermediate role bank sector remain fundamental promote efficient use capital sustain growth. progress corporate governance enhancement legal framework support bank sector would also conducive achieve macroeconomic objective accession countries. look ahead enlarge european union, even important future today keep momentum exist convergence process promote further. nominal well real convergence key ingredient regional social cohesion thus, stability, union euro area. i look forward final session afternoon, deal issues. lady gentlemen, 4 bi review 91/2001 we immune adverse shock future. however, base stable architecture emu, i confident sound policy continue keep euro area robust shock absorber euro stable anchor. prudent accession enlargement policy enhance position european union add importance euro worldwide, reinforce major stable cornerstone international monetary system. this will, however, require perseverance structural reform effort various field within european union, well sound convergence strategy policy part accession candidates. together provide strategic response rise global competition common contribution global stability. thank much attention. bi review 91/2001 1 christian noyer: bank euro area speech mr christian noyer, vice-president european central bank, 30th anniversary association foreign banks' representatives, frankfurt, 8 november 2001. * * * i grateful invitation speak occasion 30th anniversary association "foreign banks' representative germany". your association 117 member large number countries. several member institution count among 30 major european banks, among bank elsewhere important operation europe. for many bank represent association, topic speech "banking euro area" part day-to-day business. it also day-to-day business european central bank (ecb) eurosystem whole, conduct monetary policy operation run target large-value payment system. the integration european bank system financial market interest bank central bank. for banks, mean liquidity benefit deep wide market low cost operate several countries. from central bank perspective, enhance efficient consistent implementation single monetary policy. we already enjoy benefit common euro area bank system important respects. an integrate money market exist liquidity transfer euro; bank inter-connected common payment system infrastructure; wholesale security market activity corporate finance service recognise geographical borders. however, retail level, international bank must still treat country individual market. this localise demand country-specific bank products, difference conduct-of-business consumer protection rules. the remain difference regulatory supervisory practice also play role. i believe institution understand well do, still cope task navigate business various national environments. i like explore double feature euro area bank today. on one hand, challenge central bank supervisory authority respond emergence common wholesale bank system order maintain financial stability. on hand, great integration, also retail field, remain important policy objective. i like address two aspect turn, start wholesale bank move retail side. a common wholesale bank system i share view common currency common central bank actually determine unify bank system. in nutshell, access common source central bank liquidity common money market – well confidence common currency – create strong interconnection bank operate single currency area. this case irrespective whether pan-european banks, whether discrepancy remain local retail markets. the case unite state illustrative. even strong inter-state bank limitation place – restrict retail bank activity small local market – u bank system was, nevertheless, commonly view single system. illustrative fact the progress make integration wholesale activity rapid remarkable. first, common euro money market place since early day euro. a large number financial product trade easily minimal price distortions, small enough prevent arbitrage across countries. likewise, data cross-border trade flow provide strong indication market unification. in case predominantly use unsecured interbank contracts, share counterparties euro area country double introduction euro. in addition, large proportion activity euro conduct counterparties outside euro area, especially london. the share cross-border transaction somewhat low case repo transactions, remain legal tax barrier settlement difficulties. all all, le 2 bi review 91/2001 40% interbank market activity conduct domestic counterparties. in 1998, share still 60%. second, wholesale payment infrastructure euro area – include target, euro i euro access frankfurt – already unified. payment flow system indicate significant increase cross-border interbank trade introduction euro. in term value, cross-border transaction currently account 40% kind target payments, instance. the degree integration certainly low security settlement, even though process consolidation take place. third, degree integration security market activity usually misjudged, since attention focus cost difficulty individual investor invest abroad. the picture completely different wholesale activities. the corporate finance market major customer actually already quite highly integrated. to give example, share domestic book-runners bond issue euro area company drop 80% 1995 36% 2000. a many security derivative market activities, market structure rely large european global financial groups. the trend towards high level integration also hold true wholesale asset management, investment increasingly diversify across borders. in term volume, growth impressive euro-denominated security markets, recent slowdown increase market uncertainty tragic event unite states. the deepen market particularly strong bond – euro-denominated bond issue private entity double 1999, market activity remain quite strong summer year. challenge stem integration two major challenge authority charge financial stability emerge common wholesale bank system: vulnerability common shock potential contagion major problem across many countries, problem arise. let take issue common shock first. clearly, integration open wide range opportunity growth contribute increase resilience system. it bring along wide range fund source – asset side – degree diversification exposure increases. but integration also render financial institution expose common shocks. for large banks, area-wide risk affect specific line business increasingly matter home country-related risks. one way illustrate point take look banks' share price development. since begin year, share price almost major european bank declined. the 30 large bank lost, average, around 25% value. the overall deterioration global macroeconomic condition financial market volume affect institutions, banks' profit outlook deteriorate follow likely increase provision need reduction income market-related activities. however, stock market change 30 bank range widely small plus significant minus 50%. in line notion home-country risk lose importance, banks' nationality long relevant determinant size stock market reaction. to give one example, large retail-oriented bank suffer mild deterioration, share price wholesale market-oriented bank even country decline quite substantially. in general, great stock market reduction occur bank substantial dependence decline investment bank activity, significant credit exposure concentration certain industry – technology sector airline – trouble emerge markets. these represent common risk element euro area banks. let turn second issue spread problems. the common wholesale market clearly drive force behind efficiency integration. market participant generally express satisfy way market works. bank able borrow liquidity one another across borders, instead resort central bank funding. the common money market also absorb large disturbance before. however, bank operate common wholesale system form network, could facilitate rapid propagation shock across euro area. a major problem key financial institution likely immediately transmit countries, large well-capitalised counterparties, via effect liquidity price security markets. bi review 91/2001 3 response central bank bank supervisor while responsibility financial stability remain vest national authority – even country participate stage three economic monetary union (emu) – need co-operation among national authority increase concern i mentioned. in fact, eu authority show awareness close co-operation essential strategy risk reduction prompt effective management problematic events. let refer main issue pertain activity central bank bank supervisors. first, eurosystem responsibilities, operational tool establish common monetary policy allow market-wide liquidity shock deal with. the quick successful reaction consequence terror attack unite state sign institutional framework able address consequence common shocks. already even 11 september, ecb announce ready provide additional liquidity. indeed, euro money market show sign tension 12 september, banks' caution lend fund due uncertainty regard liquidity needs. the ecb ensure availability adequate liquidity quick tender operation, restore normal function market, way as, instance, federal reserve accomplish dollar money market. in addition, ecb federal reserve bank new york negotiate u dollar/euro swap agreement 12 september. the purpose agreement channel u dollar fund european banks, counterparties federal reserve discount window operations. european bank face difficulty raise short-term u dollar fund due disruption u financial system. second, co-operation central bank bank supervisors, ecb, national central bank bank supervisory authority eu country recently sign memorandum understanding. it establish arrangement co-operation share information respect risk large-value payment systems. third, regard bank supervisors, eu economic financial committee recently reach conclusion – also endorse finance minister – that, exist institutional arrangement supervision crisis management adequate, cross-border co-operation need fostered. the co-operative body bank supervisor european union – bank supervision committee escb groupe de contact – currently address recommendation. the opinion ecb also exist arrangement provide adequate flexible basis safeguard financial stability european level. we also stress co-operation need enhance order ensure effective execution prudential supervision corrective action crises. for single monetary policy, important financial stability effectively maintained. let make remark also supervisory arrangement national-level. after reform carry unite kingdom establish single all-encompassing financial supervisory authority outside central bank, proposal set single supervisory authority put forward several euro area countries. tendency separate supervision central bank also emerged. in almost euro area countries, central bank traditionally charge supervisory functions. in euro area countries, adjustment already made. in austria, all-encompassing financial supervisory authority established, central bank still charge certain bank supervisory tasks. in luxembourg, supervisory authority create outside central bank. change also underway discuss germany, belgium, ireland, finland. the eurosystem recently express view continue national central bank charge supervisory responsibility would offer clear benefits. this would appropriate response challenge trigger euro, would enhance capability monitor risk financial stability area-wide perspective. in alternative arrangement, involvement central bank prudential supervision ample information share would necessary order achieve necessary interaction two bodies. a central bank supervisor position quickly ass systemic risks. these could generated, example, failure large complex financial institution payment settlement 4 bi review 91/2001 system security markets. we also consider traditionally express argument favour separate prudential supervision central bank would convince specific euro area conditions. for instance, concern conflict interest monetary policy lack domestic accountability overstate set monetary policy centralise supervision remain national. still disperse retail market despite progress i mentioned, market retail financial service still define quite strongly along national, even local, lines. in markets, instance, interest rate base local competitive conditions, know well. however, mean international competition. the fact association exist thirty year clear sign financial institution already international long time. internationalisation retail operation until now, branch subsidiary abroad prefer large-scale merger strategy enter foreign bank markets. the establishment foreign branch subsidiary increase steadily euro area. for example, number foreign branch german bank european union 59, almost double 1995. the average market share foreign branch subsidiary establish bank eu country 10% end 2000, definitely negligible. also, ownership structure bank sector change significantly. it long true luxembourg's bank significant proportion capital own foreigners. in ireland, belgium portugal, nordic countries, percentage banks' capital foreign hand range around 40% 20%. france, italy, spain austria also show ratio 15% 10%. for many large european banks, hold stake large player sometimes associate joint venture specific business line geographic area – example, accession countries. look strategy individual banks, bank already develop strong multi-country operation retail field. for instance, two major bank group retail activity five eu countries. in case, integration retail market proceeds, operation could expect emerge. integration could also advance via electronic banking, cross-border lending, still relatively limited. in fact, e-banking could represent forceful boost integration, since could allow customer access bank service offer bank countries, could powerful way enter new market without need establish costly branch network. response european authority a noted, bank international operation develop local products, also comply different legal systems, imply significant costs. important step take eu authority overcome obstacle segmentation. however, legal aspect one element hind integration retail markets, since proximity customer still important factor. even though likely retail market maintain local feature least time come, unnecessary burden cross-border expansion activity lift maximum extent possible. at regulatory level, european commission generally strive finalise single market programme via so-called financial service action plan. the high cost cross-border retail payments, compare domestic ones, topical issue, take sign lack integration. in july 2001, european commission propose draft regulation close gap domestic cross-border payments. in draft examine council parliament, bank would oblige equalise price cross-border domestic payments. the ecb state eurosystem share general objective regulation. however, eurosystem express reservation choose method, give little time bank industry adjust rational way. in context, i find recent initiative european bank federation self-imposed calendar reduce level fee extremely promising. bi review 91/2001 5 step also take field consumer protection legislation. the aim recently launch revision consumer credit directive promote transparency ensure cross-border credit flow harmonise condition consumer lenders. also, report regulation e-commerce financial service launch commission. it draw attention problem arise interplay different legal system make proposal overcome them. at supervisory level, economic financial committee stress need work convergence diverge national supervisory practices. the main motivation enhance efficiency national supervisory authority involve monitor cross-border financial institution thereby improve financial stability. this also link new framework capital adequacy rule develop basel committee bank supervision significantly increase scope supervisory discretion, leave broad room diverge implementation across member states. thus, demand supervisory convergence go increase. to extent accomplished, cost bank multi-country operation also become lower. conclusion in conclusion, i like stress talk requirement euro area bank system, concern ordinary co-operation across member states, necessary account internationalisation financial firms' activities. we talk single bank sector. this mean substantially reinforce co-operation, combine convergence supervisory policy practices, deliver condition continue integration bank activities. this mitigate potential risk financial stability stem new channel contagion will, turn, benefit euro area economic activity. bi review 101/2001 1 jean-pierre roth: review swiss economy: end-of-year medium news conference introductory remark dr jean-pierre roth, vice-president swiss national bank, end-of-year medium news conference, zurich, 7 december 2001 * * * the swiss national bank decide low target range three-month libor rate 0.5 percentage point 1.25%-2.25%. for time being, three-month libor keep middle target range. recently, national bank adjust monetary policy twice already. on 17 24 september 2001, low target range three-month libor rate 0.5 percentage point each. at time, act response decrease inflationary pressure undesirable development swiss franc exchange rate. the economic outlook since continue deteriorate around globe. in switzerland, sign price stability might jeopardise medium term. due development, position reduce rate again. accordingly, since begin 2001, low target band three-month libor total 1.75 percentage points, thus ease monetary policy considerably. assume three-month libor rate remain stable 1.75%, inflation expect hover 0.9% 1.5% next three years. the national bank project real gross domestic product increase 1.5% 2001. for 2002 anticipate growth rate around 1%. in following, i would like describe development inflation past month explain late inflation forecast detail. the dot curve graph show inflation forecast june 2001. at time, expect inflation climb slightly 1.6% mid-2002 and, subsequently, recede gradually towards 1.2% begin 2004. this forecast base assumption robust development world economy stable three-month libor rate 3.25%. we assume time economic slowdown experience unite state europe would overcome early second half 2001 swiss economy would able perform accord potential. the price oil expect stand approximately usd 25 per barrel. our forecast june overestimate inflationary development last months. year-on-year inflation, measure national consumer price index, drop 1.0% third quarter 2001 1.5% second quarter. in october inflation amount 0.6%, 0.3% november. this sharp decrease mainly attribute mark fall oil price price foreign goods. moreover, upward price pressure domestic good also ease markedly november still substantial october. the dash curve graph show late inflation forecast. the table contain average annual inflation rate accord new forecast. since forecast june 2001, world economy move towards recession. short-term inflationary pressure subside considerably. on assumption three-month libor rate remain stable 1.75% next three years, inflation amount 0.9% 2002, move 1.3% 2003 reach 1.5% 2004. the fluctuation anticipate 2002 inflation rate due basis effect reflect inflationary trend. inflation expect remain within range price stability throughout forecast period. from mid-2002 on, however, follow slight upward trend rest forecast horizon. this slight rise anticipate inflation attributable two factors. first, world economy recover due course. second, swiss monetary policy constantly low interest rate - currently 1.5 percentage point low june 2001 forecast - tend increasingly expansive effect time passes. these two factor combine cause inflation rise somewhat time. our forecast base assumption u economy remain recession mid-2002 subsequently gradually return potential growth path. in europe, economy presumably stagnate mid-2002 pick momentum afterwards. we expect u dollar remain roughly current level vis-à-vis euro. the forecast assume today's relatively low oil price eventually climb back slightly. at point, i would like briefly comment interpretation forecast. it base above-mentioned assumption regard development world economy, three-month libor remain stable throughout forecast horizon. in words, forecast 2 bi review 101/2001 show development inflation condition monetary policy leave unchanged. however, monetary policy certainly need adjust forecast period. the economic environment change continuously new disruption occur, national bank respond change order meet objective maintain price stability. therefore, important bear mind forecast make three-year period valid six month most, i.e. publication next forecast. the relatively long forecast period reflect time lag monetary policy measure impact price level. we publish forecast order inform public assessment inflation outlook, time forecast, basis unchanged monetary policy. the publication mean make monetary policy decision transparent easy understand. i make remark development swiss economy year end come year. the recessionary trend witness across globe leave switzerland unscathed. both year next, growth considerably slow predict short time ago. we expect economy go virtual stagnation second half 2001. overall, economy presumably grow 1.5% 2001. in line development major economic blocs, notably export capital spend shrink drastically, put major break economic growth. although consumer confidence dented, consumption far turn cornerstone growth. the decline construction investment also clearly moderate fall capital spending. we expect economy follow path mute growth perform potential middle next year. only second half 2002 see economy expand line development abroad. we project average growth approximately 1.0% 2002. unemployment likely climb month ahead. we consider current interest rate level exist monetary condition adequate enable economy return sustainable, non-inflationary growth. our forecasts, however, fraught uncertainties. in aftermath terror attack unite states, uncertainty particularly substantial. investment consumption depend whether market participant confidence quality stability basic conditions. depend development political situation, global economy may thus recover fast slow pace anticipated, exchange rate might subject major fluctuations. in case, national bank would review monetary policy. in short run, price oil also considerable influence inflation. if continue erode, measure inflation might fall zero months. should situation arise, important bear mind cannot equate sustain - thus economically dangerous - deflation. on contrary, low oil price level would create positive supply shock and, current circumstances, would impact favourably production. inflation would dampen temporarily. we also keep close watch development money supply m3 order ass medium-term inflationary risks. follow phase low, even negative, growth rates, m3 expand somewhat fast pace. so far, however, excess supply liquidity economy, money stock m3, therefore, point towards inflationary risk present. finally, i would like make close remark imminent introduction euro note coins. for three year now, euro exist deposit money. it lead fix exchange rate uniform interest rate level euro area countries. the introduction euro note coin additional positive effect economic development europe, easy compare price confidence new currency strengthened. moreover, euro regard positively regard swiss economy also swiss monetary policy. the swiss export sector profit low transaction costs, currency devaluation - previously implement european country order improve competitiveness - thing past. swiss monetary policy benefit fact large economic bloc exist europe pursue similar goal term monetary policy. all all, exchange rate fluctuation switzerland emu country thus remain level see launch euro. furthermore, market realise due course reason swiss franc, regard role safe currency, assess differently euro. this realisation reduce risk sharp appreciations. a result introduction euro note coins, euro increasingly use mean payment tourism sector hotel restaurant industry well foreign trade, degree simply substitute d-mark. apart viable exceptions, however, employment loan contract continue conclude swiss currency, large majority domestic payments, too, effect swiss franc future. the euro thus emerge bi review 101/2001 3 parallel currency switzerland. the purview swiss monetary policy remain unaffected arrival euro. by retain swiss franc, able pursue independent monetary policy orient need swiss economy, keep interest rate low level. in respect, exchange rate key element produce inflation forecast and, therefore, determine policy. inflation forecast december 2001 libor 1.75% 2001 2002 2003 2004 annual average inflation % 1.0 0.9 1.3 1.5 bi review 101/2001 1 hermann remsperger: enlargement european union european monetary union: maastricht meet copenhagen speech prof hermann remsperger, member directorate deutsche bundesbank, annual meet elec, frankfurt, 7 december 2001. * * * i. introduction1 the accession ten central east european country well malta cyprus present european union one great challenge history.2 in june 2001 gothenburg european council clearly state process european enlargement irreversible. it already foresee first accession country participate european parliament election 2004. what currently look possible “big bang”, initial major enlargement involve ten candidate countries. the new eu member state also commit adopt euro late date. contrary unite kingdom denmark “opt out” clause. this mean two three year enlargement european union could already far great number country participate european monetary union. in opinion, however, actual progress convergence rather pressure keep political date prime focus ongoing process integration. i would like start today describe fundamental economic fact concern eu enlargement. i propose outline challenge candidate country current eu member state enlargement process. ii. economic background eu enlargement the accession twelve candidate country eu first mean population eu set rise 100 million, word one-quarter. however, gross domestic product would increase anywhere near much. the aggregate nominal gdp accession country currently le 5% gdp eu whole. in term purchase power parities, weight accession country would roughly twice much. even measurement method used, however, considerable difference current member states. the candidate country also demonstrate major structural difference eu. the share agriculture gross value add average twice high eu, around 2%. sectoral employment also point existence structural discrepancies. in poland, example, agriculture contribute 3% gross value added, whereas almost 19% workforce employ sector. increase rapprochement eu likely result major reallocation resource even full structural harmonisation likely. at point i add accession country generally large current account deficits. although deficit thoroughly defensible country process catch up, persistent current account deficit make economy vulnerable internal external disturbances, especially relatively severe finance short term foreign currency. when paint external picture economy, need say average degree openness candidate country significantly high eu. this partly due fact candidate country fairly small. nonetheless, figure range 29% poland 109% malta.3 trade liberalisation prospect eu accession, together geographical proximity country present eu member states, lead 1 i would like thank dr sabine herrmann assistance. 2 turkey include deliberations. although apply accession eu, negotiation yet begun. 3 the degree openness define average export import good service percentage gdp. 2 bi review 101/2001 considerable intensification trade integration eu. import export eu average account around two-thirds candidate countries’ total import exports. in addition difference current eu member states, account also need take heterogeneity amongst accession candidates. with population 38 million around 40% total output, poland far large accession economy. gdp czech republic hungary, second third large economies, le one-third poland. most candidate country relatively small economies. a well size economic strength, standard live vary considerably. if purchase power parity take basis, figure range 24% eu average bulgaria 82% cyprus. nine twelve candidate country show le 60% average eu income. it therefore assume real convergence take time. the heterogeneity amongst accession country also see fact number different exchange rate regime operation. most country see exchange rate regime change least once, often, transition process. this partly attribute fact exchange rate policy fulfil different task various stage development.4 the current exchange rate regime roughly divide three groups. at one end spectrum estonia, lithuania, bulgaria and, extent, also latvia malta. these country reduce monetary policy flexibility significantly adopt currency board arrangement relatively narrow currency peg. at end spectrum country allow national currency float foreign exchange market primarily pursue inflation monetary target. poland, slovakia czech republic fall category. the third group comprise hungary, cyprus, slovenia romania5 peg exchange rate euro time allow external value currency fluctuate somewhat. iii. three-stage accession process the increase heterogeneity bring eu enlargement frequently perceive risk single market single currency. it must noted, however, candidate meet whole range requirement accede eu emu. these go far beyond nominal convergence criterion often cited. for reason, i think need take close look complex three-stage integration process. at moment first phase, last eu accession. then come second stage, period transition characterise two issues: entry exchange rate mechanism erm ii one hand convergence test membership emu other. the third stage begin accession country adopt euro. the complicate issue involve third stage cover paper. first stage: preparation condition eu accession in 1993, copenhagen european council decide european union would enlarge include twelve candidate countries, also establish term accession. the copenhagen criterion require new member state demonstrate sufficient degree political, institutional economic stability, comply obligation arise membership identify fully goal european integration. of particular relevance eurosystem economic criterion criterion adoption acquis communautaire, body eu law known. the economic criterion establish copenhagen require new eu member state function market economy able cope competitive pressure within union. this requires, among things, function property rights, competition, free price formation well-developed financial sector. the european commission’s progress report clearly show far malta cyprus fully meet economic criterion. although estonia, latvia, lithuania, poland, czech republic, hungary, slovakia slovenia function market economies, effort 4 see wagner, h. (2001), “pitfalls european enlargement process – challenge monetary policy”, present bundesbank conference 26-27 october 2001. 5 officially, slovenia romania operate strategy monetary targeting, although exchange rate implicitly peg relatively closely euro (managed floating). bi review 101/2001 3 need differ degree economy able cope market forces. in bulgaria romania reform effort must intensify considerably. while great progress already make term liberalise trade foreign exchange market privatisation business enterprises, prime consideration must give economic competitiveness. if country able cope international competition capital channel smoothly within country, paramount importance domestic bank financial sector efficient. this require high degree financial intermediation, liquid capital markets, bank sufficient capital base, function system bank security supervision sound payment systems. the financial sector accession country need development. all all, bank fairly low level financial intermediation. this primarily reflect relatively limit development position former transition country still undergo restructure process. for instance, bank expertise yet develop enough area bank remain insufficiently gear towards make profit. all also reflect loan private sector. here, candidate country display, average, around 30% gdp le one-third figure eu. the occasionally large spread loan deposit rate – average roughly twice high eu – point risk premium. some observer interpret spread indication bank system yet efficient enough. on whole, security market yet play major role accession countries. although equity market grow steadily importance since 1994, market capitalisation remain small comparison eu. the bond market dominate government bonds. corporate bond market scarcely exist. none unusual country process catch up. however, indicate problem regard competitiveness business enterprises. if major significance financial sector take account allocate resources, become apparent accession country need structural reforms. the framework provide copenhagen criterion intend ensure structural convergence. it necessary precondition accelerate process real convergence accession countries. the criterion adopt acquis communautaire oblige accession candidate implement enforce european legal act regulations. in term late adoption single currency, relate particularly central bank acts, movement capital, bank system stability financial system. by virtue accession, central bank new eu member state become part european system central bank (escb). central bank legislation must therefore line relevant provision ec treaty. the accession country must accept primary objective maintain price stability, ensure institutional, personal financial independence central bank prohibit direct public sector finance central bank. in addition, eu accession conditional upon liberalisation capital movements. nine twelve candidate country already able conclude provisionally relevant chapter accession negotiations. however, still pronounce differences. estonia, latvia lithuania remove foreign exchange control therefore fully liberalise respect, although still restriction purchase property land foreigners. the czech republic bulgaria also able fulfil relevant capital account provision acquis large extent. in poland, hungary, slovakia slovenia

(b) high degree last convergence adoption euro the long carefully plan process integration culminate adoption single currency. accession emu possible accession country show high degree last convergence. pursuant article 121 ec treaty, high degree convergence attain maastricht convergence criterion fulfilled. a clear benchmark thus set attainment target. sustainability convergence, however, difficult assess. the criterion merely meet time examination; also maintain time. both aspect important monetary union function smoothly. a high degree convergence the convergence criterion make considerable demand accession country term macroeconomic stability. the inflation criterion require high degree price stability back market economic conditions. this necessary avoid long persistent delay competitiveness within emu allow development tension-free possible within framework single monetary policy. stable price create atmosphere accountability, increase transparency allow resource allocate efficiently. they thus vital precondition growth employment. most candidate make distinct progress recent year term macroeconomic stability. however, counter-developments, especially prices, observe recently; addition internal influences, wage developments, result external factor – oil price exchange rate euro.9 great effort still need take double-digit 9 see imf(2000), “exchange rate regime transition countries”, washington. 6 bi review 101/2001 rate inflation romania, slovakia, bulgaria poland back acceptable level. in 2000 lithuania malta rate inflation would line inflation criterion. if inflation expectation keep low possible appropriate underlie condition stability-oriented monetary policy secured, deficit debt ratio need low. sound public finance also ensure national fiscal policy remain flexible even time cyclical downturns. this room manoeuvre become even important participant monetary union since long recourse instrument exchange rate adjustments. with regard criterion sustainability public finances, country make improvement large last year. on average, 2000 accession candidate virtually attain benchmark 3% establish maastricht convergence criterion. malta czech republic, particular, still high public deficits. especially background economic slowdown, however, candidate country likely experience mark deterioration budgetary position 2001. moreover, must bear mind deficit base definition always fully consistent eu. government debt country – exception bulgaria – around 60% less. the interest rate criterion require adjustment long-term nominal interest rates. in liberalise capital market difference nominal interest rate primarily reflect expectation regard development rate inflation, public finance exchange rate stability. view way, interest rate criterion provide assessment, line market conditions, whether convergence progress sustain long term. however, run-up monetary union become apparent interest rate differential decline sharply confidence accession grow (“convergence trade”). sustainable convergence in term emu accession, maastricht criterion intend ensure high degree convergence, also sustainability. structural discrepancy difference standard live could, however, lead economy drift apart accession. it consequently important ensure convergence sustainable. this particular importance price performance, i shall return moment. first, though, must say sustainability also vital fiscal policy. the treaty state persistent excessive deficit avoid (article 104). the stability growth pact give concrete expression obligation ensure government budget balance medium term. the stability programme stipulate objective achieved. the aim ensure stability orientation european monetary policy undermine lack fiscal discipline. the balassa-samuelson effect,10 called, mean above-average growth rate catching-up country accompany high rate inflation. this result major increase productivity trade goods. in case small open economy accession countries, resultant improvement return always lead price reduction may, instead, lead call high wages. the correspond wage claim non-tradable good sector, generally show progress term productivity, accompany high unit labour cost sector. the outcome high price catching-up countries. in connection frequent call definition price stability euro area increased.11 this intend prevent inflationary tendency fast grow economy counterbalance deflationary development countries. several aspect problematic. first, relax objective stability would undermine credibility ecb early stage development. second, impact balassa-samuelson effect need qualified. estimate put somewhere range 1%-3% p.a.12 give relatively small economic weight 10 see balassa, b., (1964), „the purchase power doctrine: a reappraisal“, journal political economy, nr. 72, s. 585-596 samuelson, p., (1964), „theoretical note trade problems“, review economics statistics, nr. 46, s. 145-154. 11 a proposed, example, sinn reutter (2001), “the minimum inflation rate euroland”, nber work paper, no. 8085, cambridge. 12 see broek/slok (2001), “interpreting real exchange rate movements”, imf work paper, 01/56, washington d.c.;

long term stable monetary environment absolutely essential price stability, healthy investment climate sustainable growth. this also bear numerous empirical studies. the imf, instance, show progress make precisely transition country determine push forward monetary stabilisation.13 the criterion lay ec treaty represent comprehensive set rule enlargement eu european monetary union. if rule respected, possible sustain degree nominal real convergence essential ensure european monetary union function well. with regard measure convergence ec treaty therefore also refer need take account result integration markets, situation development balance current account development unit labour cost price index (see article 121 (1)). the ec treaty subject member criteria, thus avoid formation two-class monetary union. to sum up, neither introduction new hurdle relax exist criterion appear economically necessary politically judicious. iv. conclusion i would like close summarise deliberation five comments. 1. accession central east european country well malta cyprus european union represent unprecedented integration process. owe large number candidate heterogeneity, mention difference new exist member states, involve face major challenges. 2. there general consensus integration candidate country represent political necessity economic opportunity. it perfectly understandable candidate wish benefit prosperity large economic area quickly possible. particularly introduction single currency, integration-related reduction transaction costs, great price transparency consolidation expansion capital market expected. in addition, accession country stand benefit ecb’s track record. a decline inflation rates, capital market rate tend fall improve investment term expected. 3. if one consider major significance financial sector allocation resources, become clear structural reform need accession country ready join eu. the framework provide copenhagen criterion intend ensure structural convergence. it necessary precondition advance process real convergence accession countries. 13 see havrylyshyn et al.

college, swarthmore, pennsylvania, 5 december 2001. the reference speech find website board governor u federal reserve system. * * * money payment system evolve time. the early form money commodities, cattle grain, come use mean payment store value, two property effectively define money. over time, precious metals, specifically silver gold, become dominant form payment. from 1870s world war i and, cases, great depression, many nation back currency gold. later, fiat money--currency coin issue government back commodity--became dominant form money, along deposit issue banks. what drive evolution money, future money? this first set question motivate lecture. money also provide metric measurement prices. that is, define unit exchange, measure price item term unit. money also obviously relate monetary policy. another theme lecture relationship nature money, scope change overall level prices, constraint opportunity discretionary monetary policy. the next step evolution nature transfer money appear spread electronic form money payment. in unite states, deposit money issue private bank grow rapidly late nineteenth twentieth centuries. from historical perspective, well-established form electronic money bank deposit store computer bank industry. ironically, widely use method general public transfer electronic type money still paper check, although large-value transaction bank business electronic. in early-to-mid-1990s, new generation technology create possibility store monetary value silicon chip embed plastic card personal computer. with developments, focus payment development shift electronic money--e-money--using card-based computer-based product (often refer stored-value card network money, respectively) consumer might use general mean payment physical virtual worlds. what drive evolution toward electronic payment perhaps toward new form electronic money? how rapidly innovation catch on, payment system look like future? how would spread e-money affect financial stability conduct effectiveness monetary policy? this third set question motivate lecture. in past, money often privately produced, though today note coin production generally become government monopoly. the development e-money generate fascinate debate possibility reintroduce privately issue currency unite states. what would implication payment system central bank reintroduction effect private currency? could development private money private clear balance make feed obsolete? if so, become monetary policy, would price level determined? these final theme motivate lecture. the evolution money the range commodity use time money wide; include cattle, grain, knives, spades, shells, beads, bronze, silver, gold. the old record use money date back 4,500 year ancient mesopotamia, part iraq. about 3,500 year ago, cowrie shell indian ocean use mean payment china. passage bible indicate silver 2 bi review 100/2001 use mean payment time genesis.1 the first coins--lumps “electrum,” natural mixture gold silver--were introduce asia minor seventh century b.c. lydia, part turkey. drive evolution money, early emergence commodity money, desire increase efficiency carry exchanges. in absence money, trade accomplish barter, direct exchange commodity service mutual advantage parties. such exchange require double coincidence want multiple trades. if i apple want grain, i find someone grain want apples. alternatively, i engage series intermediate trade ultimately result exchange apple grain. in primitive society small range goods, barter work well enough, range good expands, barter become increasingly inconvenient costly. several consideration affect evolution commodity money itself--from cattle grain toward shell bronze ultimately silver gold. commodity useful mean payment store value le bulky relation value, durable, homogeneous, easily verify worth commodities. these consideration favor use precious metals, example, cattle grain, encourage use gold silver rather bronze copper, affect way silver gold use money time. early commodity money, example, weighed, counted, include early us silver gold. the introduction coin stamp weight purity allow money count reduce cost associate make transactions. silver become dominant money throughout medieval time modern era. relative silver, copper heavy gold light cast coin size weight convenient transactions. the next important evolution introduction “representative” paper money. warehouse accept deposit silver gold issue paper receipts. these paper receipt turn begin circulate money, use mean payment hold store value. the paper fully back precious metal warehouse. once again, efficiency enhance convenience carry paper money oppose bulky silver gold coins. owner warehouse soon learn holder paper receipt would simultaneously redeem gold deposit them. the warehouse could therefore lend gold--in turn, often convert paper notes--holding reserve gold allow meet normal demand redemption. this begin fractional reserve banking. seventeenth-century english goldsmith usually credit transition modern banking, though first paper money introduce china seventh century, thousand year practice become widespread europe. paper note early bank introduce europe medieval time advance great bank family renaissance. the spread paper note fractional reserve bank open potential credit expansion support economic development also introduce possibility run liquidity crisis well risk insolvency credit risk associate lending. in nineteenth century, many country bimetallic standard, allow mint gold silver coins. but late century, many country move gold standard, currency bank reserve back exclusively gold. barry eichengreen (1996) describe gold standard “one great monetary accident modern times,” owe england’s “accidental adoption” de facto gold standard 1717. sir isaac newton master mint time and, accord eichengreen, set low price silver term gold, inadvertently cause silver coin mostly disappear circulation. a britain emerge world’s lead financial commercial power, gold standard become logical choice many country seek trade borrow from, emulate, england, replace silver bimetallic standards. 1 williams (1997) begin chapter 1 money: a history follow quote genesis: “then pass midianites, merchant-men, draw lift joseph pit, sell joseph ishmaelites twenty piece silver, bring joseph egypt.” williams note transaction passage quite plausible historical period suppose occur (early second millennium, b.c.), “one vital qualification.” he argue seventeenth-century english translator text mistakenly think reference coin (“pieces silver”). but, time, silver use medium exchange bullion, weigh transaction, count coins. bi review 100/2001 3 england officially adopt gold standard 1816. the unite state move de facto gold standard 1873 officially adopt gold standard 1900. the international gold standard refer period 1870s world war i, time major trade country simultaneously gold standard. though many country go gold standard world war i, return form gold standard 1920s. the final blow gold standard great depression, end gold standard history. eichengreen argue emergence gold standard reflect specific historical condition time. first, government attach high priority currency exchange rate stability. second, seek monetary regime limit ability government manipulate money supply otherwise make policy basis considerations. but world war i, economic political modernization undermine support gold standard. fractional reserve banking, accord eichengreen, “exposed gold standard’s achilles’ heel.” the threat and, indeed, reality bank run create vulnerability financial system encourage government seek lender last resort provide liquidity time distress. such intervention was, however, inconsistent gold standard. the international gold standard involve adherence certain “rules game.” first, national unit currency define term certain quantity gold. second, central bank commit buy sell gold price. third, gold could freely coined, coin represent significant part money circulation, form money convertible gold fix price demand. fourth, gold could freely import exported.2 with collapse gold standard, country move fiat money systems. fiat money inconvertible, mean convertible back commodity. it serf legal tender decree, fiat, government. it value base trust--specifically others accept payment good service value remain relatively stable. this trust based, part, law make fiat money “legal tender” payment tax and, unite states, also payment private debts.3 fiat money consist paper currency metal coin face value exceed value metal content coins. the need finance war encourage early effort government issue fiat money. early example include continentals issue american government revolutionary war, assignats issue french revolution, greenback issue civil war. most issue fiat money follow severe increase prices, government tap ever great degree easiest--in case perhaps only--source revenue. these experience highlight importance control money supply achieve price stability. today, money consist currency, coin, transaction deposit (that is, check accounts) depository institutions, including, unite states, commercial banks, thrift institutions, credit unions.4 it clear first check written. the early evidence deposit might subject check medieval italy catalonia. but time, depositor appear person withdraw fund transfer account another customer. check come widespread use early sixteenth century holland late eighteenth century england. the payment system evolve recent decade spread credit card debit cards. credit card allow consumer purchase kind good “on credit,” make payment credit-card company collection purchase late check. in effect, use credit card separate purchase good ultimate settlement increase efficiency 2 bloomfield (1981) refer strict version gold standard describe “gold-coin standard.” he note country operate variant call “gold-exchange standard.” in case, monetary authority hold reserve gold claim currency (foreign exchange) redeemable gold. instead move gold around settle payment imbalances, stand ready buy sell currency fix exchange rates, enable economize gold earn interest reserves. gold coin either circulate circulate limit extent country operate gold exchange standard. 3 section 102 coinage act 1965 provide part: “all coin currency unite states, regardless coin issued, shall legal tender debts, public private, public charges, taxes, duties, dues.” thus tender u.s. currency creditor, make legal offer pay debts. however, private business require accept currency form payment may develop policy respect, unless state law say otherwise. however, government require accept currency payment tax public charges. 4 i define money “narrowly,” include mean payment, broadly include highly liquid deposits. 4 bi review 100/2001 exchange. debit card allow consumer make purchase

return role electronic money today potential spread electronic money future. money, monetary standards, monetary policy the nature money determine important property economy, include scope change overall price level opportunity discretionary monetary policy -- is, control money supply effort improve economic performance. the basic relationship money price often describe term “quantity theory money.” in long run, accord proposition, price level move proportionately money supply. a result, rate inflation depend rate money growth. though proposition hold precisely restrictive conditions, identify general sense essential link money prices. it therefore useful understand way change nature money might affect determination price level.5 under commodity money systems, money often privately produced, price level non-money good term commodity money depend supply commodity money relative supply non-money commodities. in sense, absolute price level good economy, set relative prices. however, relative price non-money good term commodity money become, effect, measure money prices, would think term today. the supply commodity money, turn, depend technology and--particularly case precious metals--on pace discovery. price non-money good term commodity money need constant, opportunity discretionary monetary policy. a state come time monopolize issue commodity money, gold silver coins, often tempt debase currency reduce proportion silver gold coin attempt realize “seignorage” revenue issue money. debasement currency typically result inflation--a rise price non-money good proportion debase currency, which, effect, maintain underlie relationship commodity, gold silver, price goods. these first experience significant inflation induce government’s manipulation money. the next evolutionary step representative paper money. a long relationship commodity money amount paper money back commodity money stable, inflation determine available supply commodity money. but begin modern banking, break strict link commodity money money supply, add element flexibility money supply open possibility inflation. during international gold standard period, currency issue coin production link convertible gold, country’s total domestic money supply tie domestic supply gold. this situation guarantee stable price level, remove risk government-induced inflation. the result--and indeed important motivation--was constrain and, principle, eliminate government’s discretion regard supply money. the gold standard, effect, put place rule govern monetary policy.6 if country run trade deficit exceed private capital inflows, would, principle, finance difference ship gold countries. do reduce money supply--and hence income prices--in country balance payment deficit increase money supplies, incomes, price country balance payment surpluses. a result, system 5 the quantity theory money understand term irving fisher’s (1913) equation exchange: mv=pq, m = money supply, v = velocity (which define ratio nominal income (pq) money), p = price level, q = level real output. v summarize feature payment system determine much money need carry give volume transactions. fisher assume v constant long run q would determine economy’s productive capacity independent money supply. in face ongoing financial innovations, v constant, link money prices, even long run, precise. 6 in strict gold standard, opportunity discretionary monetary policy. however, many country strictly follow gold standard “rules,” and, result, squeeze degree flexibility discretionary policy gold standard practice. bi review 100/2001 5 built-in tendency move deficit surplus country toward balance. in fact, drain country’s gold foreign exchange reserve typically counter increase central bank’s discount rate. the effect income price was, case, due directly change gold supply, change interest rate implement limit drain gold. however, principle practice differ gold standard. richard cooper (1992) summarize contrast follow terms: “the idealize gold standard . . . convey sense automaticity stability--a self-correcting mechanism minimum human intervention, ensure rough stability price balance international payments. . . .the actual gold standard could hardly representation.” cooper note economic growth late nineteenth century respectable, variability income growth substantially great gold standard period world war ii.7 but gold standard predominantly price stability, might give special weight evidence pertain characteristic. cooper note short-run variation wholesale price great pre-war gold standard period 1949 1979. in assess economic performance gold standard, one must also look possible trend prices. here story complicated. if one compare 1877 1913, example, price level essentially unchanged. but period cover sharp extend decline price level follow equally sharp persistent increase. price 1873 1896, example, decrease 53 percent; decrease follow increase 56 percent 1896 1913. these swing explained, large measure, fluctuation gold production drive discovery new deposits. in early post-world war ii period, nation seek alternative international gold standard govern exchange rate international economic relations. at conference bretton woods, new hampshire, 1944, participate government agree maintain fix exchange rate system--more precisely, adjustable peg. exchange rate mostly stable could alter discrete amounts, prescribe circumstances--allowing deviation fully rules-based system one discretion. in practice, system implement commitment unite state maintain fix relation currency gold countries’ agreement fix exchange rate relative dollar, rate agree conference. fix exchange rate system provide degree constraint domestic monetary policies. under system, imbalance payment settle flow acceptable assets, typically gold dollars. most countries, give limit international reserves, follow policy consistent support fix exchange rates--though, note above, option change exchange rate. the unite states, however, unique position could print assets--dollars--acceptable settle payment imbalances. a long unite state prepare convert dollar gold, fix exchange rate official purposes, country seem will hold dollars. a dollar grow relative u.s. gold supply, sustainability system come question. when unite state break link gold 1971, major country long will accept dollar fix exchange rate. the adjustable peg system break down, world end up, de facto, regime float exchange rates, exchange rate determine supply demand foreign exchange market. most country operate fiat money system time. the combination fiat money system float exchange rate remove early constraint domestic monetary policy country make price stability dimension domestic economic performance dependent conduct domestic monetary policies. central bank learn exercise discretion support objective usually dictate legislatures, almost always include price stability and, case unite states, price stability full employment.8 there disappointment well success monetary policy around world. over time, number independent central bank increase significantly, independence 7 the concern gold standard increase volatility output reinforce barry eichengreen’s (1992) conclusion gold standard contribute severity great depression. he finds, example, country still operate gold standard throughout great depression suffer most, gold standard 1929 quickly abandon large escaped. 8 the precise language federal reserve act, amend 1977, federal reserve promote price stability “maximum

also contribute, time, smooth output employment growth. over last ten fifteen years, coincide increase emphasis price stability objective advance understand conduct policy, inflation performance good. however, country today continue impose constraint discretionary monetary policy fix exchange rate regimes, tie inflation rate inflation country exchange rate pegged. this system eliminate influence

progressively costly exit. the payment system today the payment system use today rely concept develop eighteenth century well develop twentieth century. paper instrument vital commerce electronic systems. to understand long-term incentive spread electronic payment potentially new form money, one must appreciate complexity cost associate current payment system. a check come widespread use, bank accept check deposit find way exchange check draw variety bank receive appropriate value checks--processes call “collection” “settlement.” first, bank send messenger directly bank collect money due customers, direct presentment method check collection. second, out-of-town bank would send check correspondent bank, turn would collect check, correspondent bank method. both method require significant travel could require movement large amount banknote gold. accord bank lore, third solution interbank check collection problem evolve british pub. a london bank messenger stop pint (or two)

especially time economic financial stress. such failure presumably result effect poor, dishonest, excessively aggressive bank management, well impact adverse economic shock poorly diversify banks. while modern-day private money issuer able hold diversify asset portfolios, could still face strain result larger-than-expected shock management difficulties. thus, one could imagine “runs” particular brand stored-value card, example, issuer think financial trouble. if issuer bank stored-value card were, legal sense, deposits, run could manage usual way, via discount window and, need be, federal

financial system. e-money monetary policy to appreciate implication spread e-money monetary policy, helpful understand concept monetary base (b). the monetary base consist currency hold outside bank system (c) bank reserve (r). in unite states, depository institution hold reserve either form currency--so-called vault cash--or balance federal reserve banks. bank require hold reserve transaction deposit (required reserves), voluntarily hold small amount excess reserves. monetary policy implement federal open market committee (fomc) set target federal fund rate. this rate bank borrow reserve

market operations, purchase sale security portfolio. when feed purchase security portfolio, pay purchase create balance one regional reserve banks--in words, create reserves. the federal fund rate determine supply demand reserves. through open market operations, feed adjust supply reserve market clear desire fund rate. the implication spread e-money monetary policy would arise substitution e-money currency deposits, shrink size monetary base. take itself, decline demand currency would direct implication conduct monetary policy matter monetary policy supply demand reserves.11 a decline demand currency would, however, low monetary base hence reduce size fed’s portfolio securities. the size fed’s portfolio, effect, determine seignorage government obtain issue monetary base. to extent demand currency declines, monetary base hence fed’s portfolio would shrink, interest earn portfolio would diminish. the feed us interest earnings, along revenue fee check clearing, fedwire, price services, cover cost operations. the cost today small fraction interest earnings; remainder return treasury. the treasury hence american taxpayer ultimate beneficiary seignorage. the interest earn also allow feed cover cost outside federal government budget appropriation process, contribute independence feed executive legislative branches. 11 today, open market operation carry partly neutralize effect swing currency demand level reserves. in absence offset operations, decrease currency demand would raise amount reserve hence low federal fund rate. for example, demand currency decline result spread store value cards, offset open market operations, reserve would increase bank convert currency deposits. bi review 100/2001 9 give fed’s cost operation today le 10 percent interest earnings, substitution stored-value card currency would substantial budgetary independence federal reserve would threatened--though, course, treasury would lose seignorage even first dollar substitution e-money currency. if feed lose much seignorage could cover cost current arrangements, would look arrangement cover cost way support independence. one reason doubt currency would dramatically decline much it--at least half maybe much two-thirds--is hold abroad mostly store value, mean payment. a significant portion outstanding currency hold connection criminal activities, anonymity offer holders. more interest possibility spread network e-money might dramatically reduce demand deposit hence correspondingly reduce amount bank reserves. the effect spread e-money reserve would depend provide regulatory statutory responses. for example, provider restrict depository institutions? in case, e-money balance could subject require reserves, case spread would reduce reserves. depository institution could competitive advantage offer e-money, treat another form bank deposit insure fdic. in case, spread e-money would significantly reduce effectiveness monetary policy. but financial even nonfinancial firm allow issue e-money? again, reserve would affect provider subject reserve requirements, though make would require statutory change. however, prospect spread e-money could reduce reserve generate many article interest debate.12 to address issue debate, let’s assume network e-money subject reserve requirements. in case, reserve would decline, would need analyze implication decline conduct monetary policy. fortunately, already experience early innovation reduce demand reserves. over past decade, example, bank implement retail sweep programs. these program sweep excess fund immediately need transaction reservable transaction account nonreservable save accounts, allow bank reduce require reserves. bank incentive use sweep reduce require reserve balance pay interest. a result spread sweep accounts, level require reserve balance decline $28 billion late 1993 $6 billion today. the feed worry decline level require reserve balance could result increase volatility fund rate require feed alter way conduct monetary policy. the concern would present spread network money substitute transaction deposit reduce level reserves. if binding, reserve requirement raise level reserve relative bank would otherwise hold. in absence reserve requirement, bank would still hold reserve settlement clear purposes. but without cushion provide require reserves, intraday interday fluctuation demand reserve could increase volatility federal fund rate. i note, however, date, despite sharp decline require reserve balances, increase volatility fund rate. the feed ask congress statutory authority pay interest require reserve balance well excess reserves. pay interest require reserve balance would greatly reduce incentive bank conduct sweep program would therefore raise level transaction deposit hence reserves. this would diminish risk decline require reserve balance would increase volatility fund rate. in absence new statutory authority, feed indicate might need alter way implement monetary policy, event require reserve balance fell volatility fund rate increased. to date, volatility fund rate increased, move direction necessary. however, volatility fund rate increase, one possibility would introduce regime floor ceiling would limit fluctuation federal fund rate acceptable range. the ceiling could set so-called lombard facility bank would able borrow penalty rate, perhaps 50 basis point 12 the debate touch provocative paper friedman (1999) turn provoke series paper topic, include king (1999), freedman (2000a b), goodhardt (2000), woodford (2001). 10 bi review 100/2001 target fund rate. bank would never pay 50 basis point target fund rate borrow reserve access facility borrow facility nonpecuniary cost. the floor would set re-deposit facility bank could deposit unwanted reserve feed rate perhaps 50 basis point target fund rate. bank would never lend market rate low 50 basis point target fund rate access re-deposit facility. the fund rate would thus limit 100-basis range, open market operation would aim keep fund rate average near midpoint. in principle, system could work somewhat narrow wide ranges. the system could implement spread e-money reduce demand transaction balance hence level require reserves. such system common, indeed almost norm central banks, conduct monetary policy. so lot experience unite state could presumably implement it, although statutory change might need set re-deposit facility.13 but spread network money fully replace transaction deposit reserve require money? several country eliminate require reserves, appreciate today reserve requirement essential conduct monetary policy.14 in case, assumptions, would demand require reserve balance central bank. nevertheless, trust e-money instrument complete, holder would presumably demand e-money exchangeable note coin par. in case, may problem monetary policy. to make good promise convertibility, issuer clear settlement bank would probably hold note coin balance central bank. the result demand monetary base would allow feed set federal fund rate (by set supply reserves, set term deposit borrow facilities). if trust private provider provider complete, nobody ever doubt ability convert stored-value network money dollars, demand monetary base could fall zero. but provider stored-value card network money would still need fund meet demand holder e-money use buy good services. today so-called settlement balance hold reserve balance central bank. even require reserves, bank would still hold settlement balance meet liquidity need might continue hold reserve central bank. in case, again, appear problem monetary policy. but, sure cover possibilities, let’s assume bank provider e-money choose hold settlement balance meet liquidity need form interbank deposits--deposits banks--instead balance central bank. in case, perhaps large money center regional bank would collectively take role provide settlement balance provider e-money. let’s call settlement banks. let u also assume settlement balance convertible balance hold central bank, link would enhance acceptability confidence e-money. this hypothetical situation--perhaps one interest intellectual challenge plausible outcome--forces u try understand minimum requirement effective monetary policy, define one maintain control short-term interest rate. michael woodford (2001) consider problem (or least closely relate problem) paper present recent federal reserve bank kansa city jackson hole conference. he convincingly argue monetary policy could still maintain control interest rates--provided central bank pay interest deposit balance offers. 13 for reasons, however, system might work quite well unite state countries. the stigma borrow feed entrench unite states. it clear whether extent stigma would overcome introduction lombard facility. 14 in recent testimony, federal reserve open possibility require reserve ratio could reduce time reserve requirement could even ultimately eliminated. see meyer (2001). specifically, feed allow offer interest reserve balances, demand voluntary reserve balance facilitate settlement across bank could rise. today bank voluntarily hold operate balances, level require reserves, facilitate settlements. these balance pay implicit interest, form credit price service provide reserve banks. but amount price service purchase bank limit amount balance make use implicit interest. payment explicit interest might permit feed ensure high enough level voluntary reserve avoid undesirable volatility federal fund rate low require reserve ratio or, principle, without reserve requirement. bi review 100/2001 11 the central bank conduct monetary policy case set interest rate balance hold central bank. bank cannot pay rate interbank deposit low rate offer balance bank could hold central bank. otherwise, bank would convert interbank deposit central bank balances. bank incentive offer rate interbank deposit high rate offer central bank would experience loss bank give low-yielding central bank liability exchange high-rate interbank deposits. the minimum requirement effective monetary policy is, therefore, ability central bank set interest rate balance hold bank central bank. woodford address possibility bank might positive demand central bank balances. even case, availability central bank balance credit interest rate set central bank would, view, effectively control interest rate interbank deposit therefore continue allow central bank conduct monetary policy. the availability balance borrow central bank would limit effectively control rate settlement bank pay interbank deposits. charles freedman (2000b) make strong case possibility bank would prefer use interbank deposit clear purpose rather central bank money far-fetched. central bank money unique property likely ensure comparative advantage relative interbank deposits. first, central bank balance carry default risk. no private bank financial firm match this. second, central bank typically provide access liquidity discount window stand facility, especially important event serious liquidity problem. bank may want maintain clear account central bank obtain fund quickly conveniently discount window. third, bank long tradition hold reserve (settlement) balance central banks. therefore, spread e-money unlikely reduce demand reserve balance central bank extent central bank could conduct monetary policy control overnight interest rate. first, e-money substitute bank deposit could subject reserve requirement. second, even deposit reservable reserve requirement eliminated, bank would likely continue hold clear balance central bank. in case, system floor ceilings, describe above, complement open market operations, ensure continue effectiveness monetary policy. e-money reintroduction private money: be feed obsolete? this leaf one last interest set issue explore. could e-money issuer successfully introduce new monetary standards-independent dollar-and either compete federal reserve central banks, operate without central bank? alternatively, federal reserve privatized, role take successful issuer e-money? after all, unite state always central bank. before 1914, private firm manage many activity handle federal reserve. thus, one least imagine world central banking, extent thing, private hands. the result, speculative cases, would clearly factor shape monetary policy determination price level would greatly changed. consider first possibility privately produce e-money replace federal reserve’s monetary base, allow establishment several compete private central banks, money (say, red dollars, blue dollars, yellow dollars). of course, legal tender law link government-issued currency make development unlikely. still, private bank somehow able establish currency fiat currency (that is, without make convertible feed dollar asset), monetary policy time would determine value currency, interest rate currency inflation rate. if compete bank provide currencies, would multiple price levels, depend currency, number cross exchange rates. but outcome would extremely inefficient therefore hard imagine ultimate outcome. indeed, euro area go way avoid cost deal multiple currencies. though technology may reduce cost handle multiple currency prices, point cost negligible. alternatively, private money issuer might adopt commodity standard, one could transact business money back gold commodities, example. in case, price level currency would reflect relative price commodity choose respective issuer. 12 bi review 100/2001 some, like lawrence white (1992), argue free entry business provide medium exchange tie commodity standard lead good outcome even without central bank, argue case scotland eighteenth century first half nineteenth century. but outcome may depend special factor (including unlimited liability banks’ shareholders). in current environment, issuer private money would, time time, likely fail able redeem money underlie commodity. moreover, clear private issuer would appropriate incentive hold capital act lender last resort crisis. indeed, i note earlier, central banks, least develop economies, issue currency provide clear services, least part, service offer features, freedom default risk finality settlement, private provider cannot match. what private institution take (monopoly) role feed (with feed disappearing)? or, equivalently, privatization fed? in case, overall price level would result monetary policy choose firm run private central bank. it clear private monopoly central bank incentive produce good monetary policy. indeed, give externality involved, seem plausible monopoly central bank issue fiat money would respond optimally crisis (it would charge much liquidity) cyclical variation (it would maximize present discount value seigniorage income rather minimize weight sum discount inflation output losses). if private central bank adopt commodity standard, action would constrain might lead stable price long term, subject limitation gold standard discuss earlier. but central bank’s incentive term serve lender last resort hold capital reserve would presumably still wrong macro externality would take account. ultimately, essential, view, require central bank act national interest profit-maximizing firm government back crisis ensure ability take require action without constrain financial resources. conclusion the evolution money clearly dynamic on-going process, drive incentive improve efficiency exchange. even today, long historical process evolution, leave payment system costly operate, require ton paper check fly around country reunite person firm write check first place. it seem inevitable evolution lie ahead. the spread computers, advance telecommunications, dramatic growth use internet point innovation e-money. these ultimately reshape payment system and, along way, present challenge federal reserve monetary policy. give slow pace progress strong likelihood stored-value card substitute portion currency, little danger fed’s portfolio shrink point feed unable cover cost operation. the spread network money, hand, might reduce demand reserves, network money subject reserve requirements. in absence reserve requirement network money, still likely central bank balance would dominate settlement balance private banks, give former’s lack default risk. in case, system feature floor ceiling appear well design allow feed continue implement monetary policy control federal fund rate. appendix 1: innovation retail payment system important advance make improve efficiency retail payment systems. for example, check collection cost may low use check truncation. in case, paper check stop - “truncated” - point process cycle, information continue flow. typically today, truncation check occur pay bank check return check writer. credit union handle check manner since late 1970s. bi review 100/2001 13 the early paper flow stopped, great proportion cost saved. for instance, cost save great one bank check collection chain transmit information electronically pay bank. the payee’s bank intermediary feed read information check present information electronically pay bank. this form truncation support use image technology allow digital check image capture archive use information purpose or, perhaps, use lieu original check. these image may return check writer. currently, arrangement must agree upon party check, may include bank stream collection, check writer. the federal reserve board develop draft law would facilitate check truncation remove several exist legal impediment use electronics check processing. another form truncation occur point sale, check written. in approach, customer’s check scanned, convert electronic payment, hand back customer. in case, payer’s check use source document create electronic payment. truncation image potentially improve efficiency clear paper checks. in addition, exist electronic fund transfer systems--ach, debit cards, fedwire, chips--have already substitute electronic transfer paper check many transactions. the recent federal reserve study retail payment find americans’ use credit cards, debit cards, electronic payment gain relative use checks. for example, 1979 2000, number check write per year increase 53 percent (or 2½ percent compound annual growth rate), electronic payment increase 500 percent (or 8 percent compound annual growth rate). a result, electronic payment account roughly 40 percent retail payment cash unite state 2000 15 percent 1979. credit card transaction today account half electronic retail payments, debit card account little quarter, remainder primarily ach payments. these trend expect continue. a part movement electronic payments, federal government encourage recipient receive benefit payment electronically, increase number taxpayer file electronically. the debt collection improvement act 1996 require federal payments, except tax refunds, make electronically 1999. while “requirement” eliminated, fiscal year 2001, 32.6 percent federal tax payment make electronically, approximately 76 percent treasury disbursement make electronically, represent 900 million payments. today, federal reserve operate extensive check clear system electronic automate clearinghouse (ach) system, alongside competition private check electronic clearinghouses. daily reserve bank receive 50 million checks, sort high-speed machine route pay bank local area throughout country. the fed’s check-processing operation also electronically capture payment data check create digital image many checks. ach payment instruction flow one bank computer another via federal reserve computers. the value check ach payment settle bank fed’s books. question raise year rationale direct role federal reserve retail payment system. in 1996 1997, federal reserve study group, direction alice rivlin, vice chair, consider future role feed retail payments. after extensive discussion bank industry representatives, group conclude federal reserve continue provide check-clearing ach service and, time, work private sector encourage payment system innovations. appendix 2: electronic payment system e-money potential type electronic money. there already important electronic element payment system operate since 1970s. one automate clearinghouse (ach) retail payment make electronically. this system use primarily pre-authorized recur payments, payroll, corporate payment vendors, social security benefits, insurance premiums, utility payments. more recently, use expand include process one-time payments, check merchant truncate 14 bi review 100/2001 point-of-sale or, occasionally, “e-checks” internet

monetary policy european central bank economic outlook euro area speech mr guy quaden, governor national bank belgium member govern council european central bank, conference ottawa, 30 november 2001. * * * for economist financial markets, euro reality since january 1st, 1999. the decisive step take moment irrevocably fix parity different national currency continue exist momentarily start single monetary policy conduct new european central bank. for general public, however, europe elsewhere, euro real last tangible form note coins. in little one month, january 1st 2002, euro banknote coin become part every day life 300 million european citizen 12 countries. and, unprecedented logistical operation, end february latest, 12 national currency disappear good. at moment, monetary union achieve completely. * * * to mind, implementation monetary union europe explain series long term structural factors. first european integration large extent political process, root two world war devastate continent first half 20th century. the schuman declaration may 1950, provide basis european coal steel community, state clearly “solidarity production make plain war france germany become merely unthinkable, materially impossible”. then come deepen economic financial integration common market logically culminate monetary union. finally, 1990s, large consensus reach regard objective stability orient macroeconomic policy contribute remarkable convergence towards low inflation limit public deficits, without monetary union would possible. * * * in new monetary constitution europe, call eurosystem play essential role. it consist european central bank such, situate frankfurt, twelve national central bank country introduce euro. the eurosystem confound structure central bank world, even federal nature. in euro area, monetary policy decision centralise on, implementation remain large extent decentralised. the govern council european central bank supreme decision-making body. it meet every fortnight consist six permanent member board ecb governor every national central bank. it govern council particular determine level official interest rates. in practice, decision take consensus basis, accord legal provision require simple majority votes. each member one vote: vote governor national bank belgium carry weight one president bundesbank, governor central bank luxembourg governor national bank belgium. the principle ‘one person, one vote’ thus reflect fact even though originally different country euro area, member govern council act completely independently representative country. the treaty specifically stipulate neither ask receive instruction government anybody else must take decision solely basis interest euro area whole. 2 bi review 99/2001 * * * in grant decision maker european central bank high degree independence, treaty maastricht- i think two thing go together- also assign specific task: i.e. guarantee price stability. indeed, treaty clearly state primary objective european monetary policy that, without prejudice stability, monetary policy contribute objective economic policy. in every country world population is, i think, opinion first duty central bank consist maintain purchase power currency issues. but mandate particularly stringent euro area, case previously bundesbank germany. the people europe, moreover germany, seem particularly attach price stability. moreover, central banker, case member govern council ecb, insensitive growth employment. but think growth stimulate detriment price stability, action short-lived costly long term monetary policy cannot resolve structural problems, particular structural unemployment, important europe. furthermore, price stability contribute economic growth sustain consumer confidence, essential element growth, favour low long term interest rates, rate even important finance growth short term rate many european countries. (it must observe moment short term rate high euro area unite states, long term rate slightly lower). the european central bank give precise definition understand price stability : price stability define “an annual rise harmonise index consumer price euro area le 2 p.c. it must maintain medium-term.” such definition offer stable anchor point expectation economic agent uncertain environment. it also offer public mean evaluate monetary policy, thus enhance transparency european central bank enable call account performance. the expression “of le 2 p.c.” specify maximum limit pace inflation consider compatible price stability. at time, word “rise” clearly indicate deflation must avoid way inflation. by define price stability level euro area, one clearly specify monetary policy base assessment development level. finally, one speak maintain price stability “in medium term”, mean one acknowledge existence short term price volatility, due non-monetary influence monetary policy must orient towards future (“forward looking”). * * * to reach target ass risk weigh price stability found manner, ecb carry analysis accord two separate, complementary, analytical approaches. these call two pillar strategy. in first pillar, emphasis monetary origin inflation, inflation indeed remain ultimately monetary phenomenon important role money supply strategy also emphasis responsibility eurosystem inflationary monetary pressures, central bank easily keep control inflation itself. for assessment within framework second pillar, use make wide range economic indicators, especially variable quality lead indicator future price developments. these consist of, among things, wages, exchange rates, bond prices, term structure interest rates, indicator budgetary policy, various standard measure real economic activity, result survey among producer consumers. * * * bi review 99/2001 3 if i make short comparison monetary policy unite states, canada euro area, i observe great similarity bank canada ecb : price stability clearly primary objective policy, whereas mandate federal reserve wide le specific. in country quantify objective(“inflation target”) subject agreement minister finance central bank, whereas euro area, central bank determine autonomously. it true euro area twelve finance ministers! however discretionary power feed great still. but apart differences, three central bank share characteristic major modern central bank : price stability consider necessary condition sustainable growth; enjoy high degree independence conduct monetary policy simultaneously strong concern transparency accountability. * * * during first three year euro’s existence, european central bank already confront important different challenges. at start single monetary policy, begin 1999, principal lead interest rate stand low level 3 p.c. during spring year ecb address deflationary threat low rate 2.5 p.c. late on, primarily due steep rise oil prices, also meat price europe inflationary risk appear ecb seek contain gradually raise interest rate 2.5% 4.75% november 1999 october 2000. no central bank avoid shock beyond control, oil shock, momentarily increase inflation. but central bank prevent increase certain price transform upward spiral price costs. the european central bank succeed so. euro area inflation reach maximum 3.4 p.c. begin summer year; since decline accord expectation drop 2 p.c. come months. the reduction inflationary pressure allow european central bank reduce interest rate since spring 150 basis point four move (coming 4.75 p.c., level low north america). these move moreover become desirable give weaken economic activity euro area. * * * the economy euro area affected, originally thought, slowdown unite states, (which important long last initially foreseen). admittedly, since trade european country become internal trade, monetary point view, pay euro, country become le dependent foreign trade such. but transmission channel developed: european financial market grown, wall street still set tone; european company invest large scale unite state last years, height profit investment influence result side atlantic previously case. finally, different shocks, increase oil price crisis new technology hit industrialise country recently tragic event september 11th significantly increase uncertainty world. it true economy euro area run moment slow pace. however economic activity return much satisfactory path course next year. normally high level uncertainty currently affect world economy diminish. and, exception confidence consumer entrepreneurs, condition recovery already present europe. i think gradual effect measure favourable growth already take (interest rate cut many country also tax cuts); fact inflation low still decline finance condition (both short term long term interest rates) become favourable. moreover consumer euro area hardly indebted le excess investments, make easy consumption investment take non-economic uncertainty progressively recedes. * * * 4 bi review 99/2001 europe island see 2001. however, full introduction euro should, without immunise u external influences, allow euro area come year register supplementary growth owe supplementary stability, efficiency visibility. more stability: since birth euro 1999, much already achieve field. within euro area exchange rate fluctuation disappeared. a framework set macroeconomic policy aim stability, monetary policy orient towards price stability fiscal policy, within framework call pact stability growth, towards sound public finances. these objective crucial confidence economic agent sustainable economic growth. the single currency also major step forward term efficiency, low transaction cost increase price transparency competition, even evident note coin introduced. monetary union also intensify integration european financial markets, improve finance possibility companies. the single

governor bank canada, stand senate committee banking, trade commerce, ottawa, 29 november 2001. * * * malcolm i please appear committee. we hope able so, regular basis, future. today, i would like start discussion spend minute explain bank canada go set monetary policy. the bank commitment contribute economic well-being canadians. this mean must conduct monetary policy foster sustain solid economic growth. a i say last march, unique contribution monetary policy make good economic performance preserve confidence future value money. when people count central bank keep inflation low, stable, predictable, make sound economic decisions. the bank pursue low inflation within framework base explicit inflation target, support flexible exchange rate. the current target aim 2 per cent midpoint range 1 3 per cent medium term. i say “over medium term” monetary policy action take time effect economy inflation. some effect felt fairly quickly. but full impact inflation take 18 24 months. so, set monetary policy, look ahead make judgment call future economic development time final outcome action take today. since adoption 1991, inflation target prove effective keep inflation low anchor people’s inflation expectations. they also provide bank useful mechanism assess deal demand pressure future inflation way help keep economy even keel. let explain inflation target work guide monetary policy allow bank help stabilize economy. at point time, certain level output economy produce without put either upward downward pressure inflation. economist refer level output “potential output” “production capacity.” the level potential rise time worker join labour force; business increase investment new technology, machinery equipment; policy measure take make product labour market flexible; u become efficient productive do. because potential output depend many factor interaction, something measure precisely—either level growth terms. but roughly estimate it, analyze trend factors. at bank, estimate potential output canada likely rise 3 per cent per year medium term (as show chart 1). in estimate potential output, find emphasis inflation control particularly helpful. it help u avoid systematic error assess potential. for example, inflation come persistently expectations, would strong signal production capacity high estimate, vice versa. now, term set monetary policy, key question economy likely relative potential several quarter road, affect future inflation. if economy likely operate close to, above, capacity produce, reasonable expect put upward pressure inflation future (chart 1). if seem likely take inflation target, bank would tighten monetary policy (that is, raise key policy interest rate) moderate demand head pressures. on hand, economy likely operate potential, downward pressure future inflation. if look would take inflation target, bank would ease monetary policy provide room economy expand. 2 bi review 99/2001 thus, emphasis inflation control work symmetrically. it allow bank take policy action prevent overheating, economy strong push capacity limits, support growth economy weak. let try relate recent experience canada. if go back fall 1998, worldwide reverberation asian russian financial crisis still much us, see chart 2 economy operate potential. since imply good chance future inflation would target, ease monetary policy latter part 1998 first part 1999. our economy rebound strongly 1999, expectation would continue grow robustly—above potential—for time, bolster strong domestic u.s. demand. with sign emerge capacity pressures, move gradually tighten policy late 1999 first part 2000, cool demand prolong sustain non-inflationary growth. the slow u.s. economy begin second half 2000 welcome economy grow rapidly time danger overheating. but we, analysts, anticipate collapse u.s. business investment, particularly information telecommunication sectors. this lead sharp slowdown expected. when become apparent early 2001, bank’s assessment would lead moderation growth canada, would leave economy operate somewhat potential mid-year. but also expect pace expansion would pick second bi review 99/2001 3 half 2001 strengthen 2002, return u potential output levels. so, although proceed loosen monetary policy, measure pace. in first half year, available economic information broadly line bank’s expectations. by midsummer, however, evidence begin accumulate recovery u.s. investment—a key factor expect pickup growth second half 2001—would delay slowdown country would deep last long anticipated. economic activity outside north america also begin show clearly effect weak u.s. growth ongoing global retrenchment information telecommunication sectors. in canada too, sign domestic demand, hold first part 2001, soften inventory adjustment well advance expected. so revise growth projections. the implication this, look several month road, economy would operate substantially potential inflation would target. that why, end august, low interest rate support domestic demand growth. the terrorist act unite states, worldwide fallout, introduce whole new layer uncertainty global economic picture, dampen near-term growth prospects. i tell difficult ass ongoing economic effect disturbances, may significant effect psychology north american household businesses. but, i say before, monetary policy forward-looking, make best possible evaluation likely development several quarter ahead. a look 2002, time extent recovery economic activity depend crucially geopolitics quickly confidence return normal. a discuss november monetary policy report, one envisage two scenario (chart 3). in first, confidence could restore quickly, robust growth could resume early 2002, support substantial monetary fiscal stimulus already place. in second, confidence could stay fragile time, growth would anemic 2002. note that, either scenario, canadian economy would still operate level capacity end 2002. this mean inflation would continue target next year. how bank respond this? to underpin confidence wake extraordinary uncertainty generate terrorist acts, take exceptional step low key policy interest rate 1/2 percentage point 17 september, outside regular fix announcement schedule. and move ease rapidly—by 3/4 percentage point, 23 october, 1/2 percentage point, 27 november. the cumulative reduction policy interest rate since begin year amount 3 1/2 percentage points, half—2 full percentage points—occurring since late august. this substantial amount monetary stimulus work support resumption healthy growth output, investment, employment, give canada’s solid economic foundations. 4 bi review 99/2001 in view ongoing uncertainties, still early characterize economic outlook great assurance. nonetheless, sign geopolitical situation may stabilize household firm begin adjust new environment, suggest somewhat great likelihood bank’s optimistic scenario may come pas case month ago. in closing, let stress i oversimplify bank judge performance economy relative potential. in addition, i mention factor influence growth potential future path inflation. but i provide basic element inflation-targeting approach bank us help promote good economic performance. mr. chairman, remark today i focused, appropriately, contribution monetary policy make sustain economic growth. but i want emphasize that, low inflation essential context, sufficient itself. other policies, macro- micro-economic, must continue focus enhance productivity raise production potential medium term. this focus extraordinarily important want achieve sustained, solid economic growth rise standard live time. we lose sight go current short-term difficulties. bi review 99/2001 1 david klein: a “package deal”? - policy change need 2002 thereafter prepare mr david klein, governor bank israel, background meet “haaretz” economic journalists, tel aviv, 20 november 2001. * * * clarification term the term “package deal” name give past plan action agree government non-government entities-the employers’ employee organizations-to achieve certain objectives. the objective usually low inflation reduce deficit balance payments. today face different situation: economy recession, high unemployment, significant improvement sight. in words, clear current policy need revised. be package deal necessary this, government require tool disposal act alone? it best answer question identify policy change need boost growth raise employment without undermine stability without increase balance payment deficit. what characterize current policy? policy reflect laws, government decisions, agreements, old ones, new. what set laws, decisions, agreement relevant today’s objective? there two anchor macroeconomic policy: 1. fiscal policy, aim reduce government’s size debt. the implementation appropriate policy sphere enable tax burden interest rates, mainly medium- long-term rates, reduced. both factor vital growth. we know budget 2002 position path need attain goals: – the deficit great plan estimate revenue base unrealistic growth assumption. moreover second year succession deviation deficit, undermine confidence government’s commitment return downward deficit debt path 2003. – by far great part additional government expense direct current expenses, small part (less one tenth) finance investments. what needed, therefore, attain objective, is: – to adjust budget 2002 ensure deficit set government adhere to; – to alter composition government expense addition direct investment increases. to this, another subject must addressed: private legislation it show conclusively exist law prevent private legislation change government decision budgetary aggregate (tax benefit grant reduce revenues, law pass raise expenses), impose order priority government different one approved, adversely affect growth employment. an amendment law require ensure initiative knesset member check light budget policy determine government. all private bill introduce last two year must cover amendment. 2 bi review 99/2001 2. monetary policy, aim preserve price stability support financial stability. the firmly establish stability, low rate interest need maintain it. stability low interest another essential key sustainable growth. without stability, investment, without investment, growth. certain additional step require complete monetary policy, case fiscal policy: – the abolition ceiling treasury bill issues. – the abolition exchange-rate band. – the abolition remain foreign-currency controls, make ni fully convertible. – unification tax rate interest income individual mutual funds, without affect total revenue source. these adjustment would shift center gravity monetary policy bank financial markets, enable price stability achieve low rate interest. furthermore, le important, change would make financial market efficient, improve competitive structure, thereby encourage save support growth. 3. in addition two anchor mention above, must give attention various aspect labor market wage policy public sector. the relevant topic are: a. the law currently force determine minimum wage update accord average wage. to avoid expose minimum wage irrelevant change wage structure economy, comply original concept underlie law (ensuring minimum income worker low wage levels), would good link minimum wage consumer price index (cpi). in order share fruit economic growth low wage levels, possibility add rise productivity examined. efficient method enforce law introduced. at time, salary senior public-sector office holders, currently index average wage, also switch linkage cpi. b. the policy reduce number foreign workers, particular illegal ones, implemented. c. the policy aim replace income support program increase participation rate labor force implemented. d. a special work plan draw retrain unemployed year. e. the

drift (compensation seniority; large differential grades; pace advancement grades; relate expenses) amended. 4. deal factory difficulty a governmental approach must determine deal problem factory difficulties: a. a legal framework necessary (“chapter 11”). b. a process must institute distinguish factory whose continue existence cannot justify economic grounds, face temporary difficulties. c. any recovery program particular factory require participation owner (including investor capital market), creditors, employees, government. on hand, all, include government, entitle benefit recovery program prof successful. bi review 99/2001 3 what next step? the professional team work team in meet call minister finance take place 14 november, 2001, chairman general federation labour israel (the new histadrut), president manufacturers’ association, governor bank israel, decision reach appoint professional team. the team’s role would formulate work plan i outline above. a work plan operative plan, work team must appoint go details. four team work parallel: 1. one team lead budget department, include representative prime minister’s office. this team formulate change need budget 2002, aggregate composition expenses; also deal amendment regulate rule govern private legislation. 2. the second team include representative new histadrut, representative wage labor agreement department ministry finance, formulate overall change need public-sector wage policy maintain real wage implemented. 3. the third team include representative ministry finance, new histadrut, manufacturers. it task look change need minimum wage law, way reduce number foreign worker israel. 4. the fourth team include representative bank israel ministry finance, function propose change remove obstacle obstruct conduct monetary policy boost development capital market. the work team complete task weeks, professional team able submit proposal forum appoint end year. summary the main change require must institute part normal process government reach decisions. this necessitate political agreement various member coalition, agreement employee employers. what consideration time package incorporate wage price freeze, large devaluation, change short-term interest rate, adjustment subsidies, case package deal 1980s. some necessary time, cannot implement practical basis, would cause harm good. in event, importance require change fiscal policy far outweigh change mention above. in certain areas, mainly connect labor market, would preferable, early packages, arrive solution agreement employee employers. the package discussion occasion thus different predecessors. in past, issue one clearly defined, quantified, step introduce specific time period. in past could ask “who giving, receiving?” today’s package must incorporate change operate rules-laws, decisions, agreements-without time limit imposed. this adjustment policy path, ad hoc changes, problem deal ad hoc problems. investments, growth, create job opportunity cannot realize today tomorrow; create climate encourage require transparent credible long-term policy. bi review 98/2001 1 urban bäckström: the swedish economy speech mr urban bäckström, governor sverige riksbank chairman board director president bank international settlements, swedish shareholders’ association, stockholm, 27 november 2001. * * * first word thank invitation evening’s meeting. i intend talk swedish economy monetary policy. the past year mark successive weaken economic activity sweden well abroad. forecaster world make sizeable downward revision prospect growth year next. consider picture economic future consensus economics compile month prediction 200 professional observers. at begin year combine assessment 2001 2002, gdp growth unite state sweden would amount 2.6 3.5 per cent. it foresee slowdown would comparatively moderate follow quick recovery. today, growth unite state judge modest 1 per cent year even weak 2002. in sweden, gdp expect rise 1.4 year 1.7 per cent next year. in words, look though slowdown deep protract many observer count le year ago. we experience simultaneous slowdown lead economies. after terrorist attack 11 september, moreover, even great risk cyclical decline pronounce persistent. the almost simultaneous mark change occur global economic climate latter part last year trigger important extent rise energy prices, high interest rates, fall stock market abrupt swing corporate investment. weak demand lead turn stock adjustment thereby downward effect order production. at time, fall asset prices, least stock markets, tend subdue private consumption. on top this, terrorist attack entail loss production short run postpone cyclical upturn. in many respects, economic activity follow normal cyclical pattern therefore surprising. after long period expansion, sooner late activity turn downwards economy gather strength renew upward surge. while nothing exact succession cyclical phases, one say activity always fluctuate le regularly. what unexpected, however, rate activity slackened. the downturn seem accentuate reaction excessive optimism technological breakthrough generated, give rise notion new economy. we recall virtually unbounded enthusiasm benefit would flow new computer telecom technologies. expectation rapid future increase profit income inspire firm well household many part world, perhaps unite states. investment consumption rise stock market production plans. this lead time grow imbalance american economy, instance save investment well current fundamental stock-market valuations. investment probably step rather quickly. although optimism part world become excessive unite states, doubt good many investment, consumption share-purchasing decision perhaps would make long-term view economic development realistic expectation prevailed. important learn history history teach u euphoric phase economic activity tend end sudden change mood. economist austrian persuasion see investment key economic cycle. in connection technological breakthrough, firm liable exaggerate innovation’s impact productivity. they may overestimate conceivable improvement productivity, example, well 2 bi review 98/2001 duration upswing. a result, growth cycle generate new technology infrequently culminate undue optimism misplace investment. when profit expectation ultimately fall back realistic levels, share price drop. corporate investment slacken economy’s aggregate capital stock adjust match reasonable long-term return. this accompany decrease household consumption, least capital goods, match realistic assessment long-term development income. the austrian school also provide u fundamental insight economic policy’s limitations. if technological breakthrough lead period growth investment consumption exceed sustainable long run, bind fall-off. after supply shock type, measure economic policy simply capable prevent adjustment realistic appraisal future. the necessity adjustment mean measure postpone presumably tend make painful occur. history teach u period i would call “growing pains”, optimism new technology achieve restored, albeit orderly, realistic guise. in opinion, neither rapid fall-off global activity terrorist attack 11 september upset grind optimistic new technology’s potential. problem many company after investment boom mark slowdown experiencing, risk good many company balance-sheet problems. one sign historically high september figure 12-month increase number bankruptcy world-wide among company credit rat moody’s. accord moody’s assessments, expect increase number bankruptcy end march. this accompany appreciably high borrow rate company low rating, well down-grading companies. the group firm high credit rat shrink proportion small even low time late major slowdown early 1990s, example. in view increase finance cost firm low credit rating, risk bankruptcy future, contagious effect among firm sectors. for firm high credit rating, hand, generally low level interest rate imply anything finance cost reduced. so risk increase problem credit exaggerated, though look though extent least, present fall activity stem supply side. above all, appear concern overly rapid abnormally high investment it telecom sectors. inflation prospect difficult ass one consequence riksbank base analysis condition sweden — guide action central bank — past repo rate hold considerably low level unite states. there also period instrumental rate european central bank. the central factor riksbank set instrumental rate prospect inflation one two year ahead. a prospect inflation 2 per cent target normally lead repo rate increase, inflation expect low target level, repo rate normally lowered, rate price increase forecast lie around target level 2 per cent, rate leave unchanged. the economic outlook rest world ought imply weak tendency sweden well, attendant ease inflationary pressure consequently reduction repo rate. however, decision-making situation simple. three thing particular make picture complicated: (cid:1)(cid:2)firstly, inflation currently riksbank’s 2 per cent target. the great part increase admittedly attributable number clearly define transitory factor calculate drop next spring. food prices, example, move connection mad-cow foot-and-mouth disease. moreover, electricity telecom price rise reason seem demand. but analysis hold increase inflation stem — wholly part — excessively overheat economic upswing? there also survey data point rise inflation expectations. but picture clear-cut. bi review 98/2001 3 (cid:1)(cid:2)secondly, picture may upset weak exchange rate. in relation comparable long-term equilibrium exchange rates, swedish krona currently weak even though appreciation low early autumn. with important proviso else equal economies, weak krona could warrant considerable difference monetary policy riksbank central banks. (cid:1)(cid:2)thirdly, swedish economy stimulate fiscal policy. a look household disposable income, tax transfers, develop year next illustrate this. even increase unemployment next year connection economic slowdown, everything point sizeable increase connection increase public spend tax cuts. so one hand continuation weak activity next year, excessively high current inflation, weak exchange rate lead time stimulation exports, expansionary fiscal policy fee consumer demand. in addition, current repo rate 3.75 per cent comparatively low, least one consider inflation around 3 per cent. the next question much importance accord various factor side balance carry weight. a regard excessively high inflation present, try analyse whether grind suppose stem swedish economy “overheated” recent upswing count earlier. the preliminary conclusion i believe draw explanation lie there. most thing suggest inflation ought fall back next spring transitory factor push price drop change figures. an alternative approach whether high inflation temporary permanent involve look development far important component costs, namely wages. in wage agreement completed, possible arrive comparatively firm picture wage developing, least year next. with reasonable assumption productivity, thing suggest unit labour cost line inflation target. this presuppose register increase inflation expectations, among labour market organisations, show wage increases; happen would unfortunate face monetary policy new challenges. it therefore important take seriously discussion go within trade union movement regard large expect price increases. the weak exchange rate, potential economic stimulus represent via exports, complicated. in past, mark improvement cost swedish export relative main competitor country tend lead increase export market share. at time, deny international economic slowdown particularly evident market importance sweden’s economy. a long market remain weak, large market share swedish firm yield notable increase volume. another matter it telecom sectors, swedish economy become increasingly dependent 1990s, problem dependent krona’s exchange rate; global factor decisive. however, also note order inflow manufacture fall le markedly early year. there certain sign level out, usually early indication possible upturn come quarters. analysts’ expectation year’s profit list company clearly worsen autumn accompany substantial upward revision next year’s profits. so overall appraisal krona’s exchange rate stimulatory effect entirely self-evident. finally question economic policy’s aggregate impact demand. what i mind next year’s prospect relatively large increase fiscal policy’s contribution household disposable income, accompany low interest rates. an expansionary economic policy normally tend stimulate cyclical activity, imply 2002 fairly good year domestic demand. however, least two factor could limit counter effect. one factor low share price tendency house price stop rise certain case fall. in recent years, purchase car consumer durables stimulate appreciation asset feature household wealth. conversely, fall asset price past year tend subdue purchases. the stimulus economic 4 bi review 98/2001 policy may accordingly dampen delay long asset price continue fall. of course, situation reverse share price property price instead stabilise, even begin rise again. another factor connect risk labour market. the redundancy statistic suggest employment level even fall next year, may involve attendant increase unemployment. household already express fear statistic sweden’s surveys. besides direct downward effect household disposable income, weak labour market may make people sweden cautious make purchase decisions. conclusion monetary policy all all, growth prospect short term somewhat unfavourable publish recent inflation forecast. however, major economic policy realignment number important country look like pave way recovery time. but presuppose household firm really start consume invest. major risk save imbalance over-investment. in sweden, too, expansionary realignment economic policy help strengthen household income. provide international recovery, weak krona stimulatory effect exports. a regard inflation, rate since april year riksbank’s target. the increase mainly due transitory factor i envisage will, before, dwindle spring. this presupposes, however, price rise spread item lead wage increases. another argument future ease inflationary pressure existence unutilised resource result slowdown. however, opinion, riksbank must watch development closely ensure recent rise inflation rate actually fall stick. most indicator appear imply inflation close target level 2 per cent, least within small margin one side other. this even i try present general account preliminary view aspect assessment future path inflation. i look forward continue discussion matter riksbank colleagues. our decision interest rate policy due meet next tuesday, 4 december. the result discussion publish follow day, 5 december, fourth inflation report 2001. bi review 98/2001 1 ernst welteke: the euro change europe world speech mr ernst welteke, president deutsche bundesbank, japanese bankers’ association, tokyo, 28 november 2001. * * * i lady gentlemen, first all, i would like thank sincerely kind invitation speak distinguish audience. it always pleasure tokyo. i especially appreciate opportunity discus financial elite japan change bring introduction euro. thank much. the european monetary union 33 day completion. on january 1st, note coin single european currency circulated. european able pay bill use domestic currency twelve member state eurosystem. for man street, sea-change. in economic terms, however, cash changeover virtually non-event. europe de facto common currency single monetary policy nearly three year now. the eu develop common market half century. however, member state closely-knit economic network (almost) use currency own. in 1999, economic financial integration make huge leap forward, eleven – greece joined, twelve – country decide embark common currency. ii what strange europe like, wake business day japan well advanced? let start figures. the euro area population 300 million people – quite similar unite states. the twelve country twelve national governments. people euro area speak eleven native languages. the euro area open three large currency area – unite states, japan europe. japan unite state important non-european trade partners. 17 percent six half billion euro gdp generate exports, current account roughly balance. average per caput gdp stand somewhat € 20,000 (roughly y 2.2 million), third le japan. difference country considerable. the public sector share euro-area economy account nearly fifty percent gdp, aggregate budget show small deficit. aggregate gross public sector debt stand 70 percent gdp. individual country figures, however, differ. for instance, gross public sector debt range four percent gdp (luxembourg) 100 percent gdp (belgium, italy). heterogeneity fact life euro area. but homogeneity far outweigh heterogeneity one crucial respect: unite intention form integrate europe common market strong reliable partner world economy. iii in addition, monetary union build host common value interests. the euro-area country share firm stability orientation. it reflect institutional framework european monetary union. the european system central bank two-tier system. it consist national central bank european central bank, ecb. both ecb national central bank independent political interference. monetary policy decision take ecb govern council, consist six-strong ecb executive board governor participate national central banks. the vote 2 bi review 98/2001 single board member governor carry weight notwithstanding size population home country. the rule "one person, one vote". unlike centralize decision-making, implementation single monetary policy decentralized. national central bank provide market liquidity, accordance decision ecb govern council. the primary objective european system central bank maintain price stability. the ecb govern council define price stability increase consumer price (measured term harmonize index consumer prices) le two percent year. the ecb govern council opt two-pillar strategy analyze prospective price movement medium term. in pillar one, growth broad monetary aggregate analyzed. this pillar take account fact that, medium long term, inflation always monetary phenomenon. in pillar two, wide range economic financial variable indicate potential future price effects, closely analyzed. the two-pillar strategy make broad assessment potential risk future price stability. the second stability-ensuring institutional feature emu – besides escb – stability growth pact. it spell member state suppose ensure sound public finances, treaty oblige avoid excessive deficits. wage policy another national responsibility. in recent years, wage agreement settle roughly line productivity advances. since start monetary union inflation expectation low stable. this reflect confidence eurosystem’s policy, help negotiate stability-oriented wage settlements. to sum up: we single currency, euro. monetary policy decision-making centralized, primary objective monetary policy clearly specified: price stability. stability-oriented monetary policy underpin stability-oriented fiscal policy. however, even watertight institutional political environment, stability cannot take granted. stability must earned, again, day day. the german “stabilitätskultur” – one may translate "stability culture" – one cherish export european partner countries. european people share firm stability orientation. iv how single monetary policy perform? at start, eurosystem saw period hitherto unprecedented price stability. in 1998 1999, consumer price rise 1.1 percent; year 2000, inflation rate, 2.3 percent, run little two-percent ceiling, sharp increase oil prices. this year, peak may, 3.4 percent, inflation rate decreasing. in october, price 2.4 percent high year before. in current environment weak world economy, ecb govern council expect moderation price movements. at meet november 8, govern council therefore decide cut rate half percentage point. it low key interest rate year 150 basis points, 3.25 percent. a generally stable currency, market trust stability-orientation central banks, make low price increase time crisis. in brief history, eurosystem already deal successfully three external shock crises. we witness asian crisis 1997-99, oil-price shock 1999-2000 and, recently, terrorist attacks. europe escape unscathed events. however, low level turbulence within euro area contrast sharp reaction similar event period emu existed. this mean withstand regard worst-case scenario new currency. the european currency area exhibit great macroeconomic stability, benefit citizens, also benefit world economy large. bi review 98/2001 3 v the three large currency area world – unite states, japan euro area – together account almost one-half world output. currently, growth rate dwindle simultaneously three major currency areas. that much high degree global integration, still underestimate many policy makers. global trade growth probably slow 1.3 percent year, 12 percent last year. the new round trade talk recently launch doha encourage signal respect. among major region world, china, oil-exporting country middle east russia (including neighbor countries) show growth rate seriously positive magnitude. there something like global business cycle. however, perfect synchronicity among different areas. causes, consequence repercussion differ three currency areas. this call area specific policy responses. the u business cycle close recession. remember, le year ago, forecaster wonder whether usa would see hard soft landing. the downward trend high-tech industry, correspond overinvestment it, prominent among cause downward movement growth rates. the save rate rise abruptly labor market perform ever-worse. after september 11, additional negative psychological impact overcome. risk sensitivity initially increase steeply terrorist attacks. we see widen corporate, especially high-yield, spread government bonds. the increase risk sensitivity major reason monetary ease still make way entire (corporate) yield curve. more recently, spread recede somewhat. they are, however, still pre-attack level. the unite state respond quickly worsen economic outlook. the feed low interest rates, federal government substantially reduce taxes. firm market adjust quickly. i doubt u economy show rise growth rate within months. japan — need tell — could withstand global downward trend, overall economic situation favorable years. the economy still recover effect prolong bank crisis follow bubble economy late eighties. finally, euro-area business cycle follow global trend closely manifest recent years. this see outcome close links, owe increase foreign direct portfolio investment. export business investment lead slowdown europe. growth rate diminished, employment gain come halt, prospect next year worsen past months. both business consumer sentiment tend weak. however, still high than, instance, recession 1993. so capacity utilization. adjustment take place reinvigorate growth next year. a usual, expectation adjust fast production. for europe, psychological factor le important currency area. overall, political situation world today pronounce impact world economy le trouble times. the degree uncertainty factor watch global short-term economic developments. european monetary union repeatedly spar u turmoil euro area. on hand, lead tremendous change within europe. one – one vital interest – change role bundesbank europe. vi among participate national central banks, bundesbank one see great change induce changeover truly european currency. before emu, bundesbank effectively – although formally – central bank decide monetary policy much europe. the deutschmark key currency europe, second important currency world. to day, deutschmark byword stability. now deutschmark history, german central bank integral part supranational european system central banks. the bundesbank active process design escb. important feature system model bundesbank. 4 bi review 98/2001 a german central bank, relinquish outstanding position europe. the lead role hand – trustworthy hand escb. decision-making european monetary policy centralized. that constitute major change europe. a long bundesbank lead central bank europe, european monetary policy design fit germany, design fit euro area whole. the bundesbank contribute vast experience field economic financial analysis. extensive research analysis always foundation german monetary policy. the bundesbank part intellectual infrastructure germany europe – intend remain "think tank". in addition, implementation monetary policy entirely hand national central banks, deal monetary financial institution home country. other decentralize function are: (cid:1)(cid:2)the operation payment systems, interconnect target system. (cid:1)(cid:2)the distribution cash. (cid:1)(cid:2)the hold management currency reserves. and, national central bank explain eurosystem’s monetary policy general public respective home country. the role bundesbank change tremendously. we surrender sovereignty, become part large system. this easy process, worth effort. vii for great macroeconomic stability envisage architect monetary union become reality, essential member state convergent economies. a currency union, stable beneficial, need convergence three respects: nominal, real structural convergence. a regard nominal convergence, inflation rate key criterion. the gap inflation rate – measure standard deviation emu country-inflation rate – basically unchanged since launch emu. a regard real convergence, i use term sense synchronicity business cycles. the govern council european central bank set monetary policy appropriate euro area whole. a country whose business cycle get grossly step might suffer subject monetary policy inappropriate national economy. however, march absolute lockstep necessary, know past experience unite states, certain region grow fast others. the growth rate state region within currency union may differ degree. it size gap actual potential growth rate matters. if potential output-growth rate differ, actual growth rate may differ well. that necessarily indicate lack real convergence. in long run, stability must build upon economic integration, bring structural convergence. an extensive body theory evolve characteristic optimum currency areas. the important feature price wage must able adjust flexibly. the mobility goods, labor capital ensure market integration. the european single currency foster strong economic integration mean foreign direct investment. in 1999, world fdi flows, (cid:3) 888 billion, three time high 1995. intra-eu fdi flow grow significantly fast period. in 1999, five time big 1995. in addition, intra-eu direct investment rise significantly since start emu. in year 2000, actually rise 50 percent. today, intra-eu fdi account one-quarter global fdi. the fdi statistic show clearly, first, economic integration eu intense, and, second, economic integration increase fast launch single currency. these observation bear trade statistics. about one-half external trade euro-area member state intra-euro-area trade. bi review 98/2001 5 viii it financial market benefit common european currency felt clearly. the implication euro obvious: rise liquidity, deepen widen money, bond stock markets, reduction transaction cost abolition currency risks. the euro speed financial market integration. correspondingly, function european monetary union depend heavily high degree financial market integration. it smooth function enable monetary transmission work. progress field tremendous, yet come. those part european financial market crucial transmission eurosystem’s monetary policy already integrate satisfaction. the wholesale market interbank liquidity euro area actually single european money market. in addition, european bank interconnect common payment-system infrastructure. and improvement euro-area-wide payment system undertaken. a day ago, bundesbank launch new payment system rtgsplus (real time gross settlement), improve security, reduce liquidity need expedite settlement gross payments. through system, 8,500 bank credit institutions, include branch world, accessible. the impressive progress, term integration, witness euro-area bond markets. yield difference among government bond different participant narrow five percentage point emu 30 basis point nowadays. the remain spread mainly due vary liquidity paper issued. currency risk divergent monetary policy long disturb euro-area-wide diversification. in term outstanding amounts, euro-denominated bond market still significantly small denominate u dollars. but term new issuance, market par. one reason sharp rise new issuance corporate bonds. here again, diversification within euro area increased. the issuers' nationality, determinant yield performance bonds, supersede factors, especially sectoral view. accordingly, investor equity market shift perspective country benchmark pan-european sector benchmarks. european equity market still small compare usa. the market capitalisation domestic shares, ratio gdp, reach 90 percent. the match figure usa japan 152 percent 68 percent, respectively. equity market euro area grow fast. the ratio new issuance market capitalisation average 4 percent. this twice much achieve usa japan. further integration equity market europe hamper segmentation stock exchange clear settlement systems. a consolidation process started, foster legal harmonization field financial services. the degree integration bank sector mixed. on one hand, wholesale market investment bank largely integrated. on hand, commercial credit retail bank still operate national, segment markets. however, european bank create cross-border merger slowly start offer retail service standardise level customer one country. the financial system euro area still highly bank-dominated. at end last year, credit finance total 108 percent gdp. this much japan, twice much usa. the picture similar deposits. in euro area, account 80 percent gdp, 110 percent japan, u figure 40 percent. however, capital market increase importance euro area. disintermediation gain ground. financial market boom recent year investment bank (as well non-bank financial firm like institutional investors, pension investment funds) enlarge market share. disintermediation enhance need pension system rely fund retirement schemes. since capital market integrate bank sector, disintermediation foster integration entire financial system europe. 6 bi review 98/2001 change bank sector prospect new basle accord applied. in general, welcome new accord help improve allocation capital. however, two special feature german economy considered: 1. the german economy largely dominate small medium-sized enterprises, know „mittelstand“. 2. our financial system rely large extent long-term financing. this long-termism finance contribute successfully stability prosperity economy, well financial system. that bundesbank argue bank regulation discriminate long-term financial relations. small medium-sized enterprise revenue (cid:4) 5 million make 95 percent enterprise germany. this „mittelstand“ form backbone german economy. however, share outside capital significantly high large firms. a low rat therefore expected, unless collateral risk-lowering factor take account. here again, favour differentiate approach put bank large exposure medium small size enterprise disadvantage. ix bank regulation supervision europe become ever-more integrated, keep development single market. the introduction common currency 1999 therefore additional factor contribute harmonization regulatory supervisory framework, accelerate integration financial systems. currently, system home-country supervision extensive cooperation among european regulator supervisors. this try test framework serve u well. especially bank sector, integration yet advance justify pan-european supervision. furthermore, tax systems, account standard also bank system vary degree warrant unify bank supervision. a financial integration advance further, however, situation may change future. if, future, truly european financial system, take step towards single supervisory structure. those step could probably start large, internationally operating, european banks. in germany, government recently draft bill new framework financial supervision. the future "federal authority financial service supervision" combine, one roof, supervision banks, insurance company financial institutions. the bundesbank’s role supervision bank enhance new law. this good thing, good practical reason participation central banks: (cid:1)(cid:2)central banks, provide cash liquidity, run payment systems, operate open market, good insight bank behavior solvency. therefore, economy scope arise provide both, central bank bank supervision. (cid:1)(cid:2)central bank responsibility financial system stability, prerequisite conduct monetary policy. (cid:1)(cid:2)central bank operate payment system potential source systemic risks. (cid:1)(cid:2)and, time crisis, central bank role mediators, well potential "lender-of-last-resort" function. if liquidity assistance provide illiquid, solvent, banks, national central bank would benefit "first-hand information", supervisors, sake maintain restore financial stability. hence, european framework envisage financial regulation supervision, must necessarily provide meaningful involvement escb. there is, however, single solution fit country environments. in japan, i learnt, adopt different approach. bi review 98/2001 7 x let u share think international role euro. three year life, euro second important currency world. it take role deutschmark. the euro share roughly 13 percent international currency reserve – much deutschmark before. in field, dollar unchallenged leader, two-thirds international reserves. the size, depth liquidity dollar markets, well widespread habit use dollar intervention price commodities, explain predominance. a regard use store value, find evidence grow importance euro. 30 percent international security outstanding denominate euro. this share slightly aggregate share predecessor currency shortly emu launched. that leaf euro second-most-important currency international security markets. again, dollar dominant currency, account one-half international security outstanding. the currency composition international bank asset present similar picture. again, dollar lead currency, share 40 percent, euro process catch up. from slightly le one-quarter end 1998, share rise 27 percent. what see figures? although habit international use currency change gradually, euro already respectable market share. it market share roughly equal economic weight euro area. further progress development broad, deep liquid financial market precondition expansion euro’s international role. increase international use euro, currency international reserve holdings, investment finance purposes, might bear monetary policy, potential impact seem manageable. hence, eurosystem, adopt neutral stance towards internationalisation euro. we regard market-driven process, neither hind foster it. xi the euro currently play role exchange-rate regime 55 countries. among euro-minded country eight twelve country will become member state european union. the motivation aim join european union prospect stability prosperity unify europe. soon iron curtain lift 1989, former communist states, centrally-planned economies, negotiate “europe agreements” european union. those partnership mean foster transition process towards, first, democracies, and, second, fully-fledged market economies. since then, lot attain term macroeconomic stability prosperity. two week ago, european commission issue annual progress report accession process. that report confirm prospect ten country join eu early 2004: (cid:1)(cid:2)the three baltic nations: estonia, latvia lithuania; (cid:1)(cid:2)five central eastern european countries: poland, hungary, czech republic, slovak republic slovenia; (cid:1)(cid:2)and two mediterranean island cyprus malta. the process accession organize three stages. we currently pre-accession stage. the next step accession eu, final stage might full participation european monetary union. accession european union conditional fulfillment so-called "copenhagen criteria". these comprise, first, "the stability institution guarantee democracy, rule law, human rights, respect for, protection of, minorities". this political criterion already meet negotiate countries. 8 bi review 98/2001 second, “the existence function market economy well capacity cope competitive pressure market force within eu”. all country envisage accession 2004 function market economies. the eu commission, recent report, also expect able cope competitive pressure market force within eu near term. and, third, "the ability accept obligation membership, include adherence aim political unification, well economic monetary union". the eu commission recognize substantial progress, candidate countries, towards adoption, implementation enforcement "acquis communautaire" – community’s legislation. the copenhagen criterion define common grind future eu. accession european monetary union conditional "a high degree sustainable convergence" (art. 121 treaty), specify maastricht criteria. they stipulate nominal convergence term inflation rates, sound public finances, long-term interest rate exchange-rate stability. candidate country join emu two year eu accession, earliest, spend least two year european exchange-rate mechanism erm ii. there still considerable discrepancy candidate country present eu member state macroeconomic structural data. accession twelve candidate country increase eu population roughly one-third. nominal gdp, however, rise five percent. the discrepancy today pronounce previous three round enlargement. the wealth gap current member state accession candidate large. per caput gdp (measured term purchasing-power parity) 44 percent eu average. furthermore, strike degree heterogeneity among candidate country themselves. per caput gdp measure eu average range 24 percent (bulgaria) 83 percent (cyprus). for convergence sustainable, must base advance economic financial integration. the integration candidate country eu run deep. the eu far important trade partner accession candidates. around two-thirds export destine 15 eu member states. in addition, two-thirds capital inflow accession candidate ninety originate european union. real structural convergence increase ongoing economic financial integration. lady gentlemen, eu enlargement fact challenge. a lot political work yet done. not candidate countries, also current eu, reshape institution able cope enlarge membership – probably 25 state two year time. xii lady gentlemen, a stable strong euro serve catalyst ongoing process european integration – among present member state accession candidate alike. euro banknote coin – put circulation le five week – soon become obvious symbol unify europe. political integration receive boost then, too. “the euro change europe world”. yes, does. and change better. a europe unite common currency imply world's second-largest economic entity stronghold stability. i sure stable currency strengthen foundation orderly world economy productive global competition. and, i sure, japan major player world economy benefit well. bi review 96/2001 1 jean-claude trichet: the euro - major structural reform european economy speech mr jean-claude trichet,

presence japan last two year ; likewise, japanese foreign direct investment euro area japanese portfolio investment euro since january 1999 highlight confidence european single currency. i would like explain euro monetary union successful outset, condition prospect build achievement. i discus historical event introduction banknote coin end year. i. the euro monetary union base credible monetary policy, contribute appropriate economic monetary equilibrium europe 1. the euro base credible, stability-oriented monetary policy a) i would like point that, technical point view, launch euro financial markets, 1 january 1999, indisputable success, eurosystem, make ecb national central bank euro area, fully achieve objective assign follow areas: – operational efficiency, highlight precise adjustment bank liquidity effective steer short-term interest rates; – security provide procedure system implemented, execution interbank transactions, vis-à-vis large-value payments. the inter-bank market become integrate early january 1999, right start monetary union, thank set target system real-time transfer large-value payment throughout euro area eu countries. – and, finally, smooth function eurosystem, integrate organisation decision-making centre work constant contact national central bank implementation operations. b) together many factors, technical operational success contribute high level credibility single monetary policy based, particular, independence european central bank national central banks, store confidence inherit latter. moreover, contrary popular belief, european monetary union start scratch. for le 12 year launch euro, six twelve currency make euro – represent almost two third euro-area gdp - prove remarkably stable, realign within erm. this high degree confidence also stem acknowledge efficiency operational set-up eurosystem, base principle decentralisation stipulate treaty. the eurosystem team. the european monetary team comprise ecb national central bank twelve member states, follow 2 bi review 96/2001 bank greece’s entry 1 january 2001. all member eurosystem work close co-operation. c) the credibility eurosystem lies, fundamentally, stability-oriented monetary policy strategy. the maastricht treaty give u mandate maintain price stability. we decide clear transparent possible provide clear definition price stability: say year-on-year increase overall harmonise index consumer price (hicp) euro area 2%. the aim single monetary policy ensure medium-term price stability, therefore create favourable monetary financial environment economic growth. price stability offer anchor wage negotiators, necessary factor competitiveness, turn essential achieve balance therefore sustainable economic growth. the euro area however complex financial economic zone. for reason, adopt broader-based approach, take account relevant data. we thus base monetary policy two “pillars”. in view monetary origin inflation medium term, assign key role monetary aggregate m3, constitute first “pillar” monetary policy strategy. this pillar base reference value set 4.5% annual growth rate broad monetary aggregate m3. this monetary indicator regard compatible medium-term price stability. last december, confirm 4.5% growth rate m3. the concept reference value imply commitment part eurosystem automatically correct deviation monetary growth short term. the reference value m3 consistent last price stability. naturally, also follow counterpart m3 closely, say source money creation, especially lend economy capital flow rest world. however, trend monetary aggregate sufficient assess risk price stability. this need exhaustive description prevail economic financial situation. the second pillar monetary policy strategy base broad range variable act lead indicator outlook euro area price developments. our monetary strategy ensure continuity monetary policy previously conduct national central banks, belong eurosystem. this strategy well receive financial market general public. in particular, relatively low yield long-term euro-denominated bond confirm eurosystem retain credibility store inherited. d) lastly, credibility euro also result eurosystem's constant effort term transparency communication. i must stress eurosystem one transparent central bank world. once month, immediately ecb govern council meeting, president ecb hold press conference start precise report assessment govern council, make available real time ecb website. the eurosystem first central bank world introduce, 1 january 1999, concept regular, frequent, real-time communication domain monetary policy. other major central bank since decide follow us. be accountable, independent institution modern democracy – or, case eurosystem, subtle constellation democracy like european union – mean accountable public opinion. in respect, public speech testimony president ecb attention european institution public opinion, well governor national central bank attention national institution public opinion, vital significance. indeed, crucial part collective duty consist tirelessly explain reason argument underpin decision govern council. in december 2000, eurosystem decide release, first time, euro area economic staff projections, view improve transparency communication. bi review 96/2001 3 thus, point view accountability central bank democratic society – say duty explain, justify, convince, whenever possible, take full responsibility vis-à-vis public opinion decision take –, eurosystem strive meet high standard main central bank world. 2. the euro significantly contribute growth europe enhance co-ordination economic policy a year ago, necessary convince great number sceptics, europe well rest world, euro would really launched. many observer believe single monetary policy would never succeed ! fact disprove conclusion. however, observer still sometimes evoke suppose fragility euro area stem suppose economic structural divergence euro area countries. how answer important question? firstly, monetary union necessarily imply that, give point time, participate country rate inflation growth, even though creation euro base successful completion convergence process. let u take inflation example. inflation divergence across country region quite natural monetary union. in euro area, long-term convergence common level price naturally give rise different inflation rate across countries. the convergence productivity live standard create trend towards price convergence. now, present differential euro area large, comparison sometimes observe unite states, long establish monetary union comparable size. my intimate conviction witness european integration and, medium term, increase correlation economic development area. several academic study show business cycle become synchronous across europe. secondly, question often raise whether emu success without form enhance political union. indeed, achieve this, correct mix require fiscal, economic monetary policies. in european union, member state responsible conduct economic fiscal policies. we therefore believe policy closely co-ordinated. co-ordination stress treaty itself, request member state treat national economic policy “as matter common concern” subject multilateral procedure. naturally, economic co-ordination way undermine independence ecb eurosystem. even importantly, euro area posse institutional mechanism conducive appropriate policy mix: stability growth pact includes, part member states, strict fiscal requirements. i cite three economic justification treaty provision give rise stability growth pact: – first, keep rein fiscal policy emu member states, pact ensure satisfactory policy mix within euro area. this essential monetary policy, order counterbalance fact europe federal government hence significant “federal” budget. mutual surveillance close co-ordination fiscal policy responsibility "eurogroup" ecofin council. keep deficit 3 % gdp, achieve budget "close balance surplus" medium term, ensure balance policy mix throughout euro area. – second, pact help prevent well-managed economy bear unjustified risk premium interest rates, result poor management emu economies, set penalty system excessive deficits. – and lastly, stability growth pact disprove assertion euro area automatic stabiliser event asymmetric shock member state. indeed, urge government aim fiscal position "close balance surplus" medium term, pact enable allow budget deficit increase period specific national difficulty without exceed 3% reference value. in short, enable country 4 bi review 96/2001 create fiscal buff period normal economic conditions. this buff draw counter economic divergence asymmetric shock economic downturns. but course, extent government let automatic stabiliser play strictly depend initial level fiscal balance; obviously country still fiscal deficit le room country budget close balance surplus. ii. the euro catalyst progress while many acknowledge introduction euro 1 january 1999 broadly successful, one may ask, juncture, condition full ongoing success euro medium long term. what encourage respect fact that, number areas, euro appear catalyst meet conditions. 1. the euro deepen complete single market a) the euro make completion single market possible. it enable productive sector company achieve significant economy scale, european save allocate efficient investments. it also enhance transparency market boost competition innovation benefit consumers. however, ultimate objective single market could fully achieve monetary barrier continue prevent free flow goods, service capital impose unpredictable erratic exchange rate movement transaction costs. the last step process euro cash changeover end year; enable company citizen enjoy benefit use monetary instrument throughout europe, like american today dollar throughout unite states. b) moreover, introduction euro bring significant change economic financial environment. the introduction euro strong catalyst merger acquisition euro area. the european m&a market 2000 one dynamic world operation total around one trillion euro. the single monetary policy encourage structural change financial sector, euro area money market longer-term capital markets. this give euro area investor great possibility improve finance investment conditions. – from begin january 1999, cross-border money market transaction increase sharply, reach almost two-thirds total activity money market segments. the unsecured deposit interbank market —which mainly concentrate short maturities— highly integrated. the integration interest rate market within euro area key achievement deserve underscored. eonia euribor provide market uniform benchmark fully accept market participants. this reflected, instance, amount daily transaction huge development euro interest-rate swap market. these structural change euro area money market prompt market participant concentrate euro cash management activity order take advantage high liquidity level secondary market. needle say, integration bring fruition segment money market, i.e. repo market short-term security market. further integration enhance efficiency euro area financial market beneficial borrower investors. – a regard stock market bond markets, major progress make term integration. accord recent statistics, euro, together dollar, appear major bond issuance currency first semester 2001, euro account close 40% total issuance. furthermore, european investor substantially diversify bond portfolio since introduction euro, prompt removal exchange rate risk. this enable achieve good performance give level portfolio risk. bi review 96/2001 5 additionally, i would like draw attention current trend merger close co-operation stock exchanges, security settlement systems, clear houses, similar institutions. have euro created, would thinkable paris, brussels amsterdam exchange merge create euronext recently conclude another major alliance ? undeniably, introduction euro foster large-scale market restructure throughout europe. there still barrier integration eu capital markets. in regard, eurosystem welcome objective european council meet lisbon march 2000, accelerate completion internal market financial services, set tight timetable financial service action plan may implement 2005 ; regular review plan make european authorities, progress well way. the eurosystem also support strategic conclusion committee chair a. lamfalussy integration european security markets, ratify european council meet stockholm march 2001: convince implementation broad guideline new cooperation structure european level help improve capital allocation europe foster development equity market line monetary policy requirements. 2. the euro incentive structural reform a) the euro, per se, also strong catalyst structural reform non-financial domain europe: single currency facilitate comparison prices, tax earnings. the euro could encourage "cross fertilisation" best practice increase co-ordination member states' structural policy area labour market, education training, job creation incentives, effective welfare safety nets, etc. for reason, european council, meet luxembourg december 1997, explicitly mention structural policy among item select reinforce co-ordination. the lisbon european council enhance medium-term strategy necessary structural reform union. the follow development step right direction: emphasis deepen single market, set indicator allow comparison best practice among member states, broad economic policy guideline examine structural issue closely. the recent european council meet stockholm march 2001 gothenburg june 2001 confirm guideline even add number important issue consequence age population european union, role biotechnology economic growth, environment. the european head state government, meet ghent couple week ago, call acceleration whole process. all european country must resolutely pursue reform already initiated. it must acknowledge much already done, particular implementation single market. however, continental europe still experience level unemployment high, despite fact unemployment rate decline significantly economy past three years. accord imf, oecd central banks, 75% unemployment structural nature, i.e. generate environment handicap job creation. there doubt emu stimulate structural reform labour market. with increase capital mobility smooth function single market, firm become increasingly sensitive general environment term competitiveness choose particular location euro area. the actual process select investment location within euro area major incentive undertake necessary reforms. b) besides structural reforms, strong emphasis must place competitiveness. pre-euro economic policy require careful monitor balance payment foreign exchange interest-rate markets. the authority receive constant feedback key indicator affect national economic performance could react accordingly. these indicator sensitive, multiple reactive. at present, advent single currency, economic manager must monitor relevant competitiveness indicator even great vigilance, economic policy error 6 bi review 96/2001 could slow insidious repercussions, rise unemployment weak growth. the rule market economy continue apply euro area countries. job create consumer – totally free purchase whatever wish – choose good service deem best value money. company – totally free investment choice – locate business accord relative competitiveness different possible sites. it therefore necessary monitor competitiveness even closely before, particular unit production costs, tax regulatory framework. the multilateral surveillance carry context eurogroup, help monitor competition trend euro area country zone whole and, necessary, suggest appropriate adjustments. iii. a smooth changeover euro also determine factor europeans’ confidence new currency of course, eurosystem heart euro cash changeover process. our challenge consist replace national monetary unit euro monetary financial relation public administrations, banks, enterprises, business citizens. the first contribution eurosystem euro banknote production. today, 12 billion banknote manufactured, total 14.9 billion. the launch stock almost ready. the manufacture process carefully monitored, accordance state art security standards. the new banknote combine many highly effective security feature already use national banknote euro area number additional feature specifically use euro. these security feature provide person handle cash, especially general public, mean carry rapid, easy, effective examination euro banknotes. special attention also give need blind partially sighted. the eurosystem also play key role supply process euro banknote withdraw process former national monetary units. at national level, central bank euro area work close co-operation credit institutions, security companies, shopkeeper police forces. this fruitful concertation essential success huge operation, field logistics security. the “non-cash” euro already use the final stage introduction euro include two changeovers: changeover non-cash euro, concern book-entry transaction (cheques, bank accounts, bank card payments, transfers, loans, etc.) changeover cash euro, concern banknote coins. this summer, bank france start systematically convert bank account euro provide customer euro cheque books. in various participate countries, particular france, bank account already convert . it citizen euro area establish new scale value currency make payment euro. in respect, retailer fundamental role play: active participation readiness accept payment euro greatly facilitate euro changeover whole. the cash euro circulation within 8 week a regard cash euro, main task consist frontloading banknote coin that, 1 january 2002, transaction carry smoothly best possible security conditions. to achieve this, frontloaded coin supply credit institutions. banknote soon provide (as 1 december france). retailer also provide frontloaded banknote coins. furthermore, order familiarise public facilitate give change 1 january 2002, individual able obtain, mid-december, pack euro coin know ‘euro starter kits’; coin cannot use payment 1st january 2002. a 1 january 2002, bank deliver euros, retailer give change euro atm supply euro banknote only. a day date, almost transaction carry euro. bi review 96/2001 7 beyond technical aspects, eurosystem –and also public authorities- important responsibility inform general public challenge ahead, deadline practical aspect euro cash changeover. the success global process depend heavily confidence general public cash handler well. prepare people well inform feel confident use euro banknote coin overall objective euro 2002 information campaign conduct eurosystem. this campaign aim reach general public mass media. it closely support europe-wide partnership programme 2 600 national international organisations. it enter intensive information phase, since unveil euro banknote security feature president, w. duisenberg, 30th august. a mr duisenberg stressed, event mere technical presentation, take historical symbolic dimension. on 1 january 2002, honour witness large currency changeover world ever experienced. this crown achievement long economic political process lead creation monetary union 1 january 1999. this unique event european history help ensure last prosperity, europe’s interest rest world well. lastly, speak front bankers, financial institutions, business executive journalists, i would like make follow remark regard present situation: -first, main message present exceptional circumstances, first quality institutions, economic leaders, enterprise well household keep one’s nerves. the best gift could give terrorist would change plans, cancel endeavours, delay decisions, reduce investment consumption. we, institutions, enterprises, individual project : let u realize them, time, unchanged. -second, let u beware fashion. it still fashionable, year ago, embark vibrant eloge new economy, predict end business cycle forecast ever high level productivity progress buoyant economic growth. to-day kind herd behaviour drive lot observer actor opposite direction: overwhelm pessimism regard present situation economic future. both attitude equally totally inappropriate. it central bank remain moderate judgments, pragmatic lucid various circumstance offer anchor monetary financial stability also stability judgment. -third, foster confidence major contribution eurosystem prosperity european economy. confidence precious ingredient present european conjuncture, recently emphasize european council ghent : confidence euro, price stability, ability highly reliable instrument savings, medium long term solidity. confidence consumer price stability underpin growth dynamic household consumption – today major motor economic growth. confidence saver underpin growth favourable financial environment. thank much attention. bi review 96/2001 1 laurence h meyer: before remark mr laurence h meyer, member board governor u federal reserve system, national association business economics, st. louis, missouri, 27 november 2001. * * * to promote macroeconomic stability, monetary policy must respond change economic conditions. on premise, i always start think monetary policy identify i like call outlook context. be inflation likely stable, rise fall? be economy lose momentum rapidly likely grow trend? the outlook context today must include state economy september 11 implication event september 11. at point, course, impossible fully disentangle contribution pre-september 11 momentum post-september 11 impact. moreover, neither contribution crystal clear--especially latter, early data. conceptually, however, assess economic prospect today require u blend two considerations. then i turn challenge policymakers face result complex force identify outlook context. here i address three questions: ha monetary policy le effective recently compare early period aggressive ease counter sharply slow growth onset recession? what implication face significant adverse shock already-low nominal federal fund rate? what appropriate relationship monetary fiscal policies, general today? let remind you, i proceed further, remark today reflect view outlook challenge face monetary policy. i speak federal open market committee board governors. challenge face feed immediately event september 11 before i turn outlook challenge face monetary policymakers, i want discus federal reserve's reaction disruption financial transaction increase demand liquidity bank lend result event september 11. when think september 11, always, first foremost, remember thousand whose life lose irreparably harmed--the personal tragedies. immediately attacks, many others work hard restore normal course business, essential avoid compound personal tragedy economic dislocations. do especially challenge involve financial service industry. the area new york city hit attack – include two world trade center tower – house many financial firm constitute important part infrastructure financial markets. the event day could disrupt market activity finance considerable time. instead, learn financial sector enormously resilient. in many cases, people need cubicle computer return work. in contrast, restart airplane factory auto factory production disrupt would take extremely long time. such resumption business financial firm depend careful plan advance, backup data, software, forth. to sure, security market transactions, particularly clear settlement government security markets, disrupt period. but financial market firm adapt responded, contribute quick resumption normal business. the fed, too, many challenge time. one vice chairman roger ferguson board member washington d.c. september 11. the chairman basel, i beijing, two governor elsewhere unite states. this diminish ability federal reserve system respond quickly effectively. the vice chairman, together reserve bank president staff member board reserve banks, superb job. we wear many hat day day immediately following. first, act provider liquidity. normal channel borrow payment disrupted. some bank count 2 bi review 96/2001 receive fund rely federal reserve instead. security firm business impede usual borrow turn banks, and, primary dealer firms, federal reserve open market operations, increase need extra federal reserve liquidity. the vice chairman issue brief statement immediately attack signal fed's readiness supply liquidity needed: "the federal reserve open discount window available meet liquidity needs." we use every exist vehicle inject liquidity even invent new one--the use large swap line foreign central bank inject dollar liquidity. discount window loan soar instantly around $200 million peak $45 billion september 12 later, market begin function better, federal reserve repurchase agreement soar $25 billion nearly $100 billion. second, use monetary policy counter sure sharp adverse shock demand bolster confidence feed would necessary support economy. a supervisors, sister bank agency ask bank work customer meet legitimate credit needs. we benefit diverse financial system – one strong bank system complement dynamic capital market. when one ailing, often – case – ready take slack. and bank system part admirably. we survey bank whether limit drawdowns pre-existing line credit. they inform u not. and seek understand exposure bank system industry immediately affected, airlines, insurance, travel, entertainment, lodging. we also focus operational responsibilities, ensure continuation vital payment services, include electronic transfer check clearing. finally, work market player resolve clearance settlement disruption result damage telephone physical infrastructure. we touch bank participant financial markets, touch bank security regulators, touch within federal reserve system. the feed bank financial supervisor receive much praise quick effective response. though please ability cope, recognize country face contingency one specifically planned. so, like many organizations, look lesson learn action taken. the outlook context of course, cop implication terrorist attack financial infrastructure part difficult job face recent weeks. assess condition economy appropriate course monetary policy remain central concern fed. the outlook today complicate mixture momentum force work september 11 new set force result event day. forecaster today often begin almost apologize even offer point forecast economic activity come year, give prevail uncertainties. but job do, include forecasters. forecaster offer u careful assessment force work plausible scenario may interact. policymakers begin best guess outlook guide policy response. the uncertainty face today reflect least three considerations. first, still struggle understand severity slowdown prospect recovery september 11. second, effect september 11 depend, major degree, psychological influence household businesses. i often asked, way, whether i believe economy drive psychology psychology drive economy. i always respond i believe economy drive psychology; that, i believe reverse, i would become psychologist. i return role psychology minute, even admit potentially important role shape near-term prospects. the third consideration unexpected event – additional terrorist incident home well war terrorism go abroad – may especially important shape outlook. bi review 96/2001 3 the state economy september 11 we need integrate two aspect state economy september 11 current outlook. first, perhaps obvious, momentum economy specifically close economy rebound. second, strength rebound ultimately depend importantly pace underlie productivity growth hence average rate growth possible economy reach full employment. momentum september 11. at least two school think economy's momentum exist september 11. some believe economic expansion would resume within quarter two, others foresee protract period weakness. though i view economic growth perhaps bottom slow near-zero rate second third quarters, i expect growth build slowly therefore expect pace recovery first half 2002 disappointing. to understand sharpness slowdown still grip economy time, begin period exceptional performance second half 1990s. many interpret experience suggest old rule long apply and, result, discount long-standing regularity resource utilization rate inflation worry le limit sustainable growth. i incline view. to sure, high productivity growth likely considerable period. but initial adjustment acceleration productivity also bring temporary bonus likely persist long run. they take form temporary spurt demand growth – push unemployment rate progressively low – temporary disinflationary impetus, prevent increase utilization rate immediately raise inflation. the persistent above-trend growth progressive increase utilization rate suggest danger overheat high inflation. this concern encourage series tighten move attempt slow economic growth least toward new high trend thereby prevent still high utilization rates. in view, period below-trend growth likely require unwind i view unsustainably high rate resource utilization. a result coincidence forces, economy slow much steeply feed expect intended. besides effect monetary policy, sizable rise energy price 1999 2000 early 2001 contribute erosion aggregate demand. but important shock hit economy late 2000 early 2001 – reassessment profitability produce own high-tech equipment. this shock manifest financial market real economy. it result sharp correction equity price technology sector – burst technology bubble – and, time, lead sharp retrenchment demand production high-tech equipment. the economy slow point real gdp nearly flat second quarter year likely would nearly flat third quarter, even without event september 11. the pre-september 11 prospect recovery reflect cumulative ease fed, sizable fiscal stimulus already train, decline energy prices, normal internal dynamic contribute recoveries. i return prospect recovery moment. long-term growth prospects. the strength rebound expect september 11 also shape underlie pace productivity growth. recent revision national income product account data, well sharpness retrenchment high-tech investment, force reassessment prospect longer-term productivity growth. the revision suggest that, performance still impressive, le exceptional appear revisions. in particular, revision low rate productivity growth 1998 2000 and, result, trim estimate sustainable rate economic growth go forward. before annual nipa revision early year, many revise forecast underlie productivity growth progressively upward near 3 percent even slightly higher, compare 1-1/2 percent rate achieve twenty-five year mid-1990s. the revision suggest underlie structural productivity growth peak close 2-1/2 percent – still remarkable improvement pre-1995 average quite spectacular many thought. in addition, early productivity growth, reflect frenzied pace investment 4 bi review 96/2001 high-tech equipment, appear unsustainable.1 consensus estimate longer-term productivity growth revise downward range 2 percent 2-1/2 percent. the effect september 11 in think effect september 11 events, i find focus three subperiods useful. the first subperiod include third fourth quarter perhaps first quarter next year. the second remainder typical monetary policy forecast period, case 2003. and third long run, beyond 2003. the near-term effects. the near-term effect dominate disruption certain industry – airlines, particular, also travel-related industry hotels, entertainment, tourism – psychological effect household businesses. policymakers little timeframe affect outcome, bolster consumer business confidence say. we variety measure consumer sentiment. in normal times, measures, view, offer relatively little predictive power household spending. that economy usually drive psychology mostly way around. a result, predict consumer confidence variable use predict household spending. measure consumer confidence relatively little incremental value explain consumer spend periods. during gulf war, however, learned, already know, extraordinary time consumer confidence change abruptly way foreshadow incoming economic indicators. another way say sometimes equation use predict consumer confidence make dramatic forecast errors. such error may indicate "exogenous" psychological shock thus provide additional information forecasters. in aftermath september 11, widely expect consumer sentiment would plummet data would provide information severity psychological shock help forecast project cutback consumer spending. even data available, many forecaster calibrate impact consumer spend term gulf war experience. the two lead measure consumer confidence render something split decision september 11. the university michigan measure slide september, decline occur september 11 broadly consistent deterioration show incoming economic data. this measure remain fairly stable since then. the conference board measure, hand, decline sharply october, sharp drop conference board measure bring close alignment cumulative decline michigan index. so, surprisingly, point, whether september 11 significantly affect consumer confidence unclear. at least, effect small many expected. we good measure business sentiment, generally reasonable mark business spend plan anticipation negative psychological effect households. in current case, business apparently make especially grim assessment near-term strength economy order nondefense capital good plunged, result cutback investment downward revision forecast near term. on balance, magnitude decline consumer business spend result event september 11 unclear. it seems, view, material effect business spend and, perhaps, somewhat small effect consumer spending. of course, time high uncertainty, signal typically mixed. so today. we sign quite remarkable resilience. for example, stock market plummet immediately september 11, already return pre-september 11 level. the exchange value dollar, measure currency broad range trade partners, remain 1 many forecaster period begin measure underlie "structural" productivity growth term path components: multi-factor productivity growth contribution productivity growth capital deepening. multi-factor productivity increase productivity directly relate growth non-labor physical inputs, specifically capital. capital deepen increase productivity result increase amount capital relative labor. the multi-factor productivity component adjust remove cyclical influences. the capital-deepening component, hand, reflect year-to-year pace investment hence increment capital stock. the frenzy high-tech investment, particularly 1999 early 2000, result unsustainable pace capital deepening. a result structural productivity growth period high would sustainable high-tech investment return normal pace. bi review 96/2001 5 remarkably stable, despite presumption september 11 shock would disproportionately affect unite state relative trade partners. auto sale soar record level october, prompted, sure, zero-interest rate financing. they likely fall back incentive reduced, but, case, surge signal household still will make large long-term commitment despite uncertainty risk recession. moreover, non-auto retail sale recover some--though all, sure--of grind seem lose immediate aftermath september 11. the rest short-run forecast. the consensus forecast today generally describe v-shaped, start september 11. this description refer pattern outright decline output couple quarters, follow quick move above-trend growth. the force recovery include unusually aggressive macroeconomic policy response, include year's ease monetary policy date stimulus associate series fiscal policy actions--including already implement still consideration. until recently, i would say "under consideration expected," recent development force reassessment certainty stimulus package. i return fiscal policy story moment. but stimulative policy far factor contribute rebound. recovery also reflect powerful internal dynamics. for example, amplitude decline output recession often determine major degree severity inventory liquidation. once firm reduce stock desire levels, quickly raise production avoid decline stocks. do help kick-start recoveries. all natural force expect contribute recovery event september 11, perhaps delayed, likely become part recovery 2002. aside rebound inventory investment, include end retrenchment way high-tech investment. just return flat investment spending, sharp decline recent quarters, give economy important boost. such rebound likely reinforce dissipation gloom result rebound consumer confidence. together factor suggest potential return solid rate growth next year. forecasters, time this, like remind audience make conditional forecasts. that is, forecast base certain assumptions. of course, forecaster hold accountable judgment assumptions, well forecast give assumptions. but, case, typical assumption terrorist attack one-time event follow disruptive destructive events. of course, anthrax mail-attacks another form terrorism may already incremental effect consumer business psychology behavior. they divert additional resource provision security rather production final output. until last weeks, event could materially affect economy seem likely "bad" event damp near-term confidence spending. but more-rapid-than-expected progress war afghanistan remind u possibility upside surprise well. in case, must recognize heighten uncertainty forecast associate unusual degree "event risk." longer-term considerations. the possible effect september 11 productivity growth major issue long term. three set force could low longer-term productivity growth. the first reallocation resource toward security away production good services. the purchase increase security firm show add expense produce goods. that is, business cost increase without result high measure output. cost associate security definitely rise noticeably. in addition, firm may diversify location workers, increase security expense high production costs. financial firms, well firm sectors, may build redundancy ensure continue operation event future terrorist attacks. firm may also add large buff form inventory mitigate supply disruption might follow terrorist attacks, retreat somewhat just-in-time inventory management. many productivity shocks, view, probably level productivity growth rate productivity. of course, adjustment level occur protract period, may feel like shock growth productivity. with technological innovation, example, high level productivity likely emerge gradually, innovation disseminate economy. in addition, technological advance may really one-time event may base continue series innovations. in case, innovation likely result high growth number years. the effect high business cost associate security (we hope) one-time decline level productivity. i expect level effect complete 6 bi review 96/2001 within year two, give immediacy need. the result case is, therefore, transitory effect growth rate potential output year two, follow return rate productivity growth would prevail absence high cost security. the second set force could low long-term productivity growth relate federal budget. the increase spend defense homeland security unlikely, view, offset fully cut government spend program high taxes. a result, budget surplus likely low long run otherwise. to extent are, national save lower, real interest rate higher, private capital formation lower. a consequence, level productivity low otherwise, growth effect spread considerable period. give link national save productivity dimension expect effect, i expect result decline productivity crowding-out effect would small, perhaps 1/10 percentage point year while. third, wide variety indirect behavioral response possible. for example, firm general may somewhat averse risk le will make long-term commitments. household may want large cushion accumulate wealth, perhaps increase save rate time. they may also reallocate wealth toward safe more-liquid assets. these developments, balance, would take toll longer-term productivity growth. nevertheless, view, large enough alter conclusion pace innovation information technology industry raise underlie productivity growth rate fast prevail twenty-five year prior mid-1990s. still, productivity story exceptionally complex. on one hand, take comfort underlie productivity growth continue pace achieve early 1970s mid 1990s. on hand, economy suffer consequence recent decline underlie productivity growth--a decline high rate underlie productivity growth enjoy late 1990s early 2000. challenge face monetary policy monetary fiscal policymakers face many challenge circumstances. i focus challenge face monetary policymakers. one calibrate monetary policy appropriately light fiscal policy. be monetary policy le effective previously? monetary policy september 11 ease 300 basis points, aggressive ease comparable period almost twenty years. however, many see effect ease disappointingly small. a result, question often ask today--indeed, almost always ask economy midst recession pronounce slowdown--is whether monetary policy le effective today use be. one explanation normal lag response spend monetary policy actions. we would not, example, expect much effect second quarter modest effect second half, base past experience forecast models. but factors, too, contribute perception monetary policy le effective. these include fact shock weigh economy large magnitude spread time and, partly result, forecaster general continually revise forecast economic activity. many surprised, particular, sharpness persistence retrenchment high-tech investment degree economic activity abroad slow along unite states. perhaps important consideration evolution overall financial condition monetary policy eased. monetary policy work effect decline federal fund rate spending. indeed, direct effect all. monetary policy work so-called transmission mechanism, channel include short-term private interest rates, longer-term private interest rates, equity prices, exchange rate. the effect rate asset price depend change target fund rate relative expectation already embed financial market change expectation result policy actions, statement accompany actions, developments. other thing equal, decline fund rate low short- long-term private interest rates, raise equity prices, bi review 96/2001 7 depreciate dollar. the combine effect quite powerful. in current episode, however, thing equal, dollar depreciate stock market appreciated. of course, monetary policy presumably ease much dollar depreciate stock market risen. at rate, painfully little pass-through fund rate operative channels, decline private short-term interest rates. the absence pass-through reflect change fundamental effectiveness monetary policy much offset effect financial shock occur time feed easing. one way quantify degree pass-through compute financial condition index combine effect transmission channel single number. goldman sachs macroeconomic adviser develop differ methodology compute index. basically, weight change various financial condition relative importance determinant private spending. the message index financial condition improve since feed begin ease and, indeed, may even deteriorated. the response overall financial condition monetary policy ease episode unusual, unique. in previous recession periods, financial condition generally improve feed eased, reflect pass-through low short- long-term private rates, high equity prices, low exchange rate. the major reason failure financial condition improve case one major shocks--the reassessment profitability own produce high-tech equipment--was, time, shock financial market aggregate demand. the financial shock revaluation equity value result reassessment--the burst equity bubble technology sector. in addition, dollar appreciate rather depreciated, reason one seem fully understand. so two key channel transmission monetary policy behave differently expected. whether long-term interest rate fall much would expect historical regularity difficult assess. one reason part decline long-term rate occur feed begin ease, anticipation easing. in addition, limit effect long-term government rate may partly reflect offset upward pressure change long-term budget implication recent prospective fiscal policy measures. these include large tax cut pass early year, effect spend fiscal measure already pass response event september 11, effect spend increase tax cut consideration. the fiscal policy effect appear contribute expectation robust recovery relatively quick aggressive reversal monetary policy. this presumption see federal fund future market, extract forecast expect fund rate next year half. the market expect fund rate begin rebound mid-2002 rise significantly follow year. finally, rise risk spread boost longer-term private rates, especially below-investment-grade securities. on balance, number factor combine restrain economy, despite sizable cumulative decline federal fund rate. i would conclude, however, monetary policy general le effective structural change may occurred. but i believe financial shock occur –including shock equity price dollar – require monetary policy move aggressively otherwise would case. the implication initial low federal fund rate: hold powder respond especially aggressively adverse shocks? on september 11, federal fund rate already low – 3-1/2 percent. since time, fund rate reduce another 1-1/2 percentage points. indeed, september 11, le room maneuver previous post world war ii recessions. doe mean feed "keep powder dry," argued, hold back ease case downturn turn serious case additional adverse shocks? i believe strategy would misguide – indeed reverse would appropriate. give initial low level nominal federal fund rate, face risk that, arguably worst-case scenario, rate could drive zero, practical limit nominal interest rate. this course situation lately confront bank japan refer problem zero nominal bound. in view, appropriate policy response, confront potential limit, respond especially aggressively adverse demand shock, effect, substitute speed move cumulative size easing. the danger wait 8 bi review 96/2001 inflation might drift lower, limit ability drive real federal fund rate negative territory, might necessary support timely recovery. in bad case, japan today, inflation might turn deflation, limit ability low real policy rate even zero. the implication start unusually low interest rate therefore go slowly aggressively respond adverse shock. i view consideration relevant september 11 even immediately after. but consideration favor last 50-basis point move. at least, line reason powerful counter-argument "keep powder dry" strategy. monetary fiscal policy the last policy issue i want address relation interaction monetary fiscal policies. begin reagan administration, division labor evolve policies. fiscal policy become le focus short-run stabilization focus longer-run considerations, promote growth reduction marginal tax rate (the reagan approach) reduction structural budget deficit (the clinton approach). this leave short-run stabilization part hand fed. many argue focus fit comparative advantage monetary fiscal policies. it widely believe monetary policy effect long-term growth rate real gdp, aside benefit arise achieve maintain price stability. in particular, begin position price stability, accommodative monetary policy cannot raise economy's long-term rate growth. monetary policy, hand, often view comparative advantage short-run stabilization. that advantage base ability monetary policymakers change policy flash, compare difficult often contentious process legislate change tax spending, subject always threat presidential veto. this characterization is, i think, quite fair. it describe difference milton friedman call inside lag two policies--the lag shock action response shock. the inside lag unquestionably short monetary policy. but friedman also note outside lag – lag policy response effect aggregate demand spending. here lag monetary policy probably long fiscal policy action – example, spend implement quickly, like extension unemployment insurance, tax changes, include tax rebate surcharges, change withhold rates, temporary investment incentives, depend specific design. indeed, friedman argue long variable lag monetary policy, due outside lags, make monetary policy unlikely instrument short-run stabilization. of course, fiscal policy action gradual effect well – perhaps gradual monetary policy actions. these slowing-acting policy include change capital gain tax rates, supply-side response change marginal tax rates, many program spend build gradually time. monetary fiscal stimulus complement shock large adverse interest rate already low. however, put together appropriately stimulative fiscal package always easy. the political debate result delay implement fiscal stimulus follow event september 11 –even side seem agree prompt fiscal response appropriate – remind u fiscal policy generally agile flexible instrument short-run stabilization. one recur problem virtually every fiscal change effect distribution government benefit tax across taxpayer different incomes. every time try implement stabilization package, therefore get republican democratic option reflect philosophical differences. from reagan clinton, widely accept good fiscal policy mean permanent change positive supply-side effects. to sure, republican democrat always differ implement supply-side fiscal policy. but need temporary demand-side stimulus, differ even more. the first principle design temporary demand stimulus is, virtually definition, avoid permanent change appropriate need demand stimulus. permanent change mean effect out-year budgets--in case low surpluses, hence low national saving, high real interest rates, low private investment low growth productivity output. this problem future. bond market become aggressive build expectation rise short-term rate time today's long-term interest rates. high long-term bi review 96/2001 9 rate today response long-term effect permanent fiscal policy change would offset part intend stimulus. the second principle temporary demand-side fiscal program implement policy large "bang buck." even agreement two principles, design temporary demand-stimulus package challenge. in general, temporary policy effect difficult predict permanent changes. and temporary policy change typically leave hole side therefore create problem road. still, balance, package well-crafted, temporary, quick-acting demand-side fiscal measure would, view, make constructive contribution support strengthen rebound expect next year. the current debate congress fiscal stimulus create challenge forecaster monetary policymakers alike. monetary policymakers condition policy forecast, forecast must include assumption fiscal policy. in cases, especially fiscal policy player stabilization policy, dependence monetary policy fiscal policy serious issue. but today, forecast 2002 quite sensitive whether stimulus package implement specific package. i, one, assume congress would reach timely agreement implement package temporary measure characterize relatively high bang buck. while i doubt outcome, i change forecast yet. conclusion the economy contract third quarter appear contract current quarter. fortunately, considerable amount stimulus already train combination monetary policy ease fiscal policy measure already enacted. the congress may still pas additional fiscal stimulus year-end. in addition, internal dynamic support recovery may soon come play. in case, economy gradually strengthen next year. for moment, risk continue side, front-loaded response monetary policy already make important contribution counter adverse shock and, addition, provide insurance downside risks. once economy show sign move rate growth trend, feed reassess appropriate degree stimulus and, point, begin return neutral policy. bi review 95/2001 1 birgir ísleifur gunnarsson: monetary policy, economic growth prosperity open address mr birgir ísleifur gunnarsson, chairman board governor central bank iceland, conference mark 60th anniversary university iceland faculty economics business administration, reykjavik, 31 october 2001. * * * i would like congratulate university iceland’s faculty economics business administration 60th anniversary, noteworthy activity contribution towards strengthen icelandic economy. i also wish faculty every success future. at time i thank honour i show invitation deliver open address anniversary conference. i choose call talk “monetary policy, economic growth prosperity.” i shall therefore focus role play monetary policy economic policy implementation, contribution towards economic growth prosperity. and ample reason well, notable event economic organisation year involve precisely monetary policy framework central bank. price stability important change make central bank legislation around world recent years. there gradual increase support view natural set central bank straightforward target suit instrument use, strengthen independence take action financial independence time make firm requirement transparency accountability towards government general public. treasury access central bank fund closed. simple target-setting central bank largely involve assign single main objective monetary policy, i.e. promote price stability, mean low level measure inflation. in countries, central bank assign task define main objectives, elsewhere do governments, cooperation government central bank. these viewpoint reflect central bank legislation many country maastricht treaty’s provision establishment activity european central bank. another widespread central bank objective recent year contribute stability financial system, include payment systems. many central bank devote increasingly scope topic, reflect need identify follow deregulation international capital movements. at global level, much high profile give active monitor financial activity maintain active overview various risk factor financial system economy whole, order attempt prevent serious shocks. persistent inflation result lax monetary stance there good reason assign central bank single main objective, namely promote price stability. inflation primarily monetary phenomenon. short-lived inflation many causes, persistent inflation consequence lax monetary stance. in long run, monetary policy therefore primarily effect prices. under normal condition temporary impact economic growth employment. since central bank broadly speak one instrument, i.e. interest rates, therefore achieve single long-term macroeconomic goal, natural set price stability ultimate monetary goal. this say price stability important goal than, say, full employment, simply monetary policy instrument inherently good suit impact prices. it pointless set objective monetary policy cannot achieve. through price stability, forward-orientated monetary policy contribute towards create stable economic environment long-term growth potential economy, namely growth prosperity, based. the reason central bank widespread effect interest rate formation market interest rate decision exclusive right issue money economy, i.e. base money. by control price base money, i.e. interest term 2 bi review 95/2001 financial institution borrow short-term capital them, central bank influence volume price liquidity financial system. central bank interest rate decision impact short- long-term interest rates, financial system liquidity, money circulation bank lending, exchange rate currencies, asset price and, last least, market participants’ expectation future development factors. all this, turn, influence consumption investment decision individual businesses, thereby aggregate demand. the impact individual area vary greatly one time next. the new central bank act the previous central bank act date 1986 draft period 1981 1984. it product time reflect perspective late establish themselves. in early 1990s minister commerce appoint committee review central bank act, chair professor ágúst einarsson, current dean faculty economics business administration. follow committee’s work minister commerce propose bill parliament new central bank act entail sweep change 1986 act, include consider many necessary element central bank legislation. however, bill adopt parliament. in may year parliament pass new central bank act approval 56 member present vote bill. a detail account main change early legislation give central bank’s publications. see i.a. central bank iceland’s monetary bulletin 2001/3 i shall mention single target set central bank, i.e. promote price stability. with prime minister’s approval, bank also authorise specify numerical inflationary target. the bank grant full independence apply instrument order achieve main objective. it financial independence increase preclude law treasury access short-term fund central bank, previously preclude agreement minister finance bank. provision transparency accountability towards government general public make focused. a i mention before, one central bank’s main objective contribute towards active secure financial system, financial stability often known. in recent year central bank many country increasingly devote monitor financial stability. this development partly product financial market liberalisation deregulation capital movements, partly response shock strike many countries, currency shock bank system setbacks. example include trouble encounter bank finland, norway sweden decade ago crisis hit asia latin america latter part 1990s. the central bank iceland build new organisational department, financial stability department, main role monitor factor affect financial stability. twice year bank publish article topic quarterly monetary bulletin, annual main study may short account november. in addition, central bank financial supervisory authority maintain close productive cooperation, seek ensure security icelandic financial system respective way. inflation target to return monetary policy itself, recall joint declaration inflation target change monetary policy issue march 27 government central bank iceland. see central bank iceland’s monetary bulletin 2001/2 with declaration, monetary framework change inflation target adopted, whereby fix exchange rate fluctuation limit replace float exchange rate. the inflation target set 2½%, measure twelve-month rise cpi. the declaration state inflation deviate 1½% target bank oblige bring back within tolerance limit soon possible. at time bank would oblige submit report government, would make public, state reason deviation, plan response length time expect take bring inflation back within range. since inflation somewhat target declaration made, upper tolerance limit set 6% 2001 4½% 2002. despite abolition exchange rate fluctuation range, central bank reserve right intervene interbank market foreign exchange buy sell currency deem necessary order contribute towards attain inflation target, view bi review 95/2001 3 exchange rate swing threat financial stability. in effect, new policy ratify new central bank act. the inflation target policy make great professional demand upon central bank. although introduce fairly short notice, bank prepare conceivable change monetary framework time beforehand. an important aspect new policy bank’s commitment produce publish inflation forecast four time year, project least two year ahead. the bank already considerable experience inflation forecast study show le capable field central bank follow comparable policies. this success achieve ambitious professional theoretical work one bank’s main focuses. we become aware central bank follow kind policy note comment carefully iceland prepare introduction inflation targeting. it aim strengthen central bank’s research theoretical work still further, worth point new legislation specifically state undertake economic research relate tasks. inflation target establish inflation target policy establish recent years, correspondingly large reduction number country apply policy base fix adjustable exchange rates, exchange rate within fluctuation range. the reason least prove increasingly difficult adhere fix exchange rate policy world deregulate capital movements. it could say prevail opinion identify two possible exchange rate options: float exchange rate completely fix one, example membership currency union, unilateral adoption currency establishment currency board. the new policy produce good result apply country include sweden, norway, uk, australia new zealand, along several country eastern europe, latin america, asia africa. it also argue european central bank partly follow kind policy. from clear central bank iceland undertake major responsibility ensure price stability, sense use joint declaration government central bank mean twelve-month rise cpi 2½%. it central bank’s role ensure specific rate growth level employment, since instrument incapable impact long run. however, acknowledge ensure price stability create vital precondition economic growth prosperity. inflation increase substantially year june pass outside tolerance limit define march declaration. accord central bank’s inflation forecast publish early august, outlook inflation would rapidly decelerate towards end year begin next, would move inside tolerance limit middle next year, 2½% target would reach mid-2003. the forecast base main assumption unchanged exchange rate forecast day, cool economy wage rise excess agreement already negotiated. the central bank publish next inflation forecast november 8. tight monetary stance the central bank apply tight monetary stance time now, reflect high policy interest rate. the policy rate rate interest apply central bank’s repo transaction credit institutions, i.e. interest liquid fund borrow bank. monetary policy subject lively debate recent week month bank steady pressure cut interest rates. a central bank repeatedly underlined, viewpoint low interest rate entail great risk wait tangible sign assumption behind august inflation forecast hold good. it crucial bring inflation swiftly, since go without say inflation bad enemy household businesses. a tight monetary stance inevitably consequence sometimes painful household businesses. there nothing do that. household business alike must accept consequence action obvious many simply go excess consumption, investment borrow recent years. they need reduce spending, cut cost put finance order. that cannot avoided. 4 bi review 95/2001 i also point current account deficit large. even though shrink rapidly year foreseeably continue decrease substantially next year, still large historical international context. in order achieve acceptable macroeconomic balance, contraction national income unavoidable. low inflation improve macroeconomic balance also create climate nominal exchange rate króna begin appreciate. furthermore, i underline interest rate definitely effect iceland countries, research study indicate beyond doubt impact monetary policy iceland similar elsewhere. however, people need understand exactly monetary policy capable of, not. transparency finally, i shall turn issue le important i already mentioned. great central bank independence recent year accompany much stringent requirement transparency accountability towards government general public. this mean central bank operate openly possible. they must give clear account policy assessment economic monetary situation outlook, explain detail assumption underlie monetary decisions. all serf purpose inform government public fully possible monetary policy, provide basis understand and, depend circumstances, make independent evaluation it. one way central bank fulfil function publication quarterly monetary bulletin. indeed, new legislation state central bank shall, le frequent quarterly intervals, publish report monetary policy monetary, exchange rate foreign exchange development measure areas. the central bank shall also issue annual report explain detail activities. in annual report, bank outline various aspect operation publish detail itemise account operate expenses, detailed, i believe, institution iceland. to cite example importance transparency days, autumn 1999 international monetary fund publish guideline transparency monetary policy firmly urge member country adopt. the central bank iceland definitely say fulfil rules. by provide detail description policy assessment economic monetary situation outlook, bank also contribute professional inform public debate issues. by token, great responsibility impose commentators, since le scope claim lack information. the central bank wholeheartedly welcome professional public debate bank policies, take part dialogue see grind so. lively, professional dialogue produce even great understand character objective monetary policy. i hope see student teacher faculty economics business administration become involve issue future. there always scope new opinion debate current affairs. the debate recent week partly reflect fact people still absorb major change make monetary policy framework year. a wide range cooperation take place central bank university iceland recent years. the central bank support research project area activity, publish find journals. a importance monetary policy become increasingly recognise economic policy implementation, vital university’s faculty economics business administration give high profile monetary economics, theoretical practical. monetary policy transmit numerous market vital people engage analytical business side firm ground field. similarly, important dialogue monetary policy conduct far possible firm professional basis. the central bank eager cooperate closely faculty body strengthen university level teach monetary economics central banking. lady gentlemen: in talk i describe change make iceland’s monetary policy implementation new attitude monetary policy much world. the main task central bank promote price stability, recognise make best contribution economic growth prosperity. under new monetary framework, central bank iceland bi review 95/2001 5 provide mechanism central bank industrialise country create environment. the central bank take role seriously strive fulfil condition lay new legislation joint declaration issue government march 27. the global economic climate dramatically transform recent year still change wake terrorist attack usa september 11. it quite obvious iceland carry much weight global

september special luncheon address dr zeti akhtar aziz, governor bank negara malaysia, cfo summit 2001 - the economic outlook aftermath 11 september, kuala lumpur, 8 november 2001. * * * lady gentlemen, introduction even event 11 september global economy already experience slowdown growth. although emerge sign downturn begin level off, event september 11, increase uncertainty prospect. the issue u today thus extent development affect growth prospects? to extent mitigate adverse implication domestic sector. and all, u current environment good weather economic slowdown? it pleasure today opportunity share think implication development malaysian economy. current global economic environment after decade rapid expansion, u economy enter period cyclical slowdown begin mid-2000, gdp growth u slow sharply 8.3% first quarter 2000 le half percent second quarter 2001. give u absorb one-fifth world exports, slowdown far reach implication world growth. the sharp anticipate u slowdown 11 september due mainly adjustment technology sector lead cyclical decline business investment unwind inventory accumulate boom period. however, consumer spending, account two-thirds gdp unite state activity house sector generally still hold prior 11 september. this trend support interest rate reduction 300 basis point january august 2001 tax rebates. in addition, adjustment asset price see relatively moderate. while event 11 september affect business consumer confidence, need distinguish immediate term effect longer-term prospect recovery growth. on industry-specific basis, impact visibly see tourism travel-related industry insurance sector. in immediate term, expect activity dampen scale back expenditure activity take place. the unemployment rate also see rise recently release national association purchase manager (napm) index, short-term lead indicator u economy, show significant decline. nevertheless, preliminary estimate u third quarter gdp show decline somewhat le expected. this allow cautious optimism. the u automobile industry also record large ever monthly sale october consumer respond promotion auto companies, indicate event 11 september entirely curb consumers’ propensity spend. furthermore, concern sharp weaken u dollar recede result relative stability major exchange rates. amidst developments, however also simultaneous slowdown major industrial economy result downward revision growth europe japan. while report hardly comforting, important keep assessment perspective. the current external environment reflect reaction immediate aftermath attacks. of importance consumer would behave come months. the answer question is, large part, still remain uncertain. much depend household industrialise economy ass near-term job income prospects, assessment evolve time event global environment continue unfold. 2 bi review 94/2001 the final outcome would depend analysis plethora economic data us, also policy emerge us, europe also regional economies. of course, main factor would consumer investor response policy changes. in u particular, feed ease monetary policy immediately follow 11 september, bring interest rate low level since 1960s. the u congress approve series fiscal packages, bring total fiscal spend 15% gdp. the prompt coordinate monetary policy response across globe demonstrate commitment support global growth avoid tailspin reaction could lead recession. in light, economic weakness could expect near term, positive consumer response policy change would point positive medium-term prospects. give emerge indicators, preponderance view current economic slowdown would prolonged, recovery expect occur second half 2002. other positive factor relate sharp inventory adjustment take place allow upturn demand promptly translate high production activities. at time, structural change corporate level include world wide cost-cutting measure would provide foundation sustain recovery global growth. lady gentlemen, weather slowdown be highly open economy, malaysia continue affect external developments. while may able directly reduce impact development external sector compensate encourage domestic activity. on domestic front, malaysia year build strong foundation place u position weather current slowdown. the event 11 september alter positive economic fundamental foundations. this continue provide business platform sustain activity. firstly, structural adjustment undertake recent decade recent measure take since crisis result diversify productive economic base resilient external shocks. the recent strong performance service sector positive growth agriculture mine sector first half year contribute mitigate extent decline electronics exports. for service sector domestic content high several service sub-sectors link manufacture sector. these sector continue respond positively domestic policies. even within manufacture sector, domestic-oriented industry contribute one-third total output sector. these sector benefit fiscal stimulus package low interest rate environment. second, government’s fiscal position remain strong, outstanding debt contain 37% gdp debt service gdp ratio 2.8%. the increase fiscal deficit finance non-inflationary sources. expenditure allocation also target project immediate high spin-off effects. third, inflationary pressure contained, thus allow monetary policy remain accommodative. our track record low stable inflation also encourage capital formation high save rate. fourth, current account surplus continue remain large thereby lend strength balance payments. the current account balance payment expect register surplus 7.9% gnp 2001. the decline export offset correspond reduction import well payment services. this surplus expect continue serve buff finance volatility short-term flows. fifth, external reserve continue rise trend ample unencumbered. the external reserve level breach end-2000 level. the figure 31 october show reserve level us$30.2 billion. this reserve position adequate finance 4.9 month retain import 6.3 time short-term external debt. sixth, external debt level low, reduce vulnerability current slowdown external demand. total external debt equal 49.5% gnp end-june, significantly low peak 64% record end-1997. the overall debt service ratio also low 5%, even slow export growth. in addition, short-term debt component low, account 11% total bi review 94/2001 3 external debt 18% external reserve holdings, give malaysia one favourable position among regional economies. seventh, malaysian bank sector strengthen resilient follow recent restructure consolidation achieved. this reflect high capitalisation ratios, improve profitability asset quality. the strong rwcr 12.5% (end-september) core capital ratio 10.6% provide adequate cushion absorb increase npls economic slowdown. the late stress test indicate rwcr bank system expect remain well bi minimum 8% view strong capitalisation bank institutions. also domestic private debt gdp decline peak 152% 1998 current level 133% mid-2001. eighth, see increase retrenchment labour market, unemployment level remain low. of importance educate labour force mobility adapt change environment. effort focus upgrade quality education system. while labour dislocation expected, effort direct encourage redeployment alternate activities. ninth, physical infrastructure one best develop asian region, facilitate production, trade communication. tenth, political stability institutional arrangement place allow rapid, effective coordinate decision make deal ongoing developments. it allow prompt response strategic plan manage management economy. accelerate corporate restructure involve large corporation country also underway increase attention focus enhance corporate governance. despite difficult external environment, solid foundation remain intact continue provide malaysia ability ride current phase slowdown ensure long-term growth prospects. more specifically, provide u agility adapt, adjust respond change economic conditions, change comparative advantage change opportunity current environment accords. the track record show decade economy able shift new area growth change opportunity change comparative advantage. prudent policy pursue careful economic management also accord u high degree flexibility policy option respond new challenge emerged. our resilience account combination strong foundations, high degree agility flexibility policy respond difficult period thereby enhance ability weather current slowdown. lady gentlemen, of importance therefore look beyond immediate term. our history show economic downturn 1985, 1998 current period externally driven. a highly open economy continue vulnerable external developments. in period adverse external conditions, domestic policy response however, successful restore growth. the strategy adopt pre-emptive front load policy initiatives. in addition, effort generally support effort strengthen economic base restructure reform financial system. despite severity 1998 contraction, malaysia recover within year strengthen economic fundamentals. all possible give strong foundation economy financial system. all often take granted. in current period, focus policy promote domestic source growth. it far allow u mitigate extent adverse effect slowdown export-oriented manufacture sector. in first half-year, saw positive growth record agriculture mine sectors, construction sector well domestic-market orient manufacture industries. go forward, pro-growth policy target improve consumer disposable income, increase expenditure skill enhancement improve infrastructure. the impact policy together low interest rate would continue filter domestic economy. should global demand strengthen, malaysia well position see strengthen second half next year. the government therefore direct policy measure strengthen domestic source growth. the expect impact u economic slowdown already build fiscal stimulus package contain 2001 budget 2002 budget. project identify fiscal 4 bi review 94/2001 stimulus include high spill-over effects, low import content short gestation period. hence, high allocation give social services, education, training, low cost house health services. in early 2001, amidst sign slowdown u economy severe early expectations, measure take march 2001. the measure include additional fiscal stimulus rm3 billion reduction employees’ share epf contribution 2% one year aim promote consumer spend overall economic activity. follow heighten uncertainty event 11 september, additional stimulus package amount rm4.3 billion announce prior budget 2002. this early announcement aim provide enough lead time high expenditure sustain growth. the focus allocation also also skew towards small project fund would promptly disbursed. most recently, budget 2002 present parliament october reinforce strategy diversify economic structure increase significance domestic source growth. the budget include measure promote economic activity increase domestic demand strengthen private sector’s resilience competitiveness. in addition, high development expenditure, focus budget 2002 direct raise disposable income via tax cut bonus direct measure stimulate private consumption. other fiscal measure allowance also aim provide incentive businesses. the question often raise concern sustainability fiscal deficit potential long-term risk economy. previous prudent policy accord government flexibility expansionary policy. the deficit finance non-inflationary source high rate domestic save enable access finance without crowd private sector. prudent policy also keep debt level low. debt levels, particular external debt position remain low. this continue important strength malaysian economy. secondly, excess liquidity domestic money market strong demand government security mean new issue raise low interest cost. the debt service would therefore burden future generations. thirdly, expenditure well-targeted high potential achieve desire objectives. and finally, plan consolidation nation’s fiscal position reduce deficit year 2002 balance position envisage period eight malaysia plan. on monetary front, strategy front load monetary measure provide positive environment private sector. during recent period, already historically low lend rate effective stimulate domestic demand term rise loan residential property, passenger car consumer durables investment manufacture service sector. interest rate raise growth 1999 growth exceptionally strong 2000. monetary policy period continue direct support domestic activity environment low inflation. follow increase uncertainty event 11 september, 3-month intervention rate reduce 50 basis point 5% 20 september support domestic economic activity light heighten potential rapid economic slowdown. currently, lend rate malaysia among low region. in addition, specific measure also undertake increase volume access finance smes. all measure contribute positive growth bank lending. while address short-term developments, policy also continue focus long-term area strengthen foundation financial sector. with successful completion consolidation bank sector, become necessary address remain overhang corporate leverage. in context, series aggressive measure take expedite process resolve outstanding corporate debt large corporations. important change implement management implementation corporate sector restructuring. similarly, implementation new rule regard corporate governance also ensure improvement standard practice corporate sector. the malaysian code corporate governance implement various change effect security commission act 1993 klse list requirement strengthen regulatory statutory framework corporate governance. bi review 94/2001 5 these development economy financial market serve ultimate goal create economy responsive change resilient external shock thereby increase prospect long-term growth. conclusion lady gentlemen, malaysia track record ensure economic environment supportive business activities. policy implement demonstrate commitment preserve value domestic foreign investment malaysia. while foundation provide u agility adjust, flexibility policy respond resilience weather current slowdown, recognise need continue strengthen economic structure need continue determine perseverance enable u effectively manage external shock without weaken economic foundation. while may provide assurance, mean ensure desire results. the reaction response business consumer vital success policies. this require ability balance approach distinguish longer-term economic prospect bias short-term concern immediate term conditions. within context domestic conditions, business must also aware global development competitive external environment. in regard, need strive increase efficiency productivity enhance competitiveness. despite current weak conditions, business hold back make strategic investment ensure well-positioned benefit upturn occurs. any hindrance progress eliminate new business segment growth seek out. research development expenditure continue important true sustainable source competitive advantage global economy. an integral part strategy need enhance train upgrade human resources. bankers, meantime, overreact weak short-term environment, continue provide access finance viable project support growth process. a constructive approach need take financial institution assist borrowers, initiative, reschedule restructure loan viable borrowers. finally, consumer spend productively contribute sustain domestic demand. to conclude, government act swiftly global slowdown recent event us. the government do part. it therefore private sector response key determine element malaysia weather current challenge environment. bi review 94/2001 1 joseph yam: develop position hong kong’s bond market speech mr joseph yam, chief executive hong kong monetary authority, forum china’s government security market new century, hong kong, 19 november 2001. * * * introduction it great pleasure today share hong kong’s experience development bond market view future prospect market. before i go subject, however, i would like congratulate friend mainland superb effort lead china’s accession world trade organisation. the sign necessary document week ago mark successful conclusion 15 year sheer hard work determination, begin new era mainland embrace globalisation earnest, long-term benefit china, region world. i doubt hong kong, particular, benefit tremendously this. the international business community position itself, hong kong free open economy doorstep mainland integral part china take advantage many opportunity open year come. a international financial centre china, hong kong particularly look forward opportunity arise much quick pace financial liberalisation mainland accession wto. put simply, notwithstanding gloom global recession, future hong kong bright. bond market development let turn quickly bond market development. there point i would like make immediately. the first point basic obvious one, obvious often overlooked. this bond market channel financial intermediation purpose mobilise save productive investment promote economic growth development. there need involve bond market responsible development make profit live frequently remind basic purpose. this particularly consider introduction sophisticate product derivative like. i nothing sophisticate financial engineering, engineer well remunerated, provide regulator market participants, wholesale retail levels, capable appreciate cop associate risks. this may often case. it possible that, product theoretically make market efficient, term spread manage risks, practice risk may magnified, extent create systemic instability disrupt crucial flow fund basic important channel financial intermediation. the second, rather obvious, point bond market one three broad channel financial intermediation, along good developed, least region, bank equity markets. le obvious, perhaps, importance ensure bond market command degree robustness efficiency capable channel suddenly enlarge flow save investment may divert one two channel result crisis there. these channel reinforce order financial intermediation therefore economic growth continue time financial stress. we witness u bond market help substitute bank intermediation credit crunch late eighties. we also witness u bank system turn play back-up role bond market fail intermediate fund result ltcm crisis, thus minimise disruption economic growth. in contrast, le develop bond market region fail provide necessary backup bank number jurisdiction face difficulties. fund simply dry debilitate economic financial consequences. bond market development region thus urgent task. this task is, however, hind third point, three channel financial intermediation competition other. this extent development bond market, least region, may inhibit rather efficient bank equity markets. understandably, vest interest may exert degree influence effect, one reason bond market, underdeveloped, may 2 bi review 94/2001 consider public good justify involvement official sector development. this indeed case hong kong, come long period agonise whether deliberate government involvement, free economy world without continue need government borrow finance budget deficits, appropriate. perhaps great institutional integration provision financial services, lack enthusiastic support development bond market service provider alternative channel financial intermediation time transform co-operation even initiative, thus obviate need government involvement. in meantime, however, regard degree financial sophistication economy region, official sector involvement bond market development seem justified. this might form facilitate development market infrastructure, iron administrative obstacles, help education, etc, rather direct obvious form subsidy. fourth, bond market financial intermediation need narrowly confine domestic phenomenon. it take international dimension. through facilitate inward investment foreign savings, source fund much need domestic investment tremendously enlarged. this would also enhance overall efficiency international allocation funds, economy provide high return commensurate risk involved. an economy capital control therefore plan eventual internationalisation bond market, even though associate financial liberalisation process quite risky one. but risk manage avoided, benefit open market far outweigh cost term financial instability. i confirm this, even unpleasant experience financial turmoil 1998. free open market impose valuable discipline policy maker welcome long-term interest people serve. fifth, turn actual bond market development issues, need adopt comprehensive approach. we address demand supply sides, environment interact discover price debt instruments, include market make arrangement determination benchmarks, market infrastructure, include payment, clear settlement systems. focus issue individually, sixth point, usually strong latent demand debt instruments, particularly economy high save rate. between low risk-return bank deposit high risk-return equity market, risk-return profile fit debt instruments. the trick latent demand, involuntarily trap two end spectrum, bring satisfied. investor education creation retail network market debt help. but cost latter quite substantial possibly prohibitive, particularly low interest environment, retail bank system cannot rely upon support wholeheartedly (which i glad add case hong kong). furthermore, government debt use bank system asset acquire liquidity support, demand bank may easily crowd retail demand. nevertheless, institutionalisation savings, could organised, example introduction professionally manage provident fund schemes, quite effective harness demand. this would, time, enable retail demand transform level sophistication that, appropriate supply response, greatly enhance efficiency robustness debt market channel financial intermediation. the seventh point i wish make concern supply side. for economy continue need finance budget deficit course natural supply debt instruments, unless, like hong kong, surplus spend. but story end there. it essential supply government debt organise way enable demand different nature met. this require well structured, transparent predictable programme, wide maturity spectrum. thus, eighth point concern interaction demand supply discover price reliably efficiently. this relevant primary secondary markets, best achieve respectively well-structured tender market make arrangements. these may involve last resort support regulators. there many successful model arrangement ample literature them. the common objective ensure high level liquidity facilitate reliable efficient price discovery, thereby provide benchmark yield curve upon issuer confidently accurately price own, hopefully much big volume of, private sector debt. that aim development bond market play meaningful role financial intermediation. bi review 94/2001 3 my ninth point concern market infrastructure, i mean payment, clear settlement systems. this regrettably neglect aspect development financial markets, bond market. imagine general investor confidence would damage financial instrument investor buy get lose delivery. or wait considerable amount time receive pay money, money pay receive vendor. i often point government spend huge amount money effort build physical infrastructure move people good around safely efficiently, even small fraction resource give move money financial instrument around safely efficiently. the result, simply, inefficient financial intermediation. money mobilise full potential, economic progress undermined. the financial infrastructure want, use bite market jargon, one enables, soon possible dealing, rtgs dvp, namely, real time gross settlement delivery versus payment transaction financial instrument (rtgs pvp payment versus payment foreign exchange transactions). this achieve hong kong. hong kong’s bond market let turn development hong kong’s bond market share experience. a i say earlier, agonise long period, behind convenient argument need market develop develop without urge government, decide get involved. the exchange fund bill note programme subsequently introduce begin 1990. but primary justification deploy need money market instrument, target bank customers, facilitate monetary management rather development bond market. nevertheless, adopt comprehensive approach task. we put together innovative market make system virtually guarantee liquidity allow handful market maker go short issue paper long overall holdings, suitable haircuts, long. this replace even robust arrangement whereby short position particular issue square end day overnight repos issues. we also build paperless clearing, settlement custodian system operate central moneymarkets unit (cmu), also provide similar service large volume private sector debt. and, time introduce real time gross settlement payment system end 1996, move dvp, delivery versus payment, real time end day capabilities. meanwhile, supply debt steadily increasing. corporate bond issuance increase 300 per cent last decade so. we also increase variety products, include mortgage-backed security retail product bring market hong kong mortgage corporation. all readily absorb latent demand i also refer earlier. and recent introduction mandatory provident fund schemes, demand bond build quickly. in 1991, bond market size 4 per cent gdp. this grow 35 per cent last year, share private sector debt around 77 per cent. we come long way still lot room expansion, evidence comparison bond market g-3 economies. but bond market grow big enough robust enough provide meaningful back-up time financial stress. in 1998-99 when, property price fell sharply financial turmoil lead deteriorate asset quality, bank adopt conservative stance lending, corporate bond issuance increase significantly. position future our present pre-occupation development hong kong bond market bring international dimension. a international financial centre, course aspire play role international financial intermediation. to achieve this, effort concentrate two fronts. first establishment bilateral linkage appropriate element financial infrastructure jurisdiction wherever compatible so, whenever counterpart willing. this basically purpose facilitate cross border investment debt securities. our cmu link euroclear clearstream 1994, central security depository australia 1997, new zealand 1998 korea 1999. we also stand offer region link hong kong dollar rtgs payment system currency rtgs capability achieve payment versus payment foreign exchange transactions, words, eliminate herstatt risk. but i must confess that, former, 4 bi review 94/2001 lot traffic, latter, takers, far. i hope merely reflection fact financial infrastructure others yet ready type linkages. but i really cannot see robust arrangement propose promote facilitate international financial intermediation find lack region. but shall patient. the front work replication hong kong dollar financial infrastructure u dollar, popular currency international financial intermediation. we late last year complete debt clear system rtgs payment system. we link correspond system hong kong dollar financial infrastructure. i won’t bore technical details. what mean have, time zone, robust financial infrastructure u dollar transaction accommodate, among things, u dollar bond market region. you wait new york open achieve finality settlement u dollar transaction bond or, indeed, u dollar denominate financial assets, lodge cmu hong kong. furthermore, asian currency rtgs payment system, link system, able achieve pvp payment versus payment two currency real time. we already pvp hong kong dollar versus u dollar transaction first world. i have, probably aware, drift position hong kong bond market meet future challenges. we have, effort development financial infrastructure, put position play ideal host bond market region, time zone. i hope member financial community leverage position strength bring issuer investor u dollar bond hong kong. further development bond market largely hands. a central bank officials, hong kong monetary authority do appropriately do, provision public good robust financial infrastructure. we can, course, replicate financial infrastructure currencies, indeed currently explore possibility major international currency domicile time zone euro. and appropriate, also transfer technology others advisory services. i am, particular, think rmb financial infrastructure, opinion require urgent strengthening, facilitate development rmb bond market, also facilitate many measure financial liberalisation follow wto accession. meanwhile, u dollar financial infrastructure hong kong, couple market make arrangement well try decade, critical mass financial institutions, ideal launch u dollar bond programme mainland. i understand, course, foreign reserve well exceed us$ 200 billion, arguably little need mainland raise additional foreign debt. but part outstanding foreign debt could refinance hong kong programme. perhaps liquid market reliable benchmark yield curve established, similar exchange fund paper hong kong dollars, overall borrow cost could lowered. this seem worth trying, downside risk minimal benefit could substantial, mainland term potential save borrow road show costs, hong kong, term consolidate position regional bond centre. and ready play part development rmb bond market mainland, accordance timetable associate wto accession, starting, slowly, establishment joint venture underwrite trading, development rmb bond fund on. but hope that, fullness time, mainland authority come around accommodate full access rmb bond market hong kong. i sure demand rmb asset hong kong, demand already. i know matter, issue concern financial intermediation rmb outside mainland, raise complicate issue capital account control need resolve cautiously. but i would like reiterate view that, increase economic integration hong kong southern part mainland, some, possibly increase degree of, mobility capital two economy inevitable. the choice whether channel properly flow capital openly and, consider desirable, control manner, monitor it, leave dark, ironically perform useful role promote efficient use capital two economies. there great deal free open financial market hong kong offer rmb financial intermediation, i delight that, important point china’s economic financial development, one theme conference effected. i wish fruitful discussion rest forum. thank you. bi review 93/2001 1 klaus liebscher: economic monetary union (emu) - important pillar stability international financial system speech mr klaus liebscher, governor oesterreichische nationalbank, symposium “the role international institution globalisation”, centre study international institution csi, innsbruck, 16 november 2001. * * * it great pleasure i accept invitation take part symposium “the role international institution globalisation” deliver think economic monetary union role international financial system. but first i would like congratulate dean prof. chen prof. socher faculty initiative set “centre study international institutions”. i strongly hope new centre contribute good understand function well need international institution like imf, worldbank, bi others safeguard economic development world liberalisation globalisation. i really wish success need for! it always duty monetary authority secure monetary financial stability. yet, issue monetary financial stability move prominently agenda, due growth financial services, volume depth, financial crisis recent year terror attack september, 11. with globalisation capital flow vulnerability country financial crisis increased. international institutions, especially imf, recent year play important role crisis prevention crisis management. the crisis asia region direct attention towards phenomenon financial contagion side politician well academics. through global network financial market crisis one part world may quickly spread via chain reaction places, potential destabilise global financial system. these crisis transform international agenda: at global level plan new international financial architecture abound future role institution like imf world bank widely intensively debated. prominent economist like paul krugman, joseph stiglitz, stan fischer, barry eichengreen and, course meltzer commission formulate quite diverse controversial proposals. in context i focus deliberation role emu euro provide stability international financial system. emu represent new opportunity challenge financial institution markets. up now, one distinguish essentially four type stability effect euro's arrival brought: exchange rate stability, price stability, financial stability fiscal stability. to four, let add fifth stability aspect give emu euro provide provide anchor stability central eastern european accession countries. exchange rate stability first, exchange rate stability directly relate single market good services, well development financial market european union. the single currency completely remove exchange rate risk exporter importers, debtor creditor across 12 country euro area. cross-border trade, investment financial transaction foster and, particular, small medium-sized company encourage enter euro area-wide markets. these development increase competition, improve resource allocation investment climate thus contribute high long-term potential growth euro area. this - i may say - internal "exchange rate" stability aspect often overshadow disproportionate interest u dollar/euro exchange rate. the dollar/euro exchange rate movement have, fact, fully line dollar's historical fluctuation vis-à-vis european currency prior introduction euro. more importantly, weight fluctuate part exchange rate "baskets" is, member states, much small past. 2 bi review 93/2001 for example, austria small open economy external stability currency prime concern. with introduction euro change significantly external trade much le important euro area austria. other austria prior introduction euro follow policy tie currency dem, eurosystem exchange rate target. while austria’s stability orient currency policy make sense small open economy, would wise try maintain fix exchange rate international currency era globalisation financial market full liberalisation capital transfers. the euro area economy far le open economy individual euro area countries. this tend limit impact external economic development particular exchange rate external price domestic euro area prices. thus, exchange rate channel monetary policy transmission le important large, relatively close currency area, like euro area, small open economies. however, statistic show, euro area still open unite states. in 2000, export good service represent 19,1 %, whereas import represent 18,7 % euro area’s gdp. this unite state ratio 10,7 % export 14,4 % imports. in environment, stability orient credible economic policy contribute sustainable economically viable exchange rates. of course, exchange rate development cannot ignore – second pillar monetary policy strategy eurosystem also contain information foreign exchange markets. long-lasting identifiable deviation estimate “equilibrium” exchange rate negative consequence economy massive misallocation resources. but far, regrettably, clear consensus economic literature calculate equilibrium exchange rates. give general observation still move within framework happen past 30 years, importance external exchange rate stability somewhat overstated. it also emphasise tragic event september, 11 inject turbulence currency market euro/dollar exchange rate continue trade around previous level. hence, even though may soon make firm statement existence euro well action take eurosystem conjunction federal reserve system likely stabilise markets. price stability second, price stability, analyst agree monetary policy decision ecb govern council appropriate. since begin emu, euro-area achieve low inflation expectation thereof thus interest rate low. the govern council make decision basis primary goal, price stability. it worthwhile restate mandate eurosystem. the primary objective eurosystem, treaty european union define it, maintain price stability euro area. the govern council ecb define price stability "year-on-year increase hicp euro area 2%". furthermore, make clear outset price stability maintain medium term. by unambiguously assign primary objective price stability independent central bank, treaty recognise focus monetary policy maintenance price stability euro area ensure monetary policy make best possible contribution improve economic prospects. this view root fact, support practical experience empirical evidence, benefit price stability growth substantial. without put forward arguments, maintenance price stability help allocate resource efficiently across us across time. inflation cause economic agent confuse transitory permanent price changes, therefore distort decision-making process. in evaluate investment opportunities, firm need confidence signal convey relative price changes, discriminate relative price adjustment general change overall price level. this process facilitate situation overall price stability. price stability therefore improve transparency relative price mechanism promote adequate environment increase growth potential euro area economy. moreover, experience shown, stable price minimise inflation risk premium, thereby low long-term interest rate help stimulate investment growth. bi review 93/2001 3 in order maintain price stability, eurosystem design monetary policy strategy wherein risk price stability assess basis two pillars. the first pillar assign prominent role monetary developments. the second pillar broadly base assessment wide range economic financial indicators. this all-encompassing systematic approach guarantee govern council ecb take consideration relevant piece information assess outlook price stability medium term. the eurosystem´s two-pillar monetary policy strategy particularly choose cater period transition uncertainty. the two-pillar strategy allow u - indeed compel u - follow closely systematically wide range monetary, economic financial indicator may give indication future inflation economic development large. it easily accommodate advisable shift relative weight attach various variables. what more, two-pillar strategy pretend existence certainty stable economic relationship reality things. in sense, honest strategy. to transparent public, though, require special communication effort eurosystem. by means, two-pillar strategy firm conviction clearly superior – particularly present juncture considerable model uncertainty – mechanical rule-based approaches. the latter usually taylored specific view economy operate therefore le likely perform well period view might adapted. monetary policy rule usually derive policy recommendation narrow set economic indicator only. in many case rest heavily output gap equilibrium real interest rate, which, i point out, potentially unreliable concept present juncture. financial stability third, financial stability euro area enhance single currency; late development provide indisputable proof this. generally, implementation monetary policy euro area prove highly efficient. the eurosystem successfully introduce market-oriented, modern flexible operational framework. the money market clearly benefit refinance operations. short-term interest rate totally converge money market within euro area become fully integrated. a result, efficient liquid euro money market, bank benefit conformity market conditions. the euro money market widely use daily reference index interest rates, notably eonia overnight transaction euribor transaction long maturities. these euro area index swiftly accept market form common basis pricing. market participant able manage day-to-day fund efficient manner, incur relatively low costs. the rapid integration euro area's money market also support development payment system infrastructure, establishment target system operate escb, link national real-time gross-settlement system ecb's payment mechanism. the smooth function settlement cross-border payment allow bank trade safely throughout euro area. therefore money market gain clear cross-border orientation, large bank start act "money center" banks, base euro area-wide scope activity. the broaden market increase share cross-border transaction positive impact provision liquidity: the wide euro area money market absorb liquidity shortage easily before, bank borrow readily foreign institution vice versa. when terrorist attack unite state trigger threat short-term function global financial market beginning, mere existence single currency consequent integration deepen euro area financial market contribute financial stability europe. in addition, day follow attacks, eurosystem able react quickly efficiently succeed stabilise market create confidence functioning. the eurosystem’s decision immediately provide extra liquidity euro, co-operation u federal reserve system euro area national central banks, dollars, contribute rapid return normal euro area well international markets. 4 bi review 93/2001 the euro area island global development affect euro area economy course. hence, one requirement globalise world frequent exchange information view among policy-makers. the eurosystem currently participate meet international organisations, international monetary fund (imf), organisation economic co-operation development (oecd) bank international settlement (bis), different fora, g7 g10. these exchange important good understand economic development fully analyse spill-over effect economy arise different policies. in long term context, launch single currency establishment strong monetary policy player global scene contribute effort enhance co-operation regulation supervision financial market institutions, well oversight payment settlement systems, european global level. fiscal stability the fourth stability-related aspect euro area discipline fiscal policies. the macroeconomic policy pursue euro area present are, whole, conducive price stability, fiscal prudence structural change time 1970s, 1980s early 1990s. the convergence criterion third stage economic monetary union already important ensure stable environment. they also set kind standard beyond euro area, eu member state yet adopt euro, also 12 candidate country actively negotiate membership european union. in addition, institutional set-up different permanent procedure within european union aim promote stability-oriented policies. the multilateral surveillance stability growth pact important tool here. the fact development member states' public finance continuously scrutinise detail ecofin council imply peer pressure share responsibility. increase competition together share responsibility also strengthen incentive improve efficiency viability public sector, labour market pension system structures. at present, major imbalance euro area would require long-term adjustment. economic policy euro area whole remain gear towards price stability, objective stability growth pact, wage moderation structural reform. further positive effect economic growth stem impact tax reduction several member country fact finance condition favourable. thus, natural economic slowdown adverse effect member states’ budgets, important especially country budget position still close balance surplus and/or high public debt-to-gdp ratio adhere medium-term consolidation plans. the current slowdown substantially change scope reach medium-term commitment make stability growth pact context stability programmes. a medium-term perspective continuous consolidation essential conduct fiscal policy euro area countries. this would give firm signal investor consumers, thereby support confidence contribute recovery. while may perceive difficult advance area environment weak economic activity, need properly address rigidity much obvious time buoyant growth. the current weakness therefore take challenge meet step reform rather allow effort abate. stability anchor finally, let turn fifth stability aspect. emu euro anchor stability central eastern european country (ceecs), among several applicant eu accession. a detail analysis show euro become particularly important unit account international good service trade ceecs. moreover, euro likely play ever large role central eastern european forex markets. the true euro investment issue currency private user ceecs and, long term, price good stock exchange. bi review 93/2001 5 even today, euro key currency central eastern europe. in ceecs' monetary policy strategies, exchange rate play vital role and, wherever formal informal intermediate target, least key monetary policy indicator. in nearly case euro upon ceecs' currency oriented, formally linked. european integration truly successful reach whole europe. it concept stability orientation urge u complete european unification. if manage enlargement process successfully, also conducive endeavor guarantee stability whole euro area. such mutual improvement desirable broad sense: political stability, financial market stability, macroeconomic – particular interest eurosystem – price stability. there doubt enlargement encourage stability, growth employment wide europe. there consensus accession country reap substantial growth employment benefit membership european union. still, let also add word caution context: it may take quite new entrant position fully harvest benefits. a fair share realism call avoid disappointment. the country central eastern europe make successful impressive progress way eu membership. yet remain done. sustainable monetary, fiscal structural policy reform prime importance context, help establish require real convergence european union – precondition smooth accession eu. these reform comprise, example, sustainable low rate inflation, sound public finances, stable currencies, flexible labor market efficient financial markets. finally, central eastern european country involve accession negotiation confront basic question economic monetary union feature overall context enlargement. a far judge today, see economic monetary policy integration candidate country proceed three steps: in first step, candidate accede european union, participate erm ii, exchange rate mechanism union, last step, introduce euro national currency. let point clearly fulfillment maastricht convergence criterion prerequisite membership european union. but, course, mean convergence criterion wholly unimportant accession country today. while may represent criterion judge country's readiness europe, may signpost stability-oriented policies, course must devise line particular situation country in. to fulfill convergence criterion necessary condition participation emu. future candidate country emu must, current member done, fulfill convergence criterion treaty, also less. from overall perspective, i clearly welcome european union's plan enlargement, enlargement help extend zone stability europe, strengthen europe's international competitive position thus contribute substantially prosperity, security peace long term. september 11th implication monetary policy international co-operation in well-known address american economic association 1968, milton friedman1 state that: “the first important lesson history teach u monetary policy do...is monetary policy prevent money major source economic disturbance. the great contraction might occur all, had, would far le severe, monetary authority avoid mistakes.” the terror attack new york washington september 11th immediate repercussion across world, particular financial markets. in deal immediate impact, eurosystem act close co-operation federal reserve own. the world’s lead central bank take prompt action alleviate ensue liquidity crunch provide market liquidity subsequently cut interest rate prevent market crashes. they thus act mature player successfully forestall crisis inject confidence batter markets. 1 milton friedman (1968), „the role monetary policy“, american economic review, vol. 58, no.1. 6 bi review 93/2001 be general lesson draw experience? will concert policy action among central bank frequent future? it may sound confuse joint action restrict truly exceptional circumstance extreme events. in addition, concert action must consistent principle sound monetary policy. even exceptional circumstances, euro area’s monetary policy must always remain clearly focus mandate eurosystem primary objective maintain price stability domestic economy. what may differ circumstances, however, time profile appropriate policy action best serve objective degree co-operation among central bank come common understand situation case emergency. without doubt, central bank make important contribution limit international economic consequence extreme event like september terrorist attack may entail. however, apart immediate task central bank term ensure continue function market payment systems, main contribution central bank remain always been: maintenance price stability. confidence maintenance price stability foundation effective function market economy. foster trust confidence last price stability become le important wake extreme event presence unusual uncertainty. this remain best contribution monetary policy make secure solid basis growth “domestic” well international stability. ask monetary policy serve purposes, risk create illusion monetary policy do. a aptly put governor bank england, sir eddie george, recent speech: "it important limitation monetary policy - can't hope achieve - clearly understood. otherwise expectation likely disappointed, disappoint expectation may lead build pressure alternative policy actions, may event longer-term economic interest." this view monetary policy - important cannot - basically share major central banks. base "common understanding", central bank thus likely come similar conclusion appropriate course policy give respective mandate prevail condition respective economies. concert action come conflict mandate monetary policy strategy pursue participate central banks. otherwise co-operation could lead increase uncertainty future course policy compromise longer-term stability. this lesson also seem stem historical experience. on whole, since end bretton wood effort policy co-ordination confine address specific unusual circumstance severe currency misalignments. conclusion in conclude sum remarks, i strongly believe best contribution large economy like euro area make international financial system ensure macroeconomic stability "at home" pursue policy lead sustainable non-inflationary growth euro area. give size economy euro area, stability-oriented policy help create favourable environment conductive non-inflationary growth global level. bi review 92/2001 1 willem f duisenberg: the introduction euro, region accession process speech dr willem f duisenberg, president european central bank, plenary session european union committee regions, brussels, 14 november 2001. * * * lady gentlemen, it pleasure today address plenary session committee regions. like many event still young life euro institution, european central bank, fact premiere. in recognition composition committee specific expertise, i like focus remark two key issues, – i believe – could particular relevance regional local authorities. first, i like explore issue receive great deal academic medium attention, could consider particularly relevant perspective regional local authorities: persistence regional economic difference relation single monetary policy – speak – one size fit all. second, allow address challenge connect forthcoming enlargement european union eventual entry new member state euro area. but so, let emphasise introduction euro banknote coin – moment – important challenge ecb national central bank (ncbs) euro area. the euro banknote currently produce 15 different print work throughout europe, include number ncbs. by end october 2001 13 billion banknote produce – is, significantly 10 billion expect enter circulation begin next year. the print work currently produce logistical stock purpose changeover. in order ensure smooth introduction euro banknote coin efficient withdrawal national banknote coins, logistics 2002 cash changeover determine well advance. within general framework changeover scenario national responsibility, accordance principle subsidiarity decentralisation. the eurosystem well aware importance achieve smooth cash changeover order maintain public financial market confidence single currency. one main concern express cash changeover need retailer hold large amount cash first day 2002. in order address concern, substantial number measure implement national level. while successful cash changeover immediate concern – thus naturally centre current public medium attention, – also bear mind longer-term challenge involve make economic monetary union euro last success. in context, relationship single monetary policy presence regional economic difference euro area probably particular relevance and, view, also topic common interest institutions. the treaty establish european community unambiguously lay override objective single monetary policy maintain price stability euro area. this reflect notion best contribution monetary policy make sustainable long-run economic growth rise standard live maintain price stability. a single monetary policy successful fulfil objective necessarily imply euro area region country always display similar price developments. divergence price development across various region country normal phenomenon monetary unions. such differential price development represent relative price changes, affect – affect – monetary policy. give existence single monetary policy euro area, ecb's monetary policy impact price level euro area whole. this true irrespective number country region part euro area. this imply ecb's monetary policy must focus price stability euro area whole. 2 bi review 92/2001 however, important understand source differential rate price change among country region euro area, since may affect citizens' welfare require national regional corrective measures. one source divergence rate price change across euro area country regions, often quote public debates, relate “catching-up processes”. we witness catching-up process country region start low level productivity – thus income per caput – compare economy participate emu. during transitional period, may fast productivity growth sector expose international competition catching-up economy mature economies. this, turn, might associate fast price increase catching-up economies. this normal phenomenon within monetary union cause concern. in respect, i like stress substantial process convergence per caput income already take place euro area last decades. another source divergence rate price change across euro area country region may arise country region affect economic policy shock different nature timing, when, due different economic structures, local economy respond differently common shock. one example would change oil price. although common shock whole euro area, country region euro area affect different extent, depend particular demand (or supply of) energy. a difference economic structure across country likely remain future too, fact different region euro area face different economic shock unavoidable. it therefore crucial national local authority measure place facilitate smooth efficient adjustment economic development affect country region differently. one important equilibrate mechanism response shock fiscal policy, operation automatic stabiliser adoption specific measure case adverse shock regional national level. however, require sound budgetary position medium term accordance stability growth pact. in context, allow emphasise responsibility regional local authority make important contribution consolidation public finance exercise control public expenditure. another important adjustment mechanism mobility factor production. the process european integration already lead significant convergence financial capital market capital highly mobile international level. however, labour continue barely mobile within many euro area country almost immobile countries. to end, crucial – i like encourage – make much progress possible introduction acceleration structural reform aim increase mobility, promote flexibility price wage settings, enhance competition reduce distortion product labour markets. without reforms, loss competitiveness derive rigidity become source national, regional, unemployment inefficient under-utilisation resources. strong competition removal structural rigidity increase flexibility economy low adjustment cost associate asymmetric shock affect one particular country region. although considerable progress made, much remain done. lady gentlemen, allow also stress importance role contribute inform european citizen danger cause divergence price development across country regions, might arise result excessive wage increase unsustainable expansion profit margin local level. the development become entrench economy, lead loss competitiveness and, eventually, loss output employment respective economies. clearly, effort make euro success require u master – home – challenge i outlined. however, european union, also euro area, face important external challenge – bring second topic presentation: eu accession process subsequent enlargement euro area. the fact committee establish liaison group applicant country bear witness substantial implication enlargement central bank also representative regional local authorities. a well aware, date 12 country central, eastern southern europe involve negotiation become member eu and, ultimately, also euro area. the integration bi review 92/2001 3 large number new country european union – would imply almost double current number member state – enormous task side without precedent history. a i said, accession eu also entail significant implication economy accession country themselves. for them, main priority indeed foster convergence process eu, real nominal terms. thus, accession country aim achieve european union's standard living, time seek macroeconomic financial stability. this process entail profound comprehensive adjustment real economy well careful design sound economic policies. undoubtedly, significant progress already make respect. a substantial reallocation resources, strong reorientation trade link towards eu, complete institutional overhaul sizeable development private sector obvious sign systemic change. however, achievement give rise complacency rather take motivation structural reforms. these reform need accession country order transform economy fully-fledged market economies, enable cope competitive pressure provide condition sustainable non-inflationary growth. give positive impact structural reform countries' disinflation processes, appear contradiction real nominal convergence. thus, objective pursue parallel emphasis focus one target expense other. in context real nominal convergence, i like emphasise important role play sound fiscal policies. although judge overall fiscal policy stance broadly satisfactory accession countries, budgetary consolidation effort country appear experience recent setback. in cases, strengthen effort return path sound fiscal policy crucial. a determine pursuit fiscal consolidation necessary accession process completion transition phase likely place demand budgetary situation, example relation high infrastructure investment future reform accession countries' health social security systems. lady gentlemen, i like conclude presentation answer one main question usually arise representative ecb talk enlargement: accession process consequence conduct single monetary policy? the answer no. a i already argue regard issue monetary policy regional differences, ecb's monetary policy focus maintain price stability euro area whole, irrespective number region country form part euro area. furthermore, definition price stability, adopt ecb, see last quantification primary objective. the purpose definition remain valid consistent credible point reference time different circumstances. lady gentlemen, pleasure able use brief presentation convey perspective central bank topic also great interest committee regions. thank much attention. bi review 92/2001 1 kristina persson: sweden, emu krona speech m kristina persson, deputy governor sverige riksbank, seminar svensk handel, stockholm, 16 november 2001. * * * thank invitation come here. the theme important one, even yet know referendum hold whether decision emu membership take sweden. there one month leave 1 january 2002, 307 million inhabitant 12 european country new banknote coins. 15 billion banknote 50 billion coin come circulation. in course couple month national banknote coin eurozone cease legal tender. the distribution exchange involve enormous challenge term practical implementation, logistics security. yet i imagine many people soon see positive experience able use mean payment throughout almost whole western europe. see banknote shop euro price across continent bring home existence monetary union tangible way citizen europe. for u swede euro enforce sense outside euro. in addition, behind u period krona weaken without apparent entirely motivate fundamental factors. in opinion, problem worth close examination. it issue i intend speak today. the role riksbank the role riksbank context implement decision take government parliament. the sverige riksbank act, govern operation since 1999, state “the riksbank shall decide application foreign exchange rate system decide upon government.” the general council riksbank last express opinion issue 1997 ask respond government's investigative report. in response submission general council emphasise economic advantage membership probably outweigh disadvantage sweden therefore join emu start. the current executive board reason take stance issue. over past year regularly make technical preparation enable possible future membership implement great cost problem-free manner decision finally taken. economic consequence swedish emu membership the obvious advantage disappearance currency border normally know transaction gains. this removal cost inconvenience involve exchange currency one visit trade different country eurozone. of course foreign exchange cost eurozone limit right start emu 1999, disappear completely. for economy whole, however, exchange cash involve relatively small cost, nevertheless symbolically important. a somewhat large cost arise handle charge company force bear hedge undesirable fluctuation exchange rates. this cost disappear early 1999 within eurozone, particularly large relation gdp – perhaps tenth percentage point. a single currency promote competition within eu benefit consumers, experience low price thereby money pockets. when everyone us unit currency, easy compare price countries. it also advantage national economy whole, since competition facilitate work hold inflation. some difference price unavoidable arise transport information costs, difference attribute costs. despite fact common market free trade good service throughout entire eu, still large difference price different country within union. the average price difference 16 per cent, 2 bi review 92/2001 mean difference approximately 40 per cent large case various state region usa. the price normal volvo, instance, differ 15 per cent one country another europe. some difference create difference culture languages, new study indicate actual psychological barrier involve differ unit currency may bear large part responsibility. the u economist charles engel, instance, calculate extensive study price difference usa canada currency border create price difference correspond geographical distance almost 8,000 km, even country either side currency border (as case canada usa) entirely open one another share language culture. the large negative effect different currency probably trade resource allocation. in way believe inflation result large national economical cost create uncertainty future expense income, fluctuate exchange rate too. in addition, allocation resource society distort exchange rate fully motivated. the emu particular significance trade. many economist long attempt estimate gain look extent fix relatively float exchange rate affect trade find small difference. however, single currency fix exchange rate. the practical psychological difference probably considerable. professor andrew k. rise berkeley usa has, together economists, instead compare trade within monetary union trade country without monetary union, make adjustment fact monetary union often share language, culture regulatory framework. when rise recently present study sweden, opinion emu could course decade increase trade integration much 30-50 per cent. rise admit figure uncertain economist believe much small trade gains. however, even cautious calculation indicate monetary union could provide considerable gains. for instance, professor torsten persson estimates, use alternative calculation rose's material, gain monetary union one-fifth rise claims. this would still involve clear trade gain reason apply sweden. hopefully, new debate stimulate rose's article lead new insight important field. what disadvantages? after all, give one's currency also involve give certain amount one’s autonomy. the argument possible swedish membership emu often touch opportunity pursue independent stabilisation policy. the start point swedish economy could one reason another find synch economic development eurozone, know asymmetrical shock. have independent monetary policy currency would give u opportunity stabilise economy - act form shock-absorber, lose joint monetary policy govern prospect inflation business climate throughout eurozone. this also primary reason calmfors commission's report consequence swedish membership emu1 come conclusion sweden wait labour market wage formation show sufficient flexibility deal serious disturbance. however, note commission envisage “small” eurozone around 6 country take part, whereas talk 12 countries, represent 40-50 per cent sweden's trade. moreover, practice swedish business climate rarely come seriously synch eurozone. when sweden do so, mainly result mistake sweden's economic policy due unforeseeable external disturbance afflict swedish economy. also, respect sweden change recent years: introduction inflation target expenditure ceiling reduce risk new economic policy mistakes. in addition, strong indication correlation swedish eurozone growth increase join emu, trade integration euro country thereby strengthened. we see already long-term swedish market rate covaried strongly eurozone recent years, even period difference business climate 1 report emu investigation (sou 1996:158). bi review 92/2001 3 sweden eurozone. a far swedish membership emu would reduce difference business climate, lead long-term interest rate development adapt business climate. if still believe sweden could become radically synch rest europe, course alternative use independent exchange rate monetary policy shock absorbers. the robust budget situation sweden enjoy today, example, provide slightly great scope early 1990s use fiscal policy purpose stabilisation. one also imagine build buff fund pay reduce payroll tax crisis situation (known internal devaluation) type introduce finland.2 another variant asymmetrical disturbance asset price – property market stock exchange – due strong economic development force short while. however, situation this, require tighten usually manage help fiscal policy. naturally, stabilisation policy via budget limitation since work delay dependent many long-term considerations. in addition, stability growth pact, sweden include whether member emu, provide limitation increase government expenses. the important “shock absorber” even join emu, especially do, wage adapt change competition situation, i.e. high degree flexibility pliability wage formation. it would thus possible avoid increase unemployment adaptation period. naturally, difficult, politically, achieve adapt exchange rate. a single monetary policy therefore require great discipline labour market party since connection wage costs/inflation monetary policy le obvious case today. the krona the reason i pursue far assume exchange rate actually function shock absorber: float exchange rate adapt competitiveness business climate, i.e. strengthen country sweden's economy show good growth weaken swedish economy show weak growth countries. the exchange rate would thus counteract imbalance arise. if sweden alone suffer negative disturbance require price wage sweden develop differently euro countries, float exchange rate would facilitate adaptation. here development krona recent year give cause reflection. doe krona really function shock absorber practice? or fluctuation exchange rate risk affect many factor role shock absorber counteracted? it difficult see recent severe weaken krona adaptation fact sweden come synch surround world. so actually steer krona rate? since 1970s krona weaken almost 90 per cent sweden's important competitor countries. approximately half weaken explain fact inflation sweden high countries. however, inflation sweden develop roughly line international inflationary trends. the weaken krona recent year therefore cannot explain difference inflation rate. if instead look exchange rate adjust inflation differences, “real” exchange rate, find traditional explanation much weaken take place 1970s mid-1990s. our term trade weakened, productivity develop weakly sweden country certain period investor concern rapidly grow central government debt. however, development latter part 1990s rather different. the growth productivity gdp good inflation rate low average among main trade partners, central government debt declined, favour strong krona. nevertheless, krona depreciated. 2 a detail

a small part recent depreciation explain real economy factors: term trade deteriorate slightly due fall price telecom products; export decline heavily sweden many country follow economic slowdown usa; fall order intake export create decline demand krona. however, also explanation directly concern real economy factors, instead steer financial flows, i.e. krona affect net outflow capital sweden. the development krona stock market show strong correlation since begin 2000. this probably connect foreign investor sell swedish share line fall stock market, affect sweden countries, large part stock market value own foreign investors. moreover, swedish investor buy large amount foreign shares, probably connect new pension system free investment regulation ap pension funds. it possible ap pension

one consider safe investment. this particularly noticeable mexico crisis 1995 asia crisis 1997-98. the recent unrest financial market connection uncertainty global business climate negative effect krona. follow terrorist attack usa saw depreciation krona (and minor currencies), well weak development stock market. finally, generally strong dollar must mention one explanation weak krona. some dollar's strength attribute high productivity usa, economist still believe dollar overvalue basis traditional economic theory. the krona thereby steer extent factor connect economic situation development real economy. this mean weak krona function fully shock absorber outside world. sweden undervalue currency despite economy develop well countries' economies. the monetary policy problem weak krona risk create inflation via import prices, turn force tight monetary policy stance would otherwise necessary. there international example exchange rate, instead act shock absorber, rather worsen effect economic slowdown. japan switzerland experience prolong crisis period 1990s, currency remain strong thus cause problem export industry. one effect weaken krona export industry competitive import industry become competitive short term. however, structural problem here: unmotivated weak exchange rate risk strengthen certain part export industry constitute expansive future sectors. sweden's future hardly lie compete low cost prices, rather quality, cut edge technology know-how. when krona eventually appreciate level motivate basis fundamental factors, sweden industrial structure poorly equip meet requirement future. conclusion the riksbank assume krona appreciate. it possible already see begin development recently. when upturn take place, may prove even strong riksbank estimate late inflation report. this prevent fact recent valuation krona bring new perspective question swedish membership third phase emu, i.e. participation eurozone. the volatility krona

effect growth price competition border increase trade could great previously often assumed. bi review 92/2001 5 an independent monetary policy course remain main argument emu membership. the question valuable is. in part, i consider risk large sweden alone get catch crisis instrument best stabilise economy. in part, see exchange rate govern fairly long period time factor financial market primarily relate real economy. instead act shock absorber business climate development sweden synch countries, risk krona, weaken motivate fundamental factors, could instead upset sweden's possibility stabilise development. the economic gain remain outside eurozone thus appear uncertain, recent research indicate swedish debate probably undervalue integration gain emu. when hold first euro banknote next year

financial organization objective improve market discipline foster stable financial markets. effective market discipline complement bank supervision regulation. 2 bi review 91/2001 with sufficient accurate relevant information, market participant good evaluate counterparty risk adjust availability price fund promote good allocation financial resources. the concept market discipline assume great importance among international bank supervisor well. the recent proposal amend augment basel capital accord, publish january call basel ii, seek strengthen market's ability aid bank supervisor regulate capital adequacy. it consist three pillars, tools: risk-based capital (pillar i), risk-based supervision (pillar ii), disclosure risk capital adequacy enhance market discipline (pillar iii). this approach capital regulation, market-discipline component, signal sound account disclosure continue important part supervisory approach many year come. i understand effort enhance capital rule address late today separate session, i discus depth. however, i would like point goal basel process develop risk-sensitive framework provide appropriate incentive bank organization maintain strong capital position sound risk-management systems. the history 1990s, include episode global financial instability spread small country international capital market banks, underscore need maintain adequate capital internationally active banks. for sake maintain financial global stability, i hope everyone value goal. on international level, basel ii would also improve disclosure many bank foreign country well unite states. the proposal recommend specific disclosure convey good institution's capital adequacy risk profile. the incentive basel ii greatly diminish opacity cloak many international financial institution help bring convergence international norm bank disclosure. i believe counterparties expect, indeed force, great disclosure. recent history certainly teach u understand counterparty's balance sheet risk appetite necessary accurately price transaction even decide whether engage transaction. increase supervisory emphasis control risk management the federal reserve also seek strengthen audit control standard banks. this goal large part due recognition several year ago examine banks' business process provide clear assessment safety soundness focus exclusively transaction --that is, review mean rather results. examine process become necessary recognize year ago widen use derivative enable institution substantially change risk profile within hours--possibly shortly conclusion examination. in addition, interim report become important monitor individual bank sector whole. the quality management information financial report dramatically affect internal control systems, include internal external audit programs. financial report good internal control rise importance bank regulator directly affect ability promptly identify institution distress work toward satisfactory resolution. my view financial sector benefit bankers, regulators, auditor focus quality internal control systems. bank benefit directly efficient effective operation indirectly improve audit efficiency reduce regulatory burden. auditor benefit learn client's business good understand supervisor's perspective. a bank supervisors, benefit tap auditor's expertise assess system internal control. auditor expertise sufficient, however. auditor independence also critical relationship supervisor profession. without it, process break down; suspicion rise auditor motif supervisor's ability rely auditor find recommendation diminished. the revision basel ii also address internal control propose capital charge operational risk. development widespread adoption technology, large-scale mergers, e-commerce, increase prevalence outsourcing, increase operational risk. while regulatory reform developed--and interim formal revision basel accord--supervisors continue evaluate management's ability control operational risk. this aspect effort amend accord criticize industry either unnecessary create formulaic approach crude approx-imation proper capital charge. i suggest event september 11 indicate operational risk issue bi review 91/2001 3 cannot ignored. i invite internal external auditor monitor basel ii offer counsel best reflect operational risk capital. both manager supervisor focus operational aspect bank year lead year 2000, date uneventful large part preparation made. now know possible loss physical facility key personnel, generally consider part y2k planning, must factor financial firms' disaster-recovery scenarios. similarly, provide reliable backup key infrastructure--electricity, telephone, water--is likely play large role financial institutions' planning. a go forward, operational preparedness regulate institution figure prominently supervisory program. the role external auditor bank sector the federal reserve supervisory agency long recognize key role account audit profession play assess internal controls. guidance issue federal reserve regulatory agency reflect important role internal external audit play enhance internal system monitor risk. a require statute, bank organization asset $500 million must annual independent audits. the bank agency encourage small institution follow suit. in similar vein, basel committee produce extensive guidance role external audit internal audit way factor supervisory process. a i said, market discipline become key element supervisory thinking, market discipline depend prompt, accurate financial information. external auditor help significantly ensure financial statement reliable useful marketplace. periodic financial statement bank organization also use federal reserve risk-focused supervision programs. these report contribute pre-examination planning, facilitate off-site monitor programs, ultimately help determine institution's financial condition. a strong external audit program assist u move away detailed, burdensome, consider invasive examinations. supervise institution might well decide use expertise external auditor routine financial reports. external auditor could also review quality internal control system ass internal audit function's scope adequacy. we well aware strong system internal control foundation safe sound operation financial organization. furthermore, financial institution's board director responsible set control environment, senior manager responsible lay internal control process. recognize responsibility, i would surprise board director senior manager ask external auditor review internal audit function recommend improvement light change business environment post-september 11. external auditor prepare answer question director following: • be internal audit function appropriate size institution nature scope business, receive unbiased assessments? • be internal audit function competent give current environment? • be resource available internal audit function adequate give nature, complexity, risk institutions' activities? • be weakness fully identify report promptly us? external auditor also help federal regulator encourage financial institution frequently reassess refine risk-management practices. a risk-management system continually monitor financial risk change business climate, outlook credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, operational risk. of course, potential benefit external audit realize audit perform accord high professional standards. this time account profession complacent. each firm review internal practice ensure audit best quality, consistent sound practice high standard ethic independence. the peer -review process view opportunity improve quality rather somewhat routine compliance obligation. i certainly encourage audit profession police strive continually improve audit quality. by avoid suspicion regard competence 4 bi review 91/2001 judgment

risk-taking financial institution way promote financial stability. conclusion in face rapidly evolve external environment, i see wisdom stay course, encourage improve risk-management process good disclosure. i also see, however, time right bank financial institutions, infrastructure providers, utility work independently and, possibly, collaboratively, yield tougher, resilient financial system. i sure regulator support efforts, i encourage account audit community provide professional support well. the account audit community traditionally play important role improve risk-management

91/2001 1 tony latter: derivative central bank perspective speech mr tony latter, deputy chief executive hong kong monetary authority, seminar programme fow derivative expo, hong kong, 5 november 2001 * * * introduction why may central bank interest derivatives? although dangerous generalise, two central bank may see precisely light, certain aspect derivative central banks, include hong kong monetary authority, probably common interest. i like review today. for present purpose one need precise mean derivatives, save note focus financial derivatives, although course share many basic characteristic commodity derivatives. the textbook give various definition financial derivative: instance, contract value depend derive value underlie financial asset index; instrument constitute ownership promise option convey ownership. at widest, definition could embrace futures, forwards, swaps, options, warrants, convertibles, asset-backed security on, combination variation those. at end day probably fair say that, although may experience difficulty describe exactly derivative is, usually recognise one encounter it. the interest central bank derivative tend rather broad commercial bank, trader broker, multiple policy responsibilities. the issue conveniently group four headings: infrastructure, supervision, information, operations. infrastructure hkma probably fairly typical central bank develop financial centre general concern stability development financial infrastructure, without necessarily involve directly provision infrastructure, derivative nowadays form indispensable part. derivative bring substantial benefit commercial community, facilitate hedge hence business plan generally, enable financial institution offer progressively wide range service great efficiency intermediation process, well exploit market imperfection trade opportunity gain. the range available derivative product hong kong extensive. exchange tradable derivative include future option hang seng index well individual hong kong stock and, since launch week ago, selection lead stock certain overseas exchanges. exchange trade interest rate product include one-month three-month hibor futures; future contract three-year exchange fund note expect commence trade late month. le visible, perhaps, outside observer, le important, trade over-the-counter derivative product among financial institutions. few high frequency statistic available otc activity exchange-based activity, bank international settlement publish regular estimate recently release result comprehensive triennial survey activity world's foreign exchange relate derivative markets. the hkma parallel release detail hong kong data collect submit survey.1 briefly, three year april 2001, while, roughly line experience elsewhere world, turnover foreign exchange market hong kong declined, activity otc derivative - essentially currency swap options, interest rate swaps, option forward rate agreement - rise 10%. interest rate product account almost two third total derivative activity. the apparent buoyancy interest-rate relate activity may partly attributable growth composite product structure note include option swap element. some 1 a full account appear forthcoming november issue hkma quarterly bulletin. 2 bi review 91/2001 growth interest rate swap market also associate continue development hong kong dollar bond market, well-rated name may combine issuance longer-term fixed-rate paper swap secure floating-rate hong kong dollar sub-hibor, or, particularly case international borrowers, link also currency swap obtain u dollar sub-libor. a regard exchange trade products, recent surge activity hibor futures. this may owe something steep downtrend interest rate year, could prompt expect continue content lock borrow current low rates, enter future market order speculate hedge respective hunches. all all, various example illustrate, derivative infrastructure hong kong develop well meet evolve requirement business financial communities. supervision despite part provide beneficial service, derivative trade also potential bring disaster. mere mention word bar doubt sufficient make point. it reason relevant authority exercise supervision derivative activity. in hong kong context, hkma supervise bank deposit take institution ensure suitably prudent behaviour, sfc regulate exchange trade players. i perhaps make point supervision aim suppress activity, rather ensure risk properly identify manage disaster might threaten systemic stability avoided. particular emphasis place ensure management posse sufficient understand derivative business associate risks, appropriate internal mechanism place monitor control. officialdom general, central bank especially, sometimes characterise oppose speculation and, extension, suspicious derivatives, often regard convenient vehicle speculation. that characterisation mistaken. we oppose speculation. indeed, recognise clearly financial market cannot operate efficiently speculator excluded. he play key role price formation process essential counterparty hedger. the textbook tell u speculator stabilise price make profit, loses. the fact speculator still exist take prima facie evidence activity balance stabilising, although i also conscious counter-argument, namely destabilise lose money, population constantly replenish fool think better. however, although acknowledge generally positive role speculation, much oppose manipulation. the key distinction that, whereas speculator take view base price observe market act upon it, manipulator us resource advantage dominant market position try influence price - words, potential price setter rather price taker. particularly small market relatively small deal may able move price significantly, need alert potential problem, may, unattended, seriously undermine one's vision competitive, efficient markets. information the price derivative trade contain information may usefully supplement market data available central bank mean monitor expectation sentiment. let give two examples. first, foreign exchange market, whereas forward rate may provide point estimate expect future rate, data option price different strike price provide probability distribution future rate. this additional information, available by-product derivative trading, may interest market analysts, include monetary authorities. within hkma conduct research this, process discuss academic technicians. second, exchange trade products, level activity clearly visible, sudden surge collapse turnover may hint shift sentiment one reason another. although may always clear story best fit particular statistical movement, sensible alert development try understand signal may give. bi review 91/2001 3 operation it may consider natural central banks, like financial institutions, active account derivative markets. nevertheless, perhaps one two caution might apply case central banks. if central bank trade profit - would usually when, instance, manage foreign currency reserves- may presume follow normal trade strategy portfolio manager, within specify guideline subject appropriate risk control course. derivative may usefully part that, provide efficient avenue pursue trade hedge opportunities. it seem entirely reasonable central bank allow operate way, but, derivative cash markets, central bank may need balance objective fund management monetary exchange rate policy. there also question whether derivative use deliberate tool monetary policy purposes. typical example would use foreign exchange forward option assist maintain exchange rate stability. a couple year ago, partly response academic debate subject, hkma fact examine case exchange fund write currency options. we conclude follows: "… write currency option hkma appear technically feasible might consistent currency board principle properly design ….. in theory least, write currency option central bank could useful tool help stabilise exchange market certain condition …. however, … theoretical benefit seem outweigh disadvantage … [including] complication write option would bring currency board system, possibility negative perception hkma engage risky activity lack mean support currency board system spot market."2 the feasibility advisability use derivative monetary instrument subject debate year academic policymakers, country relevant experience tell. a number point seem worth making. first, instances, confident monetary policy probably front support actions. if posse sufficient resource support, certainly think twice leverage derivatives, even demonstrate strategy might, successful, profitable - potential downside could considerable. second, although central bank government nowadays much transparent operation previously, use derivative may instance provide temporary disguise, disguise would seldom healthy reason select strategy. third, imply quotation, perception continue exist derivative particularly risky activity, one might signal degree desperation. despite fact view may irrational, central bank may need acknowledge public sensitivity err side conservatism operations. fourth, search cost-effective reliable avenue monetary operations, bear mind derivative market may fickle le liquid cash markets, perhaps moment might tempt use them. in sum, i currently see convince case use derivative monetary policy tool. in final analysis, however, central bank entitle keep option open surprise market wishes, provide ultimately accountable actions. conclusion i try briefly explain angle central banker generally, hkma particular, view derivatives. this perhaps rather dry topic i feel sure many interest challenge aspect derivative discuss two day seminar relate derivative expo. 2 record discussion exchange fund advisory committee sub-committee currency board operation 5 november 1999, reproduce hkma quarterly bulletin, february 2000. bi review 91/2001 1 european

conference, hold frankfurt, 8 november 2001. * * * lady gentlemen, vice-president i report outcome today's meet govern council ecb. the govern council conduct comprehensive in-depth examination monetary economic developments. against background available evidence, analyse implication maintenance price stability euro area, take forward-looking medium-term perspective. a result, govern council decide low key ecb interest rate 50 basis points. at new level, key ecb interest rate continue appropriate ensure favourable outlook price stability medium term. in assess information accumulate past week conclude inflationary pressure diminished. this particularly apparent information second pillar ecb's monetary policy strategy, information relate first pillar also judge consistent today's decision. the govern council consider today's assessment line available forecast view economic development period ahead. it expect view broadly confirm incoming information economic situation. the ecb publish projection december issue monthly bulletin. let elaborate somewhat assessment provide two pillar monetary policy strategy ecb. with regard first pillar, grow strong pace previous months, m3 growth increase september. however, recent evolution need see reflection increase liquidity preference investor environment relatively flat yield curve august, development global stock market surge financial market uncertainty follow terrorist attack 11 september. in addition, growth credit private sector continue decline recent months. overall, despite acceleration m3 growth, current monetary development signal risk price stability medium term. we continue closely examine underlie dynamic monetary growth. regard second pillar, much clear signal reduction inflationary pressure demand side accumulate recent weeks. euro area real gdp growth weak second half 2001. this see background ongoing weakness world economy, depress demand euro area exports. a consequence, also take account high degree uncertainty follow terrorist attack 11 september, current environment likely lead delay investment activity and, extent, also negatively affect private consumption growth euro area. real gdp growth euro area expect remain potential growth also part next year. further ahead, however, condition exist recovery take place course 2002 economic growth return satisfactory path. the uncertainty currently overshadow world economy diminish, major imbalance euro area would require longer-term adjustment. economic policy euro area whole remain gear towards price stability, objective stability growth pact, wage moderation structural reform. further positive effect economic growth stem impact tax reduction several member country fact finance condition favourable. a regard outlook price euro area, recent development confirm early expectation gradual decline inflation rates, result unwind previous increase energy price absence shock food prices. in addition, crucial medium term, two factor support view wage development le risk previously case. first, slowdown economic activity contribute contain inflationary pressure stem labour market. second, sufficient evidence increase consumer price inflation temporary, help keep inflation expectation low. look forward, inflation 2 bi review 91/2001 rate next month probably show volatility, account base effect result previous price movements. however, short-term fluctuation distract medium-term trend. we expect price stability safely restore 2002. this view confirm bond yield developments, consistent financial market expect inflation rate euro area clearly 2% medium term. overall, assessment point abatement inflationary pressures, allow u reduce key ecb interest rate 50 basis points. this follow three previous interest rate reduction year, bring total decrease 150 basis points. the new level interest rate appropriate maintain price stability medium term. this, turn, favour environment conducive restore high economic growth euro area. interest rate across entire yield curve low measure liquidity condition supportive economic growth. at juncture, i like recall position regard impact slow economic growth euro area countries' fiscal positions. while natural economic slowdown adverse effect member states' budgets, important especially country budget position still close balance surplus and/or high public debt-to-gdp ratio adhere medium-term consolidation plans. the current slowdown substantially change scope reach medium-term commitment make stability growth pact context stability programmes. let emphasise medium-term perspective continuous consolidation essential conduct fiscal policy euro area countries. this would give firm signal investor consumers, thereby support confidence contribute recovery. in effort expand production potential euro area, government also give great impetus implementation structural reforms. fiscal reforms, include relate pension system well level composition public revenue expenditure, would provide correct incentives. labour product market reform beneficial employment growth euro area improve resilience euro area economy adverse shock future. while may perceive difficult advance area environment weak economic activity, need properly address rigidity much obvious time buoyant growth. the current weakness therefore take challenge meet step reform rather allow effort abate. finally, i would like inform govern council decide that, today, – rule – ass stance ecb's monetary policy first meet month. accordingly, interest rate decision normally take meeting. at second meet month, govern council deal part issue relate task responsibility ecb eurosystem. after second meet month, press release ecb's monetary policy decision long issued. obviously, warrant circumstances, govern council still decide change key ecb interest rate time, regardless previously schedule meet (as recently demonstrate decision low interest rate 17 september 2001). we disposal questions.
