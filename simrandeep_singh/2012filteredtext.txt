 bi central bankers’ speech 1 ewart s williams: financial risk management open remark mr ewart s williams, governor central bank trinidad tobago, caribbean centre money finance conference, port-of-spain, 26 march 2012. * * * good morning lady gentleman let add word welcome participant timely seminar financial risk management. a know, seminar form part wide project involve central bank caribbean/caricom region. the project fund mainly inter-american development bank (idb) partner university west indie (uwi) caribbean centre money finance (ccmf) make initiative possible. i would like say special word welcome former president caribbean development bank act executive director ccmf, dr. compton bourne mrs. michelle cross-fenty, country representative iadb, major sponsor project. welcome also distinguish participant regional central bank regulatory body international regional financial institutions. i also thank medium presence. it secret, lady gentlemen, financial system severely test last year outbreak global financial crisis whose powerful shock wave rattle financial market world over, also trigger deep recession many country still grappling. for part, regional financial system display remarkable resilience global financial crisis, even though economy buffet global recession ensued. regional financial systems, however, face challenge arise collapse stanford bank notably, demise large regional conglomerate, cl financial. the stress face cl’s financial subsidiary (clico insurance, clico investment bank (cib), british american baico) test foundation regional financial system, even so, prove resilient. two aspect become know “clico crisis” worth mentioning. the first regional reach: entrap net, trinidad tobago, also barbados, guyana suriname (that clico subsidiaries) well oecs bahamas, house baico insurance companies, clf subsidiaries. the second aspect stand tremendous cost. the bill still accumulate region whole, cost could somewhere vicinity 10–15 per cent regional gdp. for negatives, clico crisis serve important wake-up call region. come heel global financial turmoil, clear reminder need strengthen financial regulatory systems, could withstand exogenous shock underscore idea coordinate regional approach needed. it background caricom heads’ government, july 2009 meet request regional central bank stakeholder put place framework regional financial stability increase resilience exogenous shock intra-regional stresses. 2 bi central bankers’ speech it worth noting, lady gentlemen, objective characteristic region make strong case regional approach financial stability. we small economies, extensive economic links, high vulnerability indices, compare regional group (like, example, eu). moreover island dominate short list over-lapping financial institutions. on downside, however, currently regional regulatory institutions. specifically, nothing like european systemic risk board regulatory authority. the close come regional regulatory authority eccb, cover oecs. what’s more, give current state regional movement, i sure chance pan-caribbean regulatory authority. put aside issue time being, i would like address question, “what main element new regional financial stability infra-structure caribbean region?” and, i would like propose following:  first – region need strengthen financial sector legislation, first round cover bank system, insurance credit union sectors;  second – need substantially upgrade financial sector supervision;  third – country deposit insurance;  fourth – country national crisis management plans;  fifth – build national plans, need formulate regional crisis management plan. permit say word elements. in many country region, include own, financial sector legislation grossly deficient compare obtain advance emerge market countries. we, trinidad tobago, recently introduce modern financial institution act cover bank system new insurance legislation currently parliament. some country region upgrade bank legislation situation promise regard insurance legislation, remain woefully outdated entire region. this must see background jamaican financial crisis late 1990s clico/baico regional crisis originate insurance sector. in principle, strengthened, harmonize legislation would ideal forestall regulatory arbitrage. however, obstacle face caricom model financial institution bill clearly demonstrate potential challenge likely face kind harmonize financial legislation. country region also need upgrade financial sector supervision, include introduction consolidate supervision. i tell first attempt currently underway conduct supervisory exercise systemically important institution, cross-border operations, involve supervisory team different jurisdictions. this important initiative i hope time kind exercise could become routine example regional regulatory cooperation. more country add stress-testing use financial stability report supervisory tool kit. properly used, could provide early warn signal improve assessment threat financial system. i know preparation financial stability report important component idb-financed project, i would like return topic later. deposit insurance scheme could contribute significantly maintenance regional financial stability, protect lower-income depositor prevent bank-runs. a harmonize regional deposit insurance scheme would ideal obstacle would bi central bankers’ speech 3 formidable. national scheme still regard important part regional stability infrastructure. because financial instability sometimes arise without adequate warning, country national crisis management plan, able move quickly contain potential cost national financial crisis. such plan invariably require close coordination various national regulatory bodies, government stakeholders, constitute kind road map process crisis-resolution. the element certainty plan bring, bolster consumer confidence facilitate quick crisis resolution. a regional crisis management plan another indispensable part regional financial stability, element likely present great challenges. the critical pre-requisites regional plan (i) agreement constitute systemic threat regional financial system; (ii) existence information share protocol among regional jurisdictions; (iii) agreement strategy consider resolution process guide principle cost-sharing event public intervention deem necessary. a crisis management plan region likely face several challenges, among difference legislation supervisory approach across region; compete national priority difference resource availability among regional governments. the implementation regional crisis management plan require high level regional council authority make bind decision use resources. this could another challenge current circumstances. i would like make comment one critical component idb-financed project – preparation comparable regional financial stability report (fsr). we need remember report design serve early warn signal point policy maker key risk vulnerability face policy makers. most financial stability report report late level key financial soundness ratios. there new body research suggest assessment value report could enhance include least qualitative discussion near term outlook ratio base various policy assumptions. i fully recognize, course, preparation fsrs resource intensive particularly challenge small central banks. thus, conference seminars, like one, bring idea experience together, invaluable learn opportunity. we need leverage exercise successfully. a know well, range dis-aggregated commercial bank information central bank develop country take grant sometimes difficult collect region culture disclosure deeply rooted. this make effort develop fsrs challenge time necessary. let end wish two day stimulate discussions. i confident conference effort strengthen regional financial stability i thank ccmf idb make possible. bi central bankers’ speech 1 charles i plosser: economic outlook speech mr charles i plosser, president chief executive officer federal reserve bank philadelphia, rotary club wilmington, wilmington, delaware, 29 march 2012. * * * the view express today necessarily federal reserve system fomc. introduction thank invite speak rotary club wilmington. in plan today, i learn wilmington’s business community leader gather auspex location since 1914, long rotary club world. from one organization almost century old another, quite achievement. since federal reserve near centennial december 2013, i think i would give little background nation’s central bank i talk economic outlook. while many american hear feed news every day, everyone know work structured. congress create federal reserve system 1913. to balance political, economic, geographic interests, system design 12 independently charter regional reserve bank throughout country, oversee board governor washington, d.c. the federal reserve bank philadelphia serf third district, include delaware, southern half new jersey, eastern two-thirds pennsylvania. the reserve bank distribute currency, act banker’s bank, generally perform function central bank, include serve federal government’s fiscal agent. a central bank also guide country’s monetary policy. in u.s., body within federal reserve make monetary policy decision federal open market committee, fomc. the committee include seven member board governor washington – currently two open post – five 12 reserve bank presidents: president new york feed four presidents, serve one-year term rotate basis. this structure ensure national monetary policy root washington wall street, also main street across diverse nation. whether vote not, reserve bank president attend fomc meetings, participate discussions, contribute committee’s assessment economy policy options. each u prepare meet gather information throughout districts, around nation, and, cases, internationally. this occur meet board director advisory councils, conversation local international business leaders, well brief economic condition research staffs. all help contribute rich comprehensive mosaic national economy. in way, able make best inform decision possible achieve goal monetary policy congress set u federal reserve act. specifically, congress mandate feed conduct policy “promote effectively goal maximum employment, stable prices, moderate long-term interest rates”. since moderate long-term interest rate generally result price stable, often say congress give feed dual mandate. i believe diversity opinion around fomc table one great strength serf improve quality decision-making. a famous american journalist walter lippmann said, “where men think alike, one think much”. but 2 bi central bankers’ speech diversity view also require note i speak federal reserve board colleague federal open market committee. economic outlook now let turn state economy. we see 10 quarter real gdp growth since mid 2009, great recession officially ended. however, growth particularly robust smooth. to many, occasionally feel like take two step forward take one step back. we finish 2011 real gdp 1.6 percent, compare 3.1 percent prior year. there perfectly understandable reason weakness last year, give unexpected shock experience early year. yet, economy persevered. we saw growth accelerate across four quarters, le half percent first quarter 3 percent fourth quarter. i anticipate continue see moderate growth around 3 percent 2012 2013. that outlook put slightly optimistic camp forecasters. for instance, philadelphia fed’s first-quarter survey professional forecaster report average estimate real gdp grow 2.3 percent 2012 2.7 percent 2013. business spending, especially investment equipment software, remain relatively healthy last year, buoy solid growth corporate earnings. result philadelphia fed’s monthly business outlook survey manufacturers, widely view useful barometer national trend manufacturing, continue improve since last summer’s lull. in march, regional manufacturer report current activity continue expand moderate pace, sixth consecutive month positive numbers. the survey’s indicator general activity, new orders, shipments, employment remain positive. the survey’s measure future activity show respondent expect activity continue pick next six months. consumer spending, account 70 percent nation’s gdp, also continue improve. while personal consumer expenditure steady january, retail sale february grow 1.1 percent. while exactly robust growth, retail sale 6 percent high year ago. on house front, i expect see stabilization maybe slight improvement 2012. we enter great recession over-invested residential real estate, likely see strong house recovery surplus inventory foreclose distress property declines. even economy rebalances, house relate sector likely return pre-recession highs, expect so. those high unsustainable, house crash ensue destroy great deal wealth consumer economy whole. the loss real consequence severe many individual many businesses. moreover, monetary policy cannot paper losses, try so. nevertheless, household business continue make progress restore health balance sheet pay debt increase savings. that healthy trend, economists, include me, believe trend continue 2012. on labor front, i continue encourage recent employment reports, although everyone would agree still many people unemployed region nation. the february employment report show net gain 227,000 jobs, give u third month row job growth 200,000. we also continue see trend upward revision prior months, add another 60,000 job payrolls. the unemployment rate 8.3 percent february, january, unemployment rate move steadily six months, low bi central bankers’ speech 3 level three years. a growth continue strengthens, i expect gradual decline unemployment rate, rate fall 8 percent end 2012. at regional level, late unemployment rate january also show improvement. new jersey’s rate, 9 percent, still high national average, delaware’s rate 7.0 percent pennsylvania’s rate 7.6 percent national average. our research department forecast change unemployment rate pennsylvania new jersey decline delaware’s unemployment rate february. the data schedule release tomorrow. we also see continue improvement employment index monthly survey manufacturers, suggest employer add payroll cut back. a continue road recovery, undoubtedly bump setback along way, i generally optimistic. of course, forecast subject risks. the significant identifiable risk horizon potential effect continue sovereign debt crisis europe. in recent months, i come believe european government economy work challenges. nonetheless, economic slowdown euro zone likely exert small drag u.s. exports. and european financial institution far endure financial market turmoil europe, must continue monitor event ensure trouble spill u.s. financial institutions. of course, regardless european situation play out, already impose considerable uncertainty growth prospect global economy. hopefully, uncertainty begin wane. moreover, nation’s fiscal challenge contribute additional uncertainty economic landscape. until economic environment become clearer, firm consumer likely exercise restraint spend hire decisions, thus limit pace recovery, even economic fundamental u.s. continue improve. on inflation front, risk must monitor trend care. the rate inflation, measure consumer price index, 2.9 percent 12 month february. another common measure call personal consumption expenditure price index 2.4 percent january. thus, inflation high fed’s long-term target 2 percent. some increase inflation past year drive sharp increase energy prices. during late summer, oil price decline somewhat, slow price increases, unfortunately, rise crude oil price $100 barrel gasoline price rising. oil price add great deal volatility overall price index. at times, sharp spike oil price raise overall inflation, reverse price increase moderate. yet, since early 2009, oil price fell $60 barrel, trend upward. moreover, inflation rate remove effect energy food drift upward well low 1 percent le late 2010 2 percent little high today, depend particular index. thus, must monitor inflation trend care prepare take appropriate action necessary. the public right expect central bank keep inflation near target 2 percent medium long term. inflation often develop gradually, monetary policy wait long respond, costly correct. measure slack unemployment rate often think prevent inflation rising. but lesson 1970s show case. a may recall, end high unemployment high inflation, become know misery index. that place want find again. 4 bi central bankers’ speech monetary policy before discuss monetary policy might go relation economic conditions, might helpful review much accommodation currently place. a know, feed keep federal fund rate near zero three year support recovery. we also conduct two round asset purchase triple size fed’s balance sheet change composition short-term treasury longer-term treasury housing-related securities, mostly mortgage-backed securities. many action take height financial crisis ensue deep recession. yet, since then, i indicated, economy healing, somewhat slowly would like, financial crisis substantially abated. of course, problem remain, thing nearly bad gloomy 2009 early 2010. at late meet march, federal open market committee continue hold statement economic condition “likely warrant exceptionally low level federal fund rate least late 2014”. that follow structure forward guidance committee first begin last august, say condition likely warrant exceptionally low rate mid 2013. then january, push back calendar date another 18 months. the fomc also announce feed intend continue maturity extension program, “operation twist”, first launch last september set end june. in program, feed buy $400 billion longer-term treasury sell equal amount shorter-term treasuries, effort reduce long-term yield already historically low levels. the fomc also continue reinvest principal payment hold agency debt mb mb effort help mortgage markets. you may know i dissent fomc decision august september, clear monetary policy accommodation appropriate then. after all, inflation high unemployment low relative previous year, discussing. monetary policy responsive economic conditions, since time, unemployment decreased, inflation target. i believe monetary accommodation still call for, i believe accommodative aggressive height crisis, unemployment 10 percent inflation 1 percent. now unemployment 8.3 percent fall inflation 2 percent drift up, anticipate additional accommodation. indeed, absence shock derail recovery, may well need raise rate end 2014. nevertheless, monetary policy responsive economic conditions. in view, current condition warrant accommodation. yet, economic condition significantly deteriorate upside risk inflation i stress fall significant risk deflation emerge, rethink policy stance. but neither event seem likely juncture. i believe accommodation stage business cycle could lead u treacherous path – one would ever difficult u navigate one would increase already substantial risk high inflation. yet, problem inflation risk road. prolong effort hold interest rate near zero lead financial market distortion misallocation resource could lead more, less, economic instability. conclusion in summary, u.s. economy continue grow moderate pace. i expect annual growth around 3 percent 2012 2013. bi central bankers’ speech 5 prospect labor market continue improve, job growth strengthen unemployment rate fall gradually time. i believe inflation expectation relatively stable inflation remain moderate level near term. however, accommodative stance monetary policy place three years, must guard medium- longer-term risk inflation distortion accommodation create. monetary policy determine economic condition calendar date. and resist notion solve economic challenge simply ever accommodative monetary policy. bi central bankers’ speech 1 paul fisher: liquidity support bank england – discount window facility speech mr paul fisher, executive director market bank england, national asset-liability management global conference, london, 29 march 2012. * * * introduction the bank england’s market operation design allow use balance sheet deliver two core purpose monetary financial stability. specifically, allow u perform three important tasks. first, implement market decision monetary policy committee (mpc) bank rate and, since march 2009, quantity asset purchase finance issuance central bank reserve (better know quantitative ease qe). second, enable u provide liquidity insurance bank system hence reduce cost unexpected disruption commercial banks’ payment service uk economy. third, provide bedrock bank’s market intelligence work, fee core purposes. over past three year so, i use opportunity set policy objective rationale underpin bank’s various market operations.1 today, i want fill piece jigsaw puzzle discuss detail two new operation provide liquidity insurance: discount window facility (dwf) recently-announced extend collateral term repo facility (ectr). in order that, i first want summarise principle govern bank’s provision liquidity insurance, contribute complete overhaul bank’s operation since start financial crisis 2007. principle provide liquidity insurance in order understand liquidity insurance facilities, helpful first think necessary – relate commercial bank do.2 in simple form, bank provide customer variety basic financial services: on-demand source bank notes; deposit save accounts; payment services; supply credit, business households. these critical service efficient function uk economy – do well make u good off. but provide generate necessary degree risk. the obvious credit risk – lend someone money, might get back. that risk justify support central bank – consequence bad commercial lend decision bear banks’ management shareholders, uk taxpayer. bank also bear liquidity risk, might crystallise reason beyond control. for example, bank liability typically comprise large amount on-demand customer deposits, asset tend comprise longer-term loan household firms. this maturity mismatch asset liability essential part bank business model large unexpected shock leave even well-run bank short liquidity. and degree spill-over system whole particularly elevate bank system. 1 see fisher (2010), “managing liquidity system: the bank’s liquidity insurance operations”, http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/documents/speeches/2010/speech450.pdf. 2 in speech, reference commercial bank take include build societies. 2 bi central bankers’ speech by way contrast, car manufacturer fails, people buy cars. if bank fails, cause loss confidence hence run banks. commercial bank self-insure liquidity risk hold buff liquid asset readily exchange cash money markets. it obvious hindsight banks’ collective hold liquid asset prior 2007 insufficient cope ensue crisis hold – although precisely much still debate international regulatory circles. nonetheless, liquid asset buff go far – one always conceive event render bank’s self insurance buff insufficient. such scenario could range short-term it malfunction prevent payment received, full-blown global financial crises. that central bank need stand ready lender last resort. a monopoly supplier central bank money, liquid asset all, central bank able provide liquidity, either bilaterally (in event idiosyncratic shock), bank system whole (in event market-wide shock). in so, important constraints. support central bank available prop fail institution. the bank england lend commercial bank are, judgment, solvent viable. this two relate public policy objectives. first, central bank need guard moral hazard – is, policy undermine commercial banks’ responsibility manage liquidity prudently. if commercial bank know always bail out, may take much risk: bank’s shareholder management might seek profit extra gain arise risky lend whilst rely authority risk crystallise. second, consequence, central bank need protect balance sheet (and hence public money) risk loss. a result, central bank lend collateralised, subject haircut prudently calibrate sufficient counterparty default. in crisis, difficult judge whether bank really temporary liquidity problem underlie solvency problem. there shy away fact difficult judgement make whether central bank offer actual liquidity support. before recent crisis, limit publication term condition possible liquidity support. an approach “constructive ambiguity” adopt many central banks, guard moral hazard. but event occurred, approach limit extent central bank – market participant – could act quickly within appropriate risk management framework. draw lesson crisis, bank’s approach provide liquidity insurance evolve radically since 2007. during period, bank review use balance sheet, implement series public transparent reform facilities. many proposal set consultation document publish october 20083 result work programme lead almost complete overhaul bank’s sterling monetary framework (smf).4 the new framework include arrangement implement monetary policy well permanent facility provide liquidity support bank system. the latter arrangement include bank’s overnight operational stand facility (osfs, offer overnight liquidity high quality collateral event frictional payment 3 “the development bank england’s market operations”, http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/markets/ documents/money/publications/condococt08.pdf. 4 that new system describe revise “red book” publish end 2010, http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/ markets/pages/sterlingoperations/redbook.aspx. bi central bankers’ speech 3 shocks), regular index long term repo auction (iltrs, offer pre-determined, fix quantity central bank reserves, period 3 6 months, wide range eligible collateral),5 discount window facility (dwf) recently extend collateral term repo (ectr) facility. the rest talk today focus policy underpin latter two facilities. design discount window facility the bank’s dwf, introduce october 2008, on-demand facility, design provide bilateral short-term liquidity support face either idiosyncratic system-wide shocks. eligible counterparties, apply grant access dwf, apply borrow time, obviate need wait bank’s next schedule market-wide operation. the design bank’s dwf shaped, part, lesson learn special liquidity scheme (sls). the sl temporary scheme, introduce april 2008 alleviate extreme pressure uk bank system. it design provide significant, one-off, long-term liquidity upgrade legacy asset become illiquid. under scheme, bank lend £185bn treasury bills, three years, exchange high quality illiquid asset create end 2007 – mostly securitised mortgage cover bonds.6 like sls, dwf draw typically structure liquidity upgrade – exchange borrowers’ illiquid collateral uk government security (gilts case dwf). the bank will accept wide range collateral discount window – much wide set normally eligible bank’s regular open market operations. the bank’s publish documentation set four category eligible collateral (level a level d). the content determine market liquidity eligible asset class. the least liquid collateral set include own-name security pool loans: borrow bank originated, close financial link to, asset comprise collateral. other feature dwf different underpin sls. first, dwf borrow typically term 30-days.7 the dwf intend act bridge event liquidity shock. for relatively mild shock might support counterparty next regular iltr,8 plan debt issuance. for great shocks, solution might require fundamental change firm’s balance sheet (e.g. asset disposals). in case, agree lend discount window, bank england need convince credible path point access long required. crucially, dwf intend provide short-term liquidity support bank – intend use replacement funding, source sustain way private markets. and vital stress dwf 100% commit facility. at point application, bank make fresh, independent assessment whether deem counterparty solvent viable. to guard moral hazard, dwf charge fee make unattractive normal times, would attractive stress market conditions. because 5 for information, see fisher (2011), “recent development sterling monetary framework”, http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/documents/speeches/2011/speech487.pdf. 6 for information see john, robert weeken (2012), “the bank england’s special liquidity scheme”, bank’s spring 2012 quarterly bulletin. 7 currently bank also offer discretion option draw 364-days, additional fee. 8 although counterparties guarantee allocation auctions, able bid liquidity, increase chance allocated. 4 bi central bankers’ speech dwf structure liquidity upgrade, fee charge link type liquidity collateral delivered. the illiquid collateral, great value upgrade, hence high fee. in addition, part bank’s desire ensure commercial bank adequately incentivised seek liquidity insurance, cost borrow increase size draw. the result matrix fee summarise table 1. table 1 fee table dwf draw gild fee (bps) collateral type % sterling eligible liability level a level b level c level d (e.g. high quality (e.g. liquid (e.g. illiquid (e.g. own-name sovereign debt) high quality transferable securitisations mortgage securitised loan cover corporate bonds) mortgages) bonds,

associate provide liquidity support compromise bank england’s ability conduct monetary policy. to implement interest rate decisions, bank must, market operations, adjust supply central bank money response change demand banknote reserves, give mpc’s policy rate (bank rate). during period stress may large shift demand reserve bank’s market operation need design meet monetary policy financial stability objective without conflict. in normal times, bank rate set within reserve average framework, commercial bank choose target reserve balance hold bank require meet target average monthly maintenance period remunerate bank rate. the bank england supply enough cash system bank collectively meet targets, combination operational stand facility inter-bank market guide short-term market interest rate towards bank rate. this framework rely bank ensure amount sterling cash system line demanded, give bank rate. the liquidity swap structure dwf involve extra injection cash help avoid direct impact set bank rate. the bank may, however, decide exceptional circumstances, lend cash instead. that might require if, example, gild repo market function properly, size require draw sufficiently large bank deem unlikely counterparty able repo gild without cause undue volatility markets. in circumstance either bank would need relax tolerance around banks’ reserve target accommodate bi central bankers’ speech 5 extra cash system, drain excess cash, one several means. in either case, bank would compromise capacity set bank rate purchase assets. since start bank’s asset purchase programme march 2009, interaction binding. because quantitative ease directly inject cash economy, force commercial bank hold reserve would otherwise choose to, reserve average system suspend central bank reserve since remunerate bank rate. but reserve average re-introduce due course, need conscious potential interaction liquidity support monetary policy operations. the framework design policy objective achieve time.9 recent policy initiatives/issues a) pre-positioning since dwf put permanent transparent foot late 2008, bank work number initiative develop facility further. one important expansion bank england’s capacity ass lend portfolio loan (e.g. mortgages) well securities.10 there number benefit capacity. portfolio loan easy bank ass risk perspective, embed complex structure sometimes present securitised assets. and securitising loan asset back security – rmbs – complex expensive firms, generally available large enough exist securitisation programme. the ability accept raw loan collateral mean small counterparties, without securitisation platforms, disadvantage position collateral dwf. since financial instability start small bank easily large ones, expand universe possible discount window counterparties could lead significant financial stability benefits. alongside expansion eligible collateral loan portfolios, encourage bank “pre-position” collateral. pre-positioning involve commercial bank identifying, bank england assessing, various type collateral ex ante, need assess short notice event sudden unexpected need borrow discount window. assess vary pool illiquid collateral extremely complex time consuming. the bank may able lend much, all, collateral time conduct sufficient due diligence. a result, vital collateral pre-positioned well ahead need draw. one benefit public transparent facility due diligence much easy carry out. the pre-positioning drive gather pace last year – £265bn collateral pre-positioned use dwf. after apply appropriate haircut piece collateral pre-positioned, mean bank could, subject solvency viability assessment repayment plans, lend around £160bn dwf without complication detail collateral checks.11 although substitute firm 9 further detail central bank use money market operation implement monetary policy provide liquidity support bank set clews, salmon weeken (2010), “the bank’s money market framework”, available bank’s winter 2010 quarterly bulletin. 10 further detail available http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/markets/marketnotice100719.pdf. 11 that around 10% annual nominal uk gdp 2011 – slightly high unite states, lendable value collateral pledge depository institution discount window (around $1.3trn january 2012) equivalent around 8.5% nominal u gdp 2011. 6 bi central bankers’ speech build hold high quality liquid asset satisfactory level, represent substantial “war chest” potential liquidity event significant adverse shocks. there limit cost counterparty pre-positioning, collateral withdraw demand use operation market transactions. the extent pre-positioning vary across firms, however, hope continue sign new counterparties encourage firm increase quantity pre-positioned collateral time. b) address perception stigma the late data, publish bank’s quarterly bulletin week, show borrow dwf introduction late 2008 30th september 2011. in part, likely reflect fact uk bank system (in aggregate) short sterling liquidity period – bank inject large amount liquidity variety operation include sl expand ltr operations. and since early 2009 asset purchase mpc’s qe programme mechanically lead large increase stock central bank reserves. of course reserve total ensure appropriate distribution liquidity across individual bank – help. some people suggest lack use dwf may reflect concern stigma attach support facilities. stigma might arise counterparty concern use dwf would detected, couple perception others weak institution would ever use bilateral, on-demand facility. in fact, make clear, dwf support fail firm – borrow dwf, firm must convince bank ability repay. address stigma issue extremely complex potentially affect number central bank operation internationally. one way address perception stigma appropriate policy disclosure. while headline result bank’s auctions, total bid total amount allotted, publish immediately conclusion, publish average daily amount outstanding dwf quarter, aggregate across firms, even one-quarter lag. the intention dwf draw disclose terminated. moreover, structure liquidity upgrade, dwf borrow would visible bank’s balance sheet, reduce risk draw unintentionally revealed. another possibility counterparties concern “spotted” use dwf-sourced gild repo markets. for majority cases, however, i think simple way alleviate concern – example encourage bank set multiple repo counterparty relationship rotate regular gild repo business amongst them. that would deliver wide business financial stability benefits, even absence dwf. indeed, fsa require bank test repo capacity lend gild liquid asset buffers. ultimately expect counterparty would draw dwf to, despite stigma concerns. the risk perception stigma might delay application borrow, make firm’s liquidity position perilous. the solution problem require bank work closely supervisor commercial bank themselves, ensure appropriate time use. c) extend collateral term repo facility (ectr) the recent policy development liquidity insurance tool addition ectr facility december 2011. although contingent facility, ectr permanent part bank’s sterling monetary framework. the design ectr share element iltrs dwf. like iltrs, competitive auction, design provide reserve bank system whole. bi central bankers’ speech 7 participant submit quantity would like borrow price (expressed spread bank rate, subject minimum 125bps) would will pay. the disclosure policy (total amount bid for/allocated) also similar iltr, together market-wide nature operation, help alleviate perceive stigma associate facility. the ectr’s collateral arrangements, however, similar dwf – borrow back full range eligible collateral, long pre-positioned discount window beforehand. the purpose ectr make liquidity available least liquid collateral, market whole, would offer likely multiple take up. (if single firm need support could direct dwf.) consistent bank’s facilities, firm judge solvent viable would eligible participate. subject that, counterparties access dwf would eligible participate ectr operations. although facility announced, bank yet offer operation ectr. that reflect judgment market condition yet consistent likely demand use. the bank would revisit decision event mark deterioration market conditions. conclusion in speech today, i set principle behind bank england’s revised, permanent public facility provide liquidity insurance bank system. we expect bank self-insure liquidity need – encourage progress date, need front. but necessary, bank england stand ready provide support solvent viable institutions, sufficiently good collateral, appropriate fee. it important commercial bank pre-position collateral due diligence perform maximum benefit achieved. the new sterling monetary framework, reform almost entirety since 2007, reflect experience crisis lesson temporary measure put place. doubtless framework continue evolve future, provision publish facility help make system resilient year come. bi central bankers’ speech 1 masaaki shirakawa: central bank – before, during, crisis remark mr masaaki shirakawa, governor bank japan, conference sponsor federal reserve board international journal central banking, washington dc, 24 march 2012. * * * introduction the global financial crisis bubble precede pose mount issue central bank. the bank japan first central bank among advance country confront issue postwar period. japan’s experience intellectually stimulate academic policy maker overseas, lead bank flood policy proposals, include highly experimental ones. with exception cases, however, low growth japan follow burst bubble often simply interpret unique episode cause failure implement bold policy measure prompt manner. a many may recall, oft-quoted paper coauthored number federal reserve economist entitle “preventing deflation: lesson japan’s experience 1990s” release 2002.1 this paper argue follow (chart 1). “our sense much failure monetary loosen support asset price boost economy owe offset shock rather genuine breakdown monetary transmission mechanism. …… little evidence transmission channel monetary policy diminish obviate benefit fast sharp monetary ease 1991–95 period.” at time, i find view effectiveness monetary policy sanguine. several year later, house credit bubble burst, time europe unite states, trigger financial crisis. development real gdp unite states, u.s. house price peak large-scale financial crisis occur form lehman shock, reveal surprisingly similar trend share japan (charts 2 3).2 the say two countries’ policy responses, include virtually zero interest rate policy expansion central banks’ balance sheet (charts 4 5). when bank japan strive devise new policy measures, mention zero interest rate policy, quantitative easing, policy commitment regard future level interest rates, – refer today – credit easing, little i imagine federal reserve would adopt similar measure within short span years. i become painfully aware need closely study countries’ experience past quarter-century, draw true lesson could apply future policy conduct. relevant topic discussion range widely monetary policy regulation supervision, payment settlement systems, on. in remark today, i raise 1 for details, see following. ahearne, alan, joseph gagnon, jane haltmaier, steve kamin, others, “preventing deflation: lesson japan’s experience 1990s,” international finance discussion papers,

crises, focus role monetary policy. conventional wisdom tell u price development serve trigger change monetary policy. in fact, without exception, central bank pay attention output gap inflation expectations, impact future inflation developments. in retrospect, however, look back bubble form develop financial crises, significant imbalance destabilize macroeconomy emerge financial front instead price front. the financial imbalance take form sharp significant rise asset price credit expansion associate increase leverage maturity mismatches. financial imbalance ultimately create tremendous shock financial institution financial system, lead sharp significant contraction economic activity. while acute pain wear result aggressive policy measure take government central bank crisis erupted, chronic affliction low growth associate balance-sheet repair remains. this experience reveal fact economy able avoid prolong period stagnant growth even though aggressive monetary ease adopt prompt manner burst bubbles. in sense, policy priority place ex-ante measure restrain buildup financial imbalance instead ex-post measure clean mess bubble bursts. regard ex-ante policy measure address financial imbalances, argue that, base tinbergen’s rule mundell’s assignment principle, authority assign monetary policy price stability task regulatory supervisory measure challenge address financial imbalances. however, policy assignment effective two policy objective price stability financial system stability independent other. a series event recent year make clear two policy objective independent. when macroeconomic environment include price become stable, economic entity become sanguine risk increase appetite risk-taking. furthermore, grow expectation low interest rate environment continue price stability, financial institution increasingly get involve “search yield” activity increase leverage mismatch asset liability respect maturity currency (chart 6). when imbalance grow beyond certain threshold, threaten stability financial system consequently real economy prices. many central banks, include bank japan, aware financial imbalance period precede financial crises. the troublesome thing central bank fact inflation rate rise, remain low, buildup imbalances, ironic give traditional emphasis price stability (chart 7). at least case japan, inflation rate remain low amid high economic growth, try justify interest rate hike need defeat strong counterargument predicate late become know “the arrival new economy.” the continuation low interest rate environment one cause financial imbalances. in particular, central bank commit asymmetric conduct monetary policy – specifically, lean bubble long price stable instead intervene aggressively burst bubble –, situation could get bad follow channels. first, kind put option-type monetary policy engender risk-taking financial institutions. second, monetary policy focus narrowly price stability alone successfully engender extend period stable macroeconomic environment, boost various economic entities’ expenditure risk taking. even though monetary policy lead combination high growth low inflation, surface, difficult distinguish case arrival new economy. if central bank bi central bankers’ speech 3 continue monetary ease without proper diagnosis, boost economy accelerate accumulation financial imbalance seemingly continue price stability, result correspondingly large shock bubble bursts. this could refer “a paradox price stability.” needle say, inappropriate blame monetary policy accumulation financial imbalance fact form much complicate mechanism. in regard, nobody disagree claim regulation supervision play important role address financial imbalances, macroprudential perspective crucial. so, argument authority assign regulatory supervisory measure financial imbalances? my answer simple: need employ appropriate monetary policy tandem regulation supervision. it seem promise address financial imbalance macroprudential measure regulation without monetary policy responses. this like endlessly bail water overflow bucket without turn tap. ii. during crisis: importance lender last resort role now i would like move next phase: midst crisis. in phase, essential role central bank act “lender last resort.” the time-honored importance lender last resort function also demonstrate aggressive measure take central bank midst recent crisis, prove effective prevent sharp drop economic activity. take example quantitative ease bank japan, credit ease federal reserve, three-year ltro european central bank, effectiveness measure essentially hinge central banks’ role lender last resort. in association lender last resort function, i would like stress importance policy regard payment settlement system (chart 8). only central bank able issue currency private economic agent accept without conditions. therefore, financial crisis credibility counterparties undermined, role central bank become extremely important. in midst crisis, crucial financial institution investor manage counterparty risk control amount exposure end day also intraday credit. in past twenty year so, role central bank, bank banks, make various effort improve safety efficiency payment settlement systems. such effort lead introduction real-time gross settlement, delivery versus payment, simultaneous settlement foreign exchange (chart 9). without effort make central banks, lehman shock could induce complete termination financial transactions. if i ask significant contribution central bank term secure economic financial stability past quarter century, i could point unceasing effort improve payment settlement systems. iii. after crisis: effect limit aggressive monetary policy lastly i would like discus role monetary policy aftermath financial crisis – specifically, economy overcome acute pain still suffer chronic affliction low growth associate balance-sheet repair (chart 10). when take monetary ease steps, essential conduct careful analysis intend benefit well unintended costs. while aggressive monetary ease definitely need burst bubbles, side effect limit also take consideration. although universal conclusion cost benefit analysis monetary easing, depend country phases, i would like call attention follow 4 bi central bankers’ speech four aspects, pay sufficient attention traditional argument make recent crisis.3 the first burden balance-sheet repair. even monetary easing, economic entity excess debt neither increase expenditure embrace risk take debt reduce appropriate level. monetary ease mitigate pain associate balance-sheet repair. moreover, employ mitigator prolong time come costs, reduce incentive lessen excess debt cause delay balance-sheet repair, ultimately necessary economic recovery. needle say, effect low interest rate extend economic entity suffer damage balance sheets. if bring forward future demand present take advantage low interest rate environment, lead increase aggregate demand. a balance-sheet adjustment continue long period time, however, amount future demand could bring forward gradually diminish even low interest rate environment. the above-mentioned cost reduce incentive lessen excess debt issue private economic entity also government. once increase level government debt perceive unsustainable, threaten price stability financial system stability, case european debt problem. the second aspect impact low interest rate supply side economy. if low interest rate induce investment project profitable interest rate levels, could adverse impact productivity growth potential economy make resource allocation inefficient. while central bank typically conduct monetary policy treat potential growth rate exogenously given, economy prolong shock arise balance-sheet repair, may take account risk continuation low interest rate affect productivity overall economy low potential growth rate endogenously. the third aspect impact financial intermediaries. the effect monetary ease usually materialize firm household increase expenditures, induce low interest rates. within process, bear mind financial intermediary financial market connect monetary policy conduct central bank firm households. once intermediary stop function properly, long expect see successful transmission monetary easing. maturity transformation important intermediation function banks, benefit spread short- long-term interest rates. monetary ease widen spread increase interest margin financial intermediaries. this one monetary transmission mechanism enhance stimulative effect economy bank sector. beyond certain threshold, however, monetary ease could instead squeeze margin discourage financial intermediation, result low efficiency resource allocation low growth potential long run. a similar problem arise institutional investor form negative spread – is, investment return asset fall promise return long-term liabilities. the fourth aspect international spillover monetary ease feedback effect country’s economy. when domestic economy process balance-sheet repair, effect monetary ease tend materialize form search yield activity global investor depreciation foreign exchange rates, instead increase expenditure domestic private economic entities. if emerge economy become destination search yield activity global investors, monetary ease advance economies, combine inflexible foreign exchange rate policy emerge economies, likely lead expansion emerge economy rise international 3 a quantitative analysis effect various policy measure adopt period quantitative ease japan, please see hiroshi ugai, “effects quantitative ease policy: a survey empirical analyses,” monetary economic study vol. 25, no.1, march 2007. bi central bankers’ speech 5 commodity prices.4 even though rise commodity price affect globally accommodative monetary conditions, individual central bank recognize fluctuation commodity price exogenous supply shock focus core inflation rate exclude price energy-related item foods. the result reluctance individual central bank counter rise commodity prices, aggregate globally, could boost prices. from global perspective, situation represent nothing case hypothetical “world central bank” fail satisfy taylor principle, ensure stability global headline inflation (chart 11). while understandable central bank would pursue stability economy conduct monetary policy, increasingly important take account international spillover feedback effect economies. conclude remarks: monetary policy challenge future so far i raise point relevant discuss central bank term three phase – before, during, financial crisis. in closing, i would like offer change perspective point future challenge central bank organizations. the first framework monetary policy. in regard, consensus already emerging. most central bank advance economy conduct policy aim maintain price stability medium long term, regardless difference label attach monetary policy framework. furthermore, also become apparent excessive focus short-term inflation development may ultimately result large swing economy buildup inevitable correction financial imbalances. the bank japan probably alone try incorporate view financial imbalance – words, macroprudential perspective – conduct monetary policy. the remain issue weave desirable framework political foundation central bank independence, cornerstone economic stability prosperity. it relatively straightforward hold central bank account hit miss certain inflation number. in sense, spotlight accord specific level inflation quid pro quo entrust important slice economic policy technocratic institution. in contrast this, macroprudential consideration much nebulous – contain element art rather science – inevitably test limit democratic deference conduct monetary policy. the second, related, challenge strengthen decision-making process economic analysis central banks. good decision make research support central bank real foundation independence. the recent crisis reveal miss many important point look economy traditional macroeconomic perspectives. we need make effort avoid fall trap break free habit groupthink. it essential develop institutional culture variety information vital decision make monetary policy – relate macroeconomy, financial markets, financial institution – fully utilize well-balanced manner. 4 a background international commodity price development policy implications, please see report g20 study group commodity chairmanship mr.

orthodoxy un-orthodox time speech mr christian noyer, governor bank france chairman board director bank international settlements, conference global interdependence center/bank france, paris, 26 march 2012. * * * the unconventional policy implement crisis transform face central banking. but change prove permanent “the unconventional become new normal?” there yet definitive answer question. we may not, easily would like, able revert exactly status quo ante. however, i strongly believe must make sure gain pre-crisis period, term monetary price stability, compromise process. prior crisis, description central bank would centre four characteristics: they focus price stability primary key objective, responsibility seek give financial stability; they limit size small balance sheet interest rate policy instrument; they independent, condition recognise necessary anchor inflation expectations, embody strong institutional frameworks; and successful: “great moderation”, period exceptional low volatility output inflation, widely see product efficient wise monetary policies. there happy feel that, last, perennial monetary regime found, well-tailored characteristic modern market economy. financial market efficient zero low bind liquidity trap appear historical curiosities. with hindsight, course, see “ideal” economy may never existed. the great moderation much product “good luck” (brought disinflationary effect globalisation) good policy. monetary stability necessary sufficient condition financial stability, capital market always necessarily efficient. and downward financial spiral may quickly bring economy point interest rate long use effective tools. therefore, crisis unfolded, central bank respond take unprecedented measure and, process, undergo three major change a diversification interventions. in order both: unclog financial market (both private public). this involve exceptional liquidity provision bank well temporary purchase assets, private public. circumvent zero low bind bring real long-term interest rate purchase government bonds, and/ interest rate guidance. a consequence, central banks’ balance sheet expand factor three, dramatically increase role financial intermediation sometimes raise concerns, least quarters, possible inflationary impacttogether, diversification increase size create complex interaction fiscal policies. specifically, asset purchase sometimes see “quasi fiscal policies” asset side (due potential risk attached) liability side (when contribute significantly meet fund need sovereigns). 2 bi central bankers’ speech at time decided, exceptional intervention absolutely necessary. although forgotten, central bank initially create protect economy excessive financial disturbances. this was, historically, “raison d’être”. a ultimate unique provider liquidity, cannot escape responsibility let financial system economy collapse. at time, so, central bank expose number risk first, risk link balance sheet expansion. they cannot ignored, although central bank extremely careful value asset purchase take collateral. second, run risk blur line fiscal monetary responsibilities. a dynamic use balance sheet central bank effect allocation distribution resource economy. they may favour penalise type collateral certain borrowers. if central bank take additional responsibility area financial stability, close cooperation fiscal authorities, thus expose possible interference monetary policy. the major risk, however, risk confusion. a multiplicity intervention could interpret relative dilution objectives. there tendency market participant policymakers consider central bank “universal problem solvers” whose balance sheet used, without cost, purposes. there also doubt, least ambiguity, mind analysts, true purpose government bond purchases. central banks’ activism may create doubt ability stick core mandate – price stability – face increase pressure constraints. overall, euro area well protect risk thank robustness institutional framework price stability unambiguously priority objective monetary policy monetary finance government strictly prohibit the eurosystem (the ecb national central banks) extremely well capitalised, protect independence. this allow eurosystem implement nonstandard measure large scale without endanger credibility. of course, control fiscal policy. we never accept situation fiscal imbalance could constrain monetary policy. it important, therefore, credible fiscal consolidation take place across euro area. this make easy eurosystem active protect financial stability. on contrary, doubt governments’ resolve ensure sustainability public finance would make u powerless fight instability expose euro area great dangers. now normative aspects. we may live nonstandard measure long time. indeed, central bank adopt interest rate guidance announcement cover next two years. it likely monetary policy will, time, make use diversity instruments. macro-prudential measure interact monetary policy complex way. in context, therefore important keep clarity purpose stick two crucial feature inherit pre-crisis consensus: focus price stability and, corollary, central bank independence. there ambiguity central bank try achieve. the non-conventional actions, le obscurity ultimate purpose. non-conventional measures, like others, achieve objective inflation expectation solidly clearly anchored. from point view, call economist market participant temporary relaxation price stability objective bi central bankers’ speech 3 are, view, totally misguided. i find significant, contrary, two major central bank recently decide quantify price stability objective enhance communication accordingly. bi central bankers’ speech 1 jörg asmussen: exchange view economic social crisis greece introductory statement mr jörg asmussen, member executive board european central bank, committee economic monetary affair european parliament, brussels, 27 march 2012. * * * response write question economic social crisis greece several political group within european parliament find ecb’s website. dear chairwomen, honourable member european parliament, the organisation hear illustrate extent launch euro bring economic interconnectedness: view strong implication stability euro area whole, put greece back foot interest us. political interconnectedness could also hardly good demonstrate today. domestic policy become european – fully justify discus european level, executive parliamentary fora. why greek adjustment programme unavoidable the greek economic adjustment social implication painful: doubt this. the question, however, is: greece get situation alternative? the major effort adjustment reflect severity macroeconomic imbalance accumulate year greece. misguide economic fiscal policies, lack structural reforms: policy undermine sustainability public debt create large competitiveness gap. it adjustment programme cause recent decline gdp. the current economic depression unavoidable correction substantial positive output gap build 2009. be alternative current adjustment? we help greece create false expectations. call loosen fiscal stance illusory. greece could hardly face large financial constraint moment: lose market access draw fix envelope official support. there one way forward: restore fiscal sustainability competitiveness, will, turn, bring back sustain growth. this require perseverance: perseverance carry fiscal consolidation; perseverance implement comprehensive structural reforms; perseverance address weakness greek bank sector. the effort undertake greek government sacrifice greek public endure far substantial. but still long way go. it secret programme subject exceptionally high implementation risks. the debt exchange operation successful, official finance scale up. this improve debt sustainability prospects: estimate debt-to-gdp ratio could bring 116½% 2020. but depend one key condition, namely greece fully implement programme. debt dynamic extremely sensitive implementation slippages. delay fiscal consolidation, low privatisation proceed slow structural reforms: scenario would translate weak economic growth worsen debt sustainability. without regime-change policy implementation much broad political consensus favour painful, necessary reforms, high risk programme derails. therefore, political courage need ever. 2 bi central bankers’ speech let comment detail three key areas: fiscal adjustment, competitiveness gain financial sector issues. fiscal adjustment the greek authority greek people deserve recognition significant fiscal adjustment achieve last two years: despite deep recession, general government deficit reduce around 6½% gdp since 2009 (from 15¾% 9¼%). this broadly correspond deficit reduction initially envisage programme, i.e. 2009 deficit outcome revise upwards (by 2.2% gdp). this remarkable achievement. nevertheless, size government still large compare greece’s capacity generate collect fiscal revenues. moreover, quality fiscal adjustment mixed. on one hand, important reform start address greece’s high level public wage employment previously unsustainable pension system. on hand, fiscal adjustment far excessively rely increase tax rate across-the-board expenditure cuts. look ahead, progress fiscal consolidation require implementation difficult structural fiscal reforms. close large fiscal gap 2013–14 (5½% gdp) litmus test government’s commitment programme: without government’s willingness ability design implement difficult structural fiscal reforms, large adjustment cannot achieved. i call greece’s political class push difficult reform confront vest interests. otherwise critical mass structural fiscal reform necessary close medium-term fiscal gap may reached. finally, make sure economic adjustment burden fairly distributed? i know important concern european parliament. one essential avenue tax administration reform. progress regard rather disappoint far: many cases, wealthy greek still contribute le possible overall adjustment effort, partly account tax evasion. strengthen revenue administration fight tax evasion crucial. not need increase revenue; could also improve social acceptability adjustment programme. competitiveness there improvement competitiveness first programme, fell short needed: greece still face substantial competitiveness gap. this largely reflect delay implementation labour market structural reforms. close gap, remain euro area, require pronounce internal devaluation. how achieved? how reverse dramatic increase unemployment? reduce minimum wage private sector, remove rigidity wage-setting system: key element strategy accelerate internal devaluation. they may popular, way around want create basis renew competitiveness employment growth. this area decisive action needed. labour market reform must complement liberalisation product service markets, example close professions. political willingness key ingredient overcome resistance vest interest areas. bi central bankers’ speech 3 bank recapitalisation last least, greece need address situation bank sector. a consequence debt exchange, greek bank heavily undercapitalised. the programme envisage bank deem viable bank greece recapitalised. bank unable raise capital market recapitalised programme resource hellenic financial stability fund (hfsf). in contrast, bank deem non-viable resolved. it crucial €25 billion earmark purpose part first disbursement use swift injection capital greek bank (the overall envelope bank recapitalisation resolution amount €50 billion). the recapitalisation strategy design maximise private sector participation, preserve state’s interests. the banks’ share acquire state recapitalisation process limit vote rights, may still allow upside return share state private shareholders. whenever possible, private management bank safeguarded. the governance structure recapitalisation resolution process significantly enhanced. this become necessary owe substantial amount official finance channel exist greek institutions, particular hellenic financial stability fund. conclusion let conclude message hope. yes, medicine bitter, patient recover follow prescription. look successful past experience fiscal adjustment european country show lose battle. however, absolute prerequisite adjustment succeed strong political ownership. the greek people reform economy state please troika; carry sacrifice please country x y euro area. they go adjustment process good. maximum political ownership therefore expect key. bi central bankers’ speech 1 edgar barquín: recent economic trend policy issue presentation mr edgar barquín, president central bank guatemala, jp morgan investor seminar, central america panel, occasion iadb annual meetings, montevideo, uruguay, 17 march 2012. * * * i would like thank jp morgan opportunity share view panel. in address recent economic trend guatemala main policy issues, i would first like highlight specific feature current international context directly affect guatemala’s economy. then i give quick overview recent trend prospect guatemala’s main economic variables, finally i share main policy challenge face near future. regard current international context, i would like highlight six elements: first, deterioration global economic prospects, already reflect weaken global trade. low economic prospect also horizon latin american country well key emerge economy china india. second, high frequency indicator suggest recovery economic activity unite state america, though sustainability recovery still uncertain due high level unemployment, problem key market house market, potential risk due problem euro area fiscal consolidation issues, among others. third, uncertainty arise euro area debt crisis potential spillover effect region financial markets. fourth, decline commodity price contribute ease headline inflation develop countries. however, price still high, particularly oil prices. fifth, high level unemployment remain advance economy include unite state euro area whole. and sixth, insufficient progress develop medium term fiscal consolidation advance economy could deepen global imbalances. regard recent trend prospect guatemala’s main economic variables, first i would highlight recovery economic activity continue 2011; year, gdp increase 3.8 percent, though still pre-crisis levels. for 2012 expect growth rate 2.9 percent 3.3 percent, mainly due impact international environment i mentioned. a regard exports, experience negative growth rate 2009 due crisis, growth rate 2011 high last 13 year more, 23.6 percent. this performance mainly due high price high export volume guatemala’s main traditional products. for 2012, prospect expect slightly low growth rates, though still positive, due deterioration global economic prospects. in case imports, growth rate quite significant 20 percent 2010 2011, reflect high domestic demand good service particularly capital goods, fuel input industry. for 2012, low growth rate expect estimate low demand consumption good input industry. remittance inflow recover slow pace. in 2011 amount little bite higher, 63.3 million dollars, one 2008 previous hit crisis guatemala. for 2012, even though expect recovery amount inflows, growth rate 2 bi central bankers’ speech significant, 5.7 percent, hispanic unemployment rate unite states, 99 percent remittance come, still high. a guatemalan economy integrate global economy new investment opportunity arise due great diversification production good services, experience increase capital flow foreign direct investment. we expect flow keep grow specific action take promote investment country basis public-private strategic alliance also include effort improve guatemala’s investment climate. a today, 55 percent foreign direct investment come unite state mexico. here important mention short term capital inflow economy significant. therefore, experience problem latin american country deal relatively high capital inflow well significant appreciation nominal currency increase credit private sector fuel economic activity potential levels. international monetary reserve reach high historical levels, usd 6 bn (and expect reach close usd 7 bn 2012), represent important liquidity cushion guatemalan economy well good signal international market credit rat agencies. the bank credit private sector increased, mainly credit foreign currency due low international interest rate well high guatemalan industrial activity experience 2011. the main fund credit foreign currency commercial line credit american banks. the economic activity confidence index improving, particularly recent months. this performance highly relate positive expectation new government take office mid january. so far, government give clear signal pro-private sector government. in first month office government launch competitiveness agenda integrate policy foreign trade, competitiveness investments. these specific action contribute positively expectation economic growth despite uncertainty global economic prospects. decline commodity price contribute ease headline inflation since mid 2011, reach 6.20 percent end year, slightly top limit monetary board’s target 5.0 percent plus minus 1 percentage point. for 2012, inflation estimate within range target 4.5 percent plus minus 1 percentage point, though inflationary expectation still range. guatemala’s central bank main goal pursue price stability reflect inflation range target set monetary board, one i mentioned. in context, inflationary pressure arise inflationary expectation continue target, specific action take monetary board near future achieve 2012 midterm inflation targets. in meantime, central bank monitor performance prospect key external internal economic variable may impact headline inflation inflationary expectations. in addition, coordination fiscal policy continue strengthen well transmission mechanism monetary policy. guatemala know international organisation credit rat agency good record prudent fiscal monetary management well low level public debt tax burden. fiscal revenue significantly hit crisis 2008/2009 fiscal deficit almost doubled, reach 3.3 percent gdp 2010. to keep public debt sustainable level bi central bankers’ speech 3 midterm, fiscal deficit equal low 2 percent gdp. in regard, even though reduction needed, say consolidation underway fiscal deficit reach 2.9 percent gdp 2011 expect 2.6 percent gdp 2012. it worth mention first month new government congress pass two legal provision aim strengthen fiscal revenue sustainable path. the legal provision include modification tax also specific provision strengthen tax administration power fight tax evasion smuggling. despite increase public debt recent years, total debt gdp ratio still critical values. we expect action take strengthen fiscal revenue sustainable way contribute stabilize ratio sustainable levels. give uncertainty remain global economic prospect i would say three main policy challenge currently face policy makers: the first one anchor inflation expectation midterm target. this mean central bank stand ready take necessary measure address inflationary pressures, even context potential deterioration economic growth national level. this important downside risk growth materialize inflation expectation still midterm target, central bank room ease monetary policy support economic growth. the second main policy challenge secure fiscal sustainability medium term strengthen tax revenue implementation prudent fiscal policy reflect stabilization rise debt-to-gdp ratio reduction fiscal deficit level 2 percent gdp. this particularly crucial need restore fiscal maneuver short term order able address severe global economic downturn impact natural disaster fact likely happen guatemala among world’s vulnerable country experience natural disasters. secure fiscal sustainability issue reduce public expenditure besides high fiscal rigidities; guatemala important infrastructure social need need address order foster sustainable economic growth. this drive third main policy challenge foster sustainable economic growth uncertain international environment. to address challenge commitment need government mainly private sector well civil society. a i already mentioned, work do build strategic alliance competitiveness agenda integrate policy agenda foreign trade, competitiveness investment endorse private sector. in addition, effort initiate previous government regard specific program address poverty creation opportunity vulnerable group take new administration well specific action address high level crime violence also affect sustainable economic growth. some action render benefit medium term, mean time main contribution monetary fiscal policy would preserve macroeconomic stability maintain soundness financial system key address adverse shock past well create solid basis achieve sustainable economic growth. a conclusion, allow summarise follow points:  a discuss day different forums, economy are, again, vulnerable external shock arise regions.  even though make significant improvements, particularly regard strengthen economic fundamental economies, reflect low volatility main macroeconomic price include low inflation rates, 4 bi central bankers’ speech strengthen financial systems, sound fiscal balances, improvement productivity on, exempt, future, experience kind shock end affect economic financial variable important well populations.  a policy makers, responsibility preserve economic fundamental come policy action may reduce negative impact, even good could make economy le vulnerable effects.  in context, i glad look forward discussion challenge may come specific policy action may need future address challenges. thank much attention. bi central bankers’ speech 1 ben s bernanke: open remark speech mr ben s bernanke, chairman board governor federal reserve system,

matthew elderfield: european bank regulation eurozone crisis address mr matthew elderfield, deputy governor central bank ireland alternate chairman european bank authority, 4th cdu/csu congress bundestag, berlin, 26 march 2012. * * * these remark author personal view necessarily reflect eba esrb, mr elderfield member general council. thank invitation join today discus european bank regulation. in brief time open remark i would like three things: explain action european bank authority (eba) take address eurozone financial crisis; discus limit regulatory action due feedback loop characteristic crisis suggest two three area explore improve current policy response crisis. the formation eba start 2011 significant milestone development european regulation single market banking. the eba different predecessor three important ways. first, action policy-maker mean single european rule book become reality directly bind eu banks. second, remit supervisory convergence direct operational responsibility – role college supervisor – make increasingly influential supervision work grind national authorities. and third, responsibility crisis management mean forefront important regulatory challenge day. this has, course, case current eurozone financial crisis, first series stress test and, recently, recommendation create temporary capital buff strengthen european bank system. it important remember eba’s action capital take response market concern also call strengthen capital lead international european policy makers. last autumn new manage director imf european systemic risk board, comprise eu’s central bank regulators, make strong call increase capital level europe’s banks. eba’s chairman, andrea enria, show strong leadership respond concern craft new initiative capital adopt eba’s members. construct correctly calibrate regulatory measure involve bank capital extremely challenge current financial crisis. this principally negative feedback loop bank sector, sovereign debt real economy. there two dimension feedback loop problem: procyclicality – interaction bank lend real economy – backstop burden – interaction bank recapitalisation sovereign debt sustainability. procyclicality phenomenon bank capital rule exacerbate business cycle encourage lend time growth contract time recession. basel 3 aim build countercyclical buff lean wind good time ease help growth bad times. we evidently bad time now, intriguingly prompt consider whether fact start release buffer. indeed, could probably run basel countercyclical buff methodology plausible assumption get conclusion many country well past point buff would released. the problem, course, buff place ease and, indeed, still strengthen capital require basel 3. in addition, market expectation capital faster. where can, bank respond race meet new basel standard well ahead five year 2 bi central bankers’ speech transitional period. in respect, regulator give – transitional period ease impact new rule – market take away. a fair mind regulator acknowledge concern identify industry time ago. all consideration lead eba careful design buff two respects. we make clear calculate capital buff determination sovereign debt exposure would fix one point time, advantage therefore incentive dispose sovereign debt holdings. and provide tight guideline limit capacity bank meet capital requirement deleveraging activity – reduce lend – would hurt real economy. we see banks’ plan meet eba’s aggregate €115 billion requirement. the assessment encouraging, banks’ provide margin error, limit deleveraging plan overwhelmingly require minimum meet new capital rather reduce assets. however, eba course monitor development closely. where go next term policy responses? the european bank regulators’ room manoeuvre fact constrain two dimension negative feedback loop problem. the central dilemma microprudential regulator capital good thing – macroprudential perspective concern fast get cost. perhaps safe course action, then, breathe space term initiative capital front. the eba’s decision postpone next stress test exercise 2013 therefore sensible development. there also argument breathe space let political decision sovereign debt crisis fully implemented, respect fiscal discipline build firewall adequate resource sufficient operational flexibility. indeed, happen, sustain positive impact, could eventually give scope eba revisit necessity full scale current capital buffer. i would like see use breathe space wisely consider future design stress test operational flexibility firewall structures. it seem role stress test diagnostic tool need reasserted. recent eu stress test evolve might describe “capital shortfall” calculation: set single scenario specially create threshold effectively prescribe additional capital even require eu law basel rules. interestingly, u stress test focus dividend share repurchase approval rather close capital gap prescribe timeline. the eu stress test approach therefore addition – potentially cut across – new basel 3 minimum capital requirement come anyway. also, i fear try satisfy insatiable market expectation conservatism stress test risk procyclical. stress test originally conceive diagnostic tools, consider range scenario provide basis management supervisory judgement, rather automatic capital formula. give introduction basel 3 already require increase capital light change balance risk procyclical regulatory action, would sensible recalibrate european approach stress test next period. what second negative feedback problem i mentioned, might describe “backstop burdens”. the problem country sovereign debt concern need borrow recapitalise banks, harm debt sustainability therefore exacerbate euro crisis, impact real economy feed back banks. a former u treasury secretary colourfully speak need bazooka – big gun – sort crisis, mean use vast amount money convince market problem solved. but country debt problems, need borrow afford ammunition bazooka debt sustainability position get worse. the room manoeuver ever tough capital bi central bankers’ speech 3 standard therefore constrained. in respect, feedback loop break investment, rather borrowing, outside loop. thus, debate around firewall structure normally sensitive issue size, i would suggest sufficient operational flexibility new mechanism equally important objective. find mechanism investment bank system without add sovereign debt must surely desirable policy goal consider carefully. this might do european firewall mechanism structures. i interest report comment hans-peter keitel, president federation german industries, benefit investment (rather loan to) debtor country greece. this seem sensible initiative developed. investment stress bank system would help break feedback loop provide commercial opportunity time. let conclude acknowledge good work do european bank authority current crisis. but let u also recognise limit action regulatory capital address crisis. we use breathe space refine policy instrument hand way help break feedback loop much damage member state eurozone. bi central bankers’ speech 1 benoît cœuré: the monetary policy european central bank speech mr benoît cœuré, member executive board european central bank, barclays’ european conference, tokyo, 26 march 2012. * * * introduction it pleasure barclays’ european conference tokyo. today i would like provide simple yet comprehensive description ecb’s action crisis. face severe turbulence, central bank take measure real time switch central bank “standard operate mode” “risk control crisis management” mode. we keep eye fix objective. this help u stay course provide continuity. i start present simplistic model monetary policy transmission. this sequence event central banks’ decision transmit economic magnitude impact people’s welfare. i review effectiveness ecb’s monetary policy prior financial crisis, transmission mechanism function accord textbook definitions. this period tranquil, economically speaking, although macroeconomic imbalance quietly build beneath surface. i portray crisis create break transmission mechanism. the crisis however that: point fear whole financial system would stop functioning. but i analyse perspective implication chain event monetary policy action depends. here, i argue standard tool central bank – change short-term interest rate – lose potency sudden unravel imbalance threaten financial stability impair transmission mechanism. but i also claim new untested instrument deploy largely replace standard monetary policy interventions. this perhaps relevant lesson draw crisis. monetary policy transmission let briefly elaborate transmission mechanism monetary policy. you see slide 2 monetary transmission mechanism important central banks. the ecb statutory objective price stability, define year-on-year positive inflation rate 2%. within range, govern council aim inflation rate far 2%. we say: “an inflation rate below, close to, 2%”. however, order exert influence agents’ decision affect price inflation, ecb start top chart try reach bottom. the path connect two extreme – start policy interest rate ecb control monetary policy operation – long convoluted. this transmission mechanism: long uncertain chain event various asset price react action take ecb – top layer decision chart – change overnight rate bank lend money market. long-term interest rate form important link chain. aggregate demand function credit market conditions, credit market condition function medium long-term interest rates: interest rate mortgages, non-financial corporations’ loan fund long-term investment projects, on. the interest rate channel monetary policy specific transmission path – mark orange – start overnight rate ecb manipulate policy operations; work way long-term rates. 2 bi central bankers’ speech the first equation next slide [3] describe long-term interest rate overnight rate connected. long-term rate ( ilt) reflect average expect overnight rate set monetary policy (which indicate itmp) plus premium reward long-term investment lenders’ exposure uncertainty ( prt). to influence long-term interest rate central bank two levers. these lever correspond two term right-hand side equation (1). the first term parenthesis denote component long-term interest rate determine expectation policy rate. basic arbitrage condition ensure financial reward long-dated security today ( ilt) least large average financial return investor expect reap hold short-dated security roll many period maturity long-dated security. the central bank act expectations. it anchor current future policy rate level – solidly incorporate agents’ expectation – conducive price stability. this central bank’s first lever transmission process. the way central bank influence expectation policy behaviour face macroeconomic shock critical here. it work credibility central bank’s governance way central bank see – month month – react systematically change economy. in way, agent start internalise systematic behaviour expectations. but process – easy sound – fact complex reversible. no policy rule macro-model justice complexity interactions. so, sake clarity i use stylise policy rule state equation number two slide. accord simplistic representation, central bank change overnight policy interest rate consider two conditions. first, consider whether inflation expect line level consistent quantitative definition price stability. here term (e tπ t+1 – π*) denote difference expect inflation steady state value, case close 2%: inflation expectation exceed objective, central bank – thing equal – likely raise policy rate. a second factor influence policy stance monetary conditions. if volume money credit create financial intermediary exceed trend consistent price stability long run, central bank also expect increase policy rate, excess money credit creation herald risk price stability. in simple policy rule, excess money credit growth denote mt. the coefficient α λ capture strength central bank’s reaction. this course simplify model full representation ecb decision-making include broad set variable lead indicator future inflation. if consistently follow through, policy behaviour – rule – resist inflationary pressure counter exuberance monetary sector anchor expectation inflation and, channel, future path policy rate. ultimately, anchor contribute low steady long-term rates. i mention risk premium. the second lever central bank operate try influence long-term rate via risk premium, prt. now, risk premium decompose three elements, state third equation slide. two element reflect macroeconomic uncertainty – measure variance inflation variance real economic activity. if variance inflation variance real growth large, quantum macroeconomic uncertainty high, lender charge high premium long-term finance remuneration risk. the quantum macroeconomic uncertainty premium compensate influence central bank. by avoid erratic behaviour – again, follow steady predictable pattern reaction evolve state economy – central bank push volatility system contribute low premium. bi central bankers’ speech 3 but premium include third element beyond control central bank. i’m call component “d”, associate credit default risk. but i’ll leave “d” factor aside i come back end. measure performance how well ecb manage transmission mechanism macroeconomy? since inception single currency ecb fulfil price stability mandate. take long-term average performance indicator, inflation rate euro area average basis point 2%. you see exact evolution time slide [4]. the slight overshoot relative aim – close to, below, 2% – due recent renew pressure volatile component price basket. it certainly remain within strict tolerance bands. simultaneously, ecb manage compress volatility inflation euro area. slide 5 show breakdown volatility headline inflation volatility core inflation central bank influence medium term – solid yellow bar – volatility food energy price – blue grey respectively. the left-hand chart indicate result euro area. you see since launch euro, overall inflation volatility decrease despite substantial increase energy food price volatility. during period time, inflation volatility u actually increased, drop core inflation volatility offset surge variance introduce energy inflation. do systematic compression inflation volatility come price erratic real activity? let move next slide [6]. here, dot represent major economy: give information standard deviation inflation standard deviation output growth economy experience since 1999. in space, want close possible zero. why? because lower-left part chart populate economy low macroeconomic instability, i.e. low inflation volatility low growth volatility. indeed, see euro area close zero economy except one, switzerland – dot left. the low variance inflation rate euro area come expense unsteady economic growth. low macroeconomic volatility mean low long-term interest rate low inflation compensation financial contracts. my next slide [7] illustrate standard technique disentangle long-term euro area bond yield premia remunerate investor risk bear long-dated securities.1 two fact noteworthy. the first fact steep decline – since pre-monetary union time – nominal yield pay average euro area government borrow ten-year maturity. this blue line chart. the second fact steep fall ten-year yield result three component determine nominal interest rates: real rate, inflation expectation – compensate investor average expect inflation life security – inflation risk premium – compensate investor inflation volatility. the real rate red line, two risk premia visible wedge nominal real rate. borrow money euro area cheap today – real nominal term – decade half ago, low cost borrow largely relate le uncertain predictable macroeconomy. the euro area stable economy, static one. my next slide [8] show real per caput income progression euro area u since 1999. contrary long-standing beliefs, euro area’s dynamism lag us. 1 see garcía, j.a. t. werner (2010), “inflation risk inflation risk premia,” ecb work paper no 1162. 4 bi central bankers’ speech i would conclude euro guardian, ecb, make solid contribution low stable borrow conditions, – channel – moderate fluctuation economic prosperity. the data i show fact even noteworthy, since cover long difficult upheaval suffer financial market demise lehman brother fall 2008. i would like consider particular period. the first phase crisis the financial panic follow lehman’s collapse undermine ability market price financial assets. the result turmoil disrupt mechanism which, normal times, central bank use transmit policy signal broad economy. the interest rate channel cease operate (see slide [9]). the impact policy rate interest pay security different maturity via expectation control weakened: visible left-hand chart slide [10]. the euro area money market freeze – show surge cross-sectional standard deviation overnight rate across member states. (see right-hand chart slide 10). bank locate different jurisdiction could long obtain liquidity unsecured money market comparable costs. likewise, part euro area bank system problem obtain long-term fund financial markets. slide 11 show result ecb’s bank lend survey 2008. throughout 2008, increasingly year elapsed, bank report difficulty access wholesale market virtually maturities, short-term money market le affected. to address downside risk price stability, ecb respond shock forceful application standard policy tool, many central banks. we reduce policy rate all-time low 1%. (see slide 12). at time, disappearance market arbitrage challenge interest rate action could tackle full. we therefore start act market maker play intermediation role market unwilling unable perform. we try get round obstruction face standard transmission mechanism follow new route, liquidity channel. (see slide 13). it work confidence-boosting measure: enough central bank liquidity would forthcoming case market liquidity dry up. our system – centre overnight term credit banks, rather outright purchase security – tailor-made use instrument fend bank crisis. in event, flexible enough activated, limit adjustments, emergency conditions. we tackle collapse private arbitrage, mean market could distribute liquidity across institution time. this rationale two main feature extraordinary credit support. the full, unlimited accommodation banks’ demand central bank credit policy interest rate step breach inter-bank lend collapsed. the extension central bank credit provision long maturities, one year june 2009, replace market inter-temporal trading, largely disappeared. (see slide 14). important design structure euro area, small medium-sized enterprise particularly important growth job creation bank provide financing. the importance bank flow credit real economy euro area see (slide 15). fully accommodate overall high liquidity need bank alleviate bank fund stress is, therefore, essential support wide economy. equally important design institutional set-up euro area – comprise 17 sovereign state share single currency. offer unlimited liquidity discretion bank make possible target exactly part bank system subject particularly high fund stress. this, turn, contribute uniform bi central bankers’ speech 5 cross-border transmission household business throughout euro area enjoy credit condition largely homogeneous. the impact action evident [slide 16]; show eurosystem balance sheet consequence increase lend assistance counterparties. a see, actual liquidity demand exceed level necessary minimum reserve requirement purposes: look significant volume cash deposit overnight ecb counterparties liability side balance sheet. the measure stabilise economy. slide 17 depict economy’s plunge lehman shock, bell-shaped distribution market forecast year 2009 gdp growth rate revise downward one update next annual percentage points.2 this unprecedented experience ecb national central banks. from second half 2009, growth prospect resume macroeconomic uncertainty – measure dispersion forecast distribution – decline significantly. the density become “thinner” large probability mass concentrate around mean, mean growth forecast turn positive. the second phase crisis a i mention already, “d” factor loose end transmission mechanism. it important determinant long-term interest rates. but control central bank. (see slide 18). between october 2009 may 2010 “d” factor – remain dormant long time monetary union – become destabilised. fiscal sustainability concern exacerbate credit risk perception prompt investor seek high credit risk compensation. the debt market sovereign issuer precarious fiscal condition find attack. start summer 2011, market distress spread broadly. in end, massive credit risk re-appreciation take place affect bank non-bank borrow pervasive effect viability transmission mechanism. banks’ creditworthiness measure via cd premia correlate strongly lend country stress (see slide 19, left-hand chart). at times, correlation reinforce perception government bore significant contingent liability link “too-big-to-fail” financial institutions. in response stress fund condition anticipation worsen macroeconomic outlook, bank tighten credit supply standard sharply.3 (see slide 19, right-hand chart). once more, private financial intermediation threatened. in money market, confidence rapidly drain away trade become rare. the market government paper seriously impaired. it background that, may 2010, ecb announce intervention debt markets. a focus phase preserve normal condition asset price market securities, call policy “securities market programme”. among fixed-income securities, government bond important three reasons. first, low liquidity uncertain price government bond degrade effect value acceptability collateral use secure finance. the grow role secure lend financial market mean financial intermediation would suffer enormously paralysis sovereign bond transactions. second, sharply low bond price cause significant loss portfolio financial non-financial institutions. 2 forecast base different vintage eurozone barometer forecast results. 3 see ecb bank lend survey october 2011 january 2012, http://www.ecb.int/stats/money/surveys/ lend/html/index.en.html 6 bi central bankers’ speech for banks, would reduce ability provide loan economy. third, interest rate government bond influence level interest rate firm pay issue bond bank use price loans. government bond yield basis price assets, fixed-income instrument equity. the decision intervene decision support discovery price market key transmit policy intention become highly dysfunctional. a tension grow summer autumn 2011, strengthen response further. (see slide 20). in first three-year longer-term refinance operation december last year provide around €489 billion stable fund 523 bank euro area. in second one – conduct 29 february year – supply €530 billion 800 banks. both long-term credit operation aim break vicious circle sovereign fund stress impede bank access longer-term finance ultimately disrupt flow credit household companies. it’s worth note second operation reach much wide group bank – among many small bank provide fund specifically small medium-sized enterprises. it effect heighten expand range collateral, particularly facilitate participation small medium-sized banks. importantly, risk relate expansion collateral mitigate stringent risk control measures. for instance, haircut additional credit claim high make riskiness additional credit claim rest collateral, haircut lower. we confident wide participation bank lead broad dissemination credit small medium-sized borrowers. the right half picture show impact new measure eurosystem’s balance sheet. (see slide 21). at present, see encouraging, albeit early, sign normalisation across financial market segments. broad money growth increase january, loan growth private sectors. we also see low stock market volatility (slide 22, left-hand chart). money market credit spread edge low recently (slide 22, right-hand chart). similarly, corporate bond credit spread financial non-financial enterprise decrease (slide 23). these development remain confirm closely monitor them. i want stress one important principle guide u consistently, particularly second phase crisis. we try influence “d” factor: could possibly do so. the “d” factor originate elsewhere, outside monetary policy sphere influence. it role ecb cure root cause malaise: weak fiscal institution concern fiscal sustainability, reinforce diverge competitiveness among euro area country low growth potential wide range country due delay structural reforms. monetary policy cannot substitute sustainable fiscal policies, structural reform adequate governance. these policy indeed remit governments. government remain inactive – contribute normalisation. some take important step towards address root cause market malfunctioning. collectively, euro area level, several initiative way implemented. i would like mention recent one regard euro area governance. the so-called “six-pack” introduce macroeconomic surveillance procedure detect correct divergence early stage. fiscal surveillance strengthen procedure correction make automatic dependable. a so-called “fiscal compact” introduce fiscal rule bind national legislation. in pipeline so-called “two-pack” expect strengthen surveillance mechanism euro area even might become first step towards fully-fledged fiscal union. fiscal federation impose strict control regional budget basis – condition – build mechanism cross-regional financial solidarity. this route euro area government follow now. bi central bankers’ speech 7 structural reform promote growth job creation ease pressure government finance. similarly – recommend european bank authority – build-up capital buff bank reassure market resilience bank system create condition stable financial industry europe. strong fiscal institution combine reform boost long-term growth competitiveness euro area economy resilient bank system right way address “d” factor. the overarch principle guide monetary policy know monetary policy cure structural economic malaise one overarch principle guide central banks. equally important price stability – clear override objective – well central bank independence credibility. let elaborate principle support ecb’s monetary policy recent times. independence essential central banks, particularly period sovereign fund stress. whenever state finance unsustainable, likelihood government exert pressure central bank monetise debt increases. in monetary union found monetary independence clear mandate central bank, temptation rule out. in union, shock "d" factor even desirable collateral effects. they provide incentive sovereign pursue sustainable state finance undertake necessary structural reforms. switch mechanism would weaken incentive conduct right economic policies. monetary policy commit price stability conduct independently credibly deliver low inflation rate also contribute financial stability. i deliberately use word “contribute” price stability necessary insufficient condition financial stability. financial stability joint outcome of:  sound prudential regulation, supervision oversight financial intermediaries, financial market financial market infrastructures,  sound macroeconomic policy – comprise monetary policy fiscal policy. nevertheless, contribution financial stability significant. in particular, timely exit non-standard measure return le accommodative policy stance – economic condition ripe – essential several reasons. first, monetary policy accommodation prolong period time might fuel excessive risk-taking, leverage asset price bubbles. second, might discourage banks, company government strengthen balance sheet therefore create dependence low rates. let develop exit take place. all ecb’s crisis-response measure involve liquidity provision long horizon share important feature: credit grant low adjustable rate. we already explicit fact exact interest rate long-term liquidity determine ex post, equal average policy rate prevail life respective open market operation. we also give bank option reverse long-term repurchase operation advance, one year, condition warrant long maturity central bank credit long place. in case, withdraw ample liquidity create side effect long-term operation whenever govern council deem liquidity condition excessive view outlook price stability. all tool necessary large-scale liquidity withdrawal already place readily available needed. this consistent monetary policy strategy. it emphasis monitor monetary credit developments, link financial imbalance threat price stability long horizons. it ensure symmetric policy respect 8 bi central bankers’ speech financial misalignment “leaning wind” monetary trend signal inflationary pressure beyond standard conjunctural analysis macroeconomic project imply.4 conclusion in conclusion, i return i started: transmission mechanism stability-oriented strategy influence multiple path (see slide 24). the important link long chain monetary policy strategy. clarity objective key indicator anchor expectation empower monetary policy decisions. a know, adjustment expectation amplify action take credible central bank. our strategy support mechanism normal times. in crisis times, market cease transmit price signals, tool change. the eurosystem’s response timely; non-standard measure temporary tailor special feature euro area. our tool change strategy – fact support gradual process normalisation. the euro area economic monetary union (emu). it monetary pillar perform well far continue work future. the economic pillar considerably strengthened. the new fiscal framework promptly ratify forcefully implement leadership european commission; complement, growth initiative welcome, insofar address long-term growth potential. 4 see fahr, s., r. motto, m. rostagno, f. smets o. tristani (2011) “lessons monetary policy strategy recent past” in “approaches monetary policy revisit – lesson

derivative reference private-label mortgage-backed security hold poor quality subprime alt-a mortgage multiply amount gain loss financial system. there loss actual mortgages, also cd link mortgage otc derivative market. this increase stress system reference subprime alt-a mortgage begin perform poorly. moreover, structural characteristic over-the-counter derivative market amplify shock create house bust several ways. first, collateral call generate sharp movement mark-to-market value otc derivative trade drain liquidity buff provoke fire sale assets. these fire sale increase volatility provoke

also tend drain liquidity trouble dealer dealer often use counterparty cash collateral fund operations. when customer move 2 bi central bankers’ speech business, collateral balance depart worsen fund crunch trouble dealers. third, large counterparty, lehman brothers, file bankruptcy, could long meet obligations. the claim lehman’s customers, include open otc derivative position lehman owe money, frozen. the lack adequate segregation customers’ asset lehman estate inability move outstanding obligation dealer – refer lack portability – create large problem lehman’s counterparties. often lehman’s client position one side trade execute lehman frozen, offset side remain open expose volatile financial markets. this asymmetry contribute sharp increase market volatility, dramatic reduction market liquidity, impairment market function follow lehman failure. fear could happen another firm failed, encourage flight dealer perceive market participant relatively weak might large potential exposures. of course, bad enough, opaqueness otc derivative market make situation much worse. no one clear insight financial health counterparties. although market participant could calculate bilateral exposure particular dealer particular dealer could understand exposure counterparties, didn’t answer broad question: expose client dealer others financial system derivative trade open positions? because easy way know difficulty not, incentive side assume bad – close open trades, hoard liquidity, retreat sidelines. the crisis make crystal clear regulatory regime keep pace rapid growth global otc derivative market. in assess shortcoming otc derivative market crisis, global consensus reached. although i over-simplifying interest time, i view follow aspect reform important. first, strong incentive system – capital requirement bank security dealer – provide impetus dealer standardize otc derivative trade whenever practical. the goal few bespeak trade standardize trades. second, g20 leader agree standardize otc derivative trade mandatorily clear ccps end 2012. third, record otc derivative trade – include bilateral bespeak trade – must report trade repositories. the data part report requirement would include key trade attribute legal entity identifier aggregate exposure could readily calculated. fourth, two standard-setting body mention early – cps iosco – would strengthen broaden principle financial market infrastructures. fifth, principle would adopt globally, strengthen resilience financial system. the logic behind five element reform go like this: standardize trade improve transparency price discovery. this mitigate opaqueness help generate illiquidity loss market function evident crisis. require trade clear ccps design reduce aggregate amount risk system. that gross exposure net dealer clear one common central clear party. in ccp framework, bilateral exposure dealer one another replace single set claim ccp. the idea dealer likely long trade one dealer short trade dealers, pass set trade single ccp reduce aggregate amount risk system. this would occur long trade net short trades, leave remain small net exposure dealer ccp. bi central bankers’ speech 3 insert ccp two counterparties trade also help reduce “run risk” face potentially trouble dealer. a saw crisis, market participant often abruptly pull trade away dealer perceive weak, turn self-fulfilling effect magnify market liquidity pressure dealer. if, however, trade dealer clear ccp, direct exposure dealer eliminate replace exposure ccp itself. this risk shift reduce incentive suddenly halt trade dealer, example, due uncertainty dealer’s financial condition future prospects. mandatory report trade trade repository design ensure detail contract preserve available regulatory authorities. finally, fact ccps central system dramatically increase importance. in essence, global ccps systemically important. thus, system safe sufficient ensure trade standardize mandate clear ccps, also necessary ccps “bullet proof.” they ability perform meet obligation regardless degree stress financial system even one participant fail disorderly manner. hence, compel need tough principle broadly enforced. in addition, ensure work well practice theory, financial stability board, cps iosco, regulatory authority emphasize importance four safeguard ensure mandatory, standardize clear ccps make financial system robust resilient. the first safeguard oversight global ccps need cooperative – involve security regulator central bank country ccp operate (the home country) country ccp may systemically important. global ccps likely establish – already run – clear different type otc derivative interest rate swaps, credit default swaps, commodity-based swap trade around world, solely within one country cross-border basis. many regulator important stake ensure global ccp meet obligations. in addition regulator country ccp headquartered, include foreign regulators. these regulator may interest party many reasons. for example, currency may use settle obligation ccp, may counterparties ccp headquarter significant amount business country, may fmis link ccp. i want emphasize effective cooperative oversight essential. otherwise, risk system become overly fragmented, proliferation national ccps. in case, many risk-reducing benefit ccps could lose severely attenuated. that few offset position would likely clear particular ccp would reduce scope reduce large gross exposure much small net positions. the second safeguard ensure fair, open safe access global fmis around world. it important, example, global ccps rule exclusionary unnecessarily entrench position whatever dealer, firm, fmi currently dominant market. the third safeguard establish rule ensure that, major market participant fail, ccp liquefy collateral quickly meet obligation timely way. but also need do way would disrupt financial market ccp’s participants. a i discus shortly, although may potential role central bank here, ccps, minimum, must liquidity resource first line defense. 4 bi central bankers’ speech fourth, need viable resolution regime ccps. this need ensure ccp either recapitalized recover or, necessary, wind orderly way without disrupt provision essential market services. also, resolution regime necessary ensure central bank might lend ccp extremis repaid. to help ensure safeguard met, major part reform effort establish strong set principle financial market infrastructures. these principle must embody four safeguard ensure infrastructure withstand stress could plausibly occur. the process develop set principle begin two year ago near completion. so new principle embody? during crisis, financial market infrastructure perform well. in fact, fmis actually source strength. they enable market participant settle obligation come due timely way. also, robustness give confidence market participant could continue trade, know transaction would almost certainly settle clear without difficulty. despite excellent record performance period unprecedented stress, still room improvement. first, future stress could severe might come different forms. this could expose vulnerability fmis have, now, visible. also, extraordinary intervention crisis backstop market function rescue key financial intermediary may prevent stress level reach point fmis couldn’t perform functions. because assurance intervention necessarily occur future, important stability fmi architecture depend timely extraordinary interventions. second, new regime central clear standardize otc derivative trades, role fmis become even important future. moreover, new regime lead development new type fmis. ccps otc derivative become widespread – trade repository established. principle need underpin new institutional arrangements. third, fmis resilient would undoubtedly need ability access central bank services, include lender last resort function. but, fmis access services, would create moral hazard. the best way address conundrum hold fmis tough global standards. fourth, strong good system fmi governance oversight help ensure system support global market subject consistent standard regardless jurisdiction operate. rely solely patchwork differ national standard global world would work well. it would encourage business migrate low standard. without establish global floor, would otherwise “race bottom.” these major reason cps iosco take task strengthen broaden standard fmis. there two major goal effort. the first goal strengthen current standard by: 1) raise bar exist standard governance, credit risk, liquidity risk, collateral margin requirements; 2) include requirement new area segregation portability, general business risk, links, tiering disclosure; 3) extend coverage include trade repositories. a propose consultation document, principle significantly strengthen exist requirement fmi’s governance financial resources. one way principle require fmis take comprehensive proactive view role play, risk face, potential support stability broad financial system. in particular, market become even interconnected, fmis must approach bi central bankers’ speech 5 governance risk management holistically, manner consistent grow importance global market stakeholder serve. regard fmi’s financial standards, important prepare handle even great potential disruption extreme market conditions. for example, fmi must cover large current credit exposure single participant pre-crisis standards, principle would require fmi collateralize current credit exposure participants. furthermore, ccps face potential future credit exposure open contract guarantee, principle impose rigorous stress test strengthen margin default fund requirements. these requirement guard wide range possible stress scenario extreme plausible market conditions. the principle also raise bar fmi’s management liquidity risk ensure systemically important payment obligation settle time. for instance, size potential liquidity need event participant default, fmi sufficient liquid resource cover shortfall cause default individual legal entity settle directly fmi, also shortfall could arise failure affiliate direct participant. in addition, fmis need address potential uncover liquidity shortfall credit loss would allocated, fmi would replenish financial resource us stress event continue operate safe sound manner. the principle also introduce number new requirements. some address shortcoming observe crisis. for example, principle require ccps segregation portability arrangement protect customer position collateral. an fmi also require manage risk bear pose to, participant customers, also entity business link fmis, settlement banks, custody banks, liquidity providers. furthermore, principle require fmis establish dedicate financial cushion could absorb unanticipated general business losses. this ensure fmi continue provide critical services. the principle also require fmis plan recapitalization orderly wind down, prove necessary. finally, coverage international standard expand trade repository new category fmi, complement g-20 otc derivative initiative mandatory trade reporting. the principle address trade repository focus transparency disclosure market data. this reflect important unique role play disseminate information regulator market broadly. the second major goal promote consistent global enforcement standards. toward end, principle unify harmonize three exist set standard – core principle systemically important payment systems; recommendation security settlement systems; recommendation central counterparties. a part effort, principle strengthen “responsibilities authorities.” this include new framework cooperation among financial authorities. it call central banks, market regulators, relevant authority cooperate other, domestically internationally, support fulfil respective mandate promote safety efficiency fmis. this build upon exist framework already use successfully cps iosco effective cooperation oversight global institutions. such cooperation facilitate comprehensive oversight, improve efficiency effectiveness, reduce eliminate gap regulation, supervision, oversight, minimize potential duplication effort burden fmis cooperate authorities. toward goal consistent global enforcement, principle consider minimum requirements. in contrast, three old set guidance weaker, recommendation rather requirements. a recommendations, could ignored. in contrast, principle make clear, country member cps iosco 6 bi central bankers’ speech apply principle “the full extent possible.” this mean regulation legal framework adjust need order accommodate standards. to ensure happens, cps iosco also develop disclosure assessment regimes. the purpose facilitate consistent set disclosure different fmis consistent set assessment methodology use relevant international institutions, namely international money fund world bank, relevant national authority fmis domicile jurisdictions. when principle publish next month, cps iosco also issue disclosure regime proposal assessment regime proposal. these put forward 60-day consultation period give market participants, fmis, regulator opportunity comment. also, principle roll country start implement legal regulatory change necessary put principle practice, anticipate cps iosco undertake monitor effort see going. the focus evaluate quickly broadly principle embed national legal regulatory frameworks. the principle important support g20 strategy mandatory clear standardize otc derivative trade ensure four safeguard discuss early global ccps fmis implemented. a i mention earlier, new principle lay responsibility authority cooperative oversight. cooperation take variety forms, include formal arrangement organize memoranda understandings, specific protocol documentation exchange critical information, informal arrangement regular ad hoc communications. much work currently underway establish various form effective cooperation, particularly individual ccps trade repository become globally important. however, work toward meet g-20 commitment continues, much work need design implement arrangement relevant fmis. in term issue access, explicit requirement fmis embed principles. the principle establish framework cover access direct participants, indirect participant – i.e., trade indirectly direct participant, access link fmis. in term lender last resort issue, principle strengthen requirement fmis term aspect financial strength capital liquidity, operational business risk. this imply enforcement principle significantly mitigate moral hazard issue could arise fmi able obtain credit central bank. on resolution, principle contain explicit requirement ensure systemically important fmis viable recovery plan and, circumstance ever warrant, could wind orderly fashion without disruption provision key services. the principles’ provision fmi’s recovery orderly wind inform upcoming work cpss-iosco potential role attribute official regime resolution fmis. this work underway complete late year. i’m please see already accomplished. but let’s clear, principle publish won’t end. to quote winston churchill, “the end beginning”. thereafter, resolution, disclosure assessment framework need finalize late year. the cps iosco member adopt new principle regulatory legal frameworks, target date year-end. the new principle put effect next year, fmis expect observe new principle shortly thereafter feasible. this obviously ambitious schedule, one fully consistent g20 leaders’ mandate. bi central bankers’ speech 7 finally, recognize global financial system complex one continuously evolve introduce many significant change system. we recognize may trade-off objectives, system may evolve way expect. there may unintended consequences. maybe major dealer standardize many trade desirable or, perhaps, ccps develop fragment manner net risk doesn’t occur extent potentially feasible. or development global ccps could unanticipated negative consequence market structure, competition and/or efficiency. we must open-minded potential need mid-course corrections. we need ensure incentive right get great amount risk reduce efficient manner. currently, example, evaluate change term basel capital liquidity standard bank interact change otc derivative regime term influence incentive standardize otc trade mandatory clear ccps. but shouldn’t kid – we’ll forecast. thus, must ready make adjustment process unfold learn more. a long regulators, fmis, market participant make effort, able make financial system much safer, resilient, transparent. the change train, properly executed, should, time, significantly reduce shortcoming otc derivative market exacerbate financial crisis. properly enact implemented, net exposure small net occur ccp process. transparency counterparty risk greatly improve via disclosure requirement ability aggregate trade information trade repositories, end user trade position much good protect segregation portability requirement robust financial market infrastructure. although still much part process, i’m optimistic right road. we need continue push ahead forget lesson learn financial crisis. thank kind attention. i would happy take questions. bi central bankers’ speech 1 narayana kocherlakota: on limit monetary policy executive summary mr narayana kocherlakota, president federal reserve bank minneapolis, 2nd annual hyman p minsky lecture, washington university, st louis, missouri, 20 march 2012. * * * slide original speech find federal reserve bank minneapolis’s website (http://www.minneapolisfed.org/news_events/pres/kocherlakota_minsky_speech_032012.pdf). since start great recession, employment fall considerably, average inflation near federal reserve’s target 2 percent. give federal reserve’s dual mandate promote price stability maximum employment, obvious question “why federal reserve appear much good one mandate other?” in speech, i present simple model suggest answer question. a key feature model two distinct type demand shocks: labor demand shock product demand shocks. the labor demand shock reflect factor adverse credit condition increase uncertainty lead firm demand few worker give real wage. the product demand shock reflect factor loss wealth high risk job loss lead household demand few good give real interest rate. each shock lead fall employment, decline employment magnify slow adjustment real wage. when consider shocks, important distinguish monetary non-monetary policy influence level output employment. in model i employ, federal reserve control real interest rate; low real interest rate increase demand good services, thereby influence national output employment. the first implication model monetary policy offset impact product demand shock employment, cannot offset employment loss due fall labor demand associate slow real wage adjustment. a result, level “maximum employment” achievable monetary policy le “full employment” labor resources. a second implication non-monetary policy specifically design stimulate demand worker (such government subsidy hiring) offset employment loss due labor demand shocks, accompany monetary easing. that is, monetary non-monetary policy must work concert reduce impact decline labor demand; neither alone. return question pose beginning, model suggest federal reserve perform well mandates. the federal reserve’s accommodative policy offset much impact product demand shock keep inflation near target. however, policy unable offset large adverse shock labor demand. the model imply that, term employment, limit monetary policy achieve own. bi central bankers’ speech 1 deepak mohanty: statistic reserve bank – reflection open remark mr deepak mohanty, executive director reserve bank india, annual statistic conference 2012 reserve bank india, chandigarh, 17 march 2012. * * * deputy governors, dr. subir gokarn dr. k. c. chakrabarty; distinguish statistician economist academia; regional director chandigarh; head select departments; shri a. b. chakraborty, officer-in-charge department statistic information management (dsim) friends. i extend warm welcome annual conference 2012 department statistic information management (dsim). for first time, conference organise outside reserve bank india (rbi) provide informal atmosphere bond brain storm need research conference like this. this conference provide platform officer dsim present research work expert receive feedback order make analysis meaningful policy research. i thank distinguish professor consent discus various paper present colleague dsim: prof. manoj panda (cess, hyderabad), prof. n. r. bhanumurthy (nipfp, new delhi), prof. subrata sarkar (igidr, mumbai), prof. surinder kumar (crrid, chandigarh), prof. mahajan (punjab university, chandigarh), prof. chetan ghate (isi delhi), prof. shalabh (iit kanpur). you bring together plenty expertise experience field theory practice statistical research economic policy make great value us. statistic method systematic learn observation experience practice centuries. india distinction start early compilation economic statistic analysis policy making. of late, however, concern quality economic statistics. this underscore need renew focus great organisational effort improve quality official statistics. statistic public good necessary empowerment citizens. today economic analysis statistical foundation. therefore, solid statistical ground soil hand data basic prerequisite make good empirical economist. this evident presence many eminent economist amongst u conference. actually, many renowned economist start career statisticians. for example, professor milton friedman, nobel laureate perhaps celebrate monetarist economist past century begin career statistician washington dc. nobel laureate simon kuznets present scientific approach macroeconomic analysis lay foundation national account statistics. central bank today challenge ever availability reliable timely information key effective policy making. a central bank, responsible generate various macro-financial statistic collect primary secondary source process implement policies. a reserve bank boast one large body statistician country, let start role statistician organisation highlight achievement challenge dsim. the statistician reserve bank perform multifarious role. dsim provide statistical service way collection, compilation, analysis dissemination information relate monetary, banking, corporate external sectors. another major area focus provide input policy formulation, conduct survey carry research activity conformity need bank. over years, widen scope spectrum data collection dissemination. a key achievement regard improvement bank’s web enable data warehouse, popular among researcher database indian economy (dbie). today various flagship data publication 2 bi central bankers’ speech bank like handbook statistic indian economy originate dbie. a large amount downloadable data make available public good near real time basis rbi website. i happy note user friendly version dbie release today. towards information management dissemination, system data submission online return file system (orfs) strengthened. at present, 40 return various department like dbod, dbs, fed, fmd, dp mpd submit use platform. at time, extensible business report language (xbrl) project standardisation report financial data make considerable progress year 42 return take implementation. during last one year, department make considerable progress identify fill data gaps. this include implementation coordinate direct investment survey (cdis), extension master office file (mof) population census economic census, development service price production index bank service, construction house price index, collation time series data rural wages1, system loan registration number (lrns) ecbs automatic route. the research activity department encompass economic measurement, analysis, model forecast economic growth, inflation, corporate performance macroeconomic indicator capture economic agents’ response expect macro development forward look monetary policy formulation. base various univariate multivariate models, growth inflation project path present form fan charts. with inflation run high rbi’s comfort level last two years, analysis growth-inflation trade-off carry department particularly useful calibrate monetary policy actions. the survey conduct department particularly macroeconomic change continue provide valuable input forward look monetary policy formulation. these include industrial outlook survey (ios), order books, inventory capacity utilisation survey (obicus), credit condition survey (crcs), inflation expectation survey household (iesh), consumer confidence survey (ccs) survey professional forecaster (spf).key find survey publish rbi website simultaneously macroeconomic monetary development every quarter. this increase visibility survey output improve considerably timeliness dissemination survey results. i sure availability survey public domain spur research areas. understand asset price development gain increase importance, especially global financial crisis. in context, department make considerable progress compile house price index (hpi) base registration price. the coverage increase nine city now. regional office dsim make important contribution towards this. further, order complement this, department introduce asset price monitor system (apms) base house loan account information available banks. financial stability analysis another important focus area rbi. i happy note department make important contribution area provide input financial stress indicator asset prices. notwithstanding achievements, let share challenge department go forward. first, wake financial crisis, quality timely availability statistic become essential. the information analytical requirement become diversify add emphasis financial stability. with structure monetary policy review become 1 base labour bureau data. bi central bankers’ speech 3 frequent, need high quality frequent forward look information increased. at time, application statistic solve operational issue gain increase importance. these development contribute demand train statistician across department bank. the department, second large pool statistician isi country, must rise occasion serve organisation better. second, central bank country, responsibility provide sizable part macro-financial statistics. our publication standard provide confidence data users. even secondary data like price statistics, user prefer consult rbi publications. therefore, responsibility maintain data quality, timeliness make data meaningful inevitably fall dsim. the department make great use technology validate improve data quality. third, survey macroeconomic change progress desire level satisfaction. we make begin collection data trade sector employment opportunity fresh graduates. but need expedite bring survey result soon. another important indicator provide early sign overall economic activity retail sales. a quarterly survey retail sale across city may initiate help regional offices. fourth, department involve various data gap statistical measurement issue participation various committee within outside rbi. one particular issue, receive renew attention across globe view complexity inflation dynamics, measurement price – commodity prices, consumer price asset prices. in recent years, great institutional effort improve measurement price india. we new cpi (rural, urban combined) now. the base wpi also revised. there is, however, considerable scope improve coverage report price data besides research measurement price inflation, term commodities/asset classes, stage production well various sector regions. now representative cpi series, institutional effort need direct towards compilation producer price index (ppi) well service price index. fifth, regional market intelligence statistical intelligence play pivotal role provide important input monetary policy making. for example, bank england (boe) establish regional statistical data collection system cover many 25 indicator include business conditions, price variation, labour employment. these different qualitative surveys. information collect analyse transform score form important input deliberation monetary policy committee (mpc) boe. india country significant regional variations. hence regional input valuable policy making. with reorganise structure envisage wide presence regional office major centres, department may put similar system gather relevant statistic market intelligence, particularly area price agricultural condition aid policy formulation national level. sixth, part on-going work dcm forecast demand currency coins, necessary conduct focus regional survey relate (i) availability/shortages coins/currency notes, (ii) regional practice usage currency notes, (iii) estimation counterfeit currency note system. in addition, regional office department could directly involve conduct survey financial inclusion, particularly assessment financial inclusion outcome village follow outreach programme bank. seventh, department noticeable presence number central office departments, like department external investment operation (deio), monetary policy department (mpd), internal debt management department (idmd), department information technology (dit), department payment settlement system (dpss), department bank supervision (dbs) financial stability unit (fsu). it desirable officer 4 bi central bankers’ speech department provide analytical input policy operational issue come research papers. these paper could present conference publish eventually rbi work paper series. this make research valuable further organisational objectives. eighth, focus determine approach research across various units, include regional offices, pursue research agenda adopt department accomplish timely manner. for data management dissemination, technology must harness full extent. there also need strengthen model forecast capability towards develop full fledge forecast suite include dsge models. finally, i congratulate department many achievements. however, challenge ahead, i draw attention. a note statistician john tukey observed, “an approximate answer right problem worth good deal exact answer approximate problem.” i see demand statistical skill statistic bank grow grapple many questions. i hope deliberation conference bring academic policy maker close lead strengthen statistical analysis system. i wish conference success. thank you. bi central bankers’ speech 1 daniel k tarullo: regulatory reform testimony mr daniel k tarullo, member board governor federal reserve system, committee banking, housing, urban affairs, u senate, washington dc, 22 march 2012. * * * chairman johnson, rank member shelby, member committee, thank opportunity testify implementation dodd-frank wall street reform consumer protection act 2010 (dodd-frank act) international implications. although bank regulation long include important international dimension, recent financial crisis bring renew attention, unite state abroad, interconnectedness among national financial market and, consequently, importance international cooperation safeguard markets. in recognition fact financial distress quickly dramatically cross national borders, seek protect financial system promote global adoption strong, common regulatory standard effective supervisory practices. such common standard practice also help prevent major competitive disadvantage u.s. firms. today i touch several aspect implementation dodd-frank act significant international implications: regulation systemically important financial institution (sifis), reform over-the-counter (otc) derivative market, number discrete issue arise work implement dodd-frank act. regulation sifis the dodd-frank act post-crisis international regulatory reform effort place great emphasis contain systemic risk potentially pose major financial institutions. the important point intersection include effort strengthen capital requirements, develop international quantitative liquidity standards, put place mechanism orderly resolution firms. capital regulation strong capital requirement remain cornerstone prudential regulation capital provide buff loss financial firm source activity. the best way safeguard taxpayer-funded bailouts future large financial institution adequate capital buffers, size reflect risk profile damage would do financial system institution fail. achievement aim require improvement traditional, firm-based approach capital regulation creation systemic, macroprudential, component capital regulation. with respect improve traditional approach capital regulation, international work common, global standard already quite advance time dodd-frank act enact july 2010. the so-called basel 2.5 agreement, strengthen market risk capital requirement basel ii, already finished. just month dodd-frank act enacted, agreement reach basel iii reforms, require improvement quality regulatory capital, increase quantity minimum require capital, maintenance capital conservation buffer, – first time internationally – compliance minimum leverage ratio. in come months, bank agency finalize regulation implement basel 2.5 unite state propose regulation implement basel iii unite states. 2 bi central bankers’ speech with respect macroprudential capital regulation, section 165 dodd-frank act mandate board establish enhance risk-based capital standard large bank hold company would graduate base relative systemic importance companies. consistent requirement, espouse proposal basel committee capital surcharge world’s largest, interconnect bank organization base global systemic importance. last year, agreement reach framework surcharges, implement transition period applicable basel iii. the board’s aim fashion enhance capital requirement section 165 associate international framework simultaneous congruent manner. both dodd-frank act provision basel systemic surcharge framework motivate fact failure systemically important firm would dramatically great negative consequence financial system economy failure firms. strict capital requirement systemically important firm also benefit help offset fund advantage firm derive perceive status too-big-to-fail provide incentive firm reduce systemic footprint. if benefit improvement exist capital requirement realized, crucial capital standard agree upon globally, also implement consistently across jurisdictional boundaries. we strongly support effort within basel committee monitor implementation – law regulation member countries, also level individual large bank organizations, include assessment consistency risk-weighting practice banks. we look forward evolution basel committee’s new plan conduct monitor exercise, considerably ambitious pursue past. liquidity standard in recognition fact liquidity squeeze financial institution play key role financial crisis, basel iii agreement also introduced, first time, quantitative liquidity requirement application internationally active banks. one standard, liquidity coverage ratio (lcr), design ensure firm’s ability withstand short-term liquidity shock adequate hold highly liquid assets. the standard, net stable fund ratio (nsfr), intend avoid significant maturity mismatch longer-term horizons. again, parallel international initiative section 165 dodd-frank act, call enhanced, graduate liquidity standard large bank hold companies. precisely first effort quantitative liquidity regulation basel committee, question potential unintended consequences, well desire ensure new standard reflect actual experience stability various fund source relative liquidity different financial instrument financial crisis. for reasons, federal reserve, support number central bank supervisors, suggest time adoption basel iii 2010 multiyear study period rule take effect. since then, u.s. bank agency basel committee work group collect data, analyze potential effect lcr financial market broad economy, consider amendment might warranted. the basel committee likely suggest set change lcr late year, goal introduce lcr 2015. work nsfr considerably slow track; current plan implementation 2018. resolution sifis a third core regulatory reform goal dodd-frank act international policymakers enhance ability regulator resolve fail sifis. the basel committee financial stability board (fsb) set forth standard national bi central bankers’ speech 3 resolution regime allow resolution sifis orderly fashion, without taxpayer exposure loss solvency support. here unite states, dodd-frank act provide orderly resolution process administer federal deposit insurance corporation (fdic), resolution plan sifis oversee fdic federal reserve. together provision dodd-frank act fully consistent basel committee fsb standards. in develop orderly liquidation authority establish title ii dodd-frank act, fdic recently express preference resolve fail sifi single receivership internal recapitalization model. under model, parent company fail sifi place receivership; all, substantially all, asset parent company transfer bridge entity; parent company residual asset liquidated; bridge entity capitalized, part, convert holder long-term unsecured debt parent company equity holder bridge. under single receivership model, major subsidiary sifi continue operate go concerns. this approach hold great promise, ensure viability resolution option requires, among things, sifi maintain amount long-term unsecured debt sufficient absorb significant loss firm. some jurisdiction have, plan to, put place special resolution mechanism conform emerge international standards. but even continue progress along path may solve possible problem associate failure sifi. the coexistence internationally active firm nationally base insolvency regime mean could important cross-border legal complication home jurisdiction place receivership firm significant assets, subsidiaries, contractual arrangement countries. a comprehensive, treaty-like instrument global bank resolution regime address issue surely unrealistic prospect foreseeable future. the federal reserve fdic work together counterpart country identify opportunity limit cooperation agreements, coordinate supervisory work resolution plans, device make orderly resolution large, internationally active firm feasible. otc derivative regulatory reform another key part dodd-frank act involve significant international consideration otc derivative reform. in unite states, administrative agency implement requirement dodd-frank act strengthen infrastructure regulation otc derivative market. this task include enhance role central counterparties, important tool manage counterparty credit risk derivative market; improve regulation supervision dealer key market participants; introduce minimum margin requirement certain derivative transaction clear central counterparty; increase transparency. a roughly parallel international initiative get way 2009, group twenty (g-20) leader set commitment relate reform otc derivative markets. since work g-20 commitment pursue number international group foreign jurisdictions, continue attention require ensure global convergence process continue timely fashion. such attention particularly important area international convergence desirable avoid significant fracture regionalization exist global structure swap market, prevent undue constraint ability u.s. firm compete foreign markets. a good example introduction margin requirement uncleared derivatives. u.s. foreign regulator form joint work group basel committee international organization security commission (iosco) develop internationally consistent margin standard appropriately address risk uncleared derivative ensure u.s. foreign firm compete level play field. 4 bi central bankers’ speech other key area otc derivative reform present similar international challenge demand similar level international collaboration. these area include creation regulation central counterparties, swap execution facilities, swap data repositories, include mutual recognition u.s. foreign regulator appropriate. issue also arise around treatment governmental entity derivative reform unite state abroad. for example, title vii dodd-frank act generally exempt swap regulation transaction federal reserve party, contain similar exemption transaction foreign central bank party. foreign central bank express concern application certain part title vii may interfere manner conduct national monetary policies. in addition involvement specific derivative reform relate dodd-frank act, federal reserve also participate variety international group serve broad forum coordinate policy relate participant infrastructure derivative markets. these forum include basel committee, recently enhance international capital, leverage, liquidity standard derivatives, well committee payment settlement systems, work iosco update international standard systemically important clear systems, include central counterparties clear derivative instruments, trade repositories. these collaborative exercise intend support development consistent international approach regulation supervision derivative products, dealers, market infrastructures. here, international contexts, aim promote financial stability unite state fair competitive condition u.s. financial institutions. other implementation issue a note precede discussion, even broad international consensus adopt particular regulatory approach, discrete issue raise country implement approach context legal, financial, political systems. this circumstance hardly unique area financial regulation; familiar anyone work virtually regulatory issue affect international trade investment. there also element dodd-frank act unlikely pursue internationally comparable form. these area u.s.-only regulatory reform present particular challenge implementation, term potential impact may ability u.s. financial institution compete abroad extent may affect activity foreign financial institution u.s. market u.s. counterparties. in instance regulatory reform pursue unite states, likely obvious answer result international complexities. for example, considerable recent attention pay international aspect section 619 dodd-frank act, commonly know “volcker rule.” concern express volcker rule’s potential international implication three principal areas. first, volcker rule apply worldwide operation u.s. bank entities, u.s.-connected operation foreign banks, concern raise regard relative competitiveness u.s. firm significant operation overseas markets. second, conversely, volcker rule also apply activity foreign bank unless activity “solely outside unite states,” several foreign bank supervisor express concern regard potential extraterritorial impact restriction may trade fund activity foreign bank u.s. non-u.s. characteristics. third, volcker rule include statutory exemption proprietary trade u.s. government debt securities, foreign sovereign debt securities, several constituency raise concern regard asymmetry. in areas, u.s. regulator need carefully consider concern raise broad international implication volcker rule work finalize implement rules. bi central bankers’ speech 5 similarly, swap “push-out” requirement section 716 dodd-frank act also appear unlikely pursue internationally. under section 716, u.s. insure depository institution u.s. branch agency foreign bank require “push out” certain type derivative deal activity affiliate entities. the global effect swap push-out provision multifaceted. on one hand, provision require u.s. bank firm restructure global derivative deal activity way require foreign bank abroad. at time, provision may require u.s. branch agency foreign bank restructure derivative deal activity way require u.s. banks. thank much attention. i would please answer question might have. bi central bankers’ speech 1 anand sinha: change contour global crisis –

quite jaded. so much already said, discussed, analysed, dissect write crisis. the crisis erupt 2007 has, time, engulf consciousness public much, finance speech complete without reference finance book consummate without chapter devoted. go number book publish crisis, one would greatly surprise publish industry one industry stay afloat, fact, thrive crisis. then, i deliberate topic discuss much already? it two reasons. one, crisis still continue offer wealth information lessons, remain relevant time come. second, crisis remain was, started. the crisis start localize sub-prime crisis morph financial crisis lead full blow global economic crisis take shape sovereign debt crisis. while current spread localize eurozone, impact continue felt across globe. it context i would place talk today change contour crisis impact indian economy. i. calm storm – period great moderation the period precede global crisis phase great moderation represent decline macroeconomic volatility (both output well inflation). the period mark strong worldwide gdp growth couple low stable inflation low interest rate lull policy maker economist believe search “holy grail” magic formula strong growth low inflation 2 bi central bankers’ speech finally discovered. the great moderation attributed1 (i) structural change may increase macroeconomic flexibility stability improve management business inventory make possible advance computation communication, increase depth sophistication financial markets, deregulation many industries, shift away manufacture service increase openness trade international capital flow etc. (ii) improve performance macroeconomic policy (iii) good luck. the role good luck maintain great moderation extensively discuss debate and, anyone would expect, role discount thing go good. the problem attribute entire credit good luck leaf unprepared vulnerable shock since, rely solely luck, become effectively, prisoner circumstances. on hand, give luck rightful due encourage overrate leaf underprepared crisis hits. whatever reason, good time last long period great moderation come end 2007 crisis erupted. the impact crisis financial world immense. the global growth slumped, unemployment burgeoned, interbank market freeze account heighten counterparty concern risk aversion, bank activity plummet non-performing loan increase many large famous institution obliterate face financial world. the impact crisis non-financial front less. in fact, crisis cause deep impact intellectual world, rubbish concept theory hold sacrosanct till then. analysts, research policymakers huddle diagnose reason crisis come various theory explanations. the plausible explanation go way. difference consumption investment pattern among country (a save glut asia oil export country spend binge unite states) result emergence global imbalance lead large capital flow surplus country deficit country mostly advance countries. these capital flow result surge liquidity advance economy lead low interest rates. both short term well long term real interest rate remain low long period. low interest rate force investor hunt yield sow seed asset inflation. financial engineer assume centre stage bid design offer high yield product investors. 1 bernanke, ben, (feb 2004), the great moderation. bi central bankers’ speech 3 in addition factors, gap regulatory framework also play part accentuate crisis. the follow reason widely attribute outbreak crisis- inadequate quantity quality capital, insufficient liquidity buffers, excessively leverage financial institutions, inadequate coverage certain risks, absence regulatory framework address systemic risks, proliferation opaque poorly understand financial product search yield backdrop era “great moderation”, perverse incentive structure securitisation process, lack transparency otc market particularly cds, inadequate regulation supervision, burgeon under/unregulated shadow bank system. while factor play background create perfect recipe crisis, proximate cause crisis development u subprime market. a observe raghuram rajan2, grow income inequality unite states, stem unequal access quality education, lead political pressure house credit lead distort lend financial sector. in classic case best intention lead bad outcome due bad implementation, envisage policy financial inclusion enable homeless homes, lead reckless lend sub-prime market and, eventually, result meltdown. 2 rajan, raghuram, (2010), “fault line – how hide fracture still threaten world economy”. 4 bi central bankers’ speech the crisis, erupt 2007, start mere sub-prime crisis localize us. but soon crisis spread market cut across geographical boundary signify extent global integration. the subprime crisis become bank crisis due exposure bank subprime asset fast turn bad. counterparty concern exacerbated, lead freeze global interbank markets. the crisis spread jurisdiction various channel contagion – trade, finance importantly, confidence. foreign investor start withdraw investment emerge market push also liquidity crisis. by oct 2008, lehman brother collapse weight sub-prime exposures, crisis become truly global, spread impact. the crisis devastate impact world economy term output loss rise unemployment. it impact segment global financial market term heighten volatility, tight credit conditions, low asset price increase write downs. the policy makers, regulator sovereign immediately step initiate measure mitigate impact crisis. there many measures, conventional unconventional, take provide relief badly batter global economy. just think crisis behind us, economy slowly limp back normalcy, another crisis hit world. in classic case cure painful disease, various fiscal measure take mitigate impact 2007 crisis have, along factors, lead huge unsustainable sovereign debt result sovereign debt crisis eurozone. country run huge fiscal deficits, either maintain populist policy bail institution global crisis guarantee fail bank etc., suddenly find verge bankruptcy unable honour obligation word “sovereign debt” suddenly cease evoke image riskless (less risky, least) asset. with background place, i

crisis india the global financial crisis impact india significantly, notwithstanding sound bank system, negligible exposure indian bank sub-prime asset relatively well-functioning financial markets. the impact mainly account india’s grow trade financial integration global economy. india’s two way trade (merchandize export plus imports), proportion gdp, 40.7 per cent 2008–09, crisis year, 19.6 per cent 1998–99. the ratio total external transaction (gross current account flow plus gross capital account flows) gdp – indicator trade financial integration – 112 per cent 2008–09 44 per cent 1998–99. 8 bi central bankers’ speech the immediate impact crisis felt large capital outflow consequent fall domestic stock market account sell-off foreign institutional investor steep depreciation rupee u dollar. the bse sensex (on close basis), touch peak 20873 january 8, 2008, decline low 8160 march 9, 2009. while capital outflow lead decline domestic forex liquidity, rbi’s intervention forex market result tighten rupee liquidity. the inter-bank call money (overnight) rate firm period second half september ’08 end october ’08 (high 19.70 per cent october 10). however, series liquidity augment measure undertake rbi result call rate come back normal level first week november ’08. global recession adversely affect indian export result widen current account deficit (cad). export grow 25 per cent 2005/08 decelerate 13.6 per cent crisis year (2008–09) register negative growth 3.5 per cent 2009–10. output growth, average little le 9 per cent previous five year 9.5 per cent three year period 2005–08, drop 6.8 per cent crisis year (2008–09). in pre-crisis years, capital inflow far excess current account deficit (cad) reserve bank absorb flow balance sheet. a global investor try rebalance portfolio crisis period, country witness large capital outflow immediately collapse lehman brother lead downward pressure rupee. the exchange rate depreciate rs. 39.37 per dollar january 2008 rs. 51.23 per dollar march 2009. bi central bankers’ speech 9 the credit market also come pressure corporates, find difficult raise resource external source funding, turn domestic bank non-bank institution fund also withdraw investment liquid scheme mutual funds. this, turn, put redemption pressure mutual fund (mfs) and, along chain, non-banking financial company (nbfcs) mf significant source funding. the indian bank sector has, however, withstand spillover effect global financial crisis evident robust crar tier 1 crar remain far stipulate regulatory minimum 9 per cent. the asset quality also comfortable despite slippages. by end march 2010, gross npa ratio stand 2.50 per cent (net npa 1.13%) crar 13.58 per cent. the spillover effect crisis were, however, visible credit growth bank sector. since september 2008, growth rate advances, also assets, start witness decline trend continue almost one year september 2009. the y-o-y growth advance fell 28.5 per cent end march 2007 12.3 per cent end sept 2009 y-o-y growth asset fell 22.9 per cent 15.1 per cent period. d. policy response – india give deceleration growth dry capital flows, reserve bank government undertake number measure minimise impact crisis india. there was, however, notable difference indian response many emes, one hand, advance economies, hand. while policy response advance economy contend unfold financial crisis deepen recession, indian response predominantly drive need arrest moderation economic growth. the main plank government response fiscal stimulus reserve bank’s action comprise counter-cyclical regulatory measure also measure ensure easy liquidity monetary conditions. the reserve bank’s policy measure aim contain contagion outside – keep domestic money credit market function normally ensure liquidity stress trigger solvency cascades. a case central banks, conventional unconventional measure undertaken. the conventional measure included, first, sharp reduction policy interest rate – effective policy 10 bi central bankers’ speech rate cut 9 per cent (repo rate) september 2008 3.25 per cent (reverse repo rate) april 2009. second, cash reserve ratio reduce 9.0 per cent september 2008 5 per cent january 2009 view inject liquidity bank system. third, liquidity injection bulk make purchase government security open market operation (omo) unwind balance market stabilization scheme (mss) buy-back, redemption de-sequestering. fourth, refinance facility export credit enhanced. measure also take enhance forex liquidity include upward adjustment interest rate ceiling deposit non-resident indian fcnr (b) nre deposit account relaxation norm external commercial borrow (ecb). in view slow economy decelerate credit flow, counter-cyclical regulatory measure introduce 2006 also reversed. the unconventional measure take reserve bank india included; institution rupee-dollar swap facility indian bank give comfort manage short-term foreign fund requirement overseas branches; special liquidity support bank on-lending mutual fund non-banking financial companies; liquidity support non-banking financial company special purpose vehicle create purpose expansion lendable resource available apex finance institution refinance credit extend small industries, house exports. the measure undertake reserve bank september 2008 – july 2009 result augmentation actual/potential liquidity rs. 5, 61,700 cr. the fiscal stimulus measures, undertake december 2008 january 2009, include additional public spend well cut taxes. these stimulus package come top already announce expand safety-net rural poor, farm loan waiver package salary increase government staff, stimulate demand. take together, fiscal monetary measure successful achieve objectives. financial market bank sector begin function normally. real gdp growth take hit 2008–09 reach 6.8 per cent recover quickly reach 8.0 per cent 2009–10 8.5 per cent 2010–11 impact stimulus measure also inherent strength domestic demand. strong recovery demand, along persistent supply pressures, however, lead inflationary pressure 2010–2011. e. why impact india muted? despite immediate impact financial market trade flows, crisis significant impact indian financial system. the reason mute impact attributable primarily (i) macroprudential approach regulation (ii) multiple indicator base monetary policy, (iii) calibrate capital account management, (iv) management systemic interconnectedness, (v) robust market infrastructure otc transaction (vi) conservative approach towards financial innovation. the monetary policy formulation reserve bank india guide multiple objective multiple instrument contrary approach follow country single objective single instruments. monitor multiple macroeconomic indicator help reserve bank interpret development financial system take prompt corrective action. similarly, measure put place robust system reduce counterparty risk otc transaction ccp arrangement regulation shadow bank institution address interconnectedness issue help contain impact crisis help economy keep afloat despite huge global turbulences. bi central bankers’ speech 11 iii. metamorphosis crisis sovereign debt crisis: just global economy revert normalcy, another crisis nature sovereign debt crisis surfaced. the grow debt many european sovereign cause sustainability concern force investor withdraw market lead significant escalation cd spreads. the crisis emerge late 2009 engulf entire eurozone end 2011. while greek bond cd spread high 200 bps april 2010, jan 2012, bond country except germany, finland netherlands cd spread high 200 bps. in fact, bond piigs country (portugal, italy, ireland, greece spain) cd spread even high 400 bps. the combination sluggish activity, bailouts fiscal stimulus measure lead balloon fiscal deficit public debt/gdp ratio major advance economy raise concern fiscal sustainability. these concern visible euro area countries, plague various combination problem over-large bank sector become expose house boom bust, uncompetitive economy signal repeat current account deficits, bloat state sector high private-sector unemployment6. for example, fiscal deficit/gdp ratio advance economy jump near balance position (deficit 0.6 per cent) 2007 9.0 per cent 2009, u jump 2.7 per cent 13.0 per cent period. fiscal deficit emerge economy also rose, albeit relatively modestly, surplus 0.1 per cent 2007 deficit 4.8 per cent 2009. the public debt/gdp ratio advance economy increase 73.4 per cent 2007 93.7 per cent 2009 103.5 per cent 2011. the ratio emerge market economy (emes) year almost unchanged 35.9 per cent, 36.7 per cent 37.8 per cent. the sovereign debt crisis, way complete circle – global crisis 2007 impact spread bank system sovereign current crisis, impact reverse direction, sovereign banks. what make present crisis disturb is, global crisis, bank stress backstop nature sovereigns, sovereign verge default leave everyone wonder could backstop sovereign default. 6 coggan, philip (2012) – “paper promise – money, debt new world order”. 12 bi central bankers’ speech impact sovereign debt crisis global economy: the current crisis jeopardize recovery plan put place regulators, policy maker sovereign post global crisis. despite source immediate impact localize eurozone, knock effect crisis felt across globe. financial condition deteriorated, growth prospect dim downside risk escalated. imf’s world economic outlook revise global output growth downwards 3.25 per cent euro area economy expect go mild recession 2012 result rise sovereign yields, effect bank leverage impact additional fiscal consolidation. the edes also expect post low growth account worsen external environment weaken internal demand. heighten risk aversion deleveraging induce euro area crisis impact financial market across globe. despite european union’s announcement significant policy action december 2011, financial market continue reel stress backdrop rat downgrade european financial stability fund (efsf) nine euro area country s&p, four downgrade two notches. the cd spread yield sovereign debt euro area increase substantially recent period. the inter-bank libor market witness grow stress term decline volume, rise rate shorten tenor lending. the usd libor-ois spread euribor-ois spread widen significantly imply increase counterparty credit risk premium. the equity market across globe witness sharp fall increase volatility. a regard bank system, country directly impact sovereign debt crisis spain, portugal italy, persistent slowdown bank credit 2011. in country peripherally affect crisis france germany, credit growth show sign revival 2010, dip reflect impact deepen sovereign debt crisis. the asset quality, reflect npl ratios, continue deteriorate eurozone countries. apart raise credit risks, sovereign crisis also increase fund risk euro zone banks. a per analysis bank international settlement (bis), bank greece, ireland portugal increasingly find difficult raise wholesale debt deposits, become reliant central bank liquidity.7 the increase cost wholesale fund also partially affect bank european countries. accord bis, are, broadly, four channel sovereign risk affect banks’ fund costs, give pervasive role government debt financial system. i. first, loss associate government debt weaken balance sheet bank make fund costly difficult obtain. ii. second, high sovereign risk reduce value collateral bank use raise wholesale fund central bank liquidity. iii. third, sovereign rat downgrade generally flow low rat domestic bank bank likely sector affect sovereign distress. a banks’ credit rat decline, wholesale fund cost rise. iv. fourth, weaken sovereign reduce fund benefit bank could derive implicit explicit government guarantees. 7 bank international settlement (2011), the impact sovereign credit risk bank fund conditions, july. bi central bankers’ speech 13 impact sovereign debt crisis india: with euro area appear head recession global growth slow short recovery, growth india moderate expect earlier. increase global uncertainty, weak industrial growth, slow investment activity deceleration resource flow commercial sector lead dip output growth. inflation risk emanate suppress domestic energy prices, incomplete pass-through rupee depreciation slippage fiscal deficit, fuel food commodity inflation lead policy tightening. all factor result growth projection india 2011–12 revise downwards 7.6 per cent 6.9 per cent. indian bank system has, however, impact current crisis significant presence country impact current crisis indian bank significant exposure bond issue them. while first order impact sovereign debt crisis, could, however, second-order impact various channel include trade. there could fund constraint indian bank branch operate overseas european bank deleverage. the cost borrow bank corporates may, therefore, go lead concern refinance foreign currency liabilities. due slump overseas demand associate downturn investment activity, already sluggishness credit well asset growth indian bank sector 2011–12. the crisis also measurable impact indian financial markets, equity price witness sharp decline account large net sale fiis backdrop worsen macroeconomic environment bearish outlook earn growth indian corporates. further, moderation capital flow couple widen trade deficit lead sharp fall inr-usd exchange rate touch time low 54.30 december 15, 2011. reserve bank take

cloud silver line every crisis bring it, lesson. the global crisis 2007 current sovereign debt crisis offer, fact, many lesson analyst busy decipher one day. while many regulatory policy lesson come fore various stage implementation, i would flag takeaway would relevant prepare enter professional world currently beset crises. takeaway 1: too much anything bad you must often hear grandmother say and, mind you, remain relevant even today, fact today, post crisis. too much leverage, much liquidity, much complexity much greed – lead crisis. it argue much finance also conducive growth. recent studies8 suggest low level large financial system lead high productivity, beyond point, bank credit result low growth. further, also argue fast grow financial sector detrimental aggregate productivity growth. moderation approach, therefore, important lesson. takeaway 2: model absolute in run crisis, excessive reliance almost blind faith model convey absolute truths. entire risk management system build around belief. post crisis, participant wake harsh reality model fully reflect reality life excessive reliance quantitative model fraught risk. exact science physic govern nature’s law immutable lead definite predictable results. finance hand, govern capricious human behavior bias cannot easily modeled. to argument model limitation good any, nassim taleb say “ you bad rely mislead information information all. if give pilot altimeter sometimes defective crash plane. give nothing look window” know shortcoming model is, therefore, extremely important judicious usage. takeaway 3: finance serve real sector converse while agree financial system further economic development enable efficient allocation capital risk, ultimate objective finance, further economic development lose sight of. in period prior crisis, financial activity grow much umbilical cord financial real sector sever finance start exist sake. the danger scenario quite emphatically convey crisis. with thoughts, i conclude address. i thank patient hear wish best future endeavors. references: acharya, shankar (2012) “india-after global crisis” 8 cecchetti, stephan kharroubi, enisse (jan 2012), “reassessing impact finance

country well. pessimism countries’ fiscal economic situations, turn, undermine confidence strength european financial institutions, increase cost difficulty institution face obtain fund reduce willingness supply credit. the difficulty euro area affect u.s. economy. the european union account roughly one-fifth u.s. export good services. not surprisingly, u.s. export europe past two year underperform export rest world. in addition, weak demand europe slow growth economies, also low foreign demand products. financial strain europe also show financial markets. during time financial condition europe turbulent, investor around world retreat risky assets. in unite states, pullback decrease stock prices, increase cost issue corporate debt, reduce consumer business confidence. in addition, u.s. financial institution think substantial exposure europe saw stock price fall credit spread widen. in past months, financial stress europe lessened, contribute improve tone financial market around world, include unite states. the improvement reflects, part, number action take european policymakers. first, measure take european central bank (ecb), include implement two longer-term refinance operation ease collateral rule reserve requirements, allow european bank lock fund three years, thereby alleviate concern near-term prospects. with benefit support, european bank turn increase hold sovereign debt, contribute low borrow cost countries. second, euro-area leaders, greek government, private-sector holder greek debt take step put greece sustainable fiscal path. it sovereign debt significantly reduced, greek authority intensify effort implement fiscal structural reforms, european union international monetary fund pledge considerable amount new fund part second assistance package. the greek economy remain deep recession, however. third finally, leader member european union approve new fiscal compact treaty strengthen fiscal rule enforcement. this treaty represent positive step toward resolve fundamental tension inherent 2 bi central bankers’ speech monetary union without fiscal union, thus help bolster viability euro-area economy long term. although progress made, need done. full resolution crisis require strengthen european bank system; significant expansion financial backstops, “firewalls,” guard contagion sovereign debt markets; and, critically, continue effort increase economic growth competitiveness reduce external imbalance trouble countries. action take federal reserve the federal reserve follow development europe closely, frequent contact key european policymakers. we particularly focus protect u.s. financial institutions, businesses, consumer adverse financial economic development europe. to help calm dollar fund market support flow credit u.s. household businesses, federal reserve act concert major foreign central bank enhance u.s. dollar swap facility originally put place global financial crisis reestablish

fact counterparties large u.s. dealer bank sovereign cd trade dispersed, primarily across large financial institutions. and vast majority cases, institution post collateral help minimize possible losses. although u.s. bank limit exposure peripheral european countries, exposure european bank larger, “core” country europe material. moreover, european hold represent 35 percent asset prime u.s.

help stabilize u.s. market situation require action. thank you. i would please respond questions. bi central bankers’ speech 1 malcolm edey: the current agenda retail payment regulation address mr malcolm edey, assistant governor (financial system) reserve bank australia, card & payment australasia 2012 conference, sydney, 20 march 2012. * * * once i thank organiser card payment australasia invitation speak today, third time event. look conference agenda two days, stand intense focus innovation. this industry great deal work go area like online payments, mobile payments, new card-payment products, improvement security. all sign vibrant industry. my subject today current agenda retail payment regulation. the reserve bank direct role payment regulation since 1998. follow report wallis committee, payment system (regulation) act year establish basic govern structure today. it set payment system board within reserve bank mandate promote efficiency stability. and act give bank significant power end. they include power designate payment system set standard area like network price various aspect payment system’s internal rules. one first area focus board credit card schemes. but remit payment system board extend much broadly card payments, even retail payment generally. the board also oversight responsibility high-value system well clear settlement facility australia, increasingly devote attention second areas. i expect trend continue, give rapid change take place internationally. today, though, i want focus work retail payments. public consultation important part work. in matter formal obligation consult, reason it. the issue involve payment regulation often complex see important engage industry, stakeholders, make sure relevant fact make decisions. currently four area retail payment regulation various stage public consultation. i want take opportunity review briefly today. the first surcharge standard card payments. the question simple one: card scheme allow place limit merchant surcharge card payments, so, form? that question first examine payment system board initial round credit card reforms, announce 2002. the board’s decision, know, require removal rule surcharging. that part wide reform package also include standard interchange fees. a newcomer debate might ask question, take action no-surcharge rule effect would make cardholder pay transactions? it’s worth briefly re-capping answer that. one distinctive feature card payment systems, historically, lack alignment price decision-making power. in typical credit card transaction, person make choice payment instrument usually cardholder, 2 bi central bankers’ speech transaction fee incur merchant. in simple terms, cardholder make decision merchant pay fee. the interchange arrangement underpin fee structure tend configure way reward issuance usage card add merchant costs. we observe structure competition tend push fee rather because, high fee, great capacity reward cardholder use give card. scheme rule prohibit surcharge effect reinforce pattern, prevent price signal flow person choose payment instrument. this basic logic decision prevent scheme make rule surcharging. a decade later, say effect decision? i best answer describe result reform package whole, different element closely inter-related. the clear impact reduction card payment costs. in case four-party credit card schemes, average merchant service fee fall 60 basis points. although three-party scheme regulate way, voluntarily accept surcharge standard subject competitive pressures. a result, merchant service fee three-party scheme fall similar amount. since adoption reforms, prevalence surcharge significantly increased. accord data east & partners, around one-third australian merchant impose surcharge least one credit card accept. the figure high large merchants1, proportion surcharge slightly half. it also seem likely surcharge become widespread future – 12 per cent merchant say least consider apply surcharge. in early stage reform process payment system board considered, proceed with, alternative approach would allow scheme limit surcharge amount link cost acceptance2. the board’s view, balance, give merchant right surcharge important realign incentive give merchant bargain power determination fees. the board also take view market force could expect work discipline excessive surcharging. the growth surcharge has, however, bring light practice look inconsistent efficiency objective. while comprehensive data available, significant anecdotal evidence surcharge reasonably relate cost acceptance. one example practice blend surcharging, merchant might recover cost average basis without distinguish high- low-cost card payments. another would surcharge simply exceed reasonable estimate cost acceptance. although practice appear widespread, concern payment efficiency point view distort consumer choice payment method use. they go principle i state early allow efficient flow price signal economic decision maker. it reason bank reopen consideration surcharge standard last year a draft revision standard release december, final stage consultation. if adopted, revise standard allow scheme limit surcharge reasonable cost acceptance, scheme able prohibit surcharge altogether prevent merchant recover costs. for purpose, cost acceptance define including, necessarily limit to, merchant service fee. 1 currently, annual turnover great $530 million. 2 the exist standard allow merchant acquirer agree so. bi central bankers’ speech 3 i want stress view change panacea away every consumer complaint. it also important make clear reserve bank set regulator merchant behaviour. what propose standard empower scheme take action surcharge clearly excessive. it interest make use power. at time, proposal preserve original goal give merchant right recover costs. in way i think strike reasonable balance strengthen incentive scheme compete low fee merchants. the le scheme cost merchants, low permissible surcharge. the second policy area i want talk reserve bank’s strategic review payment innovation. this subject talk year ago i much brief remark today. when talk innovation, need always keep mind distinction proprietary systemic. the proprietary sphere cover area service provider act independently use innovation gain competitive edge. the payment industry good innovate way, see evidence many thing talk today’s conference. systemic innovation much hard achieve require co-operation collective interest, even may strong proprietary benefit level individual service provider it’s second area focus current review. we ask question, gap system address collectively, so, make happen? submission review helpful identify number gap nature. here main ones:  transmission data payments. this long-time concern businesses, often find 18 character limit direct entry system restrictive. often drive business use cheque paper-based information, like invoice, accompany payment. alternatively might separate payment remittance information, rely separate process reconcile late stage. this likely expensive error prone.  use international standards. i won’t dwell one, way relate previous point, international framework message standard provide transmission significant amount additional data. i think widespread acknowledgement within payment industry international standard adopt wherever possible.  timeliness payments. a communication technology advances, little doubt people expect great immediacy many areas, payment exception. it currently possible make payment someone bank another bank able use fund within short space time. in circumstance lack capacity significant problem – instance someone wait emergency government payment. this seem like area could improve increasingly become focus overseas. likewise, fact payment cannot occur bank normal business hour seem line ‘always on’ world live in.  address payments. cheque always good reminder thing miss electronic payments. i pay someone cheque i know name. but i want make electronic payment, i 4 bi central bankers’ speech typically need know 6-digit bsb number 9-digit account number, thing receiver probably cannot readily provide. people find partial workarounds make use mobile phone number email addresses, yet truly seamless system. all area progress make co-operatively, characteristic network, individual players. but also mean decision move ahead area need take account cost benefit across system whole, service provider end-users. that raise broad question whether need change governance arrangement industry, make conducive innovation general. there number reason co-operative innovation hard achieve. industry participant differ commercial interests, even factor like time investment cycle make coordinate action difficult. a change message standard timeliness payment might benefit public, yet remain hard achieve proprietary benefit individual service providers. the challenge find way determine innovation nature public interest and, so, ensure go ahead. industry-level decision make may part answer. along question governance, critical decision review likely relate architecture payment system. by i mean particular question whether place additional centralise architecture australian payment system. a possible argument proposition centralise system may good able innovate bilateral systems. they may also structurally efficient network large number participants, good suit provide open access new players. the possible need centralise architecture also relevant question fast (or real-time) payment retail level. the consultation process bring range view subject. some argue exist architecture provide sufficient level centralisation, point potential cost move exist system onto hub. others focus potential form hub provide real-time retail transfer go far propose governance framework system. we position announce conclusion near future, along matter i’ve outline today. let turn briefly third fourth area current policy work. issue number three regulatory framework eftpos system. one significant development recent time establishment epal national scheme eftpos payments. the reserve bank welcome development see strengthen competition among card payment scheme domestic market. a consequence establishment epal, eftpos system work largely multilateral network. but much exist framework – access regime interchange fee standard – design reference early bilaterally-based system. a result, relevance applicability exist framework need reviewed. one change already make decision november 2009 bring multilateral eftpos fee interchange fee standard apply scheme debit cards. but change element regulatory framework eftpos system need considered. some reason purely technical, regulation stand reflect system’s current structure. but also substantive question whether need maintain currently exist arrangement and, so, form. we expect complete consultation question reach conclusion late year. bi central bankers’ speech 5 the fourth issue currently consult retail payment system resilience. much work payment system board year regulation oversight might call self-contained systems: thing like credit card network, clear settlement facility. but board’s remit extend broadly efficiency stability payment system whole. on common sense reading, payment system encompass capacity person a make payment person b bank different banks. the ability system whole deliver basic service, dependably efficiently, clearly come payment system board’s overall policy mandate. that appropriate board conduct innovation review i’ve outlined. it relate efficiency system whole. it also appropriate board take interest operational resilience individual payment service providers. in recent year number high-profile outage affect availability service significant number customers. obviously individual bank strong incentive minimise risk sort incidents. it affect reputation something go wrong impair ability meet need customers. but also system-wide dimension problems. all participant system, user payment services, interest high standard maintain across system whole, component it. when bank a’s system go down, customer bank affected, capacity exchange payment customer bank impaired. for time reserve bank monitor significant retail payment outages, follow relevant bank diagnosis appropriate remedial actions. so sense, role rba area new. what propose formalise role two ways. first, announce put place systematic report regime retail outages. and second, begin consultation process bank whether measure need improve operational resilience across system. conclusion those four area retail payment regulation reserve bank currently conduct consultation industry, interest parties. what tie thing together focus efficiency competition. in many way competition work well deliver benefit end users. but industry complex network interaction like one, important role regulation promote efficient outcomes. a i say earlier, carry role payment system board take seriously need consult, industry end-users. many today participate process, i take opportunity thank co-operation. bi central bankers’ speech 1 rodrigo vergara: the global economic scenario monetary policy management speech mr rodrigo vergara, governor central bank chile, 2012 latin american forum institute international finance (iif), montevideo, uruguay, 17 march 1012. * * * i thank luis oscar herrera, enrique orellana tatiana vargas helpful comments. thank invite speak 2012 meet iif latin american economic forum. this first time governor central bank chile. i ask share think impact region crisis affect develop world, especially confront use policy instruments, challenge lie ahead us. these last year challenge term evolution macroeconomic condition region worldwide. after crisis argentina brazil late 1990s early 2000s, part latin american economy experience period sustain growth, low unemployment drop relative stability inflation rates. nonetheless, towards end past decade state abruptly interrupt international financial crisis. the bad come fall lehman brother september 2008. the abrupt significant collapse global demand cause serious problem economies. term trade plummet soon face completely different picture. economic policy reaction come promptly. in chile, latin american countries, implement combination fiscal monetary policy stimulate economy. more important fact probably first time, crisis magnitude affect – still affect – develop countries, cause latin american economy enter balance payment crisis profound recession. suffice remember happen early 1980s, weakness shortcoming economic policies, couple significant rise interest rate worldwide, drag u deep recession. this utmost importance show mature economic policy framework face challenge maintain also improve it. after quarters, world economy begin recover gradually. this process take place two speeds. emerge economy recover fast pace, develop country experience slow rebound. the cause consequence great recession continue affect economic performance develop world. this fundamental problem, high indebtedness households, company governments, still present. the fact high level debt costly solution great side-effects, pose problem. we see clearly recent quarters. you may recall year ago main problem face emerge economy deal inflationary pressures, give narrow domestic capacity gap rise price commodity international markets. this happen time two-speed recovery process i mention accompany interest rate differential redirect capital flow towards emerge markets, exert strong pressure appreciate currencies. our concern pace would low impulse economies, take care intensify pressure exchange rate cause new imbalances. only six month late major concern change dramatically. the intensification financial tension develop economy drastically change perception future global economy. financial market drastically pick change mood 2 bi central bankers’ speech quickly saw, among developments, drop stock prices, hike risk premiums, reduction price commodities. the tough discussion hold unite state fiscal issues, together weakness economic data towards mid-year, fuel negative perceptions. overall, emerge economy dramatically change perception communication future monetary policy. between august october, probably peak moment last financial turbulence develop world, many central bank stop process interest rate raises, many also change direction change monetary policy expansive ones. in chile, raise mpr 200 basis point first half 2011 state still increase made, august move towards neutral stance. in october, consider envisage consequence deterioration international scenario, announce would increase monetary impulse foresee situation could negative impact economy. thus, january year low mpr 25 basis points. now announce new monetary policy action depend assessment effect international scenario domestic economy well evolution domestic economy itself. allow present vision go world affect us. particularly, monetary policy perspective. the current international scenario the onset 2012 surprise u considerably calm state affair expect month ago. the eurozone situation far solved. there many challenge ahead, among increase productivity many peripheral economies. nonetheless, significant progress made. the european central bank (ecb) provide long-term liquidity financial sector, european leader place condition financing, government agree adjustment plan seem go right direction, seem time buy address structural problem still present eurozone. financial market understand this, risk indicator monetary condition improved. consensus forecast world growth point performance global economy 2011. nonetheless, degree downward correction diminish noticeably late data. doe mean circumstance develop country reach point beyond must expect significant setbacks? this opinion. allow give background. a mentioned, solution eurozone’s problem still far ahead. it economy recession necessary adjustment expensive highly unpopular among population. some economy high unemployment fragile fiscal situation. if anything, measure adopt put firewall isolate systemically relevant economy great disaster. also, financial condition improve last weeks, mainly due ecb’s ltro initiative. with it, concern region’s bank sector finance need deal with. however, serious fiscal financial problem macroeconomic imbalance continue exist eurozone. in response high unemployment low growth, banks’ portfolio deteriorated. on hand, european bank authority (eba) demand capital increase system’s major banks. finally, u dollar finance pressure persist major banks. this result stringent credit conditions, may continue profound impact particularly small medium-sized business and, eventually, countries’ foreign trade. bi central bankers’ speech 3 the situation eurozone complex cannot rule possible risk scenario disorderly default peripheral economies, due challenge debt maturity profile face. this high risk scenario is, however, le likely end last year. the u economic data last month pleasant surprise. the labor market households’ expenditure seem behave good forecast. although, difficulty persist labor market fiscal adjustment need explain continue doubt true sustainable recovery currently witness is. in spite positive indicators, feed authority extend 2013 2014 period expect keep interest rate minimum levels. certainly, problem fiscal indebtedness continues. in emerge country data diverse. over course second half 2011 witness generalize deterioration consumer business expectations. neither case compare happen late 2008 begin 2009. generally, data show deceleration activity. nonetheless, difficult identify much decline due low external stimulus, much account natural slowdown economy, part explain particular events. all element add situation which, although external scenario worsening, belief risk disappear far off. it possible think likelihood extreme scenario low, but, opinion, still there. more challenge monetary policy a already mentioned, change global panorama perceive lead many emerge economy change view future economic policies. this make halt process low expansiveness and/or make resume impulse. however, new change mood bring great calm begin year, couple geopolitical factors, put u dilemma. on one hand, probably result recent memory late 2008 early 2009 global confidence crisis, economic authority quickly set close monitor system prepare batch instrument implement quick offset adverse effect global crisis. however, time show effect crisis eurozone area fairly limit far. financial market suffer big impacts, trade, output employment greatly affected. in chile, activity domestic demand, specially consumption, worsen significantly. this mean vision effect crisis develop world economy rest world changed. however, fact activity begin year high level envisage month ago. on hand, compound increase oil price. political tension middle east put pressure price, thus affect domestic prices. the effect high oil price interpret least twofold, oppose implication monetary policy. on one hand, situation tight output gap – case many emerge economies, chile among – increase price energy may exacerbate domestic inflationary pressure, make dynamic inflation complex demand great care assess evolution inflation trend. on hand, face exist risk scenarios, increase oil price also negative effect world activity. if take account fragile state households, business government develop world, high price energy may weaken position lead last deep economic fragility. 4 bi central bankers’ speech a third factor add difficulty monetary policy management renew concern capital flow towards emerge world. the change investors’ mood make look market invest, lead widespread appreciation emerge countries’ currencies. a usual, rekindle debate present discussion year back, convenience implement measure avoid currency appreciating. last year several emerge economies, among chile, intervene exchange market use different mechanisms. this year emerge economy continue so. clearly, discussion convenience perform action remain unresolved. the first thing bear mind small open economies, effort persistently keep exchange rate level beyond margin align fundamentals, particularly overvalue levels, sustainable may eventually generate high inflation. we convince float exchange rate regime appropriate one chilean economy, facilitate macroeconomic external account adjustments. nonetheless, certain circumstance may lead central bank intervene forex market, either maintain adequate international reserve position respond overreaction exchange parity beyond long-term fundamentals. however, cost associate type intervention. a first cost may create confusion objective monetary authorities: inflation exchange rate. in case, deal transparent mechanism whereby anticipate amount term interventions, maintain flexible exchange rate. in addition always clear exchange rate objective main goal central bank price stability. a second cost financial nature. foreign reserve invest highly liquid secure instrument develop countries, whose interest rate low domestic instrument use finance acquisition. conversely, benefit reserve enhance security provide case abrupt cut external financing. these benefit hard measure, reasonable expect decline availability reserve increases, occur chile since 2008. allow express final thoughts. final think news last week lead u scenario effect deteriorate external situation forecast time back evident inflationary pressure stem high cost energy resurfaced. hence, month ago clear likely scenario monetary policy emerge economy loosening, today much le clear so. compound renew influx capital flow towards emerge economy result appreciation currencies. against backdrop, manage monetary policy become complex. today, assessment continue crisis develop world sooner late affect performance economies. it possible impact le think time ago, assume nothing happen seem sensible. nonetheless, difficulty involve measure actual impact make cautious measure impulse require economy offset effect external scenario. today, prudent monetary policy management prepare kind scenario adapt amount stimulus apply accord need establish case case basis. a i say moment ago, activity see today level bi central bankers’ speech 5 forecast month back. in fact, late monetary policy meet decide maintain monetary policy rate 5% second month row. the current situation develop economy complex, teach valuable lessons. on one hand, imbalance address time end create enormous cost population. for u charge economic policy countries, absolutely essential strive address imbalance exist, time create decisions. over-stimulating economy output gap narrow inflationary pressure rise could lead imbalances. i trust sizeable develop world, case solve always costly. on hand, teach u relevance maintain improve good macroeconomic framework. in chile, framework rest four pillars. first, monetary policy management base flexible inflation-targeting regime, conduct autonomous central bank support float exchange rate system. second, fiscal policy accountable predictable thank structural balance rule. the significant amount save accumulate run-up copper price crucial factor bolster resilience chilean economy provide countercyclical fiscal boost. third, high degree commercial financial integration rest world. finally, sound financial system, globally integrated, well capitalized, adequately-regulated banks. our country suffer decade result mistake economic policies. the great recession show current state preparation confront mitigate impact adverse scenario much good past, path must continue. undoubtedly, still many thing improve. attain level development prosperity reach whole population still far away, least right track. thank you. bi central bankers’ speech 1 charles i plosser: restore central bank crisis speech mr charles i plosser, president chief executive officer federal reserve bank philadelphia, conference global interdependence center / bank france, paris, 26 march 2012. * * * the view express today necessarily federal reserve system fomc. introduction i delight today beautiful city honor serve distinguish panel friend colleagues. david kotok guide force behind gic conference past several years. he team gic never fail gather interest knowledgeable group people discus important topic truly global issues. so, i want thank gic effort contributions. i also want thank hosts, christian noyer banque de france. i go take little different tack subject matter gathering. rather focus new orthodoxy take away financial crisis, i want argue need restore old orthodoxy. david suggest want conversation important issues, i intend somewhat provocative effort stimulate conversation. a usual, i want stress view necessarily colleague federal reserve system. i focus remark two relate topic emerge consequence crisis. the first relation monetary policy fiscal policy. the second topic involve role central bank’s balance sheet policy tool. these issue i believe fundamental importance role central bank economies. the relationship monetary fiscal policy let begin share think appropriate relationship monetary fiscal policies. in wake financial crisis ensue recession, many country around world respond significant increase government spending. some increase come economist call automatic stabilizers. but also dramatic expansion budget deficit attributable deliberate effort apply fiscal stimulus improve economic outcomes. this expansion government spend significant u.s., also occur countries. so monetary policy? well, turn out, great deal. it widely understand government finance expenditure taxation, debt – is, future tax – print money. in sense, monetary policy fiscal policy intertwine government budget constraint. for good reasons, though, society converge toward arrangement provide fair degree separation function central bank fiscal authorities. for example, world fiat currency, central bank generally assign responsibility establish maintain value purchase power nation’s unit account. yet, task undermined, completely subverted, fiscal authority set budget manner ultimately require central bank finance 2 bi central bankers’ speech government expenditure significant amount seigniorage lieu current future tax revenue.1 the ability central bank maintain price stability also undermine central bank venture realm fiscal policy. history teach u unless government constrain institutionally constitutionally, often resort print press try escape appear intractable budget problems. and budget problem face many government today are, indeed, challenging. but history also teach u resort print press lieu make tough fiscal choice recipe create substantial inflation and, cases, hyperinflation. awareness long-term consequence excessive money creation reason past 60 years, country country move establish maintain independent central bank – is, central bank ability make monetary policy decision free short-run political interference. without protection afford independence, temptation government exploit print press avoid fiscal discipline often great. thus, simply good governance wise economic policy maintain healthy separation responsible tax spend policy responsible money creation. it equally important central bank grant independence constrain use authority engage activity appropriately belong fiscal authority private sector. in words, independence come responsibility accountability. central bank breach boundary risk legitimacy, credibility, ultimately, independence. give benefit central bank independence, could prove costly society long run. there number approach place limit independent central bank boundary monetary policy fiscal policy remain clear. first, central bank give narrow mandate, price stability. in fact, prominent trend last 25 years. many major central bank price stability sole primary mandate. second, central bank restrict type asset hold balance sheet. this limit ability engage credit policy resource allocation rightfully belong purview fiscal authority private marketplace. and third, central bank conduct monetary policy systematic rule-like manner, limit scope discretionary action might cross boundary monetary fiscal policies. milton friedman’s famous k-percent money growth rule one example, taylor-type rule set interest rate instrument. unfortunately, past years, combination financial crisis sustain fiscal imbalance lead breakdown institutional framework previously accept barrier monetary fiscal policies. the pressure come sides. government push central bank exceed monetary boundaries, central bank step area previously view appropriate independent central bank. let offer couple example illustrate pressures. first, despite well-known benefit price stability, call many country abandon commitment create high inflation devalue outstanding nominal government private debt. that is, suggest attempt use inflation solve debt overhang problem. 1 see thomas sargent neil wallace, “some unpleasant monetarist arithmetic”, federal reserve bank minneapolis quarterly review, 5 (fall 1981), pp 1–17. bi central bankers’ speech 3 such policy intend redistribute loss nominal debt borrower lenders. use inflation backdoor fiscal choice bad policy, view. pressure central bank also show channels. in circles, become fashionable invoke lender-of-last-resort argument rationale central bank lend “insolvent” organizations, either fail business or, cases, fail governments. such argument go beyond well-accepted principle establish walter bagehot, write 1873 classic lombard street central banker could limit systemic risk bank crisis “lending freely penalty rate good collateral”. central banker abandon basic bagehot principle last year replace clear alternative. indeed, action often confuse unpredictable lack coherent framework. i believe central bank need think hard exercise important role. we need well-articulated systematic approach actions. otherwise, action exacerbate moral hazard encourage excessive risk-taking, thus sow seed next crisis. unfortunately, neither financial reform central bank adequately address dilemma. breach boundary confine fiscal authority ask central bank heavy lifting. the feed central bank undertake action blur distinction monetary policy fiscal policy, adopt credit policy favor industry asset class relative others. such step take sincere belief absolutely necessary address challenge pose financial crisis. the clear example see federal reserve establish credit facility support market commercial paper asset-backed securities. most notable effort feed support house market purchase mortgage-backed securities. these credit allocation breach traditional boundary fiscal monetary policy, generate point public criticism fed. once central bank venture fiscal policy, likely find increase pressure private sector, financial markets, government use balance sheet substitute fiscal decisions. such action central bank create form moral hazard, market government come see central bank instrument fiscal policy, thus undermine incentive fiscal discipline. this pressure threaten central bank’s independence conduct monetary policy thereby undermine monetary policy’s effectiveness achieve mandate. in view, blur boundary monetary fiscal policy fraught risks. a i said, boundary arise good reason, ignore breach peril. i believe must seek way restore boundaries. the central bank’s balance-sheet policy another relate issue face central bank arise degree central bank expand balance sheets. there two dimension issue. one composition balance sheet. in u.s., example, balance sheet federal reserve change one make almost entirely short-term u.s. treasury security one mostly long-term treasuries, plus significant quantity long-term mortgage-backed securities. this concentration housing-related security problematic form credit allocation thus violate monetary/fiscal policy boundary i mentioned. the second aspect overall size balance sheet. many central bank expand balance sheet effort ease monetary policy usual policy instrument – interest rate – reach zero low bound. do central banker anticipate balance sheet shrink normal level move away zero low 4 bi central bankers’ speech bound? be desirable so? or monetary policy see another tool, even normal times? some suggest central bank adopt regime monetary policy rate interest rate reserve rather market interest rate, federal fund rate. this would permit central bank manage balance sheet separately monetary instrument, free respond liquidity demand financial system without alter stance monetary policy. in principle, would take pressure central bank shrink balance sheet current high level simply rely raise interest rate reserve tighten monetary policy. the alternative return traditional operate regime central bank set target market interest rate, federal fund rate u.s., interest rate reserves. implement regime would require small balance sheet. i skeptical operate regime give central bank new tool without boundary constraints. without understanding, even theory, balance sheet manipulated, open door give vast new discretionary ability central banks. this violate principle draw clear boundary monetary policy fiscal policy. when market government come believe central bank freely expand balance sheet without directly impact stance monetary policy, i believe various political private interest come forward long list good causes, rescues, fund could used. economic theory practice teach u monetary policy work best clear objective systematic approach achieve objectives. grant vast amount discretion central bank expectation cure economic ill substitute lack fiscal discipline dangerous road follow. in june, federal reserve’s open market committee outline principle would guide exit period extraordinary monetary accommodation. in view, principle represent important first step fomc’s attempt restore boundary monetary fiscal policies. in particular, fomc clearly state desire return operate environment federal fund rate primary instrument monetary policy. to achieve objective, feed shrink balance sheet normal level. i interpret say balance sheet view new independent instrument monetary policy normal times. the exit principle also indicate committee’s desire return fed’s balance sheet all-treasuries portfolio. this re-establishes idea feed use balance sheet actively engage credit allocations. in speeches, i outline framework i term “new accord” federal reserve treasury. it would enable central bank act emergency request treasury fiscal authorities, would clear front non-treasury asset accrue central bank’s balance sheet would swap government security within specify period time. this would ensure fiscal policy decision remain purview fiscal authorities, central bank. summary to summarize, important government maintain independent central bank good able achieve mandates. it also sound policy limit discretionary ability central bank engage policy fundamentally belong fiscal authority private markets. establish maintain clear boundary monetary fiscal policy protect independence central bank ability carry core mandate – maintain price stability. clear boundary resist use balance sheet new policy tool would also improve fiscal discipline make difficult fiscal authority resort print press solution unsustainable budget policies. bi central bankers’ speech 1 h r khan: towards

much 24 per cent liability form government securities, statutory liquidity ratio (slr) framework, permit classify hold held-to-maturity (htm) view protect balance sheet volatility arise interest rate fluctuations. with dominant part outstanding stock thus reside htm portfolio market low volume trade natural. the term htm, however, appear illusion security almost never hold till mature sell opportune time. such investment strategy impact liquidity security, particular, market, general. while change imminent account norm international financial report standard (ifrs) may force transformation strategy banks, need debate issue reduction htm category dispensation, albeit phase manner. in corporate debt market, investor base mostly confine banks, insurance companies, provident funds, primary dealer (pds) pension funds. of late, retail investor show interest corporate bonds, especially bond issue infrastructure company entail tax incentive. while investor shy debt issue top rat firms, reluctant subscribe low rat instruments. this anomaly low rat company access bank financing. credit enhancement bank perhaps make instrument attractive investors. but flip side, credit enhancement essentially involve transfer credit risk bank hamper development corporate bond market stunt price discovery process also increase risk bank system. the focus must de-risking bank system, time, building/encouraging institution provide credit enhancement. investor interest interest rate derivative market ought dictate exposure cash market. while investors’ cash market exposure substantial increase time, account hedge htm classification insulate holder market risk. therefore, observe skew limit participation, result shallow markets. though interest rate swap (irs) launch 1999, product market volume grow substantially overnight index swap base overnight money market index. here participation significantly broad-based. foreign bank (owning 7 percent bank sector assets) dominant player irs market follow private sector bank participation public sector bank much 74 percent bank sector asset remain miniscule. notwithstanding large trade volume value contract outstanding, skew participation lead price anomaly also put question mark economic utility product. issuer sovereign security dominate fix income market almost everywhere. in india too, central state government remain main issuers. two observation order. 4 bi central bankers’ speech traditionally, marketable security central state government constitute part respective liability and, therefore, size government bond market measure outstanding stock relatively small compare debt-to-gdp ratio. secondly, one exclude security hold reserve bank open market operation (omo) buy-and-hold entities, market size become even smaller. in recent times, market borrow emerge large source finance fiscal deficit. the auction base issuance process transparent publication auction calendar well advance enable market participant plan investments. the large supply securities, due enhance borrowings, enable creation benchmark security sufficient outstanding stock issuance across yield curve. the issuance across risk-free yield curve turn provide benchmark valuation bonds/financial assets. despite economic recovery 2010–11 resumption fiscal consolidation path, market borrow government remain elevate level india. the union budget india 2011–12 estimate gross fiscal deficit (gfd) 4128.17 billion budget gross market borrow 4170.00 billion. the market borrowings, however, date security current year increase 930.00 billion due shortfall finance items, primarily due moderation growth rate economy increase expenditure. besides inflationary implications, large overhang debt increase annual borrow impede growth flow resource private sector way loan bonds. more importantly, lack fiscal flexibility facilitate creation limit number benchmark active consolidation illiquid securities. this fragment g-sec market neither beneficial issuer investors. in spite passive consolidation government security undertake reserve bank india, market remain fragment many stock relatively small size. nearly fifty percent outstanding stock volume le 200 billion. there merit pursue active consolidation focus buy-backs switch build volume improve liquidity. reserve bank consultation government achieve degree consolidation g-sec near future. reserve bank recently constitute work group (chairman: shri. r gandhi, executive director, reserve bank india) examine way improve liquidity government security interest rate derivative market well suggest measure active consolidation securities. corporates many develop market – predominantly u increasingly jurisdiction – mark preference tap bond market rather seek bank loan meet external finance requirements. in india, however, company continue depend bank system fund ease avail bank finance, absence credit risk mitigation mechanism host factors, as, absence sound bankruptcy framework lack active interest long-term investor like insurance companies. an examination issuer profile corporate bond reveal issuance dominate bank public sector companies. private sector, non-financial corporate issuer represent small proportion. a mention earlier, issuer triple-a rat raise fund ease market compare firm low ratings. private placement mostly dominate primary segment corporate debt market account 98 per cent total issuance corporate debt (2010–11) india. corporates prefer raise fund private placement public issuance operational ease issuance private placement minimum disclosures, low cost issuance speed raise funds. the issuance process also impact costs, as, stamp duties, transfer costs, etc. need rationalisation. preference private bi central bankers’ speech 5 placement also dictate profile investor mostly institutional narrow base that. instrument for market meet diverse fund hedge need participants, need wide array instrument product would also offer benefit diversification portfolio. in process development new instruments, reserve bank’s endeavour ensure calibrate orderly development market emphasis prudent risk management promotion financial stability. over years, several instrument like zero-coupon bonds, capital-indexed bonds, float rate bonds, strip bond call put option introduce wide consultation market participant product feature comparable popular liquid instrument elsewhere. in case short term instrument cash management bill (cmbs) emerge new class instrument provide opportunity secured, short term investment sovereign paper. the size frequency issuance cmb likely increase give uncertainty cash inflow outflow government whose income expenditure grow rapidly. issues, as, short notice issue cmbs, demand treasury bills, structure tenors, may come way large demand cmbs. there plan launch new long-term instrument – inflation index bond (iibs) wherein capital interest would provide protection inflation. it expect institutional investors, as, pension fund insurance company would exhibit interest invest iibs. the expectation base fact iibs give investor long-term asset fix long-term real yield, insulate inflation real yield index actual inflation. further, also contemplate increase non-competitive portion iibs significant participation retail investor instruments. plain vanilla fix coupon bonds, however, remain mainstay issuances. with exception innovative product like collateralize borrow lend obligation (cblo), market display appetite instrument vary structure. a similar response pattern observe respect product interest rate future (irfs) (based 10-year bond 91-day t-bill), repo corporate bond new issuance float rate bond (frb). one plausible reason lack interest illiquidity underlie bond market. the dilemma participant want trade till liquidity improves, liquidity improve till participant trade give rise typical “chicken egg problem”. the bottomline market participant need active trade across yield curve across product require urgent serious introspection them. recently, guideline interest rate future two five year tenor issued. these future cash settle settlement price compute poll process manage fimmda. a product design finalise due consultation market participant issue illiquidity underlie cash market deal permit cash settlement, expect product attract active interest. another significant step extension period short sale three months, effective february 1, 2012. this enable participant express interest rate view effectively expect give fillip term repo market. similarly, credit default swap (cds) corporate bond introduce facilitate hedge credit risk associate corporate bonds. introduction credit enhancement corporate bond cd may also increase investors’ interest corporate bonds. several episode international market underscore importance risk management use financial products. learn episodes, approach reserve 6 bi central bankers’ speech bank india towards regulation risk management orient ensure orderly development financial market products. this objective achieve establish efficient infrastructure, address systemic stability issue also support market development. the pre-dominant motivation strike balance systemic stability financial market development. infrastructure market infrastructure comprehensive term include entire gamut arrangement transaction carry settle efficient safe manner. infrastructure play important role development market want efficient, transparent robust infrastructure keep market participant away one extreme cause market crisis other. reserve bank india pursue strategy creation efficient market infrastructure enhance market activity also create support institutional framework. in government bond market, state art primary issuance process electronic bid fast process capabilities, efficient, completely dematerialize depository system, delivery-versus-payment (dvp) mode settlement, real time gross settlement (rtgs), electronic trade platform (negotiated deal system negotiate deal systems-order matching) separate central counter party (ccp) clear corporation india ltd (ccil) guarantee settlement among step take reserve bank year towards end. in fact, thank efforts, india boast one emerge country state art financial market infrastructure g-sec market. create robust

international consensus evolve areas. to strengthen market infrastructure corporate bond reserve bank india, consultation security exchange board india (sebi), permit clear house exchange transitory pool account facility reserve bank. this facilitate settlement otc corporate bond transaction dvp-i basis. the infrastructure bolster support market body fimmda establish operate report platform corporate bonds, commercial paper (cps)/certificates deposit (cds). this collaboration regulator market participant lay foundation enhance transparency vibrancy market. the financial crisis 2008 reveal several deficiency otc derivative market. the importance improve transparency, mitigate systemic risk protect market abuse come forefront. in september 2009, g-20 leader mandate otc derivative contract report trade repositories; standardise otc derivative contract trade exchange electronic trade platforms, appropriate; standardise otc derivative contract clear ccps. in regard, considerable amount work infrastructure make otc derivative trade transparent do india. a early 2007, reserve bank mandate report inter-institution otc interest rate derivative platform develop purpose ccil. introduction cd accompany put place report arrangement simultaneously. on basis recommendation work group, comprehensive efficient single point report arrangement interest rate foreign exchange derivative also process implementation. bi central bankers’ speech 7 intermediary intermediary play important role development market facilitate transactions, provide value-added service increase efficacy processes. with regard bond market india, i would like elucidate role four major intermediary viz. pd system, industry association like fimmda/pdai, gild mutual fund infrastructure development fund (idfs), offing. the system primary dealer (pds) establish provide support market borrow programme government also impart liquidity secondary markets. subsequent withdrawal reserve bank india primary market, mandate fiscal responsibility budget management act 2003, pd system underwrite entire government india market borrowing. pd actively support bond issuance role successful completion sizeable issuance programme past three year commendable. recently, reserve bank revise guideline authorisation pd focus market experience well increase retail/mid-segment investor participation widen investor base. the revise guideline prescribe season requirement least one year prior submission application, reasonable experience g-sec market least 15 per cent asset turnover g-sec commitment achieve minimum turnover 75 per cent minimum nof g-sec behalf retail/mid segment clients. we expect pd would continue support market borrow programmes, act market maker provide fillip secondary market retail investor proactively deal financial product cds, irf, etc. reserve bank also explore possibility enable banks/pds make market corporate bond appropriate supportive measures. change nature financial market necessitate organisations, as, fimmda pdai, play proactive role bring orderliness market activity desire level discipline amongst market participants. reserve bank india regularly engage fimmda pdai various issue policy provide input perspective market participants. fimmda entrust responsibilities, as, publish model price g-sec non-g-sec use valuations, formulation model code conduct market participants, development operationalization critical market infrastructure like report platform corporate bonds, repo corporate bonds, cps cds, accreditation broke otc interest rate derivative market, development daily cd curve valuation open positions, etc. the entrust responsibility activities/functions fimmda underlie market clearly indicate potential self-regulatory role. there is, however, urgent need fimmda strengthen itself, build competencies, technical financial, broaden mission carry task commensurate development market undertake additional responsibility self regulatory organization (sro). i suggest fimmda may draw action plan direction clear goal achieve appropriate time lines. gild mutual fund industry grow manifold mutual fund (mfs) continue invest predominantly short-tenor fix income assets, thereby exhibit low demand g-sec market. this cause concern require urgent need examine way huge requirement investment infrastructure sector underscore importance idfs. reserve bank india has, special case, permit several prudential relaxation set idf include enhance exposure norms, assign low risk weight capital adequacy purposes, etc. reserve bank india also allow investment full repatriation basis new class eligible non-resident investor (viz. sovereign wealth funds, multilateral agencies, pension funds, insurance funds, endowment funds) rupee foreign currency denominate bond issue idf-nbfcs register reserve bank india rupee denominate unit issue idf-mfs set sebi register mutual funds. give calibrate approach towards open debt market foreign investors, investment (excluding nris) will, 8 bi central bankers’ speech however, within overall cap us$ 10 billion (which would within overall cap us$ 25 billion fii investment infrastructure debt). idf will, day come, act major source channelize huge quantum fund long term domestic foreign investor corporate debt market critical infrastructure sector country indeed gamechanger potential redefine various facet markets. incentive incentives, positive negative, play major role shape human behaviour market exception rule. for illustrative purposes, i would like cite instance incentive play important role shape development debt markets. existence easy access bank loan incentivised corporates approach bank rather rely corporate bond market. this excessive reliance bank finance hamper development deep liquid bond market partly responsible financial instability asian crisis. the illiquidity indian corporate bond market attribute apparent preference corporates finance requirement private placement rely external commercial borrowings. the level complexity stamp duty corporate bond encourage arbitrage-based approach corporate finance decision often tax-driven rather strategy-driven. differential tax treatment complicate matter tend incentivise certain investors, e.g., insurance company mutual fund exempt tds interest income corporate bonds. the regulatory dispensation htm classification protect balance sheet bank encourage invest g-sec promote illiquidity government bonds. different incentive structure treasury public sector bank private/foreign bank treasury partly explain level participation derivative market spite existence similar risk balance sheets. while difference incentive public private bank regard treasury operation exist, reason lack interest show public sector spite fact hold high interest rate sensitive portfolio balance sheet capability participate market need examine depth debated. an understand incentive essential policy maker market participant market activity direct towards attainment objective efficiency effectiveness. while reserve bank try align incentive regulation supervision, regulation could create unintended incentives/disincentives case requirement regard “htm”. for instance, ability buy cd without underlie result perverse incentive develop markets. reserve bank, frame cd policy, design regulation curb skew incentive restrict user buy cd hedge underlie exposure. physical settlement mandate credit event. a nuanced understand incentive would help design regulation promote market development without jeopardise financial stability. innovation with world still smart financial crisis believe unleash “innovative” products, one talk innovation degree caution. financial innovation essential feature history development financial markets. bypass tax regulatory regime has, course, major motivation innovation, social economic utility often questionable. an example negotiable order withdrawal (now) account u result regulation q restriction interest demand deposits. but innovation motivate need match need investor issuer make possible advancement technology knowledge essential evolution financial markets. one cite many bi central bankers’ speech 9 example – demat accounts, atms, credit debit cards, explosion option contracts, inflation index bonds, fix rate capital securities, irs, cd on. it true financial innovation also result complex product package redstribute risk way scarcely understood. a observe lord turner uk financial service authority, financial innovation produce product dubious social value. it vital understand financial innovation objective process cater product felt need market particular wide economy general without compromise financial stability. the old adage “innovate perish” read “innovate caution perish” far financial sector concerned. innovation risk two aspect financial market great deal tension. a such, inadequate risk management framework make difference survival death institution, particularly financial institution. several episode international market repeatedly underscore – orange county, ltcm, bcci, enron, barings, northern rock – one go on. we see innovative product like cdos innovative institutional arrangement like spvs without adequate appreciation embed risk appropriate regulatory framework risk management could wreck havoc. near home, ill-judged use exotic foreign exchange derivative corporates lead substantial loss create fracas bank sell products. the respective board financial institution need ensure appropriate oversight function treasuries. the board must put place risk policy also ensure strict adherence limit standards. there clear procedure assess monitor risk, adequate accountability, clear line authority separation duties. the approach reserve bank towards regulation risk management orient ensure development financial market product establish supportive infrastructure, address systemic stability issue also support market development. maintain balance systemic stability financial market development remain main focus reserve bank india. therefore, emphasis towards creation robust regulatory/supervisory framework prevent systemic weaknesses. often, tendency look towards advance market mimic practice without subject product practice customization would require eco-system adopt country. like meiji restoration scientists, receive scientific train various european countries, return japan want carry forward work language receive instruction, financial sector professional tendency crave product familiar with. the success innovative products/processes cblo, variant tri-partite agreement, infrastructure electronic trade platform (nds, nd call nds-om) transitory pool account settlement corporate bond book reserve bank india strengthen case look inwards inspiration evolve customize innovation in india, innovation rather mute even reception new product rather insipid. the regulator innovative products; concern neither innovation orient towards skirt regulatory regime lead build-up systemic risk. it imperative market participant industry association ensure adequate risk management system corporate governance structure place embark innovations. a may observed, reserve bank follow continue follow measure approach introduction innovative product adoption appropriate risk management framework suitable eco-system. 10 bi central bankers’ speech conclude remark to summarize, i briefly describe 7i framework focus structure development debt market possible future direction invigorate debt market reference framework. we need realise development adoption new product emerge market economy often easy. it require considerable amount patience, hand-holding fine-tune depend need respective eco-system. it equally important remember market liquidity consequence active participation market players. new financial product instrument design cater fund hedge need need actively use market participant without, course, increase risk financial stability jeopardise interest ultimate end-users/customers. the lack market interest, any, must introspect debate seriously draw remedial action plan. at end, i would like reiterate context develop market like india reserve bank india, concern regulators, government, fimmda, pdai market participant joint stakeholder development debt markets. all u work towards common objective conclave like would go long way generate useful insight input direction. with think i wish conference participant best productive useful deliberation mix pleasure explore beautiful country. i thank fimmda pdai give opportunity share think you. i would also like specially thank dr.zeti akhtar aziz, governor, bank negara malaysia spend valuable time midst share insight us. bi central bankers’ speech 1 k c chakrabarty: mobile bank india – regulation rationale address dr k c chakrabarty, deputy governor reserve bank india, international bank summit “regulation cross-border mobile payment regional financial integration”, mumbai, 29 march 2012. * * * assistance provide shri k sivaraman m radha somakumar preparation address gratefully acknowledged. m moono mupotola, manager, african development bank group, mr somak ghosh, group president, development & sustainable banking, yes bank, distinguish guests, participants, member print electronic media, lady gentlemen. 1. i delight present international bank summit “regulation cross-border mobile payment regional financial integration” share think subject mobile phone powerful tool enable financial services. i thank yes bank african development bank extend invitation me. 2. technology has, good worse, undeniably bring change, hitherto unimagined, life styles. the transformation bring technology area delivery financial service has, thankfully, better. internet bank complement core bank solution implement banks, mobile banking, card base electronic transaction bank atm merchant location (both physical e-commerce sites) offer variety channel bank customer conduct payment transactions. mobile medium 3. in context, question often get debate is: mobile device appropriate delivery channel financial services? besides technology capability transmit financial information efficient, secure cost-effective manner enable development mobile base application banking, significant fact idea ubiquity mobile phones. the number mobile phone country say near billion phones. hence, bank financial services, already come long way branch level service customer’s home desktop laptop, reach much large section society, include financially excluded, medium mobile phones. besides reach mobile, another reason mobile appropriate medium. what bank transaction? what purpose traditional cheque serve? in india, forget carry cheque book withdrawal funds, provide call withdrawal slip. a cheque withdrawal slip personalize direction banker put bank transaction behalf. the authentication achieve signature. but traditional method expensive. a mobile phone achieve purpose enable send personalize secure instruction banker undertake transaction behalf. if bank achieve seamless integration cbs, transaction get automatically registered. but transaction use mobile far le expensive traditional alternatives. more importantly, hold key since mobile pocket need depend bank time rush undertake bank transactions. this perhaps important advantage mobile alternate payment methods. the mobile phone can, therefore, empower common man conduct payment transaction time anywhere. it is, 2 bi central bankers’ speech therefore, wonder mobile payment mobile bank hotly debate various forums, india abroad. bank-led technology neutral approach 4. the reserve bank recognize potential mobile phone channel conduct financial service quite time back first set guideline take way back october, 2008. but reserve bank consciously opt bank-led model although approach remain technology neutral. mobile phone delivery channel great potential security cost aspect address serve large number transaction small size. it remember use mobile bank financial inclusion cannot become viable proposition standalone basis purpose achieve meaningful financial inclusion. to make viable attract volumes, provide package along product services. this achieve entity provide add-on service like emergency entrepreneurial credit, save facilities, product service insurance, besides remittances. this mainstream regulate entity like bank fit in. true, alternative provide nbfcs scale reach comparable banks. they serve niche market viable long run. but, indeed facilitate financial inclusion. so, indian model remain bank-led model bank partner msps (mobile service providers) entity achieve national goal inclusive growth. in endeavour enable enhancement mobile bank term nature service offer value transaction permit mobile banking, constant dialogue stake holder intervene liberalise mobile bank guideline phase manner. step take rbi mobile bank 5. the mobile bank guideline modify december 2011, permit bank facilitate fund transfer personal remittance purchase good service without ceiling. in words, bank free decide limits, base risk perception. in respect small value transaction fund transfer r 5,000/- effect mobile phone without need end-to-end encryption. 6. in order provide domestic money transfer facility especially migrant population access formal bank channels, domestic money transfer guideline issue october 2011. remittance bank account cash pay beneficiary bank account atm/bc outlet also facilitate r 10,000/- per transaction subject monthly cap r 25,000/- per beneficiary remit bank obtain full name address beneficiary. similarly cash pay facility permit r 5,000/- per transaction subject monthly cap r 25,000/- per remitter transfer fund bank account. remitter provide minimum detail (name address). bank need take document proof address. 7. the interbank mobile payment service (imps) operate national payment corporation india (npci) approval reserve bank enhance efficiency mobile bank enable real time transfer fund bank account provide centralise inter-operable interbank settlement service mobile bank transaction confirmation features. current status mobile bank india 8. presently, 65 bank approve conduct mobile bank 47 bank commence offer services. transaction mobile bank bi central bankers’ speech 3 show uptrend. during february 2012, 2.8 million transaction close rs. 1961.23 million transacted; 300 % increase volume 200% value term compare 0.7 million transaction close r 616.19 million february 2011. a little 12.23 million bank customer far register mobile bank services. these number really hearten consider follow facts: i. at end january 2012, total wireless subscriber base 936 million, include 313 million subscription rural areas. ii. only 55% people india deposit accounts. it evident mobile phone reach household basic bank services. bank really make significant penetration even among exist customer extend mobile bank services. however, me, important concern significant percentage financially exclude population potential mobile phone extend financial service still tapped. 9. reserve bank always conscious need bring every citizen country within ambit bank system. appreciate difficulty bank viably operate bank branch every village, permit appoint business correspondent (bcs) address this. on demand industry, also permit “for profit” company appoint business correspondents, would enable healthy fusion expertise bank communication agency network non-banks, specially msps. though partnership bank msps happening, pace far slow process need expedited. some generic issue 10. while subject, let discus generic issue relate e-money often quizzed. i. be e-money india overregulated elsewhere high level tolerance towards anonymity e-money transactions? non-banks india issue semi-closed prepay instruments, provide cash withdrawals. be kyc requirement justify cases, usage card result credit bank account merchants? ii. today, overseas credit/debit card could use withdraw cash atm potential source money launder international law come way share complete information source funds? in light threat, rbi government obsess kyc aml issues? 11. a know, e-money prepay payment instruments, whether e-wallets, m-wallets, prepay card paper coupons, bring regulation first time enactment payment settlement system act, 2007. the act come force august 2008 mention earlier, first guideline e-money introduce april 2009, since liberalize significant way. we allow issue prepay instrument rs.10,000 exclusive use purchase travel ticket without need kyc. it must, however, remember certain statutory requirement prevention money launder act need met. however, within exist statute, bank constantly review position identify area impair growth e-money initiate remedial measures. we record e-money secure way payment need promote ensure objective move towards le cash society. 4 bi central bankers’ speech should msps allow standalone basis? 12. on question msps allow money transfer service standalone basis, perhaps measure would help provide alternative mode exist money order / instant money order offer services, though would difficult say one would cheap option. the department post also 1.5 lakh post office delivery services, though imo extend little 3000 post offices. the msps technology impressive agent network deliver service efficiency. it backdrop, non-bank entity permit enable prepay card card transfers. the model would, therefore, benefit financially exclude population urban rural area send receive money convenient way. 13. it still clear demand standalone msp model persist allow far superior model collaboration rather competition expect result win win situation all? why stake holder insist inferior alternative? be insurmountable problem collaborative model? if yes, they? 14. i aware issue come regard relate (i) own customer? (ii) control transactions? ha worthwhile attempt resolve mature way? i would urge upon bank msps get act together quickly. on behalf rbi let assure stand commit success collaboration would remove genuine obstacles! enable cross border payment medium mobile phone 15. should mobile initiate cross border transaction enabled? to mind cannot uniform standard this. the issue country specific country take decision base need, issue threat perception. a far india concerned, even bad forex crisis, country careful quality inflows. secondly, rule require forex flow rout bank institution others specifically authorize undertake forex transactions. give background, even agree mobile phone use trigger transfer fund overseas non-resident beneficiary’s bank account india. the bank responsible ensure quality funds, kyc, etc. we fact permit bank enable cross border bank account bank account remittance medium mobile subject clearance local regulator. at beneficiary end, enable load fund receive overseas money transfer service scheme (mtss) scheme prepay payment instrument issue bank, could include mobile wallet, recipient funds. conclusion 16. before i conclude, let reiterate mobile phone potent tool facilitate financial service thus financial inclusion. it potential security cost aspect addressed. the medium mobile sub-serve small transaction must become cheaper. the reserve bank well consider reason opt bank-led model complete model delivery wide range services. just cannot tele-medicine without doctor, cannot mobile bank without bank! the bc model would help complement mobile banking, customer need approach bcs/atms hard currency requirement conduct bank transaction anywhere mobile phones, provide course, tele-connectivity issues! a mention earlier, social responsibility everyone, resource power, contribute success financial inclusion. while guideline m-power financial services, necessary us, rbi, bank msps particular, bi central bankers’ speech 5 take forward 4th gear convince common man power mobile phone financial transaction also safety security aspect mobile banking, provide level comfort. i believe success story mobile bank state like bihar, thank initiative certain ngo banks, enable financial inclusion make le literate people mobile banking-savvy. this need emulate adequate publicity education achieve m-powerment significant way. i thank give opportunity address august gathering. i hope issue i raise discuss summit solution found. i wish best. bi central bankers’ speech 1 jens weidmann: rebalancing europe speech dr jens weidmann, president deutsche bundesbank, chatham house, london, 28 march 2012. * * * 1. introduction thank you, mr popham, word welcome. this special event me. chatham house hold great respect almost hundred year – uk also germany across globe. the privilege i feel underscore distinguish audience gather today. i feel truly honour speak famous venue. about six week ago, i come across article frankfurter allgemeine zeitung, lead german daily. the author article, economist london school economics, choose title: “the fanatic central bank – will, always one way”. well, i come wear hat – rather suit – central banker, “bundesbanker” that. the idea i go present might therefore see fairly conservative principled. but, i hope convince you, still well short fanatic. i come deliver lecture. i am, fact, deeply convince share discuss idea lead good solutions. during next quarter hour, i try merely outline line reason order leave enough scope discussion. but first, brief look currently stand challenge times. 2. europe balance we face crisis long confine individual countries. throughout europe, weigh heavily people’s mind challenge viability monetary union current form. it obvious u crisis resolve future crisis must prevented. the first step must contain crisis, prevent spreading. to end, policymakers surround crisis “wall money”, meanwhile reach height €500 billion. ring-fencing certainly sensible approach, like “tower babel” “wall money” never reach heaven. if continue make high higher, will, fact, run worldly constraint – financial political ones. and, whether like not, also change rule game monetary union might set incentive lead new problem future. in case, must realise money put table buy u last solution crisis. a mervyn king frequently rightly states: “all buy time” – time must use address root cause crisis. i think agree crisis two major causes: first, macroeconomic imbalance build recent year and, second, public private debt balloon member states. both problem must eventually addressed. europe rebalanced. but view achieve goal differ. give unprecedented character crisis complexity, seem natural me. still, i hope fault line converge point future consistent approach emerge. 2 bi central bankers’ speech now, specific question address? 3. rebalancing europe frankly, million question answered. but simplify matter bite keep outline reasonably short, i ignore them. altogether, i address two question today. the first one relate macroeconomic imbalances. their prominent symptom diverge current account – country greece run persistent current account deficits, country germany run persistent surpluses. the question is: country adjust? those current account deficit? those surplus? both? the second question look additional problem public debt. it obvious public deficit bring significantly. but sensible consolidate simultaneously correct macroeconomic imbalance deleveraging rebalancing current account? 3.1 rebalancing current account let u begin look first question. normally, exchange rate movement important channel unsustainable current account position correct – eventually, deficit country devalue, surplus country revalue currencies. the reaction trigger import export help bring current account close balance. in monetary union, however, obviously long option. spain long peseta devalue; germany long deutsche mark revalue. other thing must therefore give instead: prices, wages, employment output. which bring back original question: country adjust? the typical german position could describe follows: deficit country must adjust. they must address structural problems. they must reduce domestic demand. they must become competitive must increase exports. but position go uncontested. indeed, number renowned economist take different view. they fear would much burden deficit country alone adjust. they consequently suggest surplus country shoulder least part burden. to avoid confusion, important make distinction point. a distinction adjustment burden entails. only burden shared. i think people would agree adjustment take place deficit countries. it true surplus country benefit high exports. but ultimately, deficit country operate unsustainable model define credit-fuelled boom domestic demand, model reformed. not every deficit country need reforms, course, require sort adjustment. by contrast, sometimes suggest rebalancing undertake “meeting middle”, make surplus country germany le competitive. this suggestion imply adjustment would share deficit surplus countries. but question ask is: “where would take us?” the competitive edge economy enjoy come free. it result often painful adjustment among worker within firms. give part ease pressure deficit country might make country good relative terms. but would make everyone poor absolute terms? bi central bankers’ speech 3 we acknowledge europe island part globalise world. and global level, compete economy unite state china. i ask you: we, europe succeed world willingly give hard-won competitiveness? to succeed, europe whole become dynamic, inventive productive. to make popular comparison: imagine champion league barcelona deny lionel messi teams, include bayern munich, good chance winning. would sensible way rebalance competitiveness europe’s top teams? in view, gain nothing try rebalance actively shift weight end scale. a second point this: large proportion current account deficit surplus result trade country outside euro area. even surplus country expand imports, would help fellow euro-area country increase export marginally. the latter must first offer something euro-area country would want buy rather someone else. to achieve this, deficit country must take measure unlock potential increase productivity improve competitiveness. this would considerably reduce cost adjustment time takes. the oecd organisation year promote long list reforms. these aim make labour market flexible, open product market make public sector efficient. a number reform already announce and, instances, implement country portugal, spain italy. and already see promise results, especially ireland. but despite first steps, still long way go. such adjustment initially place huge burden people deficit countries, even take account extraordinary boom year prior crisis. but burden heavy bear? a central fear deflation. unless productivity growth increase miraculously, certainly true price wage fall many cases. but must confuse one-time adjustment full-fledged deflation. and must acknowledge surplus country already help ease burden adjustment. what rescue package publicly guarantee interim loan facilitate adjustment? another thing forget this: course, surplus country eventually affect deficit country adjust. not every country earth run current account surplus – unless trade “space aliens” paul krugman recently suggested. a deficit country import le become competitive exporters, surplus country run low surpluses. the key issue whether happen result market process result effort fine-tune aggregate demand euro area. i would welcome former, i object latter. 3.2 consolidate public budget reform aim promote growth important part adjustment process – i think everybody agree that. but consolidation? a frequently cite argument would much burden country correct macroeconomic imbalance consolidate public debt time. the result, said, would vicious cycle fall demand slow economic growth. it true consolidation might, normal circumstances, dampen economic growth. but structural reform consolidation often hard disentangle. for example, 4 bi central bankers’ speech bloat public sector generous pension system drag growth burden budget. and another question is: normal times? it quite obvious everybody view public debt major threat. the market do, politician people street do. a wide-spread lack trust public finance weigh heavily growth: uncertainty regard potential future tax increases, fund cost rise private public creditor alike. in situation, consolidation might inspire confidence actually help economy grow. in view, risk consolidation consequently exaggerated. in case, little alternative. the chancellor exchequer george osborne recently said: “you can’t borrow way debt”. in opinion, absolutely right; promise approach “cut” way out. 3.3 a big role eurosystem? “stop”, might say point, “it true member state eventually reform, government tighten belts. but still leaf ecb. shouldn’t ecb temporarily ease pressure even more?” usually, boundary monetary fiscal policy clear-cut good reason. once central bank become involve fiscal policy, eventually lose independence credibility inflation-fighter. this story tell economic theory also historical experience. just think unholy “marriage” banca d’italia italian treasury 1975. banca d’italia promise marriage act buyer last resort government bonds. until “divorce” 1981, italian government debt tripled, average inflation stand 17%. after banca d’italia grant great independence, inflation rate begin fall significantly. or think uk: new monetary framework establish 1993 bank england grant great independence, inflation rate also come down. however, crisis boundary monetary fiscal policy become blurred. to contain crisis, central bank act flexibly accept risk balance sheets. i think unavoidable, eurosystem already undertake tremendous effort direction. but although time thing black white, i think clear distinction completely irrelevant. this particularly pertinent monetary union member state retain autonomy fiscal economic policy. in setting, government incentive accumulate debt; know deficit bias. to counter incentive, eu treaty explicitly prohibit monetise public debt. if central bank go route, would redistribute fiscal risk cost among taxpayer euro area. however, prerogative national parliaments. if central banks’ balance sheet use bring redistribution imply cost become apparent, could highly corrosive effect credibility central bank independence. credibility independence are, however, indispensable maintain price stability ensure acceptance monetary union whole. this would high price pay, would merely buy time. 4. conclusion this bring back begin speech: must contain crisis, must resolve it. to achieve goal, must address two central issues: problem excessive public debt problem macroeconomic imbalances. bi central bankers’ speech 5 country current account deficit excessive public debt must act. they must implement structural reform must consolidate budget get back onto stable growth path. of course, adjustment huge challenge people country status quo clearly unsustainable, nothing lead even sharp corrections. by contrast, take challenge open door stable prosperous future. in speech, i focus member states. this deny overhaul institutional framework monetary union equally pressing. member state make clear want retain autonomy fiscal policy. but case need strict rule counter deficit bias i mention before. some progress make issue. now, decisive rule apply rigorously. in addition, place monetary union sound foot closely link regulatory reform financial system. but i leave important issue discussion, rather go right now. admittedly, crisis open eye structural flaw many levels. but sober experience also provide impetus correct shortcomings. the time come move contain crisis resolve it. if make right choices, able rebalance europe lay foundation stronger, stable monetary union. a winston churchill said: “difficulties master opportunity won”. lady gentlemen, i present idea i look forward discuss you. thank attention. bi central bankers’ speech 1 mario bergara: financial stability net – complement reinforce micro macro perspective speech mr mario bergara, governor central bank uruguay,

represent view banco central del uruguay. 1. lesson crisis: what new? the aftermath 2008 global financial crisis witness surge discussion financial stability issues. in country focus debate role shadow financial system, relationship banks, regulatory supervisory failure address problem regulatory arbitrage. in europe, main concern lie lack european safety net, mainly due absence european lender last resort. in emerge countries, however, discussion center around impact crisis volatility capital flow architecture international financial system. though phenomenon underlie origin depth financial crisis either new locate new instrument markets, issue raise episode trace back first financial crisis world. in follow lines, develop argument even though financial stability concern old financial systems, despite main lesson recent crisis look pretty much alike lesson several financial episode past (to many jurisdiction already reacted), good reason heighten concern financial stability. financial stability arise main concern, despite fact concept neither new, main explanation collapse world experience 2008. the crisis reveal existence regulatory failure different levels, well problem design financial safety net national international level. in appear nearly paradox, regulatory failure remain background overshadow concentration policy make body financial stability. financial stability concern impact management macro micro policy regard financial stability long time now. uruguay give example matter. to quote one, 1998 face bullish international environment, uruguay increase capital requirement bank tame seemingly bubble behaviour domestic credit. for year now, uruguay work increase maturity domestic public debt avoid liquidity pressure fiscal account might end affect health bank sector. another example country’s concern real exchange appreciations. in graph possible see every financial crisis last 50 year precede deep gradual appreciation real exchange rate follow sudden sharp depreciation. that lesson carve deep skin uruguayan people, see appreciation currency sign trouble come. a reflection concern, macroeconomic policy always keen keep eye exchange rate market, try prevent misalignment real exchange rate respect fundamentals. financial stability long term concern macro en micro economic policy design. 2 bi central bankers’ speech despite long stand tradition care financial stability, emerge country like uruguay pay renew close attention matter international environment changed. the g20 solution financial crisis set clearly boundary international financial safety net, previously unknown, leave legacy medium term excess liquidity deal emerge economies. the sum two element imply much volatile international capital flows, international financial architecture country basically own. a result, even though financial stability nothing new us, pay much close look way complement reinforce effort enhance stability financial system contribution whole economy. in next line would go way envisage financial stability new international context. 2. why public intervention financial market necessary? public intervention industry commonly justify existence market failure externalities. market failure externality particularly pregnant financial markets. financial market operate environment asymmetric information adverse selection, moral hazard costly state verification problem play important role. moreover, activity financial market player pose important spill-overs externality player industry, industries, domestic economy even spread economies. many example contagion, externality market failure may identify recent global financial crisis. some aspect specific financial industry provide rationale public intervention financial markets: represent protect small claimholders. financial institution (e.g. banks) finance risky investment (e.g. loans) retail deposit liabilities. retail depositors, well claimholders, relatively small (and maybe nonsophisticated) agents. they either technical capability incentive monitor financial institutions. hence, public intervention justify order cope potential moral hazard problem. in particular, public entity assume representation small claimholders financial institution order protect (see dewatripont tirole, 1994). control systemic risk, financial macroeconomic stability. one main function financial institution manage risks. for reason, financial institution inherently fragile, point author refer “risk machines” (see bessis, 2010). moreover, trouble one institution may rapidly amplify spread others balance sheet interlink financial contagion, affect payment system real economy (see, instance, allen gale 2000, diamond dybvig 1983, freixas et al. 2000. ponce tubio 2010 offer review literature). in addition externalities, amplification spill-over effects, situation financial instability may result materialization macroeconomic risk common financial institution (see rochet, 2004). yet, financial institution may face difficulty coordinate action order resolve potentially damage imbalances. rochet vives (2004) demonstrate formal model coordination failure may determine solvent financial institution face severe liquidity shortfalls. hence, market failure need preserve public good (e.g. payment system financial macroeconomic stability) provide another rationale public intervention. protect taxpayer’s money. financial crisis demonstrate impose large clean burden fiscal authorities. hence, protection fiscal revenue another rationale prompt public intervention order reduce frequency impact crises, quickly efficiently resolve materialized. bi central bankers’ speech 3 public intervention financial market commonly imply series function classify category prevention resolution. among category prevention one mention activity monitor assess risk (two crucial function financial supervision), application regulatory policy. a regulatory policy imply use rule (i.e. regulations) also preventive action (e.g. enforce rules), corrective action (e.g. lean imbalances). the resolution policy involve use rules, important guarantee prompt efficient resolution processes, resolution clean institution trouble, correction imbalances. many tool use fulfil objective public intervention financial markets: prudential regulation, control supervision (i.e. preventive tools), resolution mechanism emergency liquidity assistance (i.e. resolution tools). the set function tool provide financial safety net financial system. in general, function tool financial safety net allocate different agencies. for example, generally central bank responsible provision emergency liquidity assistance. other responsibility like prudential regulation, supervision, deposit insurance allocate inside central bank jurisdiction outside others. in order determine efficient governance structure financial safety net policymakers consider agency explicit conflict objectives, potential conflict opinion key issue (e.g. intervention liquidation financial institution, provision short term emergency assistance, authorization merger acquisitions), need coordination. in addition this, policymakers consider pro con unification versus separation financial safety net agency grind relative expertise, capabilities, reputation, credibility institutional strength. moreover, financial safety net affect affect function like conduction monetary policy fiscal policy. these effect also consider design financial stability institutions. we come back point section 5. 3. micro- macro-prudential perspective sound risk management need individual institution also financial system whole. the severity recent global financial crisis explain systemic risk factor propagate problem individual institution market entire global financial system. the close relationship individual systemic risk provide rationale complement traditional micro-prudential perspective (focusing individual risks) macroprudential perspective (assessing systemic risks). most financial regulatory supervisory apparatus focalize microprudential perspective. some exception case spain uruguay implement mechanism control static dynamic dimension systemic risk (e.g. dynamic provision limit currency mismatches) last decade. the recent basel iii capital liquidity accord make advance consideration systemic risk. however, current financial regulation focus stability financial institution market consider isolation. hence, largely ignore externality one institution pose others, systemic importance individual institutions, risk generate endogenously financial system. moreover, regulation focus individual institution may open possibility regulatory arbitrage, i.e. possibility financial institution avoid regulation certain activity conduct entity (or line business) subject le severe regulations. the final objective macro-prudential perspective avoid materialization large social economic cost due financial instabilities. hence, perspective financial stability consider entire financial system intend protect infrastructure (e.g. payment system, interbank money markets). the macro-prudential 4 bi central bankers’ speech perspective oversight aggregate risk entire financial system explicitly consider exposition individual institution market common source risk, dynamic risk generate endogenously. the micro- macro-prudential perspective jointly consider order avoid regulatory arbitrage ensure financial stability. both perspective complement reinforce order protect small customer stability entire financial system. hence, contribution transversal financial safety net agency rather responsibility specific, macroprudential authority. the follow section analyse implication jointly consider micro- macro-prudential perspective rules, institutions, governance design macroeconomic policy. 4. micro- macro prudential policies: a two-way road the follow line argue function financial stability imply articulate cooperation institution concern macro microeconomic policy make regulation. 4.1 implication systemic risk traditionally micro-prudential rule institution the consideration systemic risk (e.g. exposure common correlate risks, interconnectedness, financial real sector conglomerates, cross border issues, regulatory arbitrage, new kind risk developments) implication traditionally micro-prudential rule institutions. risk-based regulation. risk-based regulation imply similar risk face similar regulation regardless financial institution activity generate them. this kind regulation direct way provide safety protection claimholders financial institution participant financial system. other kind regulation (e.g. activity-based institution-based) may imply important source risk remain unregulated foster regulatory arbitrage. moreover, may ignore important synergies, interlink externality among different activity financial institution (which particularly relevant financial conglomerates) contribute systemic risk. to anticipate control excessive risk take direct mechanism mitigate negative effect materialization risk impose stability financial system. a risk-based regulation act directly incentive take risks, reduce possibility regulatory gap whereby important activity regulate escape regulation. dynamic regulatory perimeter. financial institution special specialize risk management also show creative efficient development new products. financial innovation may contribute social welfare also may serve device arbitrate regulation thereby increase individual aggregate risk. the capacity innovate financial institutions, potential regulatory arbitrage, potentially dangerous effect whole financial system provide rationale allow agency financial safety net expand contract regulatory perimeter (i.e. select institution activity regulated) order promptly react new kind risk market develop. the possibility dynamically adjust regulatory perimeter also justify trend financial institution form group conglomerate stockholding company (even non-financial one) own financial institutions. moreover, state-owned privately-owned financial institution manage similar risk side regulatory perimeter subject kind regulation controls. bi central bankers’ speech 5 uruguay represent particular case latin america law give power financial sector regulator supervisor adjust regulatory perimeter order fulfil mandate preserve stability financial system. centralize regulation. the regulation financial institution centralize unique regulator. the existence many agency regulate financial institution (e.g. activity-based regulatory framework) may imply important overlap regulatory requirement important gap important activity regulate escape regulation. moreover, financial market naturally dynamic financial institution market (e.g. bank intermediaries, pension funds, insurance capital markets) show important interlink justify need large level consistency think different regulations. more centralization financial regulation may imply low bureaucratic costs, economy scale scope, use conglomerate logic low regulatory arbitrage. these advantage concentrate financial regulation may trade potential advantage le concentrate financial regulation (e.g. efficiency gain due specialization). the rule tool use centralize regulator consider micro- macroprudential risks. otherwise stated, financial regulator take prudential perspective consideration write rule use regulatory tool instruments. hence, financial regulator receive clear explicit mandate ensure stability individual institution markets, also guarantee stability whole financial system. other aspect relate governance financial regulator relationship agency analyse section 5. 4.2 implication micro-prudential concern macroeconomic police micro prudential policy direct impact macroeconomic policy, experience show reciprocal also true. change regulation supervision affect power, reach time macro policies. leave aside obvious effect crisis times, well know impact regulation supervision development financial market credit. change development financial market direct effect power monetary policy. change credit affect might affect consumption therefore fiscal revenues. the recent crisis highlight potential effect failure regulation supervision creation asset price bubbles. if add “normal time” effect one generate time stress, clear case monetary fiscal policy concern financial stability. nevertheless, since many financial crisis trace back problem policy macro level, clear case reciprocal concern macro policy design come authority financial safety net. particularly case emerge economies, threat financial stability come macro environment, depend largely way macroeconomic policy conducted. reinhardt rogoff illustrate financial crisis tend cluster history, relate volatility capital inflow commodity prices. the literature early warn system suggest basic feature currency bank crisis seem share unsustainable appreciation domestic currency fiscal problems. in case uruguay, three case depict figure portray section i explain (or cannot understand without) problem design macroeconomic policy. since financial crisis event macroeconomic factor either cause amplify them, financial stability concern affect design macroeconomic policies. the impact macroeconomic policy financial stability justify presence macro policy maker discussion financial stability issue one pay 6 bi central bankers’ speech bill crisis started, also key actor prevention episode financial instability. a direct result line reason paper develop financial stability two way road, actor involve milage cover order ensure financial stability. 5. financial stability committees: safety stability net the final outcome term financial stability depend policy conduct several agency involve macroeconomic policy design financial safety net: prudential regulation supervision, emergency liquidity assistance, deposit insurance, etc. all agency may contribute stability financial system “own” policy instrument tools, responsible use. the challenge agency internalize effect policy financial stability; agency complement identification assessment risk vulnerabilities; policy instrument tool use calibrate consider micro- macro-prudential perspective financial stability. operationally independent agency receive clear mandate remain accountable outcome policies. hence, safety net agency receive mandate contribute stability whole financial system addition specific mandates. yet, agency may conflict opinion crucial decision may end situation financial instability. financial stability committee appear response align incentives, coordinate efforts, contribute agency comply respective mandates. financial stability committee also add financial safety net help micro- macroprudential perspective complement reinforce other. financial stability committee step toward financial stability nets. uruguay, like latin american countries, recently create committee objective share information coordinate action among financial safety net agencies. financial stability committee serve framework share information coordinate actions. they also help improve identification assessment risks, accountability stability net agencies. hence, help safety net agency comply mandates. the specific mandate safety net agency operational constraint face imply specialize oversight specific dimension financial risks. to share, combine analyse different piece information leadership financial stability committee improve efficiency risk assessment profit specialization safety net agency assess specific risks, also comprehensive approach risks, consider interlink them, anticipate new risks. to get information different safety net agency also benefit financial stability committee (and social welfare) reduce potential industry “captures” safety net agency (see boyer ponce, 2011). moreover, share information, insight provide different safety net agencies, explicit consideration different point view crucial decision imply generation observable (and verifiable) information may improve accountability agencies. reference allen, f., gale, d., 2000. financial contagion. the journal political economy 108 (1), 1–33. bergara, m., licandro, j., 2000. hacia la explicitación de un fondo de

officer federal reserve bank new york, subcommittee domestic monetary policy technology, committee financial services, unite state house representatives, washington dc, 27 march 2012. * * * introduction chairman paul, rank member clay, member subcommittee, name bill dudley, i president federal reserve bank new york. it honor testify today economic fiscal challenge face europe, federal reserve’s effort support financial stability unite states. financial stability enable u.s. business household maintain access credit ensure sustain economic growth. this promote financial stability important objective federal reserve, central bank around world. let preface remark state view express write oral testimony solely represent official view federal reserve board, federal open market committee (fomc) part federal reserve system. additionally, i preclude law discuss confidential supervisory information, i able speak financial condition regulatory treatment rat individual financial institution. the u.s. economy currently expand moderate pace, strain global financial markets, although ease recently, continue pose significant downside risk economic outlook. because development europe important bear prospect growth job u.s., federal reserve monitor situation closely. this also take special step recent months, together central banks, support flow credit household businesses. europe the economic situation europe unsettle good part two years, pressure sovereign debt market local bank systems. high debts, large deficit slow growth several european country call question sustainability entire euro area. the result strain european market affect u.s. economy. the euro area capacity, include fiscal capacity, overcome challenges. however, politics difficult, problem many dimensions, many different country institution euro area coordinate action order achieve coherent effective policy response. europe’s leadership affirm commitment european union single currency union numerous occasions. and leadership work hard ever achieve great coordination area fiscal policy. a robust resilient european union would welcome development unite states. three recent development especially encourage regard. first, liquidity concern ease significantly follow european central bank’s (ecb) long-term refinance operation december february. through program, ecb provide three-year loan european bank low rates, accept wide array collateral return. hundred bank access program operation, ecb lend nearly €1 trillion total. a result, cost fund throughout europe 2 bi central bankers’ speech decline since program began, euro stabilized, sovereign bond market improved. change ecb’s collateral rule reserve requirement also positive impact. second, early month, greek government work european leader large creditor restructure bulk €206 billion outstanding privately-held bonds. this reduce greece’s total indebtedness, help calm persistent worry disorderly greek default could become trigger global economic crisis. shortly debt restructuring, eu approve €130 billion aid package greece. together, measure provide key support greek leader pursue difficult fiscal reform essential long term. third, leader euro area country approve new treaty design increase fiscal coordination. the new rule already appear make difference. both spain italy recently complete 2012 budget move deficit close eu targets. further, spain italy take fiscal action close consultation finance minister country euro area, demonstrate healthy ability work together. while difficult work still lie ahead, country euro area make meaningful progress toward achieve long-term fiscal sustainability. look future, difficult work remain also present special risk – europe unite states. if europe fail chart effective course forward, could number negative implication here. in particular, three area potential risk i would like highlight subcommittee today. first, economic condition europe weaken significantly, demand u.s. export would decrease. this would hurt domestic growth negative impact u.s. jobs. it important recognize euro area world’s second large economy u.s. important trade partner us. also, europe significant investor u.s. economy, vice versa. thus, happen europe significant implication economy. second, deterioration european economy could put pressure u.s. bank system. a recent round stress test revealed, u.s. bank much robust resilient year ago. they bolster capital significantly, build loan loss reserve significantly large liquidity buffers. the direct net exposure u.s. bank so-called “peripheral” european country actually quite modest. the good news unite state mean good able handle bad news europe. with said, exposure u.s. bank climb sharply one also consider exposure core european country overall european bank system. u.s. money market mutual funds, particular, significant european holdings. this mean crisis broaden intensify, would put pressure capital liquidity buff u.s. bank financial institutions. third, severe stress european financial market would disrupt financial market here, could harm real economy. stress financial market cause bank carefully husband balance sheets. when phenomenon occurs, availability credit u.s. household business become constrained. such condition could also cause equity price fall, impair value americans’ pension 401(k) holdings. this would damage u.s. recovery result slow output growth le job creation. at time u.s. unemployment high, particularly unacceptable outcome. in extreme, u.s. financial market could become impair flow credit household business would dry up. bi central bankers’ speech 3 u.s. dollar swap in today’s globally integrate economy, bank headquarter abroad play important role provide credit financial service unite states. about $1 trillion worldwide dollar finance come foreign banks, $700 billion form loan within u.s. for bank provide u.s. dollar loans, maintain access u.s. dollar funding. at time already hard enough american family firm get credit need, strong interest make sure bank continue active u.s. dollar markets. bank headquarter outside u.s. make extensive use dollar finance activities. in part, result fact u.s. dollar world’s number one currency – status bring many benefit country. it national interest make sure non-u.s. bank remain able access u.s. dollar fund need continue finance u.s. dollar assets. if access dollar fund become severely impaired, could necessitate abrupt, force sale dollar asset banks, could seriously disrupt u.s. market adversely affect american businesses, consumer jobs. one way help support availability dollar funding, ensure credit continue flow american household businesses, engage currency swap central banks. such swap policy tool federal reserve use support dollar liquidity nearly fifty years. most recently, federal reserve establish dollar swap line major central bank global financial crisis 2008, reactivate may 2010. last november, fomc, cooperate five central banks, reduce rate charge swap increase usage. the swap intend create credible backstop support – supplant – private markets. bank surplus dollar likely lend bank need dollar know borrow bank able obtain dollar need repay loan, necessary, central bank. ultimately, dollar swap design support financial stability, avoid unnecessary tighten financial conditions, economic activity job creation unite state continue recover. our principal aim protect u.s. banks, business consumer adverse economic trend abroad. i please swap seem working. in conjunction ecb’s long-term refinance operations, swap help european bank avoid significant liquidity pressure fear month ago reduce risk would need sell u.s. dollar asset abruptly. conclusion in sum, i hopeful europe effectively address current fiscal challenges. the federal reserve actively carefully assess situation potential impact u.s. economy. at time, although i anticipate effort federal reserve address potential spillover effect europe unite states, continue monitor situation closely. thank invitation testify today, i look forward answer questions. bi central bankers’ speech 1 mario draghi: remark annual reception association german bank speech mr mario draghi, president european central bank, annual reception association german banks, berlin, 26 march 2012. * * * sehr geehrter herr schmitz, vielen dank für ihre freundliche einführung und vielen dank für ihre einladung nach berlin. ich freue mich, heute hier zu sein. lady gentlemen, i would like take opportunity provide assessment current situation euro area shed light recent sign improvement overall outlook. i would particularly like draw attention effectiveness policy measure implement eurosystem, eu institution national authorities. and remind measure must continue pursue come month year great diligence order continue path stabilisation. the current economic situation a audience know well, november last year, prospect euro area financial sector bleak. bank experience period heighten stress. the inter-bank market close except strong institution safe countries, fund market impaired. unable raise fund beyond short maturities, many bank reduce medium-term lend real economy. at time come requirement increase capital ratio 9%. this increase risk substantial deleveraging, include risk bank cut back loans, notably small medium-sized enterprises. we could see intensity deleveraging pressure bank lend survey data. in fourth quarter 2011, significant tighten credit standard loan company households. there doubt euro area brink major credit crunch, potentially adverse consequence economy employment. at time, many observer little confidence capacity euro area reverse situation. yet today, four month on, picture look different. there sign stabilisation financial market overall economic activity – albeit still low levels. condition bank fund market improved. for example, euro area bank already issue 70 billion euro senior unsecured debt far year, well amount issue whole second half 2011. bank meet new capital requirements. the capital plan submit european bank authority (eba) indicate intention exceed benchmark 20%. eba also confirm stress test year. bank lend also stabilising. bank start ass financial situation positively many case willingness make loan increasing. 2 bi central bankers’ speech how picture change clearly four months? there two part answer. first, doomsday prediction always exaggerated. not situation last november serious. but willingness euro area authority take measure necessary restore stability great many commentator realised. second, euro area authority prove commitment safeguard financial stability number important policy measures. the eurosystem, eu institution national authority play role construct comprehensive coherent response economic, financial fiscal challenge face. let explain key element response detail. the policy response eurosystem the primary explanation improvement sentiment last month measure take eurosystem – is, european central bank (ecb) colleague national central bank 17 country share euro. a know, since december last year eurosystem launch two long-term refinance operation – ltros – maturity three years. while total liquidity request bank operation amount around 1 trillion euro, net liquidity injection eurosystem around half trillion euro half shift operations. let clear implement three-year ltros. it support sovereign debt markets. it also bolster bank profits. the ltros specifically design prevent credit crunch could compromise maintenance price stability euro area. with fund market closed, bank need liquidity assurance medium term avoid pre-emptive deleveraging continue lending. to understand operation necessary require euro area wide perspective. it would mislead judge urgency action – necessary response – base situation one country group countries. the eurosystem act interest euro area whole 330 million citizens. this perspective always inform decisions. some observer raise question operations. the question tend fall three category since touch fundamental issues, i would like spend moment respond them. first, wonder whether really transmission ltros real economy. the argument go bank simply take cheap liquidity set carry trade put liquidity back deposit facility. the fact show incomplete view. over 800 bank participate february ltro, compare around 500 december. this number include 460 bank germany, – literally hundred – small banks. i cannot tell name town village bank locate often bank town could easily identified. but i tell this: money close small medium-sized enterprise before. we cannot say money necessarily go small enterprise certainly close them. we mind nearly three quarter corporate employment euro area small medium-sized business sector. the bank i talk one whose main business lend mittelstand thereby support real economy. bi central bankers’ speech 3 it also accurate claim bank return liquidity straight back eurosystem. we know bank use deposit facility identical borrow eurosystem. this imply even though bulk liquidity return eventually, direct within bank system intended. the second category question involve concern express eurosystem expose excessive risks. critic point particular differentiate collateral framework adopt national central bank allow bank participate three-year ltros. let underscore high haircut apply additional credit claim ensure risk equivalence collateral regular framework. moreover, main element risk management framework apply common: eligibility criterion risk control measure approve govern council, council monitor effectiveness risk control framework ongoing basis. hence, limit national discretion. i also emphasise eurosystem long experience acceptance credit claim collateral framework. moreover, eurosystem careful manage risk may ensue current operations. we employ conservative risk management framework. on additional collateral present far, average haircut 53%. this mean nominal value 100 euro provide 47 euro liquidity. this show prudently collateral accepted. if time market value quality collateral post decline, counterparties would provide additional collateral return part liquidity. this serf protect financial soundness eurosystem whole. the third kind question come observer worry liquidity create ltro lead inflation asset price distortions. here important distinguish different concept liquidity. we would expect impact inflation asset price follow sustain strong increase money credit – follow increase central bank liquidity per se. the tentative sign see stabilisation money credit growth signal increase inflationary pressure medium term. for example, growth monetary aggregate remain low levels, m3 increase 2.5% january 2012, well average growth rate m3 monetary union far, 5.9%. the true counterpart m3 – loan euro area private sector increase 1.5% january, compare average 6.8% since start euro. market indicator inflation expectation overall show sign inflation medium-term objective. investor overall assume break-even inflation rate five year around 1.7%. look inflation expectation five year ten year also show that, adjust usual risk premia, market expectation long-term inflation fully consistent definition medium-term price stability. moreover, eurosystem range tool disposal absorb excess liquidity deem necessary future. available tool include increase reserve requirement conduct liquidity absorb operation include short-term also longer-term deposits. hence, tool govern council use needed. moreover, balance sheet grow shrink past without create inflation – example, evident course 2009 2010. in words, constantly alert threat medium-term price stability. euro area citizen certain objective deliver price stability medium term – necessary tool achieve it. the consistent strong anchor inflation expectation confirm commitment credible. 4 bi central bankers’ speech let address one final issue, concern debate country target2 balances. it important debate frame correctly – particular, distinguish symptom causes. target2 payment system reflect flow fund within euro area. imbalance within target2 symptom real financial imbalance euro area countries. restore normality within target2 require address symptom – payment system – address cause: underlie imbalances. this task monetary policy. it task national authority eu institution responsible fiscal, economic financial policies. important progress make recent month strengthen credibility policy – recognise financial markets. this second explanation overall stabilisation witness since november – something i turn briefly. policy response national eu level the signature last european council international treaty, include fiscal compact, important signal commitment reduce deficit debt levels. enshrine balance budget rule national legislation create new “first line defence” fiscal imbalances. like schuldenbremse country, legislation shift onus enforcement away brussels onto national institutions. prevention good cure – spirit compact. member state also take important step strengthen euro area global firewalls. the entry force european stability mechanism advance paying-in capital accelerate reach full lend capacity sooner originally planned. on top this, euro area country commit provide additional 150 billion euro imf. see together, measure represent coherent strategy strengthen euro area economic governance. the focus not, commentator claim, skew towards fiscal consolidation. strong fiscal rule one – albeit essential – element large package address real financial imbalance provide safety net country financial difficulties. but strong governance cannot effective without individual member state also fulfil responsibilities. here witness number positive development recent

the safety science depend existence men care justice method value result obtain use them.1 5. statistic method learn experience decision make uncertainty. that often call study law chance. chance inherent natural phenomena, way understand nature make prediction 1 cohen, morris r., “scientific method,” the encyclopaedia social sciences. 2 bi central bankers’ speech study law chance formulate appropriate rule action. chance may appear obstructor irritant daily life chance also create. through statistics, learn put chance work benefit mankind. c. r. rao, preface famous book “statistics truth” thus say “all knowledge is, final analysis, history. all science are, abstract, mathematics method acquire knowledge essentially statistics.” 6. the importance study nature uncertainty realise century ago. in particular, introduction statistical idea physic begin need deal error astronomical measurements. it galileo (1564–1642) first realize repeat measurement identical condition vary. indeed emphasize “measure find difference difference difference”. about 200 year later, gauss (1777–1855) study probability law error measurements, finally formulate today call normal distribution. 7. the centrality uncertainty pursuit knowledge find enough support scientific community. it say even einstein initially view theory whose object connect law base facts, probabilities. he famously said, “……god play dice universe…..” but surprisingly, accept chance behaviour molecule suggest s. n. bose, result bose-einstein theory. the inherent nature uncertainty initially le understood. although uncertainty individual level, realise certain amount stability average mass individuals. this call “order disorder”, technically “statistical regularity”, pave way formulation law large number statistics. discipline statistics: ancient root 8. statistic subject collection use various kind statistic trace much early india. kautilya’s arthasastra (321–296b.c.), one great treatise economics, indicate system census data collection relate agriculture, population economic activities, cover village towns. in addition, concept cross-check validation independent agent much part data collection

government. modern statistical information system develop british objective collect tax meet developmental administrative need society large extent. the commercial business information system develop primarily accountant serve purpose management. hence, statistical system reorient meet developmental, administrative management need society. practitioner statistic play important role achieve objective. statistic pervade daily life 9. we live statistics. start morning newspaper even tv reports, surround various statistical figures. we often come across data economy: india’s population rise 1.21 billion people last 10 years, increase 181 million, accord census 2011; india’s gdp increase 8.5% 2010–11; inflation 7% february year. deposit schedule commercial bank 14.6% february, 2012 year

statistic provide good understand exact description phenomenon nature. through appropriate framework data collection well-organised plan scientific inquiry field life, help present complex information suitable tabular, diagrammatic graphic form easy clear comprehension, help draw valid inference population parameter sample data. if problem properly formulate measurement data generated, whether arise physical, biological, social science discipline, statistical tool design provide scientific solution. thus, widely recognize proper use statistic key element scientific enquiry. at stage let emphasize quality integrity data important element success utility statistics. us statistic 11. let give example uses. it play critical role agriculture decide plant varieties, combination fertilizer, pesticides, densities, soil qualities, growth output. india’s statistic exploration start anthropological experiment. without use statistics, business economics cannot make proper plan policy. performance measurement education, include iq, statistical construct. use statistic psychological behaviour know psychometry. examination climate change environmental study effectively statistical

inherit characteristics? what pattern rainfall? what important risk factor heart disease? any market strategy base statistical sample study. be education attainment relate income health? the duckworth-lewis method implement limit cricket statistical method. i keep give examples. misuse statistic 12. but since beginning, statistic also misuse considerable debate understand respond misuse statistics. after all, hasn’t hear famous phrase: “there three kind lies: lies, damn lie statistics”, variously attribute benjamin disraeli, alfred marshall, mark twain many others. to understand mean “misusing statistics,” important describe role statistic scientific method relate concept “misuse” ethical concepts, “misconduct” “incompetence” “negligence.” some misuse statistic consider misconduct, although misuse view negligence deficit competence. while ethical dimension, i shall elaborate further, i shall deal dimension “negligence” “incompetence” part information illiteracy slightly later. 13. how statistic use could consequence misuse well summarise preamble ethical guideline statistical practice2. it say professional performance statistical analysis essential many aspect society. the use statistic medical diagnosis biomedical research may affect whether individual live die, whether health protect jeopardized, whether medical science advance get sidetracked. life, death, health, well efficiency, may stake statistical analysis occupational, environmental, transportation safety. early detection control new recurrent infectious disease depend sound 2 american statistical association. ethical guideline statistical practice. alexandria, va: american statistical association, 1999. available http:// amstat.org/profession/ ethicalstatistics.html. 4 bi central bankers’ speech epidemiological statistics. mental social health may stake psychological sociological application statistical analysis. effective function economy depend availability reliable, timely, properly interpret economic data. the profitability individual firm depend part quality control market research, rely statistical methods. agricultural productivity benefit greatly statistically sound application research output reporting. governmental policy decision regard public health, criminal justice, social equity, education, environment, matter depend part sound statistics. scientific engineer research discipline require careful design analysis experiment observations. to extent uncertainty measurement error involve – research – research design, data quality management, analysis, interpretation crucially dependent statistical concept methods. even theory, much science engineer involve natural variability. variability, whether great small, must carefully examine random error possible researcher bias wishful thinking. . . . because society depend sound statistical practice, practitioner statistics, whatever train occupation, social obligation perform work professional, competent, ethical manner. 14. the result statistical investigation usually state numerical form are, therefore, public mind, assign degree definiteness usually associate mathematical technique. the careful investigator, however, constantly aware fact preciseness numerical result vary directly degree care use selecting, large universe, sample upon study based. the numerical conclusion derive study sample hold characteristic representative universe. a common error statistical investigation selection sample accurate cross-section large universe merely particular, unique segment. conclusion draw bias sample not, course, accurately reflect large universe. the misuse occur conclusion hold representative universe either deliberately un-consciously overlook sample bias. 15. an article cat appear the new york times’ august 22, 1989. it stated, “the expert also develop startle evidence cat’s renowned ability survive, time particular set new york city, cat prone time year fall open window tall buildings. researcher call phenomenon feline high-rise syndrome.” statistic like this: june 4 november 4, 1984, 132 victim admit animal medical centre cat land concrete survived. from data distance fall 129 132 cats, observe fall range 2 32 stories. only one 22 cat plunge 7 story died, one fracture among 13 fell 9 stories. but cat survive fall great height defy gravitation? such description generally push one scrutinize statement till understand majority cat owner report incident medical centre believe people probably don’t report cats’ deaths, either. therefore, error seem obvious sample representative data report problems. 16. let cite another example wrong notion conditional probabilities, appear statistical science 2005, type intentional unintentional misinterpretation statistical information. it say discuss fatality highway page 78: “four time fatality occur highway 7 p.m. 7 a.m.” this course imply, newspaper suggested, dangerous drive even morning. recast language conditional probabilities, p(accident | 7 p.m.) confuse p(7 p.m. | accident). unfortunately, was. one example, study death arise road accident reveal 98 percent death occur drive leave side road, whereas, 2 percent death occur case bi central bankers’ speech 5 people travel middle road. hence, wrongly infer safe travel middle side road. 17. another area concern misuse statistic come spurious correlation attribute relation type cause effect phenomenon. in case common variable, importantly “time” work link. let u take another example. number people watch tv serial number buffalo register high correlation. if one try link find causal relationship simply absurd. it easy get carry way. one prime misuse statistic find strong relationship two variable actually correlation spurious. however, exploration behaviour also lead path break development econometrics. for example, macroeconomic series strong time trend thus strong correlation. prima facie one may suspect existence spurious correlation. however, exploration relationship lead foundation concept cointegration. if two variable common trend, could possibility long-run equilibrium relationship them. this statistical find open new dimension modern economics cwj granger award nobel prize economics 2003. 18. let give example bank world. the concept inflation often misunderstand people. you would often hear refrain many person despite rbi claim inflation come recent past, price come down. so, truth? well, truth simply inflation indicate percent change, even percent declining, mean price rise slow rate, still rising! the price would come inflation become negative. 19. in conclusion, must ask quotation like “lies, damn lies, statistics” mention early make subject statistics. in opinion, society illiterate, i.e. information illiterate. information literacy, people misunderstand, third generation literacy. the first generation literacy know read write. the second generation literacy computer literate, enough first second generation literate. when transit knowledge society, critical u information literate third generation literate. and, one purpose statistic bring information literacy society. if happen statistic use prove disprove anything subject statistic would bear burden ridicule. so, us, faculty, student practitioner alike, redirect effort towards spread information literacy society. institution associate teach train statistic important role play direction, i confident students, teacher practitioner statistic associate department mathematical science bhu take great responsibility spread information literacy society. and great service memory “mahamana” discipline statistics. i wish good luck effort. thank you. bi central bankers’ speech 1 ben s bernanke: recent development labor market speech mr ben s bernanke, chairman board governor federal reserve system, national association business economics annual conference, washington dc, 26 march 2012. * * * my remark today focus recent prospective development labor market. we see positive sign job front recently, include pickup monthly payroll gain notable decline unemployment rate. that good news. at time, key question unresolved. for example, good job number seem somewhat sync overall pace economic expansion. what explain apparent discrepancy implication future course labor market economy? importantly, despite recent improvement, job market remain far normal; example, number people work total hour work still significantly pre-crisis peaks, unemployment rate remain well economist judge long-run sustainable level. of particular concern large number people unemployed six months. long-term unemployment particularly costly directly affected, course. but addition, negative effect workers’ skill attachment labor force, long-term unemployment may ultimately reduce productive capacity economy. the debate best address long-term unemployment raise another important question: be current high level long-term unemployment primarily result cyclical factors, insufficient aggregate demand, structural changes, worsen mismatch workers’ skill employers’ requirements? if cyclical factor predominate, policy support broad economic recovery effective address long-term unemployment well; cause structural, policy tool needed. i argue today that, cyclical structural force doubtless contribute increase long-term unemployment, continue weakness aggregate demand likely predominant factor. consequently, federal reserve’s accommodative monetary policies, provide support demand recovery, help, time, reduce long-term unemployment well. recent labor market development a background discussion, let provide brief review recent job market indicators. a audience well aware, job creation pick recently. private payroll employment (figure 1) increase nearly 250,000 job per month, average, three month end february, 190,000 job per month, average, past 12 months. at time, layoff public sector appear moderating. together lengthen average workweek, employment gain contribute significant increase aggregate hour work (figure 2). the increase hour work encouraging, decline hour recent recession extraordinary. from peak series december 2007 trough february 2010, aggregate hour job production worker fell remarkable 9–1/2 percent; comparison, production-worker hour decline “only” 5–3/4 percent severe 1981–82 recession. currently, hour work still 4 percent pre-recession peak – clear improvement two year ago, still far would like be. the government estimate payroll employment – number job – survey business – establishment survey. a monthly survey 60,000 households, 2 bi central bankers’ speech provide data need construct national unemployment rate, offer alternative estimate number jobs. employment estimate household survey, adjust correspond closely possible concept employment measure establishment survey (figure 3), also show improvement labor market – indeed, somewhat establishment survey. i note, however, month-to-month change measure much volatile employment measure establishment survey, federal reserve put weight establishment survey purpose short-term forecasting. the positive sign labor market show measure labor utilization: after hover around 9 percent much last year, unemployment rate (figure 4) move since september 8.3 percent february, share employment represent people work part time economic reasons, indicator underutilization, decline modestly. survey household firm attitude expectation offer yet another window job market developments. since summer, household expectation labor market condition next year get bright (figure 5), unwind deterioration register early last year. business hire plan also show modest gain (figure 6). other indicators, new claim unemployment insurance measure breadth hire across industries, also point good labor market conditions. notwithstanding welcome recent signs, job market remain quite weak relative historical norms, i’ve already noted. after nearly two year job gains, private payroll employment remain 5 million job previous peak; job shortfall even larger, course, increase size labor force take account. and unemployment rate february still roughly 3 percentage point average 20 year precede recession. moreover, significant portion improvement labor market reflect decline layoff rather increase hiring. this last observation illustrate data gross job flow (figure 7). the monthly increase payroll employment, command much public attention, net change. it equal number hire month le number separation (including layoffs, quits, separations). in give month, large number worker hire leave current jobs, illustrate dynamism u.s. labor market. for example, 2001 2007, private employer hire nearly 5 million people, average, month. total separations, average, slightly smaller. take difference gross hire separations, net monthly change payroll period was, average, le 100,000 job per month – small figure compare gross flows. the recent history flow suggest improvement labor market likely need come shift robust pace hiring. a figure 7 shows, decline aggregate payroll recession stem reduction hire large increase layoffs. in contrast, increase employment since end 2009 due significant decline layoff moderate improvement hiring. to achieve rapid recovery job market, hire rate need return normal levels. the change unemployment economic growth: puzzle? what lead hire and, consequently, decline unemployment? the short answer more-rapid economic growth. indeed, improvement labor market past year – especially decline unemployment rate – fast might expected, give economy time appear grow bi central bankers’ speech 3 relatively modest pace. about 50 year ago, economist presidential adviser arthur okun identify rule thumb come know okun’s law. that rule thumb describe observe relationship change unemployment rate growth rate real gross domestic product (gdp). okun note that, ongoing increase size labor force level productivity, real gdp growth close rate growth potential normally require hold unemployment rate steady. to reduce unemployment rate, therefore, economy must grow pace potential. more specifically, accord currently accept version okun’s law, achieve 1 percentage point decline unemployment rate course year, real gdp must grow approximately 2 percentage point fast rate growth potential gdp period. so, illustration, potential rate gdp growth 2 percent, okun’s law say gdp must grow 4 percent rate one year achieve 1 percentage point reduction rate unemployment. in light historical regularity, combination relatively modest gdp growth substantial improvement labor market past year something puzzle. resolve puzzle could give u important insight economy likely evolve. to illustrate tension, consider relationship recent change unemployment rate real gdp relative prediction okun’s law (figure 8). a illustrate position square label “2011” relative okun’s law relationship, represent line, decline unemployment rate course 2011 great would seem consistent gdp growth period. indeed, last year’s real gdp growth 2 percent, le economist would estimate u.s. economy’s potential rate growth, one might expect little change unemployment rate last year even slight increase. what confluence significant decline unemployment rate modest recent increase real gdp tell u state economy, okun’s law puzzle resolved? the apparent failure okun’s law could reflect, part, statistical noise. for example, may future data revision show real gdp grow quickly past year currently estimated. however, although certainly possible revise data ultimately explain part puzzle, point specific evidence suggest revision might offing. for example, gross domestic income, alternative measure economic activity construct use source data mostly different data use estimate gdp, provide check information provide better-known gdp measure. however, gross domestic income currently estimate increase le quickly gdp 2011 point explanation drop unemployment rate. another logical possibility decline unemployment rate could overstate improvement job market. for example, potential worker could give look work unusual extent. because person either work look work count part labor force, increase number people discourage continue search work would reduce unemployment rate, else equal – positive reason. a story center potential worker drop labor force might seem line low level labor force participation rate (figure 9). but data cast doubt idea. for example, broad measure labor underutilization include people marginally attach labor force decline line unemployment rate since late 2010 (figure 10).1 on balance, assessment broad range indicator suggest substantial portion decline unemployment rate reflect genuine improvement labor market conditions. 1 the broad measure labor underutilization reference u-5 measure unemployment, construct bureau labor statistics. 4 bi central bankers’ speech yet another interpretation recent improvement represent catch-up outsized job loss recession. in 2008 2009, decline payroll associate jump unemployment extraordinary. in particular, use okun’s law metric, run-up unemployment rate 2009 appear “too large” relative even substantial decline real gdp occurred. this point see return figure 8, show okun’s law relationship. the open triangle label “2009” upper leave figure show increase unemployment rate year well one imply contraction real gdp okun’s law. in words, employer reduce workforce unusually rapid rate near business cycle trough – perhaps fear even severe contraction come or, credit availability sharply curtailed, try conserve available cash. the diagram suggest may see flip side fear-driven layoff occur bad part recession, firm become sufficiently confident move workforce close alignment expect demand products. such dynamic would explain position square label “2011” figure far line represent okun’s law. of course, okun’s law noisy relationship, don’t really know better-than-expected labor market performance 2011 largely offset worse-than-expected performance 2009. however, extent decline unemployment rate since last summer bring unemployment back line level aggregate demand, significant improvement unemployment likely require fast economic growth experience past year. it especially important evaluate incoming information ass whether recovery pick improvement labor market fee consumer business confidence; or, conversely, whether headwind impede recovery date continue restrain pace labor market economic activity normalize. the challenge long-term unemployment discussion labor market juncture necessarily “glass half-empty half-full” tone. recent improvement encouraging, but, i noted, absolute sense, job market still far normal many measures, million family continue suffer day-to-day hardship associate able find suitable employment. although spell unemployment disruptive costly, persistently high rate long-term unemployment see past three year especially concerning. in episode, median average duration unemployment reach level far outside range experience since world war ii (figure 11). and share unemployment represent spell last six month high 40 percent since december 2009 (figure 12). by way comparison, share unemployment long term nature never exceed 25 percent severe 1981–82 recession. those experience unemployment know burden creates, grow academic literature document dimension burdens. for example, research show worker lose previously stable job experience sharp decline earn may last many years, even find new work.2 survey indicate one-half household experience long unemployment spell since onset recent recession withdraw money save retirement account cover expenses, one-half borrow money family friends, one-third struggle meet 2 for example, see till von wachter, jae song, joyce manchester (2009), “long-term earn loss due mass layoff 1982 recession: an analysis use u.s. administrative data 1974 2004,” unpublished paper, columbia university, april. bi central bankers’ speech 5 house expenses.3 unemployment also take toll people’s health may long-term consequence family unemployed well. for example, study suggest unemployed people suffer high incidence stress-related health problem depression, stroke, heart disease, may low life expectancy.4 the child unemployed achieve le school appear reduce long-term earn prospects.5 in addition, unemployment – especially long-term unemployment – impose important economic cost everyone, unemployed themselves. elevate unemployment strain public finance lose tax revenue payment increase unemployment benefit income support affect families. people unemployed long time historically find job le easily experience short spell unemployment, perhaps skill erode, lose relationship within workforce, acquire stigma deter firm hire them. loss skill low rate employment reduce economy’s overall productive capacity long term. in short term, process match long-term unemployed job typically take time, currently high level long-term unemployment might reason progress reduce unemployment rate, thus achieve complete recovery, could slow.6 a pessimistic view large share unemployment seeing, particularly longer-term unemployment, structural nature, reflect factor inadequate skill mismatch type skill worker skill employer demand. if view correct, high level long-term unemployment could persist quite while, even economy fully recovered. and appear true past two decade so, structural factor responsible increase long-term unemployment. for example, old worker lose job typically take long find new job young worker situation, age baby boom generation probably contribute gradual rise long-term unemployment. factor globalization, technological change, loss lower-skill manufacture job likely reduce employability earn potential group workers. to extent high rate unemployment, especially long-term unemployment, result structural factors, scope countercyclical policy reduce unemployment would impaired, benefit complete economic recovery many worker unemployed discourage would limited. 3 see paul taylor, rich morin, rakesh kochhar, kim parker, wendy wang, daniel

mazumder, shani schechter (2010), “what be behind rise long-term unemployment?” federal reserve bank chicago, economic perspectives, vol. 34 (2), pp. 28–51. 6 bi central bankers’ speech however, although structural shift doubt important long term, read research that, most, modest portion recent sharp increase long-term unemployment due persistent structural factors.7 consider, example, rate job find unemployed vary amount time (figure 13). unsurprisingly, rate long-term unemployed find work low unemployed short time; average period 1994 2007, bite one-third already unemployed one four week find employment within next month. in contrast, period, one-sixth already unemployed 27 week manage find job within month. if recent increase long-term unemployment drive structural factor rather than, say, severity recession, job-finding rate long-term unemployed fall sharply relative work weeks. but that’s we’re seeing. rather, figure 13 shows, job find rate recently unemployed long-term unemployed fell recession roughly proportion, remain low.8 this pattern consistent cyclical factor account bulk recent increase long-term unemployment. similarly, fact labor demand appear weak industry location suggestive general shortfall aggregate demand rather worsen mismatch skill jobs. counterexample like energy boom upper midwest, may mismatch geographic location suitably skilled worker overall shortage potential worker relevant skills, might best interpret exception prove rule; mismatch story would suggest strong labor demand would appear sector geographical area now. an empirical relationship economist long use interpret development labor market know beveridge curve (figure 14). that curve – name british economist william beveridge – compare unemployment (the number worker look employers) job vacancy (the number worker employer seeking). in good times, unemployment rate low, business grow worker hard find, job vacancy tend high. similarly, bad times, unemployment high job available (vacancies low). thus, beveridge curve, relationship unemployment vacancies, downward sloping. on usual interpretation, recession period economy move along beveridge curve; output demand labor fall, job vacancy decline unemployment rises. in contrast, change structural determinant unemployment think reflect shift beveridge curve leave right. for example, suppose that, change technology mix industry jobs, mismatch skill unemployed need employer worsens. then, give number job openings, number unemployed qualify job small unemployment rate high would mismatch problem worsened. graphically, increase skill mismatch would reflect shift beveridge curve right. from figure 14, see outward shift relationship job vacancy unemployment, consistent increase structural unemployment since onset recession. however, in-depth analysis evidence suggest apparent shift relationship vacancy unemployment neither unusual 7 for discussion effect, see organisation economic co-operation development (2011), oecd employment outlook 2011; aaronson others, “what be behind rise long-term unemployment?” (see note 6). 8 for early analysis along lines, see michael w. l. elsby, bart hobijn, aysegül sahin (2010), “the labor market great recession,” brook paper economic activity (spring), pp. 1–69. bi central bankers’ speech 7 recession likely persistent. research find immediately serious recession 1973 1975 1981 1982, beveridge curve also shift outward, case shift back inward recovery. this temporary outward shift deep recession may result particularly sharp increase layoffs, raise unemployment quickly, even vacancy adjust slowly. another possible explanation temporary shift beveridge curve extend emergency unemployment insurance, induce unemployed worker might otherwise consider leave labor force continue search work. or employer may selective hire need worker press take time fill vacancy effort find especially qualify hires. in case, data appear consistent shift vacancy-unemployment relationship recent year relatively modest likely reverse, least part, economy recover further. when historical experience take account, pattern support view structural factor major cause increase unemployment recent recession.9 conclusion to sum up: a wide range indicator suggest job market improving, welcome development indeed. still, condition remain far normal, shown, example, high level long-term unemployment fact job hour work remain well pre-crisis peaks, even without adjust growth labor force. moreover, cannot yet sure recent pace improvement labor market sustained. notably, examination recent deviation okun’s law suggest recent decline unemployment rate may reflect, least part, reversal unusually large layoff occur late 2008 2009. to extent reversal completed, significant improvement unemployment rate likely require more-rapid expansion production demand consumer businesses, process support continue accommodative policies. i also discuss long-term unemployment today, argue cyclical rather structural factor likely primary source substantial increase recession. if assessment correct, accommodative policy support economic recovery help address problem well. we must watch long-term unemployment especially carefully, however. even primary cause high long-term unemployment insufficient aggregate demand, progress reduce unemployment slow, long-term unemployed see skill labor force attachment atrophy further, possibly convert cyclical problem structural one. 9 for discussion shift beveridge curve previous recessions,

insurance investment product often easy understand. many people financially savvy. and many are, time review range insurance investment product available, understand best suit needs. this financial advisory service come in. financial adviser help people identify insurance financial plan need recommend suitable products. the role insurer financial adviser intimately intertwined. it must so. insurance protect dependants. investment grow save wealth. how buy insurance without regard broad investment portfolio? likewise, invest without consider well protect death disease? life insurance financial advisory service go hand hand. this ma introduce financial adviser act, faa, ten year ago. the faa landmark regulatory reform, provide consistency regulation person engage advisory activities:  across sectors: insurance companies, banks, stockbrokers, financial advisory firms;  across products: life insurance, securities, futures, unit trusts. two year fa act, industry-led committee, committee efficient distribution life insurance, cedli, make far-reaching recommendation minimum standard advisory process, competency insurance agents. the faa cedli together help transform landscape financial advisory service singapore. they contribute great consistency good quality advisory service provide life insurance investment products. disclosure practice also improved. life insurance coverage financial investment among singaporean grow last decade.  life insurance percentage total asset singaporean nearly double 4% 2000 7% 2011.  financial investment percentage total asset singaporean increase 14% 2000 17% 2011. but important gap fill. 2 bi central bankers’ speech we need good we large protection gap. the average singaporean still grossly underinsured.  a 2009 study nanyang technological university find exist life cover average singaporean third dependant need event early death. the insurance industry reflect find take challenge narrow shortfall protection coverage. likewise, room within financial advisory industry.  accord study nielsen company, issue global age report february 2011, 14% singapore consumer survey felt financially ready retirement. this low asia pacific global average 22% 18% respectively. financial plan go beyond advise investment product evaluate life cycle need individual, include retirement. put customer first we must build customer’s trust confidence life insurance financial advisory services. ma work closely industry help bring about. the key thrust approach follows:  raise competence financial advisory representative  raise quality financial advisory firm  make financial advice dedicate service  low distribution cost insurance product  promote culture fair deal let share action take to-date areas. i also announce step ma intend take, part comprehensive review financial advisory industry launching. we call new effort, “fair”, financial advisory industry review. fair essentially build foundation lay cedli fa act ten year ago. it two main objectives:  first, enhance professional stand competence financial advisers;  second, create competitive efficient system distribution life insurance investment products. the override aim fair protect benefit consumer. put customer first – must heart efforts. raise competence fa representative let begin competence financial advisory representatives. ma work fa industry raise skills, knowledge expertise representative serve customer better. the two aspect effort are:  improve product knowledge fa representatives;  raise entry requirement fa representative bi central bankers’ speech 3 product knowledge fa representative we introduce new examination module ensure fa representative sufficient knowledge wide complex range investment insurance product currently available market. most firm fa representative understand support need raise knowledge skill level set common examinations. some representative question need pas new exam sell simple products. ma take view good financial adviser able explain advantage disadvantage risk compete product – simple complex. the reality consumer today face wide range choices. for example, consumer wish invest buy insurance protection options. he may consider participate policy regular premium investment-linked policy simply purchase insurance term policy invest separately. he could build portfolio plain vanilla stock bond include etf future simply buy unit trusts. each option set risk-return cost considerations. the increasingly educate consumer expect representative help make sense complexity product suitability, even eventually settle simple life insurance investment products. some fa representative feel academic qualification sufficient allow exemption exams. but consumer assurance qualification fa representative meet common standard. the examination industry-certified, set common standard benchmark fa representatives. it important representatives, even industry many years, stay abreast late market development products. only provide holistic advice comprehensive recommendation buy, – importantly – buy. but understand concern representative raised. ma prepare adjust requirement subject company put place proper control ensure simple product sell select fa representative take new examinations. entry requirement fa representative next, part fair, ma review minimum level qualification expect fa representatives, ensure stay relevant need expectation consumers. the current entry requirement fa representative four gce “o” level passes. it clearly keep singapore’s rise educational levels, increase complexity products, high expectation literate sophisticate public.  one two singaporean gce “o” level qualifications, compare one three, ten year ago.  one four singaporean degree; double proportion ten year ago. our current requirement stack well major jurisdictions. they raise quality professionalism financial advisers.  in uk, minimum requirement representative serve retail customer raise end 2012 tertiary level qualification, define least diploma.  in australia, current educational entry level diploma-equivalent. 4 bi central bankers’ speech let u short-change consumer life insurance investment product singapore. i hearten note insurer already consciously recruit good qualify individual provide value-added advice customers. these agent good able explain intricacy financial planning, recommend solution meet financial need busy professional le savvy customers. but must level play field make industry norm. raise quality financial advisory firm management expertise financial resource financial advisory firm the second thrust approach raise quality financial advisory firms. while bank insurer generally well resourced, financial advisory firm vary size. some firm small shareholder director double representatives, ceo, cfo, compliance personnel. under fair, review management expertise financial resource financial advisory firms, ensure well manage financially sound. we take review consideration admit new financial advisory firms. make financial advice dedicate service besides raise quality fa representative financial advisory firms, must make financial advice dedicate professional vocation. customer look financial advice deserve serve representative whose primary focus provide quality advice regulate financial products. unregulated activity fa representative we want industry provide financial advisory service primary focus fa representatives. but late, notice worry trend fa representative conduct want conduct activity alongside provide financial advice. let give examples.  we receive query insurance agent also want real estate agents. they want allow market earn commission property transactions, often customer provide financial advice to.  some fa representative even apply casino regulatory authority junket promoter license!  ma receive complaint fa representative use regulatory status market questionable scheme gold bullion. some activity clearly conflict fa activities. they risk undermine interest consumers. we review activity fa representative conduct outside advisory role, ensure representative continue put customer first. specifically, work industry list activity fa representative engage in. to mind, activity clear conflict include:  money lending;  promote junket casinos;  sell real estate;  market investment product accord safeguard customer financial adviser act. bi central bankers’ speech 5 we also review activity fa representative engage conflict may distract representative professional focus. several insurer fa firm recognise risk associate representative may distract commitment remuneration opportunity outside realm financial advisory services. these company accept representative fully dedicate commit provide quality financial advice customers. this be. but practice vary across financial institutions, may practical ban representative undertake activity earn income. ma work industry push consistent industry-wide approach representative engage multiple activities. role introducers fair also review current practice fa firm representative make use “introducers” reach customers. an introducer may another representative, may also man-on-the-street. introducers typically pay fee refer customer financial advisers, get cut commission generate sale customers. the use introducers mean customer risk deal individual whose credential vouch financial institution. it also mean customer may receive proper advice introducers go beyond introduce pressure customer buy products. financial advisory activity insurance broking firm make sure financial advisory role primary focus fa representative one side coin. the aspect ensure, firm whose primary activity financial advisory services, fully capable manage part business. in regard, fair review scope financial advisory activity currently carry insurance brokers. some insurance broke advise group term life insurance complement suite general insurance product offer corporate customers. however, years, notice insurance brokers, fa activity revenue advisory business eclipse core insurance broking business. ma concern insurance broke may sufficient management expertise compliance capability oversee manage fa portion business. low distribution cost our fourth key thrust low cost distribution, keep overall cost life insurance product affordable singaporeans. direct sale simple product the online channel one way low distribution costs. we see use direct sale via internet distribution general insurance product travel insurance motor insurance. why life insurance? the industry could explore use internet alternative distribution channel offer life insurance consumer competitive prices. online distribution also mean product simplified. simple term life insurance via internet could good way help low cost make affordable insurance protection readily available wide population. and simple term life insurance sometimes person need protect risk. ma would like see sale simple term life insurance product internet. 6 bi central bankers’ speech commission-based remuneration distribution structure but customise financial advice still require complicate insurance plans, tailor suit individual family need circumstances, want supplement term life insurance. to low cost products, must address underlie inefficiency remuneration distribution structure. fair fundamentally review commission-based remuneration distribution structure. in singapore, insurance product distribute insurance agencies, banks, financial advisory firms. the premium insurance product include charge cover mortality risk, well various expense incur insurer, distribution management expenses. a substantial proportion premium early year go pay distribution expenses. over life policy, cost account much 8% total premium paid. a key driver cost multi-tier distribution structure common singapore’s insurance company large fa firms. the commission-based, multi-tier distribution structure involve representative upper tier share commission earn lower-tier representative provide insurance financial advice consumer.  take example whole life insurance policy. an fa representative could earn basic commission 50% policy’s annual premium first year, another 40% annual premium follow five years.  his supervisor would turn earn override commission throughout first six years. there typically third tier comprise agency manager also get overrides.  total override first six year amount 70% policy’s annual premium.  together, total commission override earn representative supervisor would equivalent 160% policy’s annual premium. fair examine whether commission structure align interest representative long term interest consumers, whether representative adverse incentive sell product pay high commissions, whether tier structure provide value customer merely add cost. most major jurisdiction long move away tiered structure. the unite kingdom australia move towards fee-based model. they have, fact, ban commission payment product manufacturer financial institution except case pure-protection products. enhance transparency distribution cost a third way low distribution relate cost enhance transparency costs. presently, benefit illustration show total distribution cost hide direct payout representative. customer know pay for. with great transparency, customer decide get money’s worth service advice provide fa representative. benefit illustration also include detail breakdown split protection investment component investment-linked insurance product. customer often assume insurance policy buy cover insurance dependants, fact product may contain substantial save element. insurer strive provide great disclosure premium split protection investment bundle insurance product enable customer good understand buying. bi central bankers’ speech 7 promote culture fair deal the fifth thrust approach instill customer trust life insurance financial advisory service promote culture fair deal financial institutions. deal fairly customer go beyond mere compliance regulatory requirements. it attitude spring ethos value institution. it culture place consumer first, focus right consumer, place premium integrity. it responsibility board senior management forge culture fair deal throughout organisation. the board senior management must set clear strategy achieve fair deal outcomes, monitor implementation, train staff representative treat customer fairly. most all, must – word deed – make clear staff meet revenue target must never expense treat customer fairness honesty. enhance transparency product a key aspect fair deal make insurance investment product transparent. ma enhance safeguard consumer buy investment insurance product complex. for example, consumer invest unit trust via investment-linked life insurance policies, require insurer provide product highlight sheet “phs” underlie funds. the ph write plain language, “question & answer” format prescribe mas. it describe profile customer fund suitable for, fund invest in, risk area could cause customer incur loss. we also require fa representative conduct customer knowledge assessment ass whether customer relevant knowledge experience understand risk product complex innovative feature customer might understand. fair – next step ma recognise fair significant impact industry public. we take consultative approach engage stakeholders. a review panel formed, representation industry associations, investment community, academia, medium consumer bodies, review propose recommendation five area i outlined. ma shortly announce member panel. we solicit feedback public panel begin deliberation make recommendations. i appreciate proposal impact business representatives. i urge industry take long term view customer’s perspective. the aim fair bring high quality financial advisory service good outcome customers, enhance customer trust, promote sustain growth financial advisory industry. ma work ease transition affect changes. conclusion since inception 1962, lia’s key objective always promote high standard best practice life insurance industry, ensure quality financial advisory service raise public awareness understand life insurance. we see lia key partner facilitate fair process develop insurance industry. i congratulate lia golden anniversary wish many fruitful year ahead. thank you. bi central bankers’ speech 1 gill marcus: perspective global domestic economic environment address m gill marcus, governor south african reserve bank, volkswagen south africa strategic conversation dinner, sandton, 15 march 2012. * * * thank opportunity lead strategic conversation evening. we come difficult years, road ahead likely challenging. right seem small breathe space might allow good assessment world today. we see three element global crisis come together, namely sovereign debt, bank crisis, crisis weak growth rise unemployment, particularly among young. there also increase recognition occur simply deep economic crisis, fundamental shift balance force world. this likely take time unfold, significant change take place, grow voice economic power emerge market hear loudly. the global financial crisis still us, although appear bad case global scenario may avoid perhaps merely delayed. but even optimistic scenario europe good news fiscal adjustments, bank deleveraging weight cumulative impact crisis thus far take hold. for reason outlook south african economy bright could be, unless concert effort make something different. currently domestic economy characterise rise inflation slow growth, difficult combination policy-makers deal with. this even i give perspective aspect global domestic economic backdrop. i spend time european situation, context within operate, formulate policy, adopt strategy critical enable u ensure south africa able take advantage opportunity exist, take appropriate measure try protect u ravage global crisis. from south african perspective, happen europe important, give trade link region. although percentage south african manufacture export europe decline past years, around 30 per cent still extremely important trade partner. in recent month progressive downward revision analyst global growth outlook. the imf, late world economic outlook, also downgrade forecast world growth average 3,3 per cent 2012, 3,9 per cent 2013. there still significant risk global environment, intensity immediacy risk may reduce somewhat recent agreement greek bail-out help prevent disorderly default. this agreement expect allow greece roll-over debt mature month. it would premature think european crisis resolve number interrelate mutually reinforce dimension mean uncertainty remains. although risk sovereign debt crisis appear reduce meantime, question sustainability solution persist, particularly light fact european authority emphasise greek bail-out model precedent. the portuguese economy also stress, could still see repetition greek crisis play come months. in absence clear commitment deal possible portuguese crisis, risk contagion systemically important economies, italy spain, increase. although peripheral european country relatively small, combine 2 bi central bankers’ speech sovereign debt around us$1 trillion, significant proportion hold european banks. the action resolve greek debt problem involve significant loss private sector bond-holders, many european banks. in term agreement, bond holder accept loss excess 70 per cent value debt. partly consequence developments, european bank undercapitalised, estimate range us$300 billion us$400 billion. this result significant deleveraging european banks, indication sell asset order achieve require ratios. this credit crunch europe exacerbate need meet new capital requirement raise tier 1 capital asset ratio 9 per cent june 2012. there concern european bank lend could decline around us$3 trillion next 18 months. the interbank market also dysfunctional europe, reflect lack trust banks. the ecb attempt alleviate situation establishment long term refinance operation (ltro) facility, date grant estimate us$1,35 trillion loan bank low interest rates. there evidence significant proportion money go purchase sovereign debt, still early say much go lend household businesses. the credit crunch likely reinforce negative growth outlook region, turn negative feedback loop. the euro area expect contract around 0,5 per cent year, european commission expect negative growth 8 17 eurozone country year. these country include belgium, greece, spain, italy, holland, austria portugal. widespread fiscal consolidation, even country relatively strong fiscal position germany, contribute negative growth outlook. a number countries, spain, portugal ireland attempt reduce deficit gdp ratio around 3 per cent per year next two years, italy 2 per cent per year. the negative growth outlook raise doubt ability greek economy adjust fiscal austerity impose it. the economy contract 15 per cent past two years, expect contract 4,4 per cent year, unemployment increase 7,7 per cent 2008 almost 20 per cent. at root problem balance payment crisis within euro area northern southern europe. the loss competitiveness experience southern european country consequent balance payment deficit effect finance borrow northern europeans. this sustainable indefinitely. under normal circumstance adjustment would facilitate exchange rate depreciation, option rule out, difficult path “internal devaluation”, involve absolute reduction wage expenditure, followed. the reluctant surplus country increase consumption southern european goods, difficult adjustment become politically unpopular measure become deficit countries. apart european situation, prospect part global economy appear promising, risk remain. the u economic growth surprise upside recent months, fear remain nascent recovery could short-lived. in particular, risk political conflict fiscal policy ahead november election could result premature fiscal cutbacks, which, accord estimate could potential reduce u growth two percentage points. there also indication chinese economy may slowing, chinese authority ability resolve intervene strongly prevent so-called hard landing. one region favourable outlook sub-saharan africa, expect grow around 5,5 per cent year. south africa’s financial trade link africa increase recent years, continent fast become major bi central bankers’ speech 3 destination manufacture exports. during financial crisis, africa relatively protect fall-out, give predominance intra-regional trade, south africa would well encourage two-way trade investment region. one consequence global crisis severe social dislocation accompany it, questionable long pain endured. the recent protest street athens general popular opposition raise question whether late initiative politically sustainable. history replete example circumstance similar describe lead political polarisation rise nationalism and/or populism. this happen context divide europe, consensus appropriate solution problems, irresolute leadership reflect weak tenuous coalition governments. the social problem reflect spiral unemployment advance economies. this particularly case come youth unemployment. in respect south africa long unique, estimate unemployment rate 23,9 per cent, youth unemployment around 50 per cent. the negative trend europe particular quite dramatic. in begin 2008 unemployment rate european union 6,9 per cent unemployment rate amongst youth (i.e. person 25 year age) 15,9 per cent. in january 2012 unemployment rate eu 10,7 per cent, youth unemployment measure 22,4 per cent. the number unemployed youth total 5,5 million. there stark divergence within region, overall unemployment range 4,0 per cent austria, 23,3 per cent spain, youth unemployment range 7,8 per cent germany 48,1 per cent greece 49,9 per cent spain. a rule thumb, youth unemployment rate 2 3 time high total unemployment rate. of 27 eu countries, 20 youth unemployment rate 20 per cent more, 7 excess 30 per cent. this phenomenon particular concern, long people remain work, le likely ever work, work again. the unemployment get deskilled, demotivated disaffected, lead attendant social hardship drain society. it also europe unemployment become problem. u unemployment measure 5 per cent crisis, peak around 10 per cent decline current level around 8,5 per cent. youth unemployment currently 16,0 per cent. in uk, youth unemployment – 22,2 per cent – close 1 million mark. the problem youth unemployment advance economy exacerbate age population put strain fiscal positions. the current low interest rate environment economy make even difficult private pension fund generate adequate return age population, potential financial demand governments. this factor result extension work age number countries, make even difficult solve youth unemployment problem, associate fiscal demand time programme scale back. the potential adverse social consequence development profound. the underlie lesson south africa importance generate sustain employment-generating growth need attend grow inequalities. it also clearly preferable, particularly short run, improve debt gdp ratio increase gdp growth, oppose cut absolute level debt. fiscal consolidation do quickly could cause growth decline, cause debt metric deteriorate result negative debt spiral. when fiscal sustainability call question, challenge find balance fiscal consolidation need growth. a i indicated, south africa’s growth outlook short medium term impact significant degree global developments. domestic economic growth 2011 measure 3,1 per cent follow growth 3,2 per cent final quarter year. the 4 bi central bankers’ speech growth forecast 2012 range 2,5 per cent 3,0 per cent, late forecast bank 2,8 per cent. this follow successive downward revision 2011 european crisis intensified. since 2009 recession, growth drive primarily household consumption expenditure, clearly undesirable unsustainable growth path. emphasis must give ensure growth drive investment. there are, however, sign investment expenditure growth gather pace, reinforce proposal around increase infrastructure expenditure follow on. accord late budget, public sector project total r845 billion approve mtef period. this emphasis infrastructure investment appropriate likely contribute improve economic efficiency help alleviation exist bottleneck economy. but focus infrastructure new, plan often meet expectations, particularly since 2010 world cup. for example 2009/10, 83 per cent amount budget infrastructure spent. in 2010/11, decline 68 per cent. importantly, government state-owned enterprise need invest. michael spence, respect growth theorist, book “the next convergence”, show country sustain growth rate around 7 per cent 25 year generally government public sector investment ratio 5 7 per cent gdp, total investment rate least 25 per cent gdp. why emphasise target 7 per cent growth per annum? because consistent growth rate 7 per cent allow double income every 10 years, whereas growth rate 3 per cent take 24 year double incomes. south africa’s gross fix capital formation percentage gdp average around 15,5 per cent decade 1994 accelerate peak around 23 per cent 2008. this positive trend coincide economic growth rate excess 5 per cent decline unemployment rate 21,9 per cent fourth quarter 2008 . since crisis, investment gdp ratio decline 2011 average around 19 per cent. between 1994 2007, government public sector investment average 4,4 per cent gdp, since 2008 average 8 per cent. we conclude lack investment simply problem government failure invest. private sector investment also lacking. but government important role play provide environment conducive private sector investment. for example, notable area private sector investment severely lack mine sector. this may due part uncertainty create regulatory environment, lack investment rail infrastructure impede ability mine get ore ports. this also illustrate government investment necessarily crowd private sector investment. to contrary also crowd investment, example. michael spence sum appropriately follows: “put bluntly, growth require investment, mean present sacrifice future gain. the job leader part get everyone board, build consensus behind forward-looking vision, underpin growth development strategy credible. multiple class participant organize stakeholder need will participants. these include labour, unions, business entrepreneurs, civil society organizations, household various level income distribution.” it investment fix capital essential. human capital important, so. it generally recognise south africa’s school situation seriously lack various respects, equal concern lack train technical skills. it indictment, example, south africa need import skilled artisan welders. germany well establish system apprenticeships, south africa go backwards respect. not undertrained undereducated workforce constrain economic growth, reinforce cycle unemployment widen bi central bankers’ speech 5 inequalities. a michael spence noted, world knowledge connectivity increasingly basis value creation, failure educational system sure form exclusion is. it would inappropriate conclude without say something monetary policy inflation, contribution monetary policy make growth employment trajectory. we know unemployment serious socioeconomic consequences, high inflation. it difficult find example history sustain economic growth high inflation go hand hand. but easy find glare example high inflation contribute socioeconomic dislocation. the inter-war year germany, latin america 1980s, close home zimbabwe previous decade good examples. zimbabwe get advantage hyperinflation, create severe hardships, zimbabwe dollar disappeared. the burden inflation get bear lose job this, unable hedge ravage accelerate price increases. these generally poor often even middle classes, whose save pension fund would render worthless. it hyperinflation problem. even moderate inflation bad poor workers. an annual inflation rate 10 per cent example, regard acceptable, mean worker receive r1000 per month need earn r2590 10 year time simply bad off. with 20 per cent inflation, amount would need r6,190 per month, 25 per cent inflation, require break-even income would r10,000. the high inflation rate, purchase power would lose bargain rounds. in latter case, worker lose quarter purchase power time next wage adjustment. if leave unchecked, high inflation tend breed high inflation. apart redistributive effects, high variable inflation also tend undermine long-term investment, important inflation keep control, monetary policy best place this. but try stem high inflation, monetary policy may negative short run effect economic growth. conversely, monetary stimulus impact cyclical growth. therefore sensitivity part policy maker state business cycle. this essence flexible inflation target is: inflation outside target, flexibility respect time horizon within inflation bring back within target, order smooth cyclical adjustment. monetary policy help growth provide stable low inflation environment conducive investment, provide short-term stimulus, determine underlie growth potential country. this domain policy focus infrastructure structural reform critical. monetary policy currently face challenge rise trend inflation slow domestic economy. accord macroeconomic forecast bank, inflation expect peak around 6,6 per cent second quarter year decline moderately return within target range end year. but lot uncertainty relate outcome. upside risk see come international oil prices, particularly context elevate tension middle-east relate iranian nuclear programme associate sanctions. administer price also remain concern, tendency price many instance set without regard inflation target. however recent developments, include below-inflation tariff increase grant ports, reduction propose e-toll tariff reduction electricity tariff increase grant eskom encouraging. the rand exchange rate could pose upside downside risk, depend global developments. the rand tend depreciate heighten risk perception europe, investor tend seek so-called safe havens. but flow tend reverse risk perception improve. currently market appear take positive view 6 bi central bankers’ speech global development reflect recent appreciation currency. however, i indicate earlier, change quickly. until recently, core inflation – inflation exclude petrol, electricity food – relatively subdued, reflect absence significant demand pressure economy. in general, monetary policy little combat impact first round effect inflation drive exogenous shocks. however recent data seem suggest inflation become generalised, may reflect emergence demand pressures. this something bank monitor carefully. at stage, monetary policy remain relatively accommodative, give challenge growth environment, real policy interest rate slightly zero. a i outline earlier, raise growth potential require concert sustain investment boost economy. an accommodative monetary policy environment part story, responsible monetary policy makers, recognise keep inflation control must do due regard possible impact employment growth. at time, maintain price stability remain central mandate, price stability part societal consensus essential successful implementation forward-looking sustainable growth strategy. thank you. bi central bankers’ speech 1 jean-pierre danthine: a world low interest rate speech mr jean-pierre danthine, member govern board swiss national bank, money market event, zurich, 22 march 2012. * * * i would like extend thank anna faber, adriel jost pierre monnin support write speech. i also thank carmen kissling provide research assistance marco huwiler, rita kobel, sébastien kraenzlin, peter kuster, thomas maag barbara sutter insightful comments, improve quality final version. lady gentlemen, it pleasure welcome swiss national bank’s (snb) eleventh geldmarkt-apéro. for third consecutive year i privilege discuss swiss monetary policy you, together significant aspect context conducted. today, deputy fellow board member, dewet moser provide overview snb’s implementation monetary policy last year. in particular, dewet highlight measure take address strong swiss franc. meanwhile, i concentrate low interest rate environment, play important part guide economic participants’ choice time now. beforehand, however, allow make comment recent monetary policy decision. a emphasise 15 march, minimum exchange rate chf 1.20 per euro remain front centre snb’s monetary policy agenda. the snb continue enforce minimum exchange rate chf 1.20 per euro utmost determination. it prepare buy foreign currency unlimited quantity purpose. the target range three-month libor remain unchanged 0.00–0.25% snb continue maintain liquidity money market exceptionally high level. the snb take decision context mix development global economy. while growth unite state surprisingly positive fourth quarter, gdp fell euro area japan. in switzerland, growth slow significantly past year. add value decline fourth quarter sector affect exchange rate movements. while high value swiss franc continue present enormous challenge economy, minimum exchange rate impact. it reduce exchange rate volatility give business leader good basis planning. there grow indication swiss economy stabilising. for 2012, snb forecast moderate growth, close 1%. the situation financial market also ease little late. it remain uncertain, however, whether advance make solve european sovereign debt crisis succeed defuse situation permanently. moreover, risk geopolitical tension lead rise price oil. the snb’s late analysis lead u adjust conditional inflation forecast downwards again. a first slide highlights, recent forecast 2012 show inflation rate –0.6%, compare rate 0.3% 2013 0.6% 2014. price stability therefore assured. that said, development international economy prove bad foreseen, swiss franc weaken further, expect to, downside risk price stability could re-emerge. whatever case may be, snb stand ready take measure time, economic outlook risk deflation require. 2 bi central bankers’ speech explanation low interest rate today’s low interest rate define feature current economic environment far beyond swiss border case time. i hence paint picture global situation broad brushstrokes, outline specific swiss case. the current low interest rate level view endpoint downward trend mark last twenty year accentuate necessary policy response current economic crisis. a second slide shows, one observe significant continue decrease long-term nominal rate various maturity since early 1980’s. several factor responsible evolution. let first discus root longer-term trends, focus post-2007 developments. long-term trend central banks’ credible commitment price stability could well explain downward trend nominal interest rate experience mature economy period. a see slide 3, inflation g7 country decline particularly high level mid-1970’s, early 1980’s, relatively low stable level since mid-1990’s. give decrease level inflation inflationary expectations, inflation premium include nominal interest rate reduce accordingly. nevertheless, slide 4 show explanation suffice. real interest rates1 also show decline trend, represent average real return 10 year bond g7 countries. what behind evolution? some attribute low interest rate environment so-called save glut. the crux argument excessive accumulation global save relative demand fix capital formation since mid-1990’s. to quote federal reserve chairman ben bernanke “…the substantial shift current account develop emerging-market nation … transform country net borrower international capital market large net lenders.”2 indeed, interest observe that, late 1990’s, aftermath asian crisis, several asian central bank start accumulate significant foreign exchange reserve effort stabilize capital flow exchange rates, position so, prove necessary future. meanwhile, conjecture mature economy age population would experience peak save rates. the “savings glut” hypothesis contested, however. a first point contention impact demographic change save investment may limited, compare factors.3 indeed, save rate industrialise country appear increase period (slide 5). in cases, even decreased. a second discrepancy, assert john b. taylor others, reside observation u save gap, surge save rest world effectively cancel one another out.4 finally, despite significant increase save rate china emerge countries, clear upward trend global national savings. the stable output growth historically low level inflation mid-1980’s onset financial crisis, period often refer “great moderation”, provide alternative complementary explanation downward trend real rates. here, 1 real interest rate calculate use observe market nominal rate minus cpi inflation. 2 bernanke (2005). 3 cf. imf (2005). 4 taylor (2009). cf. also borio disyatat (2011). bi central bankers’ speech 3 basic argument that, macroeconomic volatility decreased, investor become increasingly will accept low term inflation risk premia investments, could translate decrease observe interest rates. whatever precise explanation may be, downward progression long-term nominal real interest rate last twenty year conspicuous. let u focus recent developments. recent development the financial crisis global economic decline observe subsequently add cyclical pressure long-run trend. low negative output growth dampen expectation future growth naturally negative impact long-term rates. in addition, central bank mature economy have, course, respond deteriorate economic situation, first push short-term rate towards appropriately low level subsequently exert pressure longer-term rates. a slide 6 illustrates, first “conventional” monetary policy response bring short-term target interest rate level close zero possible. however, confront zero low bind – is, impossibility use conventional monetary policy – many central bank supplement traditional policy “unconventional” measures, often order impact long-term rates. central bank alter composition balance sheet (credit easing), expand balance sheet, i.e. increase liquidity via one form another asset purchase (quantitative easing, qe) (slide 7). there evidence suggest measure impact private sector borrow costs. often intended, effect vary one asset next. in case bank england, vast majority asset purchase gilts, and, analysis far indicate that, gild yield 100 basis point low would without qe purchase (slide 8).5 several us-centred studies6 also estimate qe measure similar effect there. a study federal reserve bank new york estimates, example, measure reduce ten-year term premium u treasury “somewhere 30 100 basis points.” the find also indicate effect asset purchase agency debt agency mortgage-backed security even significant.7 in addition, recent internal snb study reveal double snb liquidity august-september 2011 significant impact yield 10-year confederation bonds.8 with mind, i would like discus specific swiss case detail. the swiss case historically, switzerland’s long-term interest rate usually low mature economies. recently 10-year swiss government bond yield even fell japanese equivalent reach all-time low (slide 9). current low interest rate switzerland largely explain negative development global economy, progressively increase demand “risk-free” investments, decrease supply. on demand side, increase financial sector risk uncertain economic outlook lead many market participant seek 5 joyce, lasaosa, stevens tong (2010). 6 for example, krogstrup, reynard sutter (2012, forthcoming). 7 gagnon, raskin, remache sack (2010). 8 krogstrup (2012). 4 bi central bankers’ speech protection safe havens. on supply side, european sovereign debt crisis also simultaneous, unrelated, impact. investor increasingly question relative security asset previously consider safe. this reflect main credit rat agencies’ recent downgrade several sovereign bond formerly triple a-rated. this increase demand for, decrease supply of, risk-free asset directly affect switzerland. the reason well known. the country manage maintain longstanding reputation stability. in relative terms, swiss economy also withstand 2007 financial crisis rather well (slide 10), economic figure healthy and, le 40% (slide 11), gdp-to-debt ratio relatively low (slide 12). all prompt surge demand swiss franc-denominated asset put downward pressure swiss interest rates. at policy level, snb use range instrument increase supply liquidity swiss money market exert vigorous downward pressure interest rates, particularly swiss franc reach all-time high early august. in line goal state snb’s announcement 3 august, three-month libor fell 17.5 basis point 2 august low 0.3 basis point 5 september. other money market rate fell historical lows. at time, future contract three-month libor even imply negative future rates. these negative level inevitable result exceptional liquidity measure i mention earlier. though current liquidity level swiss franc money market still extremely high, interest rate fluctuate around zero, condition money market slowly start normalize extremely negative rate disappeared. this reflect recent increase three-month libor, ascribe normalisation rate’s risk premium therefore see change monetary policy. though loan currently conclude interbank market, libor remain important benchmark many credit transaction economy. conclude remark the period low interest rate live outcome cyclical secular

acute financial crisis since “great depression” 1920’s 1930’s. however, even implicit explicit call interest rate remain “low long” everywhere – include switzerland – correspond monetary policy remain cyclical response cyclical phenomenon, which, historical perspective, relatively short-lived. thus, mature economy gradually return normal growth path – i dispute diagnosis demand time severe

personally, i share view current period central bank activism follow resurgence inflation. first, contrary common assertions, persistent - oppose unanticipated - inflation limit capacity reduce sovereign debt burdens. second, low level inflation currently experience result improve monetary policy, combine general acknowledgement inflation buy durable economic performance. neither factor affect recent events. we therefore anticipate that, current enhance level understand monetary mechanisms, central bankers’ continue preference price stability, future inflation level resemble last 20

bank, bild make photomontage wear prussian spike helmet call “true german”. what think that? mario draghi: i really like it. the prussian element good symbol ecb’s key task: maintain price stability protect european savers. bild: for germans, central bank chief must take strict line inflation, politically independent favour strong euro. in light, german you? draghi: these indeed german virtues. but every central banker euro area them. bild: the french president say europe learn german model… draghi: …he’s right. long i say germany model. the old european welfare state model fact dead, make debt far often. the german re-invented – excessive debts. bild: do message people germany? draghi: keep up! bild: the ever-present fear devaluation, inflation, typically german. can understand that? draghi: in twentieth century people country suffer terribly inflation. it destroy wealth make plan impossible. what’s more, really destroy fabric society. bild: why then, ecb president, allow euro area inflation currently stand 2.7%, significantly ecb’s objective? draghi: hold on. if exclude price oil recent tax increase many governments, inflation rate stable month 1.5%. should inflation outlook get worse, immediately take preventive steps. and look facts, speak themselves. since found ecb yearly average inflation rate good comparable period prior euro. bild: in two moves, ecb put almost €1 trillion circulation. that’s inflationary, surely? draghi: the bank ecb lend money have, large, feed economic cycle use meet old liabilities. so money term inflation has, speak, neutralised. this action inflationary. and watch carefully money feed economic cycle. bild: but head germany’s bundesbank, jens weidmann, issue sharp warn flood money. draghi: i get well jens weidmann professionally personally. our difference opinion blow up. 2 bi central bankers’ speech bild: wa exaggerating? draghi: he typical central banker, like us. we like worry thing nobody else worry about. and course risk side effect use strong drug, almost €1 trillion central bank money. it right jens weidmann point i agree him. bild: be rift north south govern council? draghi: no, divide north south. all member govern council take heart germany’s stability culture. the time conflict over. but let also say situation autumn really critical. it could lead dangerous credit crunch bank thus bankruptcies; company would suddenly leave sit high dry financially. we prevent that. bild: and bank nicely it, right? draghi: the ecb’s money get right places. in germany alone, 460 bank participate action, many usual. so wasn’t acutely suffer banks, also many others, many small. that particularly help small medium-sized company account 70% job europe. bild: this sound optimistic. be euro safe currency? draghi: yes, is. bild: be crisis over? draghi: the bad over, also still risks. the situation stabilising. the key data euro area, inflation, balance payment particular budget deficits, good unite states, example. investor regain trust ecb provide support buy government bond several week now. it governments. they must make euro area crisis-proof sustainable manner bild: if birthday today, would want german government chancellor? draghi: trust ecb. trust europe. part ii bild: there end crisis greece. yet again, €100 billion credit give them. but isn’t country bottomless pit? draghi: the greek pass many important reform parliament. if also implement these, country chance get current downward spiral. bild: but party reject reform one win upcoming elections. draghi: to overcome crisis, greece need stable political situation. bild: why taxpayer germany euro area country liable go wrong? draghi: the fact european taxpayer take lot greece. their money must protected. this also ecb take part debt relief – cost would bear taxpayers. bild: how much time greece left? bi central bankers’ speech 3 draghi: some reform take effect quickly. for example, tax reform good tax collection would spread tax burden fairly. that strong incentive work – get economy quickly back feet. bild: many expert think way greece become competitive leaf euro area. draghi: a matter principle, ecb give think country leave euro area. bild: nevertheless… draghi: leave euro area possibility devalue currency would improve anything. it would remove need reform. in fact, consequence leave euro area would high inflation instability – and, foreseeable future, nobody would lend greece money needed. bild: will greek case give prosperity? draghi: yes, renounce exactly result wage cut across sectors. but still easy inside euro area rather outside it. bild: be limit support? or continue like this? draghi: i can’t answer that. we see thing develop country. generally speaking, fact remain want protect taxpayers’ money, euro area cannot turn transfer union, one two country provide money, rest spend, whole thing finance joint eurobonds. that cannot happen. bild: many parties, also germany, call that. draghi: a community must found trust – trust share rule adhere to, example, regard budgetary discipline. that new fiscal pact among euro area state right thing eurobonds would premature. bild: be german chancellor’s stance win through? draghi: let put way: without pressure market germans, much progress make various euro area country would possible. bild: how often speak telephone chancellor? draghi: not often. the ecb mindful independence. and chancellor fully respect this. bi central bankers’ speech 1 guy debelle: bank fund address mr guy debelle, assistant governor (financial markets) reserve bank australia, australian dcm summit 2012, sydney, 22 march 2012. * * * i thank chris stewart cameron dean help. a may aware, last week reserve bank publish bulletin article document recent development structure cost fund australian bank system.1 the bank publish article topic annually year now, also report regularly development various component bank fund quarterly statement monetary policy. today, i go talk article highlight main findings. the discussion around bank fund cost get confuse times. it often unclear whether participant debate refer movement level spreads, latter, exactly spread relative to. the article speech today provide fact serve common foundation discussion. the main point i want highlight are:  the level cash rate set reserve bank primary determinant level intermediaries’ fund cost (and hence level lend rates). however, significant influence intermediaries’ fund costs, risk premia competitive pressures, directly affect cash rate.  over past year, fund cost fall absolute term rise relative cash rate.  deposit pricing, particularly term deposits, major driver recent change fund costs, reflect strong competition deposits. this obviously welcome saver population.  there rise spread wholesale debt issue bank reflect investors’ concern global bank industry. while spread narrow recently, still high past couple years. let start first point. the cash rate set reserve bank board short-term interest rate benchmark anchor broad interest rate structure domestic financial system. it front end risk-free yield curve financial asset generally priced. when cash rate adjust down, whole structure interest rate economy move down, effect direct short maturities. but cash rate clearly determinant rate structure economy. to use three examples:  a one move along term structure risk-free curve, term premia play increase role.  risk premia important component borrow cost private sector entities, include banks. 1 dean c stewart c (2012), “banks’ fund cost lend rates”, rba bulletin, march pp 37−43. 2 bi central bankers’ speech  competitive pressure play important role deposit pricing. these sort determinant rate structure directly affect movement cash rate. a i discus shortly, past years, competitive pressure deposit market risk premia bank sector globally rise substantially. these material impact cost bank fund lend books. while development result movement cash rate, reserve bank board take development account set cash rate ensure structure interest rate economy consistent desire stance monetary policy. moreover, link movement cash rate lend rate australia much tight many countries. in us, example, movement feed fund rate much le direct influence 30-year fixed-rate mortgages. composition banks’ fund the fund structure australian bank system change markedly past year (graph 1). deposit become much large share overall funding, rise little 40 per cent 2007 52 per cent currently. the rise share deposit fund come expense decline share short-term wholesale fund around 30 per cent 20 per cent currently. graph 1 the structure fund show graph 1 bank system whole, particular financial institution. similarly, analysis present cost fund aggregate structure certainly differ institution institution. for example, regional bank generally fund large share book via deposits, significantly decrease use securitisation. credit union build society continue raise vast majority fund via deposits. the major change fund structure large bank switch short-term wholesale fund deposits, although also recently increase bi central bankers’ speech 3 use long-term secure issuance, particularly form cover bonds. while cover bond issuance little effect composition banks’ fund stage, give large stock exist funding, allow major bank achieve fund long tenor case previously. cover bond generally issue term 5 10 years, whereas unsecured bank bond generally issue maturity 5 years. within banks’ deposit funding, mark shift towards term deposits, pay high interest rate form deposits. indeed, term deposit account growth bank deposit since onset financial crisis. they account 44 per cent major banks’ deposits, 30 per cent middle 2007 (graph 2). graph 2 the increase share deposits, particularly term deposits, reflect number interrelate factors:  first, bank offer relatively attractive rate depositors.  second, strong business profit result large corporate cash holdings, increasingly invest deposit rather financial instruments, particularly short-term bank paper.  third, household significantly increase term deposit place directly banks, instead invest financial assets. there also rise deposit place via superannuation manage funds. some part second third factor reflect much change name fundamental shift fund structure. instead hold exposure bank system call short-term wholesale debt, corporates superannuation fund hold exposure form term deposit (of comparable maturity). this reflect 4 bi central bankers’ speech pressure regulators, rat agency market financial institution deposit funded, deposit assess stable, even though, instance, behavioural response investor probably materially different. for banks, term deposit advantage generally relatively stable fund source. the average contractual maturity term deposit fairly short, somewhere four seven months. but term deposit typically roll number time effective maturity around years. from banks’ point view, rate new term deposit also adjust quickly influence growth source funding. however, term deposit relatively short contractual maturity, change price flow whole term deposit book quickly. hence movement rate one big short-run influence change overall fund structure. while competition among bank term deposits, bank also offer attractive transaction save accounts. they pay high interest rate account offer great functionality. the increase value fund invest deposit largely place online saver account account introductory bonus and/or bonus regular deposits. bank report little growth value low-interest transaction-style deposit accounts. at-call online saver account generally assess rapid run-off rate basel iii liquidity standards, particularly attractive banks’ point view liquidity standard take effect begin 2015. that seem affect price product yet, interest see evolve term price product design approach date. cost fund have discuss structure funding, i turn cost funding. the reserve bank us wide range source derive estimate banks’ fund costs. we use data report financial institution apra banks’ regular profit statement market track composition funding. we monitor price offer various form deposit accounts, maintain comprehensive database wholesale funding, update issue issue. we supplement extensive consultation financial institutions, big small. the analysis present contain best estimates. but remain degree imprecision around them. moreover, i mention earlier, estimate system whole, particular financial institution. that said, summary, estimate absolute level banks’ fund cost fell mid 2011 february 2012, le reduction cash rate. there particularly pronounce increase cost term deposit long-term wholesale debt relative cash rate financial market condition deteriorate late 2011. deposit competition deposits, moderate somewhat early 2011, intensify late 2011. consequently, estimate cash rate fall 50 basis point since mid 2011, major banks’ average cost deposit decline 25 basis points. in words, average interest rate deposit indeed fallen, rise relative cash rate. the average spread market rate major banks’ advertise term deposit “specials” increase 35 basis point past year (graph 3). furthermore, bi central bankers’ speech 5 increase share deposit write rate high rate advertise bank mean average rate outstanding term deposit fall quickly benchmark rates, term deposit roll over. that is, bank increasingly pay customer rate advertise window customer ask it, reflect competitive pressures. moreover, shorten average maturity term deposit recently give invert yield curve, mean change price pass quickly. graph 3 the average advertise rate at-call save deposit rise around 20 basis point relative cash rate 2011. again, absolute terms, interest rate declined. take account increase proportion save deposit earn bonus rates, average rate deposit estimate increase 35 50 basis point relative cash rate. interest rate transaction account fall line cash rate many pay low nominal interest rates. hence, cash rate falls, scope low interest rate accounts. wholesale debt the absolute cost issue new unsecured wholesale debt fell 2011 (graph 4). relative risk-free benchmarks, however, cost issue wholesale debt increase since mid 2011. the increase spread banks’ wholesale fund reflect global investor demand compensation take bank credit risk, although rise australian bank le mark bank globally. this widen spread peak begin year recent week spread narrow noticeably. 6 bi central bankers’ speech graph 4 there also increase cost associate hedge foreign exchange risk new foreign-currency denominate bonds. this rise basis swap reflect dearth kangaroo issuance early year time bank raise foreign-currency debt. the pick-up kangaroo issuance recent week alleviate pressure. spread banks’ new wholesale debt come somewhat follow ecb’s 3-year longer-term refinance operations. however, still remain high mid 2011 (graph 5). graph 5 bi central bankers’ speech 7 while relative cost new long-term wholesale fund currently high mature funds, moderate effect major banks’ average bond fund cost relative cash rate date. this reflect fact take least 3 4 year major banks’ exist stock bond fund roll over. since spread begin rise sharply august 2011, major banks’ issuance new bond amount eighth outstanding bonds. a result, cost major banks’ outstanding long-term wholesale debt likely rise 25 basis point relative cash rate past year. the increase small fixed-rate wholesale debt assume swap back variable-rate obligations. the extent rise relative cost individual bank vary accord bank’s use interest rate derivatives. short-term wholesale debt mainly price 1- 3-month bank bill rates. while rate generally fell (in term level) latter half 2011 due sharp fall expect cash rate period, increase cost short-term debt relative expect cash rate measure bank bill ois spread period (graph 6). graph 6 the increase spread also contribute high average cost long-term wholesale debt, relative cash rate, give debt benchmarked short-term bank bill swap rates. these price convention ensure change cash rate, expectation future level, direct effect short- long-term wholesale fund costs. since start year, spread bank bill ois narrow noticeably. the reduction spread reflects, part, reduction short-term issuance high level term wholesale issuance. short-term issuance somewhat buff major banks. when global market dislocated, tend issue onshore short-term debt. this tend drive cost, may also rise time tension cause dislocation globally. conversely, condition improve term wholesale issuance pick up, short-term issuance declines, reduce spread downward pressure improve market sentiment. 8 bi central bankers’ speech if low spread bank bill ois maintained, alleviate upwards pressure, relative cash rate, cost fund banks’ aggregate loan books. overall cost fund take cost individual fund source note above, weight share total bank funding, provide estimate overall change cost fund banks’ aggregate loan books. compare mid 2007, average cost major banks’ fund estimate 120–130 basis point high relative cash rate (graph 7). most increase occur 2008 early 2009 financial crisis intense. since middle 2011, however, increase banks’ fund cost relative cash rate order 20–25 basis points. the graph show fairly large part increase come price deposits. graph 7 the increase fund costs, relative cash rate, differ across institution give difference fund composition price different liabilities. the available evidence suggests, example, overall increase regional banks’ fund cost since onset financial crisis large experienced, average, major banks. this mainly reflect large increase cost regional banks’ deposit significant shift fund mix. banks’ lend rate i primarily focus fund cost today, close i briefly touch development lend rates. the bulletin article go detail. the cost fund important factor influence lend rate bank set. but number factor affect price including: credit risk associate bi central bankers’ speech 9 various type loans, liquidity risk involve fund long-term asset short-term liabilities, choice growth strategy different markets. for close decade prior global financial crisis, banks’ overall cost fund follow cash rate closely, risk premia market low stable. accordingly, interest rate business house variable-rate loan tend adjust line cash rate. nevertheless, period gradual decline spread average interest rate pay loan cash rate. for example, spread average mortgage rate pay cash rate decline 275 basis point 1996 around 125 basis point 2007 (graph 8). graph 8 since onset financial crisis, bank increase spread lend rate cash rate loan types. the increase vary across different type loans, partly reflect difference reassessment riskiness loan expectation regard loss rates. but primary factor drive increase spread lend rate cash rate increase relative cost fund i describe above. financial institution increase lend rate face increase cost maintain net interest margin within range observe recent years.2 in turn, aim maintain profitability. without seek answer question whether movement lend rate “appropriate”, aim speech today, bank’s recently publish analysis, provide fact help discussion. 2 a note dean stewart (2012), number factor affect report net interest margin addition movement lend rate fund costs. and similarly, additional factor affect translation net interest margin profitability. bi central bankers’ speech 1 jens weidmann: lesson crisis monetary policy financial market regulation keynote speech dr jens weidmann, president deutsche bundesbank, frankfurt finance summit, frankfurt main, 20 march 2012. * * * 1. introduction dear professor franke, lady gentlemen, first all, i would like thank opportunity speak today. through numerous collaborations, bundesbank develop close relationship house finance. the exchange two institution always prove rewarding; pleasure follow tradition today frankfurt finance summit. almost five year pass since eruption global financial crisis. global effort resolve crisis draw right consequence exceptional historical comparison, perception financial sector change profoundly. but many question crisis raise fully resolved. among others, question refer financial development lead crisis, chain contagion throughout crisis, well consequence policy intervention taken. all common aim good understand financial sector therefore closely relate ever-changing economic role intermediary. there question role financial sector undergo profound change last decades. this illustrate increase value add financial sector percentage gdp around globe. in us, figure grow 70% last 30 years. in europe, development heterogeneous: spain witness 32% growth value add financial sector percentage gdp 1995–2007, uk 46% growth. in contrast that, germany register drop 9%. but altogether, figure point general increase financial sector’s relative weight. in addition, financial interaction take place within financial sector itself: financial asset hold financial sector increase 100%. in comparison, growth total financial asset hold household non-financial-corporations significantly low around 50% 70%, respectively. two starkly different explanation phenomenon currently debated. accord first paradigm, role financial sector financial intermediary changed, result additional function perform financial system real economy. the second – quite popular – explanation argue increase financial activity merely exaggeration, consequence financial system has, certain degree, uncouple real economy turn unproductive activities. each line argument obviously important policy implication – scope intensity regulation supervision, also policy areas, include central banks. draw right lesson crisis require first clear understand role financial system play real economy. in short remark i therefore take 2 bi central bankers’ speech somewhat general approach go beyond monetary policy issues. i argue that, firstly, highly develop innovative financial system indispensable economic growth, also inherent risk exaggerations. secondly, regulatory effort therefore strike delicate balance constrain exaggeration without stifle innovation thereby hamper economic growth. and finally, give crisis lay bare serious gap understand financial system, i conclude outline field research that, least central bank’s viewpoint, particular interest. 2. the role financial system the fundamental role financial system act intermediary borrower lenders. service transformation maturity, denomination liquidity allow efficient capital allocation, thereby promote innovation growth. furthermore, financial system solve adverse selection moral hazard problem lender borrowers. this crucial importance finance innovation therefore tfp-intensive growth depend age highly develop economies. throughout history, role financial system never static, become complex step economic progress. in process, contemporary structure financial system gradually evolve centuries. bank perform task associate money credit, bond market provide finance government large corporations, stock market provide equity finance joint stock companies, venture capital fund nascent business – myriad financial instrument allow u trade redistribute kind risks. and well-known fact process has, history, accompany build-up burst bubble – usually large, sometimes large costs. prominent example include tulip mania, south sea bubble, roar twenty bubble dot-com bubble. hence always trade-off. on one hand, financial innovation precondition rise prosperity economic development. on hand, fluidity dynamism financial transaction make financial system prone exaggeration emergence speculative bubbles. the financial crisis another illustration pattern, particularly severe one galvanise policy-makers reform financial regulation. but lesson draw? 3. lesson financial regulation regulatory reform aim improve resilience financial system whole shock form default burst bubble. to achieve this, financial regulation prevent market force get control. but must suppress financial innovation; otherwise would eliminate indispensable contribution economic growth development. the european sovereign debt crisis raise awareness importance financial market discipline effect. true, bond market take note difference sovereign risk much late. but economic policy perform even weak prevent excessive deficit emergence severe macroeconomic divergences? for reason, i sceptical correct undesirable result financial market direct prohibition suppress market activities. bi central bankers’ speech 3 instead, regulatory reform reinvigorate principle risk return closely aligned: market participant must hold responsible actions, possibility loss even default constitutive element function market, financial market exception. the reform initiate g20 reflect approach. measure like basel iii new macro-prudential framework explicitly take systemic view financial system. the resolution regime sifis, measure adopt increase transparency create global level play field strive close alignment risk returns. the agenda pick important past trends, increase role non-bank-sector grow interconnectedness financial markets. when look experience financial crisis channel financial system affect economic growth, case make two objective efficient stable financial system are, significant degree, complementary. well design regulatory reform make financial system stable without cut sustainable growth. but constant evolution financial system emergence new instrument player also imply regulatory framework never finalise all. 4. unresolved question prudent regulation supervision crucially depend sound understand financial system. research effort institution around globe, include central bank also keen interest issues, remarkable. however, deep understand still require trend financial market lead financial instability – monetary policy measure sometimes take central bank limit mandate. i want offer research agenda, let pick area particularly interest central banks: securitisation, example, new technique, experience enormous upswing recent decades. it intend disperse credit risk good able assume risk absorb correspond losses, increase welfare. we know securitisation also increase risk-taking thus fragility financial system whole. some element regulatory reform already address problem. but question remain whether do enough reduce drawback without sacrifice benefits. another important reason financial instability potentially serious macroeconomic cost continue overextension balance sheet boom periods, often indication excessive risk-taking. we learn mask vigorous economy. it therefore vital extend knowledge make disguise risk transparent. turn prevention exaggeration direct countermeasures, still know enough desirability different form policy interventions. the search optimal mix measure ex-post ex-ante intervention still ongoing. further work need do order establish whether macro-prudential regulation solve time consistency problem associate ex-post interventions. this particularly relevant issue central banks. since crisis began, function added, especially field macro-prudential policy. a well aware, bundesbank, too, stand ready look forward assume responsibility field. the challenge integrate new task seamlessly function central bank already perform. i think right central bank closely involved, give expertise close linkage central bank functions; doubt independence central bank prime objective maintain price stability must compromised. 4 bi central bankers’ speech additional issue raise european debt crisis. a regard macro-prudential policy, distribution competency european national level various body currently subject heat debate. contagion effect financial crisis particularly severe monetary union, suggest centralise approach. but national financial system still differ significantly within euro area, member state retain large degree autonomy fiscal economic policy, favour exist decentralise setup. an important channel contagion heavy concentration sovereign debt respective national banks. when risk perception start change, bank hold large amount distress sovereign debt become severe burden financial stability. we need know best address sovereign bank nexus. 5. conclusion lady gentlemen, let conclude. the financial system play indispensable role foster innovation growth. this role never static: evolve constantly. and throughout history, process accompany exaggerations. the continuing, never-ending challenge financial market regulation limit latter without stifle undeniably beneficial force work financial system – tame market force self-interest, exorcise them. to so, expand understand financial markets, still limit lack number policy-relevant fields. the bundesbank closely involve endeavour, forum frankfurt finance summit important part process. thank attention, i wish lively, interest discussion. bi central bankers’ speech 1 ewart s williams: economic leadership within caribbean particular reference trinidad tobago feature address mr ewart s williams, governor central bank trinidad tobago, employers’ consultative association trinidad tobago fifty second annual general meeting, port-of-spain, 16 march 2012. * * * thank employer consultative association invite address part lecture series. i also take opportunity congratulate occasion 52nd annual general meeting. your anniversary take place background uncertain economic environment complicate industrial relation climate. yet birthday time celebration much proud of, survive 52 year up down all, make sterling contribution economic development trinidad tobago. you ask speak economic leadership within caribbean region, particular reference trinidad tobago. it rather broad topic i would try give perspective, hop touch issue concern you. without get much detail, i first try indicate economic performance compare regional counterparts, suggest much thankful for. i go make point medium term economic prospect region are, put mildly, uncertain. while trinidad tobago many option caricom neighbours, give uncertainty surround natural resource endowment difficult global economic environment, need undergo considerable structural transformation, maintain increase relatively high live standard enjoy. my over-riding thesis you, private sector, would critical role play process economic transformation. however, success would ultimately depend extent could set meaningful partnership developmental partners, notably state, trade unions, tertiary educational institution ngo community. first history… there doubt trinidad tobago economy make remarkable stride past two decades, doing, assume economic leadership caribbean region. for example, period immediately global recession, say 2000 2008, real gdp growth trinidad tobago average 7.6 per cent per year compare caricom average 2.9 per cent. by 2008, trinidad tobago account 38 per cent regional gdp per caput income us$19,000 compare average us$8,900 caricom territories. the bahamas barbados high per caput incomes. a know, entire region affect global recession, country others. in 2009–2010, economic activity oecs decline cumulative 9 per cent. in barbados jamaica, cumulative decline one-half amount – 5 per cent. in countries, main contribute factor sharp fall tourist arrival workers’ remittances. the oecs affect impact clf/clico crisis (in fact, baico) devastation cause hurricane tomas, particularly st lucia st vincent grenadines. 2 bi central bankers’ speech (the region remain crisis 2011. while improvement tourist arrivals, oecs saw another year economic decline, albeit reduce rate. jamaica barbados report start weak recovery). in trinidad tobago real gdp estimate decline 3 per cent 2009 remain flat 2010 decline 2011 (by 1 per cent). i note guyana suriname two country region emerge unscathed, largely gold resource benefit rise international prices. trinidad tobago’s resilient economic performance, relative neighbours, owe much energy resource entrepreneurial dynamism private sector. these endowment reflected, inter alia, strong government finances, low public debt, robust foreign reserve positions, dominance regional trade. the follow summary statistic paint picture.  regional government run fiscal deficit year since 2000, trinidad tobago run fiscal surplus two years, period.  the caricom region boast among highly-indebted country world, public debt average around 70 per cent gdp (jamaica, grenada st kitts nevis debt ratio 100 per cent gdp). in contrast, trinidad tobago public debt ratio 38 per cent gdp.  the relative fiscal public debt performance part story explain differential credit ratings. trinidad tobago caribbean country rat “a” standard poor’s. the bahamas barbados also investment grade rat – bbb bbb minus, respectively.  trinidad tobago dominate regional trade. for period 2000 2007, trinidad tobago positive trade balance us$1.5 billion vis-a-vis caricom partners; increase us$2.2 billion 2008–2010. much positive trade balance due energy exports. exclude energy trade, still annual positive trade balance around us$400–$500 million. this latter statistic underscore importance regional market manufacture export employment domestic manufacture sector. it raise interest question whether enlighten self-interest justify level financial assistance region. and fact trinidad tobago provide considerable financial assistance region past decade variety ways. since 2000, private sector firm caricom government raise approximately us$2.2 billion local capital market mainly bond issuance. in addition, official support provide trinidad tobago government include us$260 million petroleum stabilisation fund, us$50 million way contribution caricom development fund. the international monetary fund (imf) consider medium growth outlook many country caricom region subdued. exclude trinidad tobago moment, imf envisage only: i) slow recovery tourism demand weak growth advance economies; ii) increase competition scarce foreign direct investment; iii) external shocks, include natural disasters, could undermine economic stability due limit fiscal space high debt levels. bi central bankers’ speech 3 the medium term economic outlook trinidad tobago may slightly good several uncertainty challenge lie ahead. it uncertainty challenge i turn. in speech i make conference host two year ago, i make point “while oil gas bring u are, sure much would carry us”. if 2010, much 2012. (i don’t know but) i must confess uncomfortable prospect energy sector. the scott ryder report tell that, end 2010, prove gas reserve equivalent 9 year production prove oil reserves, equivalent 14 year (production). the data show oil production secular decline several year anecdotal information suggest petro-chemical industry currently face serious gas shortages. this portrait underscore urgent need investment exploration order tap probable possible oil gas reserves. however, result two bid round conduct far, good envisaged. in addition production uncertainties, serious risk gas price medium long term. these arise great proliferation shale gas technology likely lead major increase gas output depress lng price worldwide. the uncertain prospect energy sector central role sector continue play economy next years, may contribute crisis confidence non-energy sector. perhaps national dialogue subject would serve give investor good understand real picture energy sector facilitate meaningful plan much-needed diversification effort. if current trend energy sector persist, transformation non-energy sector become urgent, sustainable growth achieved. this transformation would need

sanusi: bank reform impact nigerian economy lecture mr sanusi lamido sanusi, governor central bank nigeria, university warwick’s economic summit, warwick, 17 february 2012. * * * protocol it great honor invite address warwick economic summit, become one large academic conference europe. i wish commend entire student staff university warwick invite share experience central bank nigeria (cbn). i highly delight part summit top policymakers, professional technocrat around world meet debate exchange view contemporary economic issues. the outcome summit continue inspire policymakers design proactive micro macroeconomic management policy solve emerge economic problem develop develop countries. it backdrop i urge sustain annual summit. my address today focus “banking reform nigeria it impact economy”. a may aware, bank sector nigeria recently witness significant reform hard choice make tackle linger effect global financial crisis, culminate contraction banks’ balance sheet attendant economic losses. i please note problem surmount series reform undertake central bank nigeria. introduction generally, financial system institution facilitate payment extend credit. it encompass function direct real resource ultimate user. it central nervous system market economy contain number separate, yet co-dependent, component essential effective efficient functioning. these component include financial intermediary bank insurance company act principal agent assume liability acquire claims. the second component market financial asset exchanged, third infrastructural component, necessary effective interaction intermediary markets. the three component inextricably intertwined. bank need payment system infrastructure exchange claim securely market hedge risk arise intermediation activities. the bank system therefore function efficiently effectively robust efficient payment system infrastructure. moreover concern ensure sound bank system central bank underscore critical role bank national economic development. bank instance, mobilize save investment purpose generate growth employment. the real sector, productive sector economy, rely heavily bank sector credit. government also raise fund bank system finance developmental programme strategic objectives. it view strategic role bank system national economic development issue sound bank system, proactive reform become imperative. 2 bi central bankers’ speech rationale bank reform nigeria conceptually, economic reform undertake ensure every part economy function efficiently order ensure achievement macroeconomic goal price stability, full employment, high economic growth internal external balances. thus, bank reform nigeria integral part country-wide reform program undertake reposition nigerian economy achieve objective become one 20 large economy year 2020. a part vision, bank sector expect effectively play actual role intermediation bank among global player international financial markets. a i explore later, various reform undertake nigeria target make system effective strengthen growth potentials. in view fact bank take deposit public, need periodic reform order foster financial stability confidence system. the recent experience global financial crisis underscore imperative country embark bank reform regular basis. a aware, world economy hit unprecedented financial economic crisis 2007–2009 result global recession. this crisis lead collapse many world-renowned financial institution even cause entire nation render bankrupt. in nigeria, economy falter hit second round effect crisis stock market collapse 70 per cent 2008–2009 many nigerian bank sustain huge losses, particularly result exposure capital market downstream oil gas sector. therefore, cbn rescue 8 bank capital liquidity injections, well removal top executive consequent prosecution commit infractions. these action become necessary restore confidence sanity bank system. a holistic investigation go wrong nigeria lead bank crisis 2008 find eight interrelate factor responsible. these macroeconomic instability cause large sudden capital inflows, major failure corporate governance banks, lack investor consumer sophistication, inadequate disclosure transparency financial position banks, critical gap regulatory framework regulations, uneven supervision enforcement, unstructured governance & management process cbn/ weakness business environment. each factor serious right. act together bring entire nigerian financial system brink collapse. we know well-functioning financial system matter everyone economy large. the nigerian economy huge potential growth. to realize potential, imperative learn lesson crisis take step fix problems, also introduce measure establish financial stability, healthy evolution financial sector ensure bank sector contribute development real economy. a result, nigerian bank system steadily evolved, follow wide far-reaching reform embark upon regulatory authorities. follow bank crisis 2008, central bank nigeria articulate blue print know “the project alpha initiative” reform nigerian financial system general bank sector particular. the reform aim remove inherent weakness fragmentation financial system, integrate various ad-hoc piecemeal reform unleash huge potential economy. bi central bankers’ speech 3 critical element bank reform nigeria the current reform begin 2004 consolidation programme necessitate need strengthen banks. the policy thrust inception, grow bank position play pivotal role drive development across sector economy. a result, bank consolidate merger acquisitions, raise capital base n2 billion minimum n25 billion, reduce number bank 89 25 2005, late 24. beyond need recapitalize banks, regulatory reform also focus following:  risk-focused rule-based regulatory framework;  zero tolerance regulatory framework data/information rendition/reporting infractions;  strict enforcement corporate governance principle banking;  expeditious process rendition return bank financial institution e-fass;  revision update relevant law effective corporate governance ensure great transparency accountability implementation bank law regulations, well as;  the introduction flexible interest rate base framework make monetary policy rate operate target. the new framework enable bank proactive counter inflationary pressures. the corridor regime help check wide fluctuation interbank rate also engender orderly development money market segment payment system reforms, among others. the bank year identify key priority sector develop tailor intervention support promote growth. some key intervention real sector include:  n200 billion refinancing/restructuring sme/manufacturing fund  n300 billion long term fund power aviation  commercial agricultural credit scheme (cacs)  the small medium enterprise (sme) credit guarantee scheme (smecgs)  in addition nigerian incentive-based risk share system agricultural lend (nirsal) established. the programme demand-driven credit facility would build capacity bank engage deliver loan agriculture provide technical assistance reduce counterparty risk face banks. it also seek pool current resource cbn agricultural finance scheme different component programme. furthermore, bank collaborate security exchange commission (sec) nigerian stock exchange (nse), reduce cost transactions, particularly bond issues, diversify fund source away bank well attract foreign portfolio investor sector. in 2010, asset management corporation nigeria (amcon) establish follow promulgation enable act national assembly. it special purpose vehicle aim address problem non-performing loan nigerian bank industry, among others. in line mandate, amcon recently acquire non-performing risk asset bank worth n1.7 trillion, expect boost 4 bi central bankers’ speech liquidity well enhance safety soundness. with intervention amcon, bank industry ratio non-performing loan total credit significantly reduce 34.4 per cent november 2010 4.95 per cent december 2011. in order ensure amcon achieve mandate, cbn deposit money bank sign mou finance amcon. the cbn shall contribute n50 billion annually amcon, participate bank shall contribute amount equivalent 0.3 per cent total asset annually sink fund date audit financial statement immediate precede financial year. therefore, cost resolution nigerian taxpayer significantly minimized. to engender public confidence bank system enhance customer protection, cbn establish consumer financial protection division provide platform consumer seek redress. in first three month operation, division receive 600 consumer complaints, manifestation absence effective consumer complaint resolution mechanism banks. the cbn also issue directive bank establish customer help desk head office branches. in addition, cbn commence comprehensive review guide bank charge view make charge realistic consumer friendly. the cbn take step integrate bank system global best practice financial report disclosure adoption international financial report standard (ifrs) nigerian bank sector end-2010. this help enhance market discipline, reduce uncertainties, limit risk unwarranted contagion. the universal bank (ub) model adopt 2001, allow bank diversify non-bank financial businesses. follow consolidation programme, bank become awash capital. some operator abuse laudable objective ub model bank operate private equity venture capital fund detriment core bank practices. to address observe challenges, cbn review ub model view direct bank focus core bank business only. under new model, license bank authorize carry follow type business:  commercial bank (with either regional, national international authorization);  merchant (investment) banking;  specialize bank (microfinance, mortgage, non-interest bank (regional national);  development finance institutions. the introduction non-interest bank nigeria expect herald entry new market institutional player thus deepen nation’s financial market quest financial inclusion. in fact, first fully license non-interest bank country (jaiz bank plc.) start business friday, january 6, 2012. similarly, importance microfinance grow economy cannot over-emphasized, give potential address challenge exclude large population full participation economic activities. a december 2011 24 deposit money bank 5,789 branch 816 microfinance bank bring total bank branch 6,605. the ratio bank branch total population 24,224 persons, indicate high level financial exclusion. this substantiate 2010 enhance financial innovation access (efina) survey, observe 46.3 per cent nigeria’s population still financially exclude compare south africa, kenya, botswana 26.0 per cent, 32.7 per cent 33.0 per cent, respectively. thus, 2012 bank look establish microfinance development fund (mdf) aim improve access bi central bankers’ speech 5 affordable sustainable source finance microfinance institution (mfis) microfinance bank (mfbs). it would commercial social components. this would enhance operation outreach support capacity build activity mfbs/mfis. the bankers’ committee declare 2012 year “women empowerment” bank industry. a sub-committee woman empowerment formed, ceo standard charter bank nigeria chairperson. the cbn work establish special fund end year would provide credit facility woman single digit interest rate. the cbn also work bank ensure certain percentage senior management board seat reserve women. the bank recently introduce new policy “cash le policy” part ongoing reform address currency management challenge nigeria, well enhance national payment system. a may aware nigerian economy heavily cash-oriented transaction good services. this huge cash transaction increase operational cost bank sector, pass customer form high service charge high lend rates. these operational cost significant due high cost incur cash management, currency sorting, cash movement frequent print currency notes. the direct cost cash management bank industry estimate n192 billion 2012. research show 90 per cent withdrawal bank customers’ typically n150,000 whereas, 10 per cent bank customer withdraw n150,000 responsible rise cost cash management incur generality bank customers. there also risk involve keep move large amount cash, namely high incidence robberies, encourage corrupt practice public’s propensity abuse mishandle currency notes. the cbn, collaboration bankers’ committee, aim achieve environment high increase proportion transaction carry cheque electronic payment line global trends. the enforcement t+2 cheque clear cycle step effort on-going reduce cycle t+1. anybody make payment n10 million clear system cheque. the cbn recognize need balance objective meet genuine currency transaction demand combat speculative market behavior may negatively affect economic growth stabilization measures. the new cash withdrawal policy ensure large proportion currency circulation capture within bank system, thereby enhance efficacy monetary policy operation economic stabilization measures. the policy not way stop account holder withdraw amount money desire accounts. the policy simply recognize bank business and, business, cost sometimes share business customers. the policy stipulate withdraw n150,000 (for individual account holders) n1,000,000 (for corporate account holders), transaction cost. the various measure notwithstanding, need intervene bank merge order strengthen capital base remain competitive market. accordingly, five transaction implementation agreement (tias) sign among banks, cbn issue letter objection bank acquire proceed merger entities. the sign legally bind tia five (5) bank full capitalization 3 new bank amcon resolve issue combine negative asset value eight cbn intervene banks. similarly, recapitalization five bank sign tia complete 2011. 6 bi central bankers’ speech impact reform the current bank reform yield follow result among others: i. the reform bring new mindset industry bank put place best practice area corporate governance risk management. transparency public disclosure transaction remarkably improved. ii. a number bank return profit-making path improve balance sheets, recent result financial statement shown. iii. bank gradually resume lend private sector additional liquidity n1.7 trillion inject bank system issuance amcon bonds, significant progress re-directing credit power sector smes single digit interest rates. these initiative save help create thousand job economy. iv. a new code corporate governance issue bank. the ceo bank shall serve maximum tenure 10 years. furthermore, ceo would serve 10 year july 31, 2010 cease function capacity hand successors. v. nigerian bank key player global financial market many fall within top 20 bank africa among top 1000 bank world. vi. the reform culminate moderate spread lend deposit rate 9.7 per cent end-december 2011, 12.2 per cent 2010. this contribute exist macroeconomic stability economy inflation moderate 10.3 per cent end-december 2011. vii. the hitherto volatility exchange rate witness foreign exchange market bring control. the premium within international standard 5.0 per cent. viii. there great cooperation monetary authority bank regular meet collaboration policy issues. ix. the reform bring great confidence bank system removal distress bank adoption strict code corporate governance. x. increase widespread use e-payment service among nigerians. bi central bankers’ speech 7 challenge bank reform the nigerian bank reform, despite laudable achievement confront certain challenges. first foremost wrong perception intent reform. the introduction new bank model, especially specialize bank (non-interest banking), intend broaden scope financial service offer bank nigeria. however, give religious connotation. the wrong perception stiff resistance policy could potentially deter prospective investor bank industry. second, reluctance nigerian accept positive change global dynamic another challenge. there incontrovertible evidence excessive liquidity system measure broad money (m2), narrow money (m1) currency circulation partly attributable high cash transaction economic activities, continue undermine effort achieve price stability. yet cashless policy face significant resistance, despite prospect economic growth development global trend intensity usage e-payments. third, cost business nigeria still high compare develop economy emerge develop country owe poor state infrastructure. another challenge high growth rate record last five year inclusive, imply transcend sustainable development. this situation responsible high unemployment poverty levels, inevitably affect low bank habit country. another key challenge quality manpower: real strategic change take place competent commit workforce constantly expose train development. the competitive financial sector environment require highly skilled workforce would effectively contribute value creation within financial institutions. hitherto, employee recruitment merely comply regulatory requirements, train view non-revenue function costly unnecessary. conclusion the bank sector occupy vital position economy must subject continuous reform function efficiently. the modest achievement record far largely due great collaboration commitment purpose among key stakeholders. thus, cbn effort develop sound vibrant bank system strive ensure democratization policy sustained. it also continue ensure bank abide strictly code corporate governance efficient function bank industry. thank listening. bi central bankers’ speech 1 benoît cœuré: the euro area sovereign debt market: lesson crisis speech mr benoît cœuré, member executive board european central bank, 12th imf annual forum manage sovereign risk public debt: “managing sovereign debt: a seismic shift demand supply dynamics?”, rio de janeiro, 28–29 june 2012. * * * i wish thank maximilian freier wolfgang lemke contribution speech. i remain solely responsible opinion contain herein. mr deputy manage director, lady gentlemen, it great pleasure speak today 12th imf forum manage sovereign risk public debt. clearly, topic never relevant today. in remark today, i focus experience euro area consider follow three questions: first, characterise price sovereign credit risk last two decades? second, relevance sovereign debt market tension monetary policy? and third, lesson learnt? what characterise price sovereign credit risk last two decades? let start first question, price sovereign risk. look sovereign debt market euro area past two decades, possible clearly distinguish three main periods. they display distinct pattern government bond pricing.1 first, run-up economic monetary union (emu), especially period five year 1999, euro introduced. during time, sovereign bond yield quickly converge towards german bunds. much convergence explain elimination exchange rate inflation risks. in addition, european government make great effort reduce deficit debt level order fulfil maastricht criterion join common currency. in second period, range introduction euro 1999 collapse lehman brother september 2008, government bond yield remain moderate level differ much country country. the yield spread ten-year government bond yield vis-à-vis german bunds reach maximum 70 basis points, record 15 basis point average.2 these observation raise questions: period see undifferentiated price government debt securities? and “macroeconomic fundamentals” characterise different sovereign issuer similar? in fact, no: state public finance distinctly persistently different across countries. so different degree fiscal solidity (or rather lack thereof) “priced in” government bond prices? there several reasons. market participant may insufficiently forward-looking complacent. they may extrapolate experience long period 1 see, e.g., european central bank, “financial integration europe”, may 2011, chapter i.2 characterization different phase bond market development since run-up emu detail overview bond market situation first stage sovereign debt crisis. 2 this base ten-year government bond spread initial twelve euro area member state vis-à-vis germany january 1999 august 2008, greek spread include 2001, greece join emu. 2 bi central bankers’ speech low macroeconomic volatility – so-called “great moderation” – may felt insulate extreme macroeconomic event. in particular, may appear inconceivable euro area sovereign issuer could actually reach “fiscal limit” – is, situation could re-finance debt. moreover, “great moderation” experience lead low level investors’ risk aversion low price risk across asset classes. the depth euro-denominated government bond markets, together expansion diversification global foreign exchange reserves, may also create false perception demand sovereign bond infinitely elastic. finally, no-bail-out clause maastricht treaty may simply fully credible investors. in third phase, since autumn 2008, sudden disruptive re-pricing sovereign credit risk take place. government bond yield start diverge, sometimes reach level match exceed early 1990s. there fundamental reason re-pricing risk. fiscal expansion due need fight crisis come top already high level public debt. governments’ commitment support systemically important financial institution add contingent liabilities. low potential growth rate raise concern public finance sustainability. in addition fundamental causes, sovereign bond market jurisdiction characterise poor liquidity high volatility. in context, investors’ worry regard loss market access member state may become entrenched, expectation self-fulfilling. moreover, countries, government debt market liquidity threaten completely dry periods. overall, combination fundamental cause market distortions. it soon become clear dramatic movement government bond yield merely barometer investors’ valuation liquidity credit risk. rather, extreme level bond yield exert adverse influence financial market segments, bank sector also effectiveness monetary policy. what relevance sovereign debt market tension monetary policy? there strong link stability sovereign debt market smooth function monetary policy. this become clear consider prominent role government bond monetary policy transmission mechanism. i would like identify four channel function government bond market interfere transmission monetary policy. let call interest rate channel, wealth channel, collateral channel, bank balance sheet channel. first, government bond play key role transmit monetary policy stance real economy via so-called interest rate channel. in time government bond consider essentially risk-free liquid instruments, change current expect policy rate central factor shift government bond yield curve. change long-term bond yields, turn, translate extent movement corporate bond yield bank lend rate – either via arbitrage relation via price heuristic base government bond –, thus ensure smooth transmission monetary policy throughout financial markets. however, since end-2008 bond yield change several sovereign issuer euro area become heavily dominate high volatile premiums, often drive contagion market overreaction. such effect come override change monetary policy stance, blur transmission monetary policy signal real economy. second, face threaten direct indirect loss strong price decline sovereign bonds, consumer may opt precautionary savings, would counteract desire stimulus consumption monetary policy easing. bi central bankers’ speech 3 third, government debt security key source collateral bank use secure lend bank ecb. with sharp decline sovereign bond price – often associate rat downgrade respective sovereign issuer – government bond make subject significant haircut refinance power declined. this erode volume collateral available form government bond stress re-financing possibility banks. fourth, re-pricing government debt also direct negative impact asset side bank therefore perceive riskiness. in fact, since 2009, see close relationship measure bank sovereign credit risk. this sovereign-bank nexus constitute fundamental impediment resolve crisis euro area. on one hand, rise sovereign credit risk affect banks’ credit risk via exposure government debt. this create deleveraging pressure may turn disorderly dynamic characterise fire sales. on hand, ail bank sector increase burden face governments. these two effect mutually reinforce constitute vicious circle. for banks, increase credit risk make re-financing harder. in short, unsecured finance hamper perception increase bank riskiness secure finance undermine erosion collateral. this turn become major obstacle grant loan real economy. a bank main source finance euro area, could seriously jeopardise flow credit enterprise households. what lesson learnt? these development euro area sovereign bond market offer one clear lesson: financial market prone exaggerations, amplify pro-cyclicality inherent asset valuations. usually, “good times”, risk appetite strong economic condition favourable, asset price tend high risk spread tend low. however, financial market tend over-complacent time time, especially protract period see extreme event materialising. this tendency probably lead excessive tighten euro-denominated yield run-up euro. in “bad times”, degree risk aversion increase gdp growth contracts, asset price tend decline risk spread rise. also bad times, standard pattern pro-cyclicality may amplify market exaggerations: investor tend over-price certain type risk thus under-price respective financial assets. exaggerate pro-cyclicality type hit sovereign bond market crisis. furthermore, particular use sovereign bond collateral, exert adverse effect segment financial markets, fund market financial institutions. to remedy exaggerate pro-cyclicality mean dispense discipline role financial markets. the history monetary union teach u interest lesson: discipline role intra-euro area exchange rate lost, volatility tension fact migrate sovereign debt markets, build surface. even though market sometimes misprice assets, nevertheless provide useful service term signalling, price discovery incentives. for example, market push yield country weak fiscal positions, imbalance would remain unnoticed grow much larger, cost fix would even higher. while attenuate exaggerate pro-cyclicality important avoid self-fulfilling expectation lead bad equilibriums, time recognise market issue valuable signals. there number way mitigate exaggerate pro-cyclicality government bond markets. one way reduce reliance financial, regulatory supervisory framework credit ratings. the european commission put forward number proposal end. similarly, worth consider way delink risk assessment credit institution credit rat sovereign. in addition, risk management 4 bi central bankers’ speech central clear counterparties ccps particular importance, increase number financial transaction expect migrate them. the cpss-iosco principle financial market infrastructure expect ccps adopt forward-looking conservative margin haircut policy limit risk destabilize response change credit ratings. but address root cause current instability, fundamental policy adopted. the adverse feedback loop bank sovereigns, i mention before, break establish true financial union: view include creation pan-euro area deposit insurance fund pan-euro area bank resolution framework, support single supervisory system centralise decision-making. if european stability mechanism – institution provide financial assistance euro area member state order safeguard stability euro area whole – could inject capital directly banks, would also help break bank-sovereign loop. of course, support must come strong conditionality control. let note depend design, financial union could introduce additional element risk-sharing among euro area countries, such, subject strong democratic accountability control national european level. most importantly, euro area country need return sound macroeconomic fiscal positions. this may sound obvious, unfortunately threaten slip focus recent discussions. there substantial progress towards consolidate foundation emu. fiscal rule strengthened, almost european government sign treaty contain so-called fiscal compact, mandate contract party introduce legally enforceable debt brake countries.3 the reform governance framework also provide new tool improve budgetary surveillance well prevent address macroeconomic imbalance – “six-pack” reform “two-pack” legislation example forcefully implemented. look ahead, path towards fiscal union, base principle responsibility proper control accountability, would provide sound “fiscal pillar” single currency could safely rest. some suggest could provide basis introduction euro area-wide fund instrument joint several liabilities. such instrument could contribute smooth function stability-oriented monetary policy, protect member state temporary tension arise part union offset emergence self-fulfilling expectation lead bad equilibriums. there important caveat, however. in 1790 report public credit, alexander hamilton wish “to see incorporated, fundamental maxim system public credit unite states, creation debt always accompany mean extinguishment”. common fund instrument would require share decision make national debt deficit probably joint control fiscal expenditure taxation. they result political integration; cannot precede it. likewise, importantly, fiscal union come participate country successfully restore domestic fiscal sustainability solidify condition long-term growth. joint debt issuance cannot substitute put national fiscal house order restore competitiveness. 3 “a fiscal compact strong economic monetary union”, ecb monthly bulletin, may 2012. bi central bankers’ speech 5 conclusion let conclude. euro area sovereign debt market go unprecedented challenges. the inherent pro-cyclicality exaggeration time characterize financial market recognize addressed. however, structural problem call structural answers. the current overhaul fiscal, financial economic governance euro area help put single currency sound sustainable footing. bi central bankers’ speech 1 k c chakrabarty: ict base financial inclusion – carve new path innovation address dr k c

sector go perhaps chequer phase history usefulness financial innovation extensive debate globally, hearten participate seminar endeavor carve new path indian bank innovations. congratulation organizer choose contemporary forward look topic. let begin refer recent report world economic forum title “rethinking negative innovation – reduce negative outcome retain benefits”. the report attempt answer certain fundamental questions: a. be financial innovation needed? b. there thin line demarcation innovation violation. c. what need ensure financial innovation good emphasize positive outcome reduce adverse consequences? after financial crisis, become fashionable condemn financial innovation toto, must recognize without continue financial innovation, financial market develop develop nation perform potential. but financial innovation result benefits, need focus treasury income must, instead, customer orientation. when innovation focus good alignment interest bank customers, always result win-win situations. i say innovation payment settlement systems, particularly deal one-time customer interface, customer focus. the result visible across globe. the segment financial market come unscathed crisis payment settlement system. however, financial sector succeed innovate bring efficiency product engage customer life cycle basis. finally, remember financial innovation cannot outpace innovation real sector. customer-centric technology you assemble chart new path innovation. however, let u bear mind innovation successful, necessarily customer focussed. in country like india, access financial service remain issue, innovation particularly focus financial inclusion small marginalized, viable section society. what make innovation feasible rapid pace today vis-a-vis say, last century? undoubtedly, advent technology. but, i say past also, financial sector, technology innovation true value customers, must lead good customer service three way (a) fast hassle free (b) safe error free, importantly (c) easy access cheaper. have happened? if 2 bi central bankers’ speech ask vote, i may cast half vote (a) abstain vote (b) cast negative vote (c). let amplify. what important prerequisite computer electronic device customer’s perspective inclusion perspective? to standardization. ha happen across bank services? let start term best financial innovation recent time – atms.

commercial bank financial institutions; • private sector representative • participants; • lady gentlemen; i would like firstly express appreciation director uneca, southern region office extend invitation deliver keynote address start expert group meet finance small medium scale industries. i commend uneca great effort bring together assembly high level official expert government, financial sector, private sector academic institution discus vex problem enhance financial flow sme sector africa. i note elaborate programme meet next three day cover wide spectrum issue focus factor constrain smes access finance focus need do change situation. the meet is, therefore, opportunity u face number challenge characterize sector. these include revisit strategy approach sme finance currently use much require review current institutional arrangement finance directly deliver smes, one hand, indirectly obstruct facilitate flow resources, other. however, i believe probably great challenge assembly attempt narrow gap analysis problem implementation measure action work. meetings, workshops, seminars, etc. sme finance plenty national, regional international levels. some opportunity attend several meet past. indeed, become expert talk subject. barely two week ago, bank zambia hold financial sector forum lusaka view various stakeholder need do address bind constraint sme sector considered. the fact discourse sme finance continue underpin two significant positions. firstly, give recognition fact aware potential sector generate employment, promote economic growth reduce exist poverty levels. in low income sub-saharan african countries, smes micro-enterprises make 90% enterprises. however, due various constraint face, overall contribution gdp country low 20% although estimate show could scale 60% great realization sector’s potential. contribution employment high 63%. for low income countries, smes main 2 bi central bankers’ speech source job income subsistence agriculture. particularly significant great source livelihood woman half smes 70% africa’s rural population survive formal informal sme sector. there little doubt, therefore, smes form solid basis sustainable economic development continent. secondly, continue discourse smes remind u possibility probably do talk problem fix it. although development smes vary extensively across africa, clear country major obstacle growth lack sustainable cost effective financial products. south africa mauritius region north africa do commendable job develop flourish smes sectors. part reason success country attribute modern financial system clear policy support growth sector. however, fact still remain african countries, sustainable way finance smes yet found. a i mention earlier, programme meet broad extensive. but i would wish draw attention number broad area reflection i believe help deliver great finance sector. the first area need accept bank even expect provide sme finance products. the cost structure skill orientation simply make finance institution completely unsuitable deliver sme product cost effectively. the implication great effort must place develop financial institution see sme finance core business therefore set develop expertise require finance smes successfully. fairly often discussion sme finance reduce two diametrically oppose positions. on one hand, smes consider bank represent high risk therefore, avoid deal cautiously premium price. on hand, bank accuse inflexible risk averse consequently irrelevant sector. it important understand truth lie two statement order advance cause sme financing. firstly, fact smes present high credit risk well-structured corporate entities. smes may proper account records, may severe governance issue undermine accountability, poor access markets, poor skill level include financial illiteracy promoters, lack collateral lender rely event failure, may even exist appropriate legal form even assessment viability project might difficult. lend smes lender nightmare bankers. but also true bank structure deal corporates risk averse inflexible deal smes. often bring inappropriate risk assessment tools, may focus much collateral rather project viability. they may even regard sme finance peripheral business. because limit knowledge smes, experience failure reinforce notion smes risky. what want finance institution structure respond unique characteristic smes. specialise sme lend institution likely handle risk problem present smes challenge overcome appropriate product credit risk management strategy basis inaction avoid sector altogether. in short, lend strategy ensure success corporates necessarily ensure similar success smes. appropriate sme finance institution must least make lend smes core business. the second area reflection i would urge meet consider build appropriate finance model show work africa develop country benefit best practice available. in south africa, instance, franchise allow use brand name build capacity bi central bankers’ speech 3 important driver sme finance since reduce perceive risk business failure. warehouse receipt finance guarantee loan agricultural stock extensively use elsewhere much africa. in country asia, use sme cluster model help increase sme finance build great confidence lender smes. the cluster model base member sme entity seek finance together provide collective guarantee financial institutions. the cluster also ensure credit compliance member facilitate constant interaction financial institutions. naturally, one must guard temptation adopt experience without serious reflection – but, appear desirable need build finance model appropriate therefore deliver sustainable financing. we always require re-invent wheel process. the third last area reflection must understand constraint limit flow finance smes sometimes beyond scope financial institution outside inherent adverse characteristic smes. there factor exist outside financial system beyond smes nonetheless affect resource flows. these might include poor infrastructure, bureaucracy make difficult carry business, unattractive tax regime unclear unfavourable government policies. acquire appreciation factor appropriately deal help foster efficient use available financial resource smes, increase success application credit therefore give positive feedback finance institution encourage lend sector. let conclude wish fruitful three day deliberation reiterate challenge attempt narrow undesirable gap identification problem deliver practical solution enable flow appropriate sustainable financial resource smes enable play wealth creation development role africa. for me, sme sector great engine economic development africa. meet like help make become that. but must also go beyond pay lip service sector show true real commitment make sector strong continent. i suspect go beyond lip service might, instance require paradigm shift part financiers, government player sme sector itself. i thank attention!!! bi central bankers’ speech 1 ipumbu shiimi: address financial inclusion namibia statement mr ipumbu shiimi, governor bank namibia, official

(it indeed honour privilege evening, one beautiful city world accept, behalf one respect central bank world, dufrenoy prize innovation, award year 2012 reserve bank india, calibrate approach introduction regulation financial products. i thank contribute confer honour us. and now, i award prize innovation french language, let continue speech english.) let begin refer citation jury decide

research financial economics close remark mr øystein olsen, governor norge bank (central bank norway), norwegian finance initiative (nfi) conference 2012, oslo, 20 june 2012. * * * in 2011 norge bank establish norwegian finance initiative – nfi. through nfi aim promote excellence. excellence research, curiosity criticism. one objective nfi contribute qualify debate norway fund, strategy management. top-quality research academic institution norway necessary condition this. the fundamental idea nfi provide incentive program lead long-run structural improvement research teach financial economics. over past year, introduce seven programs, direct student faculty financial economics academic institution norway. one important program involve co-sponsoring position hire outstanding academics. in way norwegian finance initiative help academic institution norway build infrastructure need sustain lively research culture. another nfi program publication bonus. the publication bonus establish norwegian finance initiative provide incentive exist faculty go extra mile produce high-quality, high-impact research. the program also signal young scholar value institution place level achievement. a scholar norway begin respond incentives, turn help set expectation peer students, lead virtuous cycle. today, i proud announce first two bonus article accept publication best journal nfi program established. the first øyvind norli, professor norwegian business school – bi. in 2007, norli author much cite paper: “sports sentiment stock returns”, publish journal finance. here, norli document effect mood swings: stock market tend take serious hit day lose perceive important football match. interest is, decide pay bonus now. recently, journal financial economics accept another papers: “geographic dispersion stock returns”. norli co-author diego garcía show company truly local outperform geographically disperse company eight percentage point year – remarkable effect. the winner i equally happy announce richard priestley, also professor bi. priestley publish several paper exchange rate regimes, many relationship establishment euro equity price across region. the scope bonus-winning paper even global. it title “the world business cycle expect returns”, accept publication premier european finance journal: review finance. in paper, priestley co-author ilan cooper use novel interest measure business variable, namely ratio capital output. this ratio good predictor return financial indices, equity bond return credit spreads, across time across markets. the paper cooper priestley demonstrate neatly central element modern financial economics: expect return financial security vary time, tend move business cycle. this fact highly relevant long-term investor fund, one conference’s central topics. since inception 1998, mandate fund prescribe strategic fix equity share; 40 percent initial years, increase 60 percent year ago. 2 bi central bankers’ speech a fix share may sound trivial. it not. the average portfolio investor cannot rebalanced. a risk premium vary time, equity value swing. equity volatile bonds, equity share combine market portfolio bond equity fluctuate substantially. rebalancing imply take risk risk already perceive high. when value equity fall bonds, rebalancing mean would sell bond buy equities. to develop robust rebalancing strategy, must understand other, also highly competitive investors, take side trades. we also need understand edge, comparative advantage – disadvantage – size, time horizon, governance structure fund. these issue intimately link question research frontier financial economics. so far, rebalancing strategy serve fund well. from 1998 2011, around 0.5 percentage point – considerable portion – total annual return attribute rebalancing. we believe rebalancing also important go forward, need deepen understand time-varying expect return risks. the main topic today’s conference – well-functioning market – also particular interest us. without well-functioning markets, massive reallocation wealth oil grind claim small share future global output would feasible. well-functioning financial market also, allocation real resources, important sustain growth global level. the financial crisis display great challenge relate market function. we saw mispricing risk, difficulty manage financial imbalances. other problem relate liquidity. trade fix income instrument take place desk large investment banks. the problem bank september 2008 imply literally close main fix income markets. the financial crisis subsequent great recession dramatically increase interest among academic research asset price frictions. question regulation, segment markets, liquidity principal/agent problem represent central issue fund manager, time topic forefront academic debate. we need understand issue affect investment possibilities, give fund’s strategy characteristics. i point link management fund two main area discuss conference – time-varying risk premium well function markets. the question forefront academic debate – potential answer – theoretical interest, immediate practical relevance us. the fund significant contributor norwegian government budget decades, maybe century come. the strategy fund need continuous development. we hope annual research conference provide valuable input process. i would like thank organizer make conference possible, least, speaker valuable contributions. also, thank participant – i hope see conference next year! bi central bankers’ speech 1 sayuri shirai: europe’s economic financial development monetary policy japan speech m sayuri shirai, member policy board bank japan, 77th meet society economic study securities, tokyo, 9 june 2012. * * * i. introduction good afternoon, member society economic study securities. my name sayuri shirai, i policy board member bank japan. it indeed great honor pleasure give talk esteem society. today, i would like focus europe, common theme today’s meeting, great emphasis euro area, development show considerable uncertainty recent months. first, let briefly outline content presentation, consist four parts. i would like begin describe recent change see euro area. next, i summarize view fundamental issue face euro area. follow that, i review region-wide response european sovereign debt crisis. in final part, i would like summarize recent economic price development japan, impact european sovereign debt crisis japanese economy, japan’s monetary policy relate developments.1 i much look forward lively discussion talk. ii. change political situation great emphasis growth – two recent transformation euro area a aware, global financial market nervous recent month follow period ease strain first quarter 2012. i believe two important change associate recent enhance sensitivity global financial markets: one change political situation; grow focus growth, interpretation appear somewhat different past. recent change political situation with regard political changes, i view first event euro area collapse coalition government netherlands april 23, 2012. this occur result disagreement budget cuts. that dispute emerge then-prime minister mark rutte stress need additional budget cut order meet 3-percent fiscal deficit target – common target set eu – 2013. however, minority coalition partner, freedom party, reject proposal demand target year postponed. a aware, netherlands one “core” country eu,2 know achieve favorable macroeconomic performance long period. prior global financial crisis 2008–09, fiscal balance netherlands record surplus, ratio sovereign debt gdp remain eu’s 60-percent threshold. since crisis, fiscal balance shift deficit, peak 5.5 percent gdp 2009; however, netherlands manage 1 the data use speech cover period june 6, 2012. 2 here, i refer germany, austria, netherlands, finland core countries. all country enjoy current account surplus high-grade credit rat sovereign bonds. 2 bi central bankers’ speech reduce 4.6 percent 2011. owe continue fiscal deficit, sovereign debt gdp ratio rise 65.2 percent, though well euro-area average 88 percent. moreover, netherlands is, like japan, net external creditor nation, thank accumulate current account surplus – phenomenon contrast “peripheral” country eu. the unemployment rate netherlands also low around 5 percent. therefore, i genuinely surprise news political turmoil. this event remind fiscal austerity measure painful even core countries, dutch public felt frustrate recession continue three consecutive quarter july september 2011 resultant rise unemployment rate. on april 26, nonetheless, dutch government manage produce agreement opposition party austerity measure worth around €12.4 billion 2013 meet 3-percent target; however, dutch general election schedule take place september. the next regime change take place france – second-largest economy euro area – event surprise world. the first round vote presidential election hold april 22, 2012, mr. françois hollande, candidate socialist party, take lead mr. nicolas sarkozy, incumbent president candidate union popular movement. during election campaign, mr. hollande promise renegotiate term eu fiscal compact, sign 25 27 eu member country march 2012.3 like mr. sarkozy, also commit meet 3-percent fiscal deficit target 2013 subsequently balance budget 2017. mr. hollande’s plan achieve by, example, impose tax financial transactions, introduce 75-percent income tax earn €1 million euros, raise corporate tax big company 35 percent, reduce tax small medium-sized enterprise (smes) scrap value-added tax (vat) increase propose mr. sarkozy. mr. hollande also promise expand public spend effort raise state spending, reduce retirement age 60 year work 41.5 years, hire 150,000 youth state-subsidized jobs, hire teacher police officers. in second round presidential vote hold may 6, mr. hollande first vote become country’s first socialist president 17 years. the market appear adopt wait-and-see attitude judge credibility fiscal consolidation plan well fate fiscal compact. the big political change occur greece general election hold may 6, 2012, panhellenic socialist movement (pasok) new democracy (nd) – join grand coalition november 2011 head mr. lucas papademos, former european central bank (ecb) vice-president – lose wide margins. since political party absolute majority seats, president karolos papoulias attempt offer successive exploratory mandate leader three main party accordance constitution. however, party end fail form government return mandate president. after president fail final attempt form government meet party leaders, decide mr. panagiotis pikrammenos, head council state, would become leader caretaker administration new election could take place june 17. the result greek election intensify nervousness market amid fear new government 3 the fiscal compact intergovernmental treaty sign eu member except czech republic unite kingdom march 2, 2012. the compact expect go force january 1, 2013 12 member euro area ratify time. accord compact, structural fiscal deficit must exceed 0.5 percent gdp, fiscal rule specify country’s national legal system least statutory level, although deviation may permit exceptional circumstance. the rule contain automatic correction mechanism event deviation, possible penalty equivalent 0.1 percent gdp. accord enhance stability growth pact, moreover, country whose sovereign debt exceed 60-percent threshold level reduce average rate 1/20 per year benchmark. bi central bankers’ speech 3 pasok and/or nd could reject fiscal consolidation economic reform program already agree troika – european commission, international monetary fund (imf), ecb. greece would thus fail receive schedule financial support, thereby lead collapse government administration possible exit euro area. increase attention growth against background political changes, i notice second type change occur recent months: number key policy player begin actively use key word “growth,” though different context use past. for example, ecb president mario draghi stress need growth compact addition already-agreed fiscal compact april 25, 2012. on may 3, subsequently elaborate idea growth compact propose following: (1) increase involvement european investment bank (eib) redirection eu structural fund toward low-income areas; (2) prioritize expenditure cut (especially cut current, rather investment, expenditure) tax increase.4 on may 5, european economics commissioner olli rehn make remark somewhat similar mr. draghi state eu need increase public investment promote growth job region. mr. rehn say create project bond infrastructure development (as propose european commission october 2011), increase lend capacity eib, improve accessibility eu structural fund guarantee lend smes. mr. rehn also stress that, base economic analysis, stability growth pact contain considerable scope judgment regard public deficit debt also legal provision apply excessive deficit procedure; encourage country fiscal surplus boost public spending. on may 8, european commission president barroso announce plan expand infrastructure investment eu by, example, issue project bond june 2012. regard feasibility renegotiation fiscal compact, mr. jean-claude juncker, head eurogroup, take balance position demand mr. hollande renegotiate compact resistance ms. angela merkel. on may 7, mr. juncker declare would possible renegotiate fiscal compact, although would possible add growth elements, necessarily form treaty. reflect new moves, eu president herman van rompuy call informal european council (eu summit) hold may 23 discus balance growth fiscal austerity measures. eu’s approach growth thus far the question emerge growth agenda suddenly become focus attention. doe mean previously eu barely pay attention issue? it clear eu tackle issue promote growth together fiscal consolidation past years. a may recall, example, european council june 2010 adopt growth strategy call “europe 2020,” whereby member country undertake structural reform toward strong, sustainable recovery. the strategy also target eu need good focus boost europe’s competitiveness, productivity, growth potential, economic convergence deliver growth jobs. 4 this approach fiscal consolidation gain support recent years. for example, world economic outlook compile imf (2010) stress fiscal contraction rely spend cut tend small contractionary effect tax-based adjustments. this partly central bank usually provide substantially great stimulus follow spending-based contraction tax-based contraction. monetary stimulus particularly weak follow indirect tax hike (such vat), raise prices. 4 bi central bankers’ speech accordingly, five headline target agree common objective guide action member countries.5 in line approach, eu introduce so-called “european semester” 2011, whereby member country submit medium-term budgetary strategy national reform program european commission assessment. the commission publish country-specific report detail policy recommendations, cover fiscal consolidation structural reforms. moreover, eu introduce “macroeconomic imbalance procedure (mip)” december 2011, which, name suggests, surveillance mechanism aim prevent correct macroeconomic imbalance within eu. this alert system us “scoreboard” 10 indicator well detail country studies. each indicator give threshold, large divergence country’s performance threshold function warn signal.6 a original “excessive deficit procedure,” apply size fiscal deficits, strict rule come effect event large divergence form new “excessive macroeconomic imbalance procedure (eip)”; carry possible financial penalty 0.1 percent gdp euro-area member countries. the decision-making process new regulation employ reverse qualify majority vote make appropriate relevant judgment penalty introduced. this semi-automatic procedure make difficult member country form block majority. in february 2012, european commission disclose first alert mechanism report. of 27 eu member countries, already enhance economic surveillance – greece, ireland, portugal, romania – exempt examination macroeconomic imbalances. the report indicate 12 country – belgium, bulgaria, denmark, spain, france, italy, cyprus, hungary, slovenia, finland, sweden, unite kingdom – bore potential risk relate macroeconomic imbalance thus warrant detail analysis.7 accord report, spain, example, take time correct external internal imbalance despite effort make rectify imbalance owe sheer size internal external debt. it also point fall employment link downsize construction sector economic recession aggravate sluggish adjustment wages. at end may 2012, commission confirm 12 country need correct large macroeconomic imbalance adjustment process closely monitored. 5 the five target follows: (1) increase employment rate woman men age 20–64 75 percent; (2) achieve combine public private r&d investment level 3 percent gdp; (3) reduce greenhouse gas emission 20 percent compare 1990 levels; (4) reduce school drop-out rate 10 percent increase proportion population age 30–34 complete tertiary equivalent education 40 percent; (5) promote social inclusion, particularly reduce poverty aim lift least 20 million people risk poverty exclusion. 6 the 10 indicator divide two areas: external imbalance competitiveness, internal imbalances. the external imbalance competitiveness comprise following: (1) three-year average current account balance percent gdp (with indicative threshold plus 6 percent minus 4 percent); (2) net international investment position percent gdp (minus 35-percent low quartile); (3) three-year percentage change real effective exchange rate (between plus minus 5 percent); (4) five-year percentage change export market share (minus 6-percent low quartile); (5) three-year percentage change export market shares. the internal imbalance comprise following: (6) year-on-year change deflate house price (plus 6-percent upper quartile); (7) private sector credit flow percent gdp (plus 15-percent upper quartile); (8) private-sector debt percent gdp (160-percent upper quartile); (9) general government debt percent gdp (60 percent); (10) three-year average unemployment rate (10 percent). 7 the report conclude follow country require detail review: czech republic, germany, estonia, latvia, lithuania, luxembourg, malta, netherlands, austria, poland, slovakia. bi central bankers’ speech 5 background refocus growth thus, could say great effort make recent year eu level boost growth competitiveness. why, then, question growth discuss intensively recent months? in general, boost growth require implementation various structural reform (chart 1). and peripheral country launch need structural reform thus far position complete them. the answer question may associate public anxiety reform may accompany social transformation short-term economic suffering, wage restraints, job losses, profit loss protect sectors. moreover, public may become frustrate fiscal austerity measure end squeeze domestic absorption promote deleveraging bank sector short term; take time realize long-term gains, improvement credibility cut long-term interest rates. furthermore, sluggish growth rest world generate sufficient external demand euro area could offset shrinkage domestic demand drive collective act fiscal consolidation. in addition, important recognize context growth shift improve competitiveness, could achieve medium long term, moderate short-term pain cause austerity measure implement economic recession. various interpretation relate growth despite reasoning, impression word “growth” interpret differently way past people employ term. it appear least three type interpretation.8 accord first interpretation, eu expand region-wide infrastructure investment issue project bond actively utilize eib eu structural fund mitigate adverse impact fiscal austerity measure adopt number member countries. the second interpretation hold current fiscal consolidation schedule could slow – example, extend target year fulfil 3-percent fiscal deficit goal situation allow it.9 with interpretation, good mix revenue-generating expenditure-reducing measure also stressed. accord third interpretation, structural reform prioritize effect immediate positive impact growth employment. this latter option may help reduce sense exhaustion austerity program country experienced. however, i believe interpretation rule structural reform need boost growth country. some action recently associate first interpretation. on may 23, informal european council agree board eib would invite consider increase capital june finance project across eu. the previous day, political agreement also reach council eu, european commission, parliament regard pilot phase project bonds. base guarantee €230 million eu budget, project bond could possibly finance €4.6 billion key infrastructure project area transport, energy, 8 other proposal include eurobonds, would issue jointly euro area member country pool debt. this idea reject ms. merkel 2011, bring mr. hollande european council may 23, 2012. while eurobonds could long-term strategy integration, ms. merkel stress would reduce incentive country contain fiscal deficits. recently, european commission address idea bank union, integrate financial supervision single deposit guarantee scheme. the idea uniform deposit guarantee scheme propose reject member country year ago. it would appear require quite time proposal agree upon. 9 on may 2012, european commission suggested, example, spain, france, netherlands (the impact additional deficit cut agree end april take account), slovenia, slovakia might meet 3-percent fiscal deficit target unless additional measure undertaken. 6 bi central bankers’ speech communications.10 the second interpretation, moderation fiscal consolidation schedule, might feasible country could present credible medium-term plan. but may possible peripheral country owe lack market confidence. on issue, european commission make initial move spain suggest possible extension one year schedule meet 3-percent fiscal deficit target 2014 – condition improve expenditure control local government submission credible two-year budget plan 2013–14. iii. three fundamental issue relate euro area so far, i discuss recent change political situation increase focus growth euro area. my observation change reflect deep fundamental issue pertain region: (1) issue arise accumulate current account imbalances; (2) issue relate savings-investment gap constitute current account imbalances; (3) issue arise accumulate fiscal imbalances. these issue course interconnected, distinction may assist understand fundamental problem region faces. accumulate current account imbalance regard first fundamental issue, current account imbalance expand euro area since adoption euro (chart 2). thank elimination exchange-rate risk decline inflation differentials, peripheral country – greece, ireland, portugal, spain – gain access considerable financial resource region substantially low interest rate before. in real terms, interest rate low core countries. cheap external finance enable peripheral country swell net external debt (chart 3).11 major financier peripheral country largely concentrate core country (with current account surpluses) france. since capital inflow peripheral country mostly take form bank loan bond issues, grow net external debt make country prone change investor sentiment. in retrospect, country allocate external financial resource toward productive investment investment lead shift higher-value-added economic structure, could improve economic productivity enhance international competitiveness. subsequently, would enable country repay external debt gradually shift current account surpluses. instead, capital inflow largely finance domestic consumption real estate construction sector (although comment necessarily fully apply case ireland, number high-technology multinational firm operating). thus, foreign borrow promote sustainable economic growth contain external debt growth (chart 2). to reduce net external debt, necessary achieve current account surplus. at stage, ireland, whose current account deficit initially small, succeed achieve current account surplus. it fair say country make effort reduce current account deficit – scale around 5 percentage point gdp case greece spain 4 percentage point portugal period 2007–11. nonetheless, time three country could achieve current account surpluses, net external debt 10 the eib manage project. if eib could guarantee project bonds, bond could issue market. private sector participation would also expected. 11 italy include analysis, current account gdp ratio small net external debt gdp remain indicative threshold 35 percent specify macroeconomic imbalance procedure. it primary fiscal balance surplus, although government debt gdp ratio large. bi central bankers’ speech 7 unlikely decline soon. in words, external imbalance stock (debt) basis remain time being. meanwhile, among core countries, finland reduce current account surplus gdp ratio 5 percentage point period, though germany, austria, netherlands barely reduce current account surpluses. in particular, current account surplus gdp ratio remain high austria (around 2 percent), germany (around 5 percent), netherlands (over 7.5 percent). this enable core country accumulate net external assets. in words, surplus country continue accumulate net external assets, deficit country net external debt – despite emerge improvement current account imbalance euro area (chart 3). i believe partly explain debtor peripheral country currently find difficult resume adequate private-sector-based capital inflow despite adjustment efforts. grow savings-investment gap with respect second issue list – savings-investment gap – savings–gdp ratio (hereafter, save rate) show decline trend four peripheral country global financial crisis. the scale decrease great greece follow portugal (chart 4). it could say greece portugal allocate large part capital inflow private public consumption (such public pay, pensions, medical care). owe tendency germany increase save rate, current account imbalance greece portugal, one hand, germany, other, could explain primarily difference saving-rate patterns. however, save rate ireland spain different germany: ireland spain increase investment-gdp ratio (hereafter, investment rates), germany remain low level. thus, current account imbalance ireland spain, one hand, germany other, could attribute largely difference investment pattern (chart 5). an increase two countries’ investment rate reflect boom real estate construction investment. it well-known fact two country undergo rapid real estate price appreciation prior global financial crisis. since global financial crisis erupted, four peripheral country face decline save rates. this imply improvement current account balances, indicate earlier, arise solely sharp decrease investment rates. this particularly case ireland, drop real estate price drastic spain experience sharp decline investment rate. however, decline investment rate three country also great. give four peripheral country suffer substantial fall investment, understandable idea expand eu-wide infrastructure-investment project offset adverse impact austerity measure widely stress recently, note earlier. grow fiscal imbalance on third fundamental issue list – relate accumulate fiscal imbalance – greece country size fiscal deficit large whose general government debt share gdp exceed 100 percent even global financial crisis (charts 6, 7). in ireland spain, ratio general government debt gdp remain 60-percent target thank accumulate fiscal surpluses. portugal poise bring fiscal deficit–gdp ratio toward 3-percent target prior global financial crisis, general government debt–gdp ratio remain around 70 percent. since global financial crisis, fiscal balance euro-area country deteriorate implementation fiscal-stimulus policy measure bail 8 bi central bankers’ speech bank sector. the size deterioration fiscal balance 2007 2011 reach minus 2.6 percentage point greece, minus 13.2 percentage point ireland, minus 1.1 percentage point portugal, minus 10.4 percentage point spain. by contrast, deterioration germany’s fiscal deficit–gdp ratio mere 1.2 percentage point period, contribute widen gap fiscal balance euro area. moreover, germany’s fiscal deficit–gdp ratio already 3-percent target and, accord european commission, ratio project drop around 1 percent 2012 reach balance 2013. germany achieve 3 percent economic growth 2010–11, unemployment rate drop historical low 5.6 percent. these favorable outcome help germany conduct fiscal consolidation without introduce drastic measure cut fiscal deficit. meanwhile, peripheral country oblige contain fiscal deficit prevent overall government debt swelling. since germany face decline ratio general government debt gdp near future, mean internal imbalance stock (debt) basis likely expand region. iv. assistance eu euro-area level give background, peripheral countries, rather core countries, expect make great economic adjustments, fiscal consolidation structural reforms. some reform take time cause hardship bear fruit. to mitigate adverse impact adjustments, financial assistance eu euro-area level necessary. this especially true peripheral country lack private-sector capital flows. without regional international financial support, country would force squeeze domestic absorption drastically public would go intolerable suffer – notwithstanding correction could make rapidly internal external imbalances. first recipient international financial assistance – greece a well known, greece first country euro area receive international financial assistance. the total amount set €110 billion first round assistance, agree share euro-area member country (€80 billion) imf (€30 billion). since general government debt greece grow rapidly, idea private-sector involvement (psi) gain favor euro area. after negotiations, large number private sector creditor finally agree voluntarily accept restructure greek debt. this psi take place completion first round financial assistance schedule greece regard precondition second round financial assistance.12 the total amount second round assistance set €172.7 billion, include undisbursed amount first program. the cost agree bear euro area (€144.7 billion) mainly platform european financial stability facility (efsf) imf (€28 billion). the contribution euro area include amount relate psi incentive bank recapitalization. newly establish financial support system euro area it recall greek sovereign debt crisis contagious effect peripheral country ireland portugal. a result contagion, country find difficult raise fund market thus ask eu, euro area, 12 the psi end cover €205.6 billion, include greek foreign law sovereign bonds, rate participation reach 97 percent end april 2012 result apply collective action procedure greek law bonds. with psi additional international financial assistance, greece’s general government debt ratio expect decline 120 percent gdp 2020. bi central bankers’ speech 9 imf financial support – november 2010 case ireland may 2011 case portugal.13 the efsf establish euro area follow decision make may 2010, begin operation august 2010. it back guarantee commitment €780 billion member country lend capacity €440 billion. in november 2011, furthermore, agree increase efsf’s power (1) provide partial protection certificate sovereign bond issue member countries, (2) create coinvestment fund purchase sovereign bond primary secondary markets. to prevent contagion sovereign debt crisis large member countries, euro area decide create permanent crisis mechanism call european stability mechanism (esm). the esm, become operational july 2012, take feature efsf maximum lend capacity €500 billion, base paid-up capital €80 billion. both efsf esm coexist efsf expire mid-2012. the new treaty create esm sign february 2012. the decision grant stability support generally take mutual agreement, case urgency could decide qualify majority 85 percent vote cast. in addition, imf make effort raise fund globally effort establish sufficient power able deal potentially contagious crisis arise europe. at g20 summit april 2012, imf announce raise $430 billion, include contribution euro area ($200 billion) japan ($60 billion). although imf fund available europe, certainly reduce uncertainty relate issue handle large countries, italy spain, case contagion. ecb monetary policy crisis response in response recent sovereign debt crisis, ecb adopt series measure since middle 2011. after raise policy rate interest rate main refinance operation 1 percent 1.5 percent raise 25 basis point april july 2011, ecb reduce rate back 1 percent cut 25 basis point november december. other recent measure include u dollar liquidity-providing operations, cut reserve ratio, modification collateral requirements, fixed-rate longer-term refinance operation (ltros) full allotment, security market program, covered-bond purchase program. among measures, two notably appear contribute substantially stabilization global financial markets: (1) u dollar liquidity-providing operations, (2) ltros maturity 36 months. the ecb conduct u dollar liquidity-providing operation part coordinate action five central bank address pressure global money markets: namely, bank canada, bank england, bank japan, federal reserve, swiss national bank (chart 8). the new action emerge november 2011 response grow strain u dollar financial markets. these central bank agree low price exist temporary u dollar liquidity swap arrangement 50 basis point new rate would u dollar overnight index swap rate plus 50 basis points. at time, agree swap arrangement would extend february 1, 2013. a contingency measure, central bank agree establish temporary bilateral liquidity swap arrangement liquidity could provide jurisdiction 13 the amount financial assistance ireland amount €67.5 billion, receive efsf (€17.7 billion), european financial stabilization mechanism (efsm; €22.5 billion), imf (€22.5 billion), include bilateral assistance unite kingdom, denmark, sweden (€4.8 billion). the assistance portugal amount €78 billion, efsf (€26 billion), esm (€26 billion), imf (€26 billion). the efsm finance facility eu member country lend capacity €60 billion base borrow market european commission. 10 bi central bankers’ speech currency necessitate market conditions. in particular, cut interest rate u dollar liquidity-providing operation succeed substantially low cost swap euro u dollar (chart 9). furthermore, decline u dollar fund cost encourage many european bank difficulty raise fund market borrow directly ecb, thereby prevent force fire sale asset cut loan denominate u dollar. the second measure contribute stabilization financial market ltros maturity 36 months, conduct december 21, 2011 february 28, 2012. on december 8, 2011, ecb decide reduce reserve ratio modify collateral requirement together announcement three-year ltros. the reserve ratio reduce 2 1 percent reserve maintenance period, start january 18, 2012. to increase collateral availability, ecb decide reduce credit-rating threshold certain asset-backed security and, temporary solution, allow national central bank accept collateral additional perform credit claim (i.e., bank loans) satisfy specific eligibility criteria. in allow application three-year ltros, modification collateral requirement regard contribute ease fund situation european bank cause shortage eligible collateral. a result, ltros succeed low euro-denominated fund cost money markets, also bring spread yield portuguese, spanish, italian sovereign bond vis-à-vis german bonds. in addition, ltros help promote issuance senior unsecured bank bond (charts 10–13). thus, widely regard ltros prevent bank fund crisis thus deleveraging massive scale. recent development financial market since uncertainty european political economic development intensify recent months, interest rate rise accordingly. nonetheless, scale increase u dollar fund cost bear european banks, example, far modest compare situation prior new arrangement relate u dollar liquidity-providing operation end november 2011 (chart 9). likewise, euro-denominated fund cost money market remain calm (charts 10, 11). meanwhile, spread yield portuguese, spanish, italian sovereign bond vis-à-vis german bond risen, greek spread; partly owe decline record low level yield german sovereign bond (chart 13). the spanish bank sector face surge credit spread financial bonds, reflect recent grow concern soundness bank sector (chart 14). stock price generally show decline trend reflection european sovereign debt problem concern global economic slowdown (chart 15). give sensitivity market developments, i continue watch closely impact european political economic development global financial markets. v. impact european sovereign debt problem japanese economy monetary policy bank japan (the bank) i would like move final part presentation, i begin summarize recent economic price developments. outlook economic activity price risk factor recently, become increasingly evident japanese economy shift toward pick-up phase, although economic activity remain le flat (chart 16). with regard outlook, japanese economy expect return moderate recovery path first half fiscal 2012. this likely since pace recovery overseas economy bi central bankers’ speech 11 gradually improve – lead largely emerge economy reconstruction-related domestic demand post-great east japan earthquake period. in fiscal 2013, japan’s economy expect maintain growth pace potential overseas economy continue achieve relatively high growth. however, economic growth rate expect somewhat low fiscal 2012 positive effect reconstruction-related domestic demand likely gradually diminish (chart 17). with regard prices, development consumer price index (cpi; item le fresh food) indicate reach historical trough 2.4 percent august 2009, year-on-year rate decline continue slow consistently since around end 2009. in recent months, rate change around 0 percent. in term outlook prices, rate change remain positive territory show gradual increase aggregate supply demand balance expect continue improve moderate recovery. international commodity price currently bearish, partly reflect concern european sovereign debt problems; though price may follow moderately rise trend owe expect increase demand food energy line growth emerge economies. assume medium- long-term inflation expectation remain stable, rate change cpi project gradually rise range 0.5 percent le 1 percent toward second half fiscal 2013. thereafter, likely long rate reach “price-stability goal medium long term” 1 percent time being, specify statement release bank japan (hereafter, bank) february 2012. the aforementioned outlook scenario bank consider probable: is, words, baseline scenario. a describe detail outlook economic activity prices, outlook report short, follow four major risk concern outlook economic activity warrant attention: (1) uncertainty relate development overseas economies; (2) uncertainty regard reconstruction-related domestic demand; (3) uncertainty associate firms’ households’ medium- long-term growth expectations; (4) issue relate japan’s fiscal sustainability. among risks, i personally particularly mindful relate adverse spillover european sovereign debt issue political development baseline scenario. there mainly two type price-associated risks. the first type concern development firms’ households’ medium- long-term inflation expectations; second type relate development import prices. with second type, possibility exist crude oil price surge, mainly reflection geopolitical risk. if occur, japan’s term trade experience deterioration, squeeze firms’ profit reduce households’ purchase power, ultimately adverse effect whole japanese economy. impact european sovereign debt problem japanese economy concern european sovereign debt problems, impact ascertain mainly mean three channel – international trade, finance, exchange rates. with international trade, would seem direct impact japan’s export limited, give export euro area account around 10 percent (chart 18). rather, significant impact could felt indirectly slowdown trade foreign direct investment activity emerge countries, china, euro area represent one large trade partner (charts 19, 20). with regard finance, u dollar fund market money market remain calm. the u dollar fund cost remain low japanese bank since exposure euro area limit balance sheet relatively sound. it true, though, japanese bank face moderate increase u dollar fund cost middle deepen european sovereign debt crisis middle 2011. after introduction 12 bi central bankers’ speech new coordinate arrangement six central bank end november, however, u dollar fund market remain calm, especially japanese bank (chart 21). money market also relax (chart 22). long-term yield japanese government bond (jgbs) show deceleration thank increase demand safe asset (chart 23). like european stocks, nonetheless, japanese stock decline (chart 24). the direct impact european sovereign debt crisis felt mainly exchange rates. because current status safe currency, yen tend appreciate intensify strain global financial market (chart 25). this suggest change risk-taking behavior global investor become closely associate movement exchange rates. recent movement show enhance nervousness global financial market cause resurgence european debt crisis increase risk aversion among global investor promote yen’s appreciation relative mid-march year. the yen appreciate euro, partly reverse interest rate differential german japanese bond yield remain maturity le two years. if sustained, yen’s appreciation may detrimental japanese firms, adversely affect investment production behavior make hard japanese economy recover. this perspective also make feel development europe demand careful attention. conduct monetary policy the bank naturally concern long-term prevalence deflation japanese economy. on february 14 year, bank introduce “the price-stability goal medium long term” – define inflation rate consistent price stability sustainable medium long term. the purpose action promote public understand bank’s determination overcome deflation. it decide goal would within positive range 2 percent low term year-on-year rate change cpi, goal set 1 percent time being. moreover, bank make clear would continue pursue powerful monetary ease – virtually zero-interest rate policy continue implementation asset purchase program (hereafter, program) – judge 1-percent goal within sight; condition identify significant risk sustainability economic growth, include accumulation financial imbalances. at time, total size program raise 10 trillion yen – 55 trillion 65 trillion yen (chart 26). on april 27, bank decide increase total size program 5 trillion yen – 65 trillion 70 trillion yen – follow change composition, include increase purchase jgbs 10 trillion yen.14 regard decision enhance monetary ease april, i would like stress high degree uncertainty remain term bank’s assessment, already explained. the positive sign economic price development emerge recent month necessarily imply baseline scenario realize projected. even though 14 moreover, purchase exchange-traded fund japan real estate investment trust increase 200 billion yen 10 billion yen, respectively. the maximum outstanding amount bank’s fixed-rate funds-supplying operation pool collateral six-month term reduce 5 trillion yen, take account recent episode under-subscription. in addition, remain maturity jgbs purchase program extend one two year one three years. the treatment apply remain maturity corporate bond purchase program. in addition, decide schedule increase outstanding amount program 65 trillion yen around end 2012 would maintained. it decide increase outstanding amount program 70 trillion yen around end june 2013. bi central bankers’ speech 13 scenario may eventually materialize, still certain soon may so. consider recent episodes, example, case baseline scenario fulfilled, even though economy appear track sustainable economic growth price also initially appear rise steadily. therefore, bank decide seize occasion enhance monetary ease good ensure return japanese economy sustainable growth price stability. a explain above, i believe action also demonstrate bank’s determination implement monetary policy commitment. tackle long-term structural challenge finally, i would like address issue commonly face number major central bank advance country regions: extremely accommodative monetary environment necessarily lead increase domestic demand, investment consumption, much expect (chart 27). though structural factor relate issue, root cause country- region-specific thus different other. in case europe, short-term depress impact fiscal austerity measure deleveraging bank sector, explain earlier, make difficult increase bank lend moment. it likely time region start enjoy sustainable, favorable growth lend activities. in case japan, working-age population decline since mid-1990s, contribute decrease trend growth rates. to overcome deflation, thus important stress need address japan’s long-term structural challenge diminish growth rate amid rapidly age population. it clear need enhance productivity growth (of working-age population) overcome depress impact cause rapid pace decrease population working-age population growth rates. however, may say implementation necessary structural reform boost growth productivity sluggish, shift economic structure limited. issue relate mount government debt social security reform generate uncertainty future economic outlook. moreover, series shock – global financial crisis, great east japan earthquake, european sovereign debt crisis, 2011 thai flood – also contribute outlook. these factor combine deter expectation rise growth firm household despite accommodative financial environment drive monetary stimulus measures. to meet diverse challenge arise background establish new basis economic growth, japanese firm need become innovative competitive effort add value activity explore new source demand, home abroad. the government also need support business community create business-friendly environment. financial institution strive toward strengthen foundation economic growth give financial support innovative, viable firm provide new type financial services, increasingly demand. meanwhile, bank’s accommodative monetary policy certainly shore private-sector activity steady decline cost raise capital. by promote longer-term economic growth, bank help sustain business community indirectly: introduce fund-provisioning measure help reinforce basis economic growth (growth-supporting fund facility) 2010, provide longer-term fixed-rate fund financial institutions. this facility expand march april year (chart 28). it emphasize goal overcome deflation achieve continuous, comprehensive effort firms, financial institutions, government, bank operate within respective roles. in conclusion, i would like express gratitude society economic study security give wonderful opportunity make presentation front distinguish members. thank much kind attention. and i wish every success work development society. 14 bi central bankers’

pleasure speak morgan stanley global investment seminar. in remark today, i would like share concern present state euro area money markets, characterise segmentation cash-rich cash-poor bank fragmentation along national lines. i would also like offer think proper money market function restored. a know, money market around world come severe stress recent financial crisis subsequent sovereign debt crisis, interest rate spread jump unprecedented level market activity decline significantly many market segments. in remark today, i’ll first consider function money market crisis malfunction crisis, highlight specific euro area’s situation compare us. tension money market lead bank seek replace money market fund central bank funding. central bank have, since begin financial crisis, increasingly become intermediary interbank transactions, witness steep increase size balance sheets. these development give rise follow questions. first, central bank provide fund bank crisis times, money market malfunctioning, don’t also normal times? in words, useful function decentralise money market perform? i argue market essential ensure price discovery, information aggregation peer monitoring. give important benefits, second question arise is, proper function money market restored? i’ll discus policy help revitalise money market euro area late on. such policy must direct towards reduce counterparty risk concerns. this achieve restore adequate capital ratio reduce heterogeneity capitalisation banks, well take decisive step towards bank union. in end, lend act trust alternative restore full confidence soundness bank government finance. secure unsecured money markets: u euro area experience money market vital fund market financial institutions. i would like highlight key development across various money market segment onset financial crisis critical point autumn 2008, trend observe since then. while main focus euro area, i allude u development well, crisis origin u

impact financial stability finance condition economy large; role initial link chain monetary policy transmission. deep liquid money markets, unlike market economy, play important part information aggregation price discovery. indeed, money market rates, euribor libor, provide benchmark rate price fixed-income security loan contract throughout economy. moreover, interbank money market play significant role provide incentive bank conduct business safe sound manner, thus ensure market discipline. specifically, unsecured money markets, loan uncollateralised, interbank lender directly expose loss interbank loan repaid. this give lender incentive collect information borrower monitor lifetime interbank loan, make loan repayment probable. therefore, unsecured money market play key peer monitor role.13 the information bank acquire may readily available regulatory authority central banks.14 in secure money markets, lender mitigate credit risk exposure require borrower post collateral, impose haircut collateral values. while attenuate credit risk concern may make easy borrow bank obtain credit, secure fund come cost acquire hold collateral, well relatively weak incentive lend bank conduct monitoring. development money market profound implication financial stability function entire economy, affect finance condition face non-financial corporation households. be essential source bank funding, money market significant impact size balance sheet financial institution amount credit extend. a such, money market contribute pro-cyclicality so-called leverage cycles: time generalise optimism, high asset valuation, low haircut abundant liquidity money market lead high leverage credit expansion, whereas bad shock hit economy asset price drop, haircut increase liquidity dry up.15 13 rochet tirole (1996) emphasise role interbank peer monitor reduce borrowers’ moral hazard excessive risk-taking ex post; see j.-c. rochet j. tirole, “interbank lend systemic risk,” journal money, credit banking, vol. 28, no. 4, 1996. hoerova monnet (2011) view market discipline unsecured money market provision ex ante incentive mitigate risk borrowers’ investments; see m. hoerova c. monnet, “money market discipline central bank lending,” present workshop “post-crisis design operational framework”, european central bank, october 2011. 14 money market among first respond arrival bad news u sub-prime mortgage market, rise interest rate and/or unwillingness roll mature debt. when perceive risk distribution risk financial system suddenly increase, incentive money market lender monitor borrower intensify, result adjustment price quantity credit granted. conversely, risk perceive low relatively homogeneous, borrower get refinance easily. smooth money market function run-up crisis aid generalise optimism low risk aversion markets, drive inter alia benign macroeconomic environment, ample liquidity financial system due “savings glut” accommodative monetary policy, well agency problem financial sector. 15 see j. geanakoplos, “solving present crisis manage leverage cycle”, federal reserve bank new york economic policy review, august 2010. 6 bi central bankers’ speech if liquidity dry up, force bank de-leverage, thus affect supply bank credit, acquire liquidity liquidate sell assets. asset liquidation impose externality player financial system through, example, fire sale financial contagion.16 from monetary policy perspective, money market play central role monetary policy transmission euro area. this euro area financial system largely bank-based interbank money market interest rate represent marginal cost fund bank loans. when money market function normally, ecb influence longer-maturity rates, relevant determine bank lend rates, steer short-term money market rate keep close official rates. a smooth function money market therefore guarantee impulse monetary policy transmit across financial system real economy without impairments. revitalise money market euro area give significance well-functioning money markets, revival essential euro area. revamp money market call reversal aforementioned adverse trend low fragment money market activity, result increase reliance liquidity provision ecb. a trend drive counterparty risk concern bank system, restore proper money market function integration among different jurisdiction require restore confidence banks’ health. it also require bank market supervisor resist temptation ring-fence liquidity capital within national boundaries. this classic problem collective action: uncoordinated national reaction heighten uncertainty could collectively lethal single market capital. two set action seem key tackle concern root: one set strengthen bank balance sheet another set action break self-reinforcing loop bank sovereign debt risk move truly unify european supervision. to strengthen bank balance sheets, first, adequate capital ratio must reach bank system. the eba capital exercise, eu bank expect reach core tier 1 capital ratio 9% end month, important milestone. regulator make sure subsequent transition basel iii framework result weaken capital buffers. the heterogeneity capital ratio must also reduced. the median core tier 1 capital ratio large euro area bank significantly low global counterparts. however, variation ratio across institution substantially wide euro area, introduce asymmetry banks’ access fund fund costs. second, leverage euro area bank system must reduced. the aggregate leverage (asset-to-equity) ratio large euro area bank remain comparatively high international historical standards.17 the adverse feedback loop bank sovereigns, doubt solvency sovereign fee doubt solvency banks, vice versa, break readily establishment true bank union. 16 see, example, v. acharya s. viswanathan, “leverage, moral hazard liquidity”, journal finance, vol. 66, no 1, 2011; f. allen d. gale, “financial contagion”, journal political economy, vol. 108, no. 1, 2000; m. brunnermeier l. h. pedersen, “market liquidity fund liquidity”, review financial studies, vol. 22, no 6, 2009. 17 for information deleveraging process euro area bank system, see special feature a, financial stability review, ecb, june 2012. bi central bankers’ speech 7 this include creation pan-euro area deposit insurance fund pan-euro area bank resolution framework, support single supervisory system centralise decision-making. if european stability mechanism could inject capital directly banks, strong conditionality control, would also help break bank-sovereign loop. these new institution would mitigate counterparty risk promote truly integrate approach bank supervision. in addition, would foster integration bank system money market level, also retail level: emergence truly pan-european bank institutions, provide properly controlled, would attenuate asymmetric shock within member state favour risk-sharing. depend devised, feature bank union, single euro area deposit insurance single resolution fund wind fail banks, may result additional share fiscal risk among euro area countries. these mechanism come appropriate parliamentary controls. there share fiscal risk without democratic decision-making accountability. money market function also affect incoming regulation. i mind particular new set liquidity standard propose basel committee,18 move over-the-counter derivative trade towards central counterparties (ccps) reform shadow bank sector. the aim current regulatory reform establish incentive-compatible regulatory framework well encourage bank adopt business model allow limit risk fulfil regulatory requirement without rely excessively central bank liquidity providers. in respect liquidity, basel committee propose december 2010 two new standards: liquidity coverage ratio (lcr), aim ensure bank hold sufficient high-quality liquid asset withstand acute stress scenario last one month; net stable fund ratio (nsfr), aim address banks’ longer-term structural liquidity mismatch require minimum amount stable fund (based liquidity characteristic banks’ assets) one-year period. it important regulation hamper function fund markets. this apply particular calibration run-off rate interbank fund asymmetrical treatment liquidity facility extend financial firms. the regulators’ welcome push move over-the-counter derivative towards ccps, aim limit counterparty risk promote great net efficiency transparency, may also effect unsecured secure money market segments. this move lead increase need high-quality collateral.19 however, supply safe asset finite pool “good” collateral dwindle creditworthiness certain sovereign question market participants. the good collateral pledge ccps, le leave use secure money market, few asset available creditor event default, make difficult obtain unsecured refinancing. this strengthen need find way identify produce new asset use collateral mitigate pro-cyclical consequence credit rat market valuation. lastly, money market function may affect ongoing discussion regulation shadow bank sector, part provide fund 18 basel committee bank supervision, “basel iii: a global regulatory framework resilient bank bank systems”, december 2010 (revised version june 2011). 19 the high demand drive number factor include current under-collateralisation over-the-counter transactions, reduce re-hypothetication collateral ccps accept relatively high quality collateral. estimate demand extra collateral vary. a recent report morgan stanley oliver wyman estimate demand usd 500–800 billion. singh (2009) estimate cost around usd 200 billion (see m. singh, “collateral, net systemic risk otc derivative market”, imf work paper wp/10/99, 2009). 8 bi central bankers’ speech traditional, regulate bank system. for example, evidence u money market fund (mmfs) provide sizeable u dollar fund european banks.20 in context, change u regulation mmfs, set short maturity limit security hold mmfs liquidity requirements, may last effect u dollar fund condition european banks. conclusion let conclude. the importance money market monetary financial stability lend condition economy call careful monitor recent money market trend ass trend temporary structural, induce inter alia current regulatory overhaul. restore proper market function require series action rebuild confidence creditworthiness bank governments, well take decisive step towards bank union. thank attention. 20 see bakk-simon et al.

national bank’s 2012 financial stability report speech mr jean-pierre danthine, vice chairman govern board swiss national bank, medium news conference swiss national bank, berne, 14 june 2012. * * * introductory remark jean-pierre danthine i, too, would like welcome news conference, also occasion present 2012 edition swiss national bank’s financial stability report. the report contain snb’s assessment risk stability swiss bank system, need action. this promote risk awareness among swiss bank sector agents, thereby contribute financial stability. introduction economic financial condition swiss bank sector deteriorate since last financial stability report. the sovereign debt crisis escalated, threaten spill peripheral euro area country core country euro area. in addition, global economic growth lose momentum tension grow international bank system. there was, likewise, ease tension swiss mortgage real estate markets. the momentum observe real estate price mortgage continued. a colleague, thomas jordan, already mentioned, baseline scenario snb expect gradual improvement economic financial condition next 12 months. although consider likely scenario, risk renew deterioration environment remain high. in short term, adverse scenario could substantial price correction financial markets, economic growth could slow markedly. such scenario would affect two big bank particular. for domestically focus commercial banks, main risk stem potential fall swiss real estate price medium term. this risk increase market price diverge justify fundamentals. give high risk economic financial environment, snb consider need action big bank domestically focus commercial bank alike. the snb’s recommendation aim strengthen resilience swiss bank system, ensure position continue perform essential function swiss economy, even adverse scenario i describe materialise. situation big bank i would like present key point assessment big banks. since june 2011, big bank make progress improve resilience; first, increase highest-quality capital – i mean loss-absorbing capital – and, second, reduce risk-weighted assets. cd spreads, example, suggest market consider solvency big bank average compare international banks. this partly explain fact moderately expose vulnerable peripheral euro area countries. despite fact progress achieved, snb consider big banks’ loss-absorbing capital still level need ensure sufficient resilience. this assessment base three factors: first, event escalation euro 2 bi central bankers’ speech area crisis, loss potential big bank would substantial compare loss-absorbing capital. a i point out, big bank moderate direct exposure vulnerable peripheral euro area countries, yet crisis country deepen, general deterioration economic financial condition could expected. in case, potential loss bank would extend significant portion credit trade positions. second, snb’s assessment base comparison capitalisation level international big banks. this comparison us definition basel iii framework fully implemented. these definition yield accurate picture bank’s true resilience. the comparison base definition reveal swiss big bank – particular credit suisse – international average. give importance big bank swiss economy financial stability, above-average capitalisation level would appropriate. third, leverage big bank remain high, despite reduction risk-weighted assets. at end-march 2012, share loss-absorbing capital net balance sheet total 2.7% ubs 1.7% credit suisse. this capital would, example, insufficient absorb loss experience ubs recent financial crisis (over 3% net balance sheet total). in addition, question remain extent reduction risk-weighted asset match effective reduction economic risks, balance sheet total remain unchanged. for reasons, snb consider essential big bank strengthen resilience. it recommend ubs continue capital strengthen process – including, particular, pursue policy dividend restraint. credit suisse, meanwhile, accelerate process take action necessary expand loss-absorbing capital base significantly current year. the snb also recommend big bank increase transparency regard resilience. concretely, publish information capitalisation define basel iii fully implement – as, indeed, ubs do two recent presentation quarterly results. they also regularly calculate disclose risk-weighted asset accord basel standardise approach. the result calculation would provide basis comparison risk-weighted asset figure calculate use internal risk models. this comparison would enable ongoing reduction risk present transparently. implement two measure necessary financial stability perspective. however, also big banks’ interest hold sufficient loss-absorbing capital, high level resilience strengthen competitiveness core business wealth management, boost market confidence. situation domestically focus commercial bank i would like turn assessment domestically focus commercial banks. there clear grow sign build-up imbalance swiss mortgage real estate markets. over past 12 months, mortgage lend volume real estate price grow strongly. thus, mortgage-to-gdp ratio, already high historical comparison, continue increase. at time, residential real estate price reach level that, cases, exceed justify fundamental factors, demographic per caput income. take national average, case price owner-occupied apartments. in region lake geneva, lake zurich lake zug, case, average, segment residential property market. bi central bankers’ speech 3 under baseline scenario, momentum mortgage real estate market continues. it therefore expect imbalance continue build up, that, consequently, risk abrupt correction imbalance increase medium term. for domestically focus commercial banks, average capitalisation relative regulatory requirement historically high level. moreover, banks’ capital high quality, thus loss-absorbing. however, current environment, resilience banks, measure regulatory capital indicators, overestimated.  first, certain risk capture regulatory requirements. this applies, particular, interest rate risk bank book, cover traditional deposit lend activities. in current situation, historically high interest rate risk exposures, significant shortcoming.  second, current capital requirement procyclical effect. thus rise real estate prices, cause loan-to-value ratio fall, lead low capital requirements. give grow imbalance real estate market, banks’ resilience, measure regulatory capital indicators, overestimated.  third, low level diversification domestically focus commercial bank take account capital requirements. the main focus banks’ business activities, risk exposures, relate mortgage lending. this concentration activity compound geographical concentration cantonal regional level. in light factors, snb consider action need two fronts: first, capacity bank bear risk incur must reviewed, strengthen necessary. this apply particularly bank cumulative risks, high interest rate risk high exposure mortgage real estate markets. finma’s microprudential measure play key role regard. second, snb repeatedly emphasised, give cyclical risk swiss mortgage real estate markets, temporary adjustment bank system-wide capital requirement may considered. to end, 1 june swiss federal council announce macroprudential instrument make available swiss authority 1 july, form countercyclical capital buffer. introduction macroprudential instrument to conclude, i would like briefly describe countercyclical capital buff work. this instrument enable authority adjust capital requirement bank system, depend potential excess swiss credit market. it preventive instrument activate necessary, level deem appropriate. it also target specific segment credit market. once imbalance corrected, countercyclical capital buff deactivated, either immediately gradually. in activate countercyclical capital buffer, aim authority twofold: first, increase resilience bank sector, thereby help protect consequence correction excessive credit growth. second, help lean build-up excesses. the federal council decide activation, deactivation level countercyclical capital buffer, upon proposal snb. the snb consult finma submit 4 bi central bankers’ speech proposal. the proposal base in-depth analysis assessment situation swiss credit market, will, principle, carry quarter.1 the sign build-up imbalance swiss credit market relate residential mortgage segment. thus, buff activated, would aim solely segment credit market. when assess necessity activate buffer, snb take account impact recently announce measure focus mortgage real estate markets. these measure include revision self-regulation rule tighten risk weight mortgage loans. in addition, part monetary policy mandate, snb closely monitor impact possible activation countercyclical capital buffer, order ass consequence economy whole. the current situation justify fact instrument, schedule implementation basel iii, make available swiss authority early date. numerous past crisis highlight cost associate credit market excesses. even countercyclical capital buff enable u prevent build-up imbalance swiss credit market, help reduce cost future, provide activate early enough preventive property take full effect. 1 swiss national bank, “implementing countercyclical

phenomenon concern short also long run, moreover, spread across number euro area member states. development global economy, particularly european one, recent year significant country region europe itself. the direct effect situation personal business budget economy general spotlight daily discussion politicians, policymakers, central bank, analyst public. the short-term direct concentration justifiable light hard time face economy take account euro area main trade partner. the short-term focus problematic situation shift attention away long-term policy reforms. the fact global crisis perceive interpret escalate crescendo tone indisputable. it partly perceive moment first hit and, little little, transform mortgage crisis deep global crisis since great depression. the response crisis lesson draw follow similar fashion. the approach extent response crisis uniform across countries. the economy fresh memory financial crisis respond swiftly strongly. the say public business community economies. the economy enjoy favourable fiscal position also face crisis without impair long-term fiscal sustainability. the situation seem slightly complex develop european economies. seek find balance deleveraging fiscal consolidation, euro area authority demand set protective wall possible fire burst outside. but, noted, fire already burst spread inside euro area walls; therefore, set “protective wall fire” pointless point. the european union institutional structures, along 2 bi central bankers’ speech international financial institution partners, undertake number reform put “fire” out. however, still unclear long “agony” last likewise impact euro area trade partners. the exhaustion fiscal monetary policy incentive fail increase economic activity and, moreover, aggravate sovereign debt situation financial stability. consequently, sovereign debt sustainability bank system credibility-related issue add concern economic growth. the question face many country today form trade-off stability sovereignty. currently, latter two intertwine endogenous relationship (of mutual impact one another), multi-dimensional need stability (implying maintenance price stability, macroeconomic stability, financial fiscal stability) require take balance measures. the latter considerable social cost short run. social discontent government propose erode credibility reform authorities, increasing, turn, sovereign debt risk. euro area, particularly southern members, face concern, whose solution bear consequence economic political implication future member state common currency. the reform policy undertake euro area authorities, individually concert manner, important direct implication economies. experience date show partner large bank adopt approach maximize benefit “owners”. consequently, decision-making entirely condition fear loss stability sovereignty associate current concern economy parent bank. this push country take bias measure economies, risk rat investment country 100%. this decision-making, directly link event take place within euro area, practically transfer issue stability versus sovereignty economies. these policy represent negative phenomenon, contradict positive stabilize role partner play far south east european economy societies. the country region last 20 year undertake numerous structural, political economic reforms, view consolidate democratic state, rule law base principle market economy support consolidate financial system. these reform enhance credibility independence public institution and, particular, central bank’s role independence. they guide wish goal join europe, rather build society similar european one. by achieve economic, political social convergence countries, hope become worthy partner develop europe, adopt euro final phase transformation process. from viewpoint, european integration process, european commission euro become powerful external anchor see country. current development diminish anchor role eu euro. consequently, european commission european decision-making authority should, future, pay great attention characteristic country region aspire eu membership, engage close cooperation respective national authorities. it is, however, important emphasize evident indisputable fact us: external factor cannot safeguard long-term stability internal anchor missing. the current situation europe show integration process prove sufficient anchor, inside outside euro area, long internal economic political choice stable long run. this conclusion underline role importance internal anchor warrantor macro-financial stability continuation structural reform bring bi central bankers’ speech 3 economy point. these anchor strong argument hand public large exert pressure public institutions, formulate implement policy guarantee long-term stability sovereignty. unfortunately, i state earlier, anchor currently jeopardize internal factors. drive short-term perceive benefit vis-à-vis real cost correction process, public, business community, syndicate stakeholder ask short-term concession institutions, particularly central bank. judge benefits, require shift focus objective traditional instrument institution mandate for. these short-term perceive benefits, seemingly, potential offer right moral solution sovereignty versus stability, bear risk cause loss long run. political institutional factor address yet important concern identify bank albania cause financial stability-related concern decelerate economic growth albania. i refer collateral execution, low perceive risk arise severe political situation lack consensus, deceleration reform require european commission receive eu candidate country status, severity political warfare, use economy situation political gain. lastly, bank albania note albanian economy remain pressure market development main trade partner economic financial policies. the measure take trade partner enhance confidence financial system adjust macro-financial imbalance hamper monetary policy transmission economy. they heighten public concern undermine confidence future. these reason prevent bank system finance economy government low interest rate and, consequently, central bank’s monetary policy transmission ease monetary financial conditions. what currently happen represent high risk premium country region reason refer earlier, rather increase real interest rates. concluding, i would like clarify central bank make utmost preserve frail macro-financial balance bolster public confidence institution financial system. in context, bank albania, date, continue foster macroeconomic financial stability albania. this major obligation arise constitution relevant laws. we commit meet obligation dedication meticulousity. we fully focus two major objectives, like good captain focus horizon, rather hand lay ship’s wheel. the bank albania belief that, guarantee two vital pillar stability prosperity economy, provide best contribution achieve high economic growth. on hand, would create attractive surround absorb accommodate foreign investment, allow entry new capital economy, vital support country’s economic activity credibility region beyond. the bank albania commit guarantee sound bank system efficient channel public save economy. we continue carry periodic examination guarantee bank system’s stability. sufficient capitalisation capital quality remain primary objective. i would like guarantee system bank albania take measure supply liquidity, increase pressure high credit volume improve quality. dear guests, i invite actively participate today’s debate discussion issue remain focus common interest future. i invite contribute, 4 bi central bankers’ speech presentation discussions, set objective region face future solve current challenges. thank attention! bi central bankers’ speech 1 mario draghi: president’s address 14th ecb watcher conference speech mr mario draghi, president european central bank, 14th ecb watcher conference, frankfurt main, 15 june 2012. * * * lady gentlemen, it great pleasure take part fourteenth edition ecb watcher conference – first i attend president european central bank. a aware, ecb crucial role provide liquidity sound bank counterparties return adequate collateral. this do throughout crisis, faithful mandate maintain price stability medium term – continue do. the eurosystem continue supply liquidity solvent bank needed. in normal times, “adequate liquidity” may define volume refinance line need bank meet obligatory reserve requirement finance autonomous factors. in time increase financial instability, “adequate liquidity” indicate volume central bank money also counteract temporary inability bank refinance market, could lead systemic consequence bank sector whole. in introductory remark morning, i talk little detail ecb’s monetary policy. i also discus europe’s agenda growth issue relate longer-term vision economic monetary union. 1. consideration monetary policy let start monetary policy. there two feature i would like highlight. the first relate effectiveness three-year long-term refinance operation (ltros) launch month ago. a recall, operation introduce environment money market spread surged, liquidity dry banks’ access market-based fund erode rapidly. the uncertainty market-based fund bank – especially medium-term fund – perhaps critical issue environment. it truly threaten undermine bank lend create pressure broad-based deleveraging. a result credit crunch would severely aggravate slowdown economic activity, hurt employment give rise acute downside risk price stability. we must always remember two third external finance firm come banks. this ratio even high small medium-sized enterprises, account three quarter corporate employment euro area. it background decide launch three-year ltros. their objective broadly met. the april bank lend survey point mark decline net tighten credit standard general improvement banks’ fund conditions. this evidence 2 bi central bankers’ speech support range market indicators. overall, confirm supply side constraint bank credit removed. this important result. the full supportive impact three-year ltros need time unfold, early draw firm conclusion behaviour single variable – namely, bank credit private economy – influence multitude factors. in current environment weak credit demand heighten risk aversion, rebound volume credit particularly slow. yet granular balance sheet data indicate february march, bank domicile stress constituency could interrupt partly reverse sustain decline loan previous months. indeed, small bank country could increase supply loans. inflation expectation remain well anchor inflation risk euro area country. financial market-based inflation expectation ten-year horizon consistent definition medium-term price stability. and risk price stability emerge, eurosystem sufficient tool disposal absorb excess liquidity. the second point i would like highlight way understand ecb’s current conduct monetary policy heterogeneity. the situation regard economic growth quite different across euro area. this first time; clearly diverge cycle ten year ago. at time, growth germany low growth country buoyant. this part normal degree cyclical heterogeneity observe large continental economies. it similar observe term cyclical heterogeneity within unite states. what new current episode parallel fragmentation financial markets. this first concern interbank market, work almost exclusively national, collateralised short-term basis. it also true broad capital market private capital flows, home bias rising. the prime reason current home bias general risk aversion. in addition, attentive monitor whether regulatory initiative – include anticipation future liquidity ratio – initiative national supervisor affect market, especially across borders. we partly respond fact increase heterogeneity allow national central bank enlarge collateral pool. this essential ensure sufficient outreach real economy constituency context significant heterogeneity. they could accept direct credit claims, particularly support credit small medium-sized enterprise important investment employment. this collateral enlargement crucial address situation liquidity abundance country liquidity scarcity others. the enlargement take place prudence risk management framework oversee govern council. while process take time, restoration adequate credit flow renew function interbank market remain firm objectives. 2. europe’s growth agenda let turn european growth agenda. strengthen growth potential economy crucial. we whole range pending reform national level: liberalisation product markets; removal bureaucratic impediment entrepreneurial activity; great labour market flexibility, facilitate re-entry unemployed job market; growth-friendly composition fiscal adjustment. let elaborate little. bi central bankers’ speech 3 product market regulation streamline foster competition, particularly shelter profession service sector. extensive administrative reform facilitate start-up new firms. moreover, judicial system adjust resolve avoid court backlogs, hamper conduct business activities. once critical mass reform achieved, considerably strengthen economic dynamism, innovation employment. these effort complement active labour market policies, target low-skilled, elderly young unemployed people. this would facilitate re-entry productive activity typically face difficult start position. it would also foster social cohesion despite burden economic adjustment face economies. second, important reform pending eu level, implementation service directive important initiative facilitate cross-border trade services. by reduce market power producers, reform put downward pressure price upward pressure productivity. third, i believe oversee national reform promote growth way parallel way oversee fiscal policies. here might draw inspiration fiscal compact idea avoid unsustainable policy first place provide incentive positive reform. in single currency area, national reform affect growth potential competitiveness important fiscal policy equally essential economic sustainability. fourth, many item consider national level could consider eu level. for example, measure foster labour mobility could implemented, inter alia facilitate cross-border portability pension rights. european fund could reallocate area conducive long-term growth durable employment opportunities. and capacity european investment bank finance infrastructure project could strengthened. a see, long-standing agenda growth. it time implement determination confidence longer-term benefits. collectively compete effectively global economy. collectively good support growth job creation. and collectively preserve common european value fairness, social cohesion social progress. 3. consideration regard longer-term vision economic monetary union let turn broad question evolution euro area towards genuine economic union – one commensurate monetary union. a know, i close contact president herman van rompuy, josé-manuel barroso jean-claude juncker reflect element longer-term vision economic monetary union. ultimately, vision basis process objectives, progress, condition deadline specified; credibility substantiate action short run line long-term objectives. since joint effort work still progress, i cannot provide specific matter yet. but i tell reflection found central aim secure stability sustain prosperity euro area. price stability remain cornerstone economic monetary union, since beginning. but order preserve broad economic stability, need strengthen foundation field financial, fiscal structural policy-making. 4 bi central bankers’ speech the strengthen foundation secure past achievement integration. they improve management euro area economy. and bring economic monetary union close heart mind europe’s citizens, whose ownership collective project integration shake crisis. a key issue context sovereignty. in process economic integration, often speak give sovereignty. yet integration far equivalent give sovereignty. there many case integration imply “sharing” “pooling” sovereignty. and case integration actually lead sovereignty high level. for example, small euro area country actually regain sovereignty euro regain influence monetary policy high level. something similar may hold country join eu, participate shape single market rule rather adjust them. in globalise economy, dwindle individual influence may actually reverse integration. of course, true country citizen involve joint decision-making. the degree participation therefore much important level policy assignment determine whether sovereignty lost, share actually gained. in case europe, decision elevate supranational level could take efficiently effectively account interlinkages spillovers. but point, supranational institution process continually gain influence, need great political legitimacy become pressing. in case therefore, first issue consider possible transfer competency would transfer legitimacy political accountability. if legitimacy fully ensure levels, policy assignment question answer grind policy optimality. conclusion let conclude. a half decade crisis forcefully demonstrated, macroeconomic financial imbalance entail considerable challenge smooth function economic monetary union. despite challenges, monetary policy framework, firmly anchor central bank independence clear focus price stability, provide robust basis ecb deliver mandate. by preserve unambiguous commitment price stability, ecb make best contribution mitigate fallout crisis. this commitment continue guide policy time come. thank attention. bi central bankers’ speech 1 agathe côté: strengthen financial infrastructure – new canadian central counterparty remark m agathe côté, deputy governor bank canada, association quebec woman finance, montréal, quebec, 14 june 2012 * * * it give great pleasure address association quebec woman finance. you aware midst period heighten financial turbulence. this current episode remind us—if necessary—of important robust financial system. today, i briefly talk risk canada’s financial system currently exposed. however, main focus major step take strengthen financial system future shocks. i refer new central counterparty service repo transactions, launch 21 february. this service, operate montréal canadian derivative clear corporation (cdcc), key initiative design improve infrastructure canadian core fund markets. recall short-term fund markets, like many countries, severely batter 2008. these market immune turbulence, important take measure increase resilience. cdcc work closely investment industry association canada, stakeholder financial industry, bank canada regulatory authority create new central counterparty. however, much remain done. it hope that, time i conclude comments, great understand essential continue next phase implementation, volume transaction number participant access counterparty expanded. risk present financial system review but first, let’s talk risk. today, bank canada release late issue financial system review, analyze principal risk weigh country’s financial system. i sure it’s news risk remain high. after period calm early year, global financial condition deteriorate markedly recent week debt crisis europe intensified. market skeptical capacity resolve policy-makers address unsustainable fiscal situations, capital adequacy euro-area bank underlie balance-of-payments problem within euro area. if issue deal orderly way, contagion effect global financial condition could significant. while le urgent situation europe, risk surround sovereign debt also affect regions. in particular, unite state spectre “fiscal cliff” loom country’s prospect growth. more generally, weakness global demand partly due international current account imbalance continue represent major source risk. moreover, several advance economies, keep policy rate low extend period time may stimulate excessive risk-taking. 2 bi central bankers’ speech here canada, high level indebtedness potential correction house sector principal domestic risk face financial system. a well, fragile situation abroad increase probability negative shock income wealth canadian households. to date, crisis europe limit impact financial system. canadian market remain relatively stable, bank continue good access wholesale fund markets. nonetheless, deterioration situation could considerable effect canada trade, confidence financial channels. even though financial system solid, important take step bolster ability absorb shocks. the creation central counterparty repo market step direction. with permission, i turn crucial role play repo market canada. the repo market repos – transaction involve sell security concurrently commit repurchase late date sale price plus interest – economic equivalent secure loans. investment dealer bank use repo market source low-cost secure finance fund long position hedge short position securities. these activity allow market-makers generate liquidity broad financial system maintain liquid secondary markets. other institutions, insurance company pension funds, also use repo market tool manage cash balances. since large proportion repo transaction short term, turnover rate market high. these transaction provide immediate margin adjustment financial institutions’ fund structures. to give sense magnitude, 30 march 2012, repo position security canadian bank value total can$90 billion (approximately 5 per cent canadian-dollar-denominated assets). government canada security provide underlie collateral almost 70 per cent transactions. hence, repo market support function crucial cash markets. in sum, repo market consider core fund market canada, represent major source fund financial institutions. in addition, immediate substitute market, cease operating, significant contagion would likely result.1 this must make every effort ensure remain continuously open. risk bring light crisis during financial crisis 2007–08, weakness infrastructure financial market contribute uncertainty and, although cause crisis, intensify systemic risk. this notably case repo markets. in fact, participants’ uncertainty valuation collateral network bilateral exposure among financial institution exacerbate aversion counterparty risk, point many reduce number trade and, cases, even leave market. 1 j.-s. fontaine, j. selody c. wilkins, “improving resilience core fund markets,” bank canada financial system review (december 2009): 41–46. bi central bankers’ speech 3 recall illiquidity repo market important contributor near-collapse bear stearns march 2008. repo market canada suffer severe liquidity crunch autumn year. follow bankruptcy major financial institution abroad, concern counterparties spread, balance sheet subject severe strains. in absence ccp would allow member ease balance sheet balance-sheet netting, bank drastically curtail repo activity. the crisis clearly demonstrate need action bolster resilience market. in canada, investment industry association canada, support bank canada, issue request proposal development ccp service repos. in december 2009, cdcc select provide services. the ccp repo transaction risk management how central counterparty work? put simply, central counterparty function intermediary financial transactions. through legal process call “novation,” become buyer every seller seller every buyer.2 in words, complex network bilateral exposure replace one exposure hub, central counterparty. this process not, however, eliminate risks? risk concentrate single institution. a result, central counterparty contribute reduce systemic risk, must solid risk-control mechanism place subject rigorous oversight. cdcc implement mechanism manage various risk confront it, notably, legal, operational financial risk. with regard financial risk, control credit liquidity risk key contain overall counterparty risk system.3 the legal rule govern cdcc’s management defaults, together financial resource available address credit risk liquidity risk, enhance stability repo market ensure orderly wind event major institution defaults, also ensure novate transaction settled. during crisis, benefit central counterparty become apparent bankruptcy lehman brothers. thank participation lehman central counterparty derivatives, position interest rate swap – enormous (us$9 trillion 66,000 transactions) – unwind orderly timely fashion. thus, market interest rate derivative – another core market – continue function smoothly despite lehman collapse. the role bank canada in light crucial role play central counterparty service efficient function repo market, bank canada consider canadian derivative clear service (cdcs) might pose systemic risk, whereupon designate cdc payment clear settlement act. consequently, cdc subject oversight bank since 30 april 2012. 2 n. chande, n. labelle e. tuer, “central counterparties systemic risk,” bank canada financial system review, (december 2010): 43–50. 3 p. chatterjee, l. embree p. youngman, “reducing systemic risk: canada’s new central counterparty fixed-income market,” bank canada financial system review (june 2012): 43–49. 4 bi central bankers’ speech the bank’s oversight process include review significant change system operate rules, review result audits, define standards. in carry oversight mandate, bank work closely relevant financial market regulators, autorité de marchés financier ontario security commission. this oversight soon base new international standard develop participation bank. it worth note lesson learn creation canada’s central counterparty repo transaction useful development new standards. implementation central counterparty the metaphor frequently use industry describe financial system infrastructure simple appropriate: it’s call “plumbing.” why? because essential viability efficient function markets. a financial system, plumb quite complicated. hence, develop new infrastructure take great deal time. it complex process, term create implement adequate robust risk-control mechanisms. moreover, time require resolve operational issues, development test require software central counterparty participants, issue associate interaction new software exist systems. the launch first phase service therefore represent major step. but much remain done. delivery take place three phases. phase one deal bilateral repo transaction single government canada security, although represent small fraction market. phase two, plan end year, incorporate cash transaction fixed-income security repo transaction negotiate intermediaries, include anonymous counterparties. finally, phase three, propose 2013–14, target general-repo transaction security predetermine basket instrument serve collateral. the introduction last phase expect significantly increase volume trade make central counterparty, well liquidity efficiency repo market. international effort mitigate risk short-term fund market in canada, creation central counterparty contribute significantly limit risk instability emanate repo market. at international level, financial stability board currently assess potential reform repo market loan security context work shadow bank sector.4 the repo market part sector form credit intermediation which, like bank intermediation, rest maturity transformation may include leverage effects. there number possible reforms. 4 financial stability board, “securities lend repos: market overview financial stability issues,” workstream security lend repos, interim report shadow bank workstream 5, 15 march 2012. bi central bankers’ speech 5 one specific measure consideration increase use central counterparties. another promise avenue address regulation margin mitigate problem associate procyclicality. adopt minimal, countercyclical, margin could help curb excessive leverage period exuberance lessen extent disruptive curtailment leverage difficult periods. moreover, increase use central counterparties repos could facilitate implementation type regulation. conclusion it intention today talk risks, even shed light significant stride take canada improve resilience financial system. one tangible, local, example progress creation, right montréal, central counterparty repo transactions. transaction execute counterparty completely transparent well capitalized, rule procedure place event default. today, canada’s experience benefit country authorities. however, it’s worth emphasize willingness private public sector work together lead creation counterparty. it essential spirit co-operation maintained, much remain done. the success counterparty depend subsequent phase implementation, broaden sphere influence. we never risk-free financial system. that’s need take measure render resilient shock may occur, either abroad domestically. let u make financial system strong build stable future. thank attention. bi central bankers’ speech 1 daniel mminele: monetary policy implementation – impact change regulatory landscape policy transmission mechanism address mr daniel mminele, deputy governor south african reserve bank, rand merchant bank ficc research macro forum, cape town, 31 may 2012. * * * 1. introduction good morning thank rand merchant bank invite certainly enlighten morning. the topic i ask address interest one central bank policy perspective, relate area work central bank still evolving, real impact remain uncertain. the two speaker provide interest insight around fiscal political dynamic locally, area international context carry fair share responsibility current sovereign debt crisis financial market stresses. it seem quite appropriate round day discussion monetary policy, play increasingly central role recent years, give limited, cases, exhaust fiscal space, seem lack political meaningfully resolve crisis. the result unprecedented expansion demand monetary policy, necessitate enlargement toolkit manner one would think impossible year ago. however, know, action consequences, central banker many way credit come rescue fiscal policy long could, many challenge go forward, least remain illusion unlimited intervention1 potential moral hazard, exit unconventional measure ultimately best exit without create another crisis. it seem keep return question “exit”, get derail upset deterioration global environment. in remark today i touch cost unstable financial system development around macro-prudential policies, i discus impact regulatory change transmission mechanism. 2. the cost unstable financial system the economic social cost associate unstable financial system well known. fiscal policy go extraordinary length try secure stability real economy financial system, doing, sow seed sovereign debt crisis. to remedy situation europe, harsh austerity measure implement order put public finance sound sustainable footing, inject necessary confidence financial markets. in reality, however, one cannot doubt measure implement best intentions, doubtful desire outcome achieved, instance measure turn self-defeating. austerity measure come expense growth, consequence, public finance able recover quickly expect fiscal deficit target met. the result debt crisis linger long anticipated, ultimately spread peripheral europe country within euro zone. hence argument rag continue favour austerity favour le austerity stimulus support growth. the 1 monetary policy crisis: test limit monetary policy, herve hannoun, deputy general manager, bank international settlement 2 bi central bankers’ speech austerity versus growth debate find way political discourse, euro zone fiscal pact challenge scale seemingly tilt favour growth rather much austerity. the ideal scenario would combination measure support growth short term, put fiscal sustainability medium term risk. when become clear fiscal policy exhaust case extended, monetary policy step in. interest rate number advance economy already cut near zero. central bank find turn unconventional measure quantitative ease balance sheet policies2 conduct large scale intervention financial market resuscitate market segment long functioning. liquidity provide dysfunctional interbank credit market mitigate credit crunch prevent complete collapse global economy. these policy use stabilize financial market tension dampen rise credit liquidity risk premia. in short, balance sheet policy employ target overnight term money-market rates, long-term government bond yield various risk spreads, impact wide range asset prices. via channel central bank action mean eventually transmit real economy. these policy action central bank certainly play significant role, prevent high degree financial instability buy time get need repair done. unfortunately, seem time buy use opportune manner. 3. macro-prudential policy give severe repercussion financial crisis, question arise whether “it good pick piece bust rather try prevent build-up bubbles”? olivier blanchard3 stress “financial intermediation matters” market segment specialize investor operate specific markets, link arbitrage. for reason, withdrawal important investor market (segment) might create severe distortion asset price therefore policy intervention become necessary restore dislocate price align fundamentals. this quite clearly play u subprime crisis. in context argue favour preventative measures, rather reactive. we learn firstly systemic risk cannot prevent focus regulation supervision, secondly achieve price stability equate achieve financial stability. hence, birth macro-prudential policy pursue financial stability objective, whereas objective monetary policy price stability. the latter us interest rate instrument, well know interest rate blunt tool deal excess leverage, extreme risk taking, unwarranted deviation asset price fundamentals. a combination monetary regulatory tool needed, increase regulatory capital ratio leverage deem high, change margin requirement reign excessive asset price moves. it true also macro-prudential policy sufficient ensure financial stability, see euro zone debt crisis, market doubt solvency sovereign manner, fiscal policy lead financial instability. nonetheless, i focus purely macro-prudential policy now. 2 balance sheet policy involve central bank use balance sheet influence broad economic and/or financial conditions, particularly policy rate reach zero limits. 3 chief economist international monetary fund bi central bankers’ speech 3 in interview4, olivier blanchard note macro-prudential measure likely target impact policy rate variable try affect. whereas policy rate best use primarily response aggregate activity inflation, specific macro-prudential instrument use deal specific output composition, financing, asset price issues. the two policy different objectives, however, implementation macro-prudential policy impact transmission mechanism monetary policy, give work channel (bank lend balance sheet financial institutions) focus institution (monetary financial). the question whether macro-prudential policy amplify dampen interest rate cycles? jaime caruana5 note trough may become le extreme macro-prudential policy reduce likelihood financial crisis disinflationary consequences. similarly, interest rate peak may le severe, assume macro-prudential policy succeed restrain asset price credit booms. on hand, contribute financial stability thereby place additional weight risk imbalances, may need large interest rate increase expansions. interest rates, believes, could move symmetrically financial cycle would reduce risk hit zero low bind resort balance sheet policies. a i mention introduction, uncharted territory still much research go topic. south africa use macro-prudential tools, number change implement enhance macro-prudential policy. these change include elevation financial stability committee equal status monetary policy committee, well creation financial stability oversight committee, chair governor sarb minister finance. 4. the regulatory change impact transmission mechanism the global financial crisis force revision international regulatory framework. reform implement number areas, include strengthen macro-prudential policies, strengthen supervision individual financial institutions, oversight key market infrastructures, monitor financial markets. basel iii capital liquidity requirement currently prominent regulatory change great potential impact monetary policy transmission mechanism. although basel iii envision increase resilience bank system doing, improve effectiveness monetary policy transmission mechanism, south africa member g20, basel committee bank supervision fsb principle support regulatory reforms, nonetheless risk unintended consequence associate implementation requirements. basel iii requirement macro-prudential nature, like previous basel requirements, aim balance sheet commercial bank could therefore impact economic activity hence monetary policy. i would like focus specifically liquidity framework require bank adhere new liquidity coverage ratio (lcr) ensure sufficient high-quality liquid asset survive month-long significant stress scenario. the lcr aim ensure bank maintain adequate level unencumbered, high-quality liquid asset convert cash cover net outflow period stress. 4 interview olivier blanchard, imf survey magazine, imf explore contour future macroeconomic policy, february 12, 2010 5 monetary policy world macro prudential policy, speech jaime caruana, general manager bis, saarcfinance governors’ symposium 2011, kerala, 11 june 2011 4 bi central bankers’ speech in south africa, like countries, basel iii liquidity regulation aim reduce reliance bank short-term funding. south africa large persistently high level income inequality, reflect high gini coefficient 60. it surprise therefore, household save low, large portion population unable make significant contribution national savings. gross save household sector around 1.6 per cent gdp past two years. consequently, national save concentrate wholesale savings, result structural constraint, bank rely heavily wholesale fund rather retail deposits. the relatively high reliance wholesale funding, increase requirement term lcr component liquidity framework basel iii, namely net stable fund ratio (nsfr)6 , therefore result high cost fund domestic banks. there double whammy, however, time, opportunity cost acquire high quality liquid asset imply decline supply loanable funds. implement basel liquidity risk standard south africa could reduce availability long-term credit, particularly south africa asset meet basel iii qualify criterion new lcr short supply (paradoxically also result pursue responsible fiscal policy avoid excessive government debt). this intuitively would result reduction broad economic activity, without raise policy rates, would possibly compromise transmission mechanism base prevail monetary policy settings. south africa implement monetary policy classical cash reserve system, liquidity shortage create money market cash reserve requirement open market operations, issue sarb debenture reverse repos. through shortage, bank impact marginal cost fund commercial banks, bank refinance shortage sarb week repo rate. this place additional pressure demand liquid assets, bank refinance shortage eligible collateral, addition asset need prudential liquid asset requirement. i add one national discretion option available authority jurisdiction inadequate qualify liquid asset make available commit facility central bank, commercial bank draw time liquidity stress. a aware, bank recently announce intention make available commit liquidity facility eligible collateral south african bank help meet require lcr. this help avoid abrupt change business model bank, could complicate transmission mechanism monetary policy detrimental effect real economy. the bank presently investigate option also deal challenge present nsfr apply current form. in addition economic impact, lcr may host unintended consequences, increase interlinkages government (although theory enhance attractiveness corporate bond therefore spur activity segment market), encourage disintermediation, well cross-border interlinkages, inadvertently negatively impact liquidity debt markets. thus, basel iii, bank may appear safer, systemic risk may necessarily lower. in sum, face structural constraints, basel iii liquidity requirement may result south african bank reduce lending, therefore availability credit real economy. this certainly negative consequence economic growth employment creation, reduce available savings. the bi concede basel iii impact transmission mechanism monetary policy, however, formal research study still infancy. while understand 6 this fund ratio calculate proportion long-term asset fund long term, stable funding. bi central bankers’ speech 5 qualitative impact, possible measure stage, impact differ accord country’s initial conditions. these issue central bank grapple today challenge present conduct monetary policy go forward. the new basel requirement suggest need change south african monetary policy implementation framework, unless change operate framework current classical cash reserve system overnight target rate framework. south africa’s money market yet sufficiently develop potentially justify change current classical cash reserve system operate framework overnight target rate framework. this segment market need develop much more, form part on-going work bank consultation market participant money market subcommittee financial market liaison group. thus, least medium term, monetary policy implementation framework south africa unlikely affect regulatory changes, however, impact monetary policy transmission mechanism therefore monetary policy interest rate need constant monitoring. 5. conclusion in conclusion, global financial crisis force rethink monetary policy financial stability, result new macro prudential frameworks. the consequence thereof still unknown could significant implication conduct monetary policy institutional set central banks. what certain operate procedure central bank become much complicated, much wide variety tool available. i thank bi central bankers’ speech 1

rate low credit quality, bank sector continue generate profit remain well capitalize liquid. in march, capital adequacy ratio stand 15.9%, liquid asset account almost one-third total sector’s assets. the bank sector expand activity drive mainly performance public deposits, continue grow buoyant rates. we are, however, aware risk expose period characterize numerous unstable development global regional economy. therefore, supervision place great emphasis identify various risk bank activity, improve bank sector’s ability manage risk strengthen legal operational framework address case materialization. in wake global economic crisis, many country redesign economic development agenda models. throughout many years, bank albania initiated, encourage support discussion engage open communication public authorities, business community academic circles. our opinion economic development policy contribute set good balance development priority sector economy, support agriculture production. one immediate objective enhance economic capacity improve competitiveness product benefit foreign demand. to purpose, development perfection financial infrastructure, well qualitative improvement technology, are, among others, priority. we must ensure well-educated labour force, able adapt international labour market, addition local one. therefore, education-related policy young generation must, all, ensure quality education incorporate programme assign great importance practical orientation. the bank albania seriously commit public financial literacy programme. in context, design implement series project cooperation initiatives, cover different age group geographical area across country. it clear objective cannot accomplish simple wave magic wand. they even hard accomplish due time capacity single economy. albania indeed small economy thank continuous reforms, turn attractive country foreign investors. our vision remain open regional initiatives. we able become part joint regional projects, thus provide evidence great absorptive capacity big investment serious investors. bi central bankers’ speech 3 therefore, formulation policy attract foreign investment, couple constant improvement business climate relevant legal framework, continuous part country’s economic development strategy. dear guests, despite small country, albania represent vibrant economy vital people able undertake wide-ranging business intitiatives. moreover, country share considerable part official border albanian-inhabited areas, hence provide different quantitative geographical dimension various potential business initiatives. i believe albania one country currently list among distinguish european countries, enjoy stable macroeconomic financial stability, economic growth. we ample natural resources, fantastic diversity climate, cultures, social, ethnographic geographical features, qualify labour force, admirable flexibility private entrepreneurship improve legal framework. for reasons, i avail opportunity invite increase interest albania make part investment partnership projects. i strongly confident contribute albania’s albanian people prosperity future, also represent safe investment alternative. thank attention i wish great success! bi central bankers’ speech 1 andreas dombret: the present state euro-area sovereign debt crisis speech dr andreas dombret, member executive board deutsche bundesbank, bank america merrill lynch global macro conference, london, 12 june 2012. * * * 1. introduction have join board bundesbank two year ago long career banking, i am, again, delight address senior market participants. i acutely aware importance exchange information euro-area sovereign debt crisis among central banker policymakers also markets. first all, comment sovereign debt crisis, i would like remind success story. more 330 million people euro area benefit today single currency, introduce 1999. the euro visible symbol european integration. while motivation introduction predominantly political, euro success economic terms, too. since introduction, internal value least stable early national currencies. the average inflation rate stand 2%. i call true success. that well good, may say, may wonder whether positive verdict refute recent upheaval euro area. indeed, investor sceptical euro, predict break-up currency union, least departure individual member states. in plain language, central question remark today “can euro make it, how?” the answer first part question crystal clear: “yes, will.” to answer “how”, i shall proceed two stages: first, explain crisis come and, second, describe europe’s response far and, mind, future action needed. 2. analysis crisis there doubt euro-area sovereign debt crisis, trigger global financial economic crisis, great challenge ever face european monetary union. the european monetary union certainly crossroads. the press question, though, european monetary union look like medium long term. will monetary policy, example, able deliver price stability past? and organise order so? when come solve current crisis, essential take account root cause well particular feature european monetary union. the root cause crisis well know now, i shall brief this. the convergence long-term interest rate low level attract large capital flow peripheral country euro area. yet, member state fail many respect put fund productive use. instead, spend cheap money public private consumption – greece portugal – allow residential construction sector boom, eventually lead oversized vulnerable bank sector – ireland spain. sharp reversal credit boom persistent loss competitiveness easily put solvency government risk – exactly happened. 2 bi central bankers’ speech and particular relevance monetary union, since member state long capable offset loss competitiveness devalue exchange rates. higher-than-average rise unit labour cost therefore require internal often painful adjustment order regain price competitiveness international good service markets. in nutshell, several member state fail meet requirement european monetary union membership. they implement necessary adjustments. the inherent risk monetary union recognise right outset, however. specifically, combination single monetary policy national fiscal policy distinguish euro area federal republic like unite state unitary country like unite kingdom. this setup increase deficit bias imply incentive take advantage central bank balance sheet mutualise sovereign debt one way another among taxpayer different nations. the found father european monetary union disincentive much mind agree institutional arrangements. first all, eurosystem mandate single primary objective, namely maintain price stability euro area whole. moreover, bail-out principle, prohibition monetary state finance eurosystem, fiscal rule stability growth pact put place prevent idleness part member states. nevertheless, crisis also make obvious shortcoming institutional framework european monetary union. the set rule prevent member state make error i mentioned. implementation fiscal rule lax. moreover, fiscal rule stability growth pact were, effect, relax two year financial crisis break 2007, follow strident campaign germany france make pact “smarter”. furthermore, designer framework turn blind eye emergence macroeconomic imbalance risk fiscal sustainability well financial stability. 3. europe’s response crisis 3.1 crisis resolution short run euro-area fiscal monetary policymakers take extraordinary measure contain crisis maintain financial stability. first all, euro-area member state imf support greece bilateral loans. then, temporary stabilisation mechanism established, efsf. a know, beneficiary ireland, portugal and, include second adjustment programme, greece. over course sovereign debt crisis, effective lend volume efsf increased, lend condition relaxed, toolbox efsf extended. a permanent mechanism, esm, resilient fund structure, established; schedule replace efsf summer year operate temporarily alongside efsf. recently, euro-area finance minister agree raise ceiling combine esm efsf lend €700 billion. moreover, imf member country pledge $430 billion new loan fund order erect global firewall. the european global firewall alike substantially strengthen past two years. be level sufficient? or european leader increase volume even further? my opinion regard policymakers refrain wild goose chase pursuit ever high firewalls. make firewall high high resolve crisis. instead, policymakers care firewall fall credibility trap owe unavoidable political financial constraints. generally speaking, firewall cannot extinguish fire. it buy time sustainable measure become effective. therefore, fire extinguish means. bi central bankers’ speech 3 monetary policy cannot extinguish fire either. this deny monetary policy eurosystem help stabilise financial system euro area beyond. our policy stance remain rather accommodative. in effect, monetary policy expansive key interest rate 1% might suggest. owe excess liquidity, market rate well margin. the large excess liquidity result non-standard policy measure eurosystem. these include extend list eligible collateral, full allotment policy provision long-term refinance operation maturity three years. the security market programme cover bond purchase programme additional non-standard eurosystem measures. all measures, i wish emphasise, temporary nature. the recent setback equity credit markets, along still strong flight-to-safety flight-to-liquidity flow sovereign bonds, mainly result political uncertainty europe. this remind european government cannot afford ease reform consolidation efforts. but let also point inherent risk side effect central bank measures. over medium long term, continue provision ample liquidity might, various channels, de-anchor inflation expectations, would translate high inflation risks. it could also pave way new asset bubbles, thereby sow seed next crisis. point risk side effect crisis measure imply bundesbank wish obstruct stabilisation euro. quite opposite. we aim strengthen framework euro ensure continue stable euro future. recur suggestion contrary, example george soros, therefore ill-advised. a disintegration currency union would link extremely high cost risks. that’s scenario cannot anyone’s goal. yet imply germany become open blackmail promise guarantee without control. this would indeed erode stability basis currency union. some argue, course, eurosystem need whatever take maintain euro – particularly consider ecb national central bank “last men standing”. however, bear mind make substantial difference whether non-monetary union central bank – feed bank england – eurosystem us balance sheet policy instrument. in latter case, balance-sheet policy implicit risk loss would imply shift burden among taxpayer different member states. but since taxpayers’ money, national parliament central bank decide shift. hence, monetary policy must sacrifice stability orientation credibility fight inflation, monetary policy cannot resolve crisis anyway. address sovereign debt crisis remains, first foremost, fiscal policy task. nevertheless, fiscal economic policy reform need bring last solution are, short run, costly – politically economically. therefore, major challenge monetary policy unconventional measure temporary relief afford see excuse delay, even reverse, reforms. otherwise, monetary policy risk take hostage fiscal policy. this would last damage – central banks’ credibility, ability maintain price stability, public acceptance monetary union whole. 3.2 sustainable crisis resolution but fiscal economic policy action need achieve last solution current crisis prevent future crises? in view, three condition met. 4 bi central bankers’ speech 1. the first condition rigorous implementation budgetary consolidation growth-enhancing structural reform member state european monetary union. 2. the second reform framework european monetary union take recent experience account. 3. the third condition progress financial regulation. financial regulation far-reaching complex field, i wish go today. but please allow highlight two points. the first that, european monetary union established, financial market expect act additional corrective measure unsound fiscal policies. history teach us, however, low risk awareness, market work effectively timely sanction mechanism – finally become aware risks, response quick fierce. nevertheless, watchdog function financial market – today – indispensable. to effective, financial regulation encourage investor become aware risk signal early stage. the second point i would like mention painful lesson contagion, via financial system, prove achilles heel european monetary union. hence, improve resilience financial system, even though major policy goal across world, particularly important context monetary union. but let elaborate first second requirement euro area overcome crisis – fiscal structural reform member state well good framework european monetary union. significant progress already make regard budget consolidation and, less extent, term structural reforms. this true programme country comply condition respective adjustment programmes. and also true italy spain, third fourth-largest euro-area economies, see significant rise bond yields. their government embark labour market reform spend cuts. but room complacency. flag eagerness little disclosure loom risk penalise immediately. we bear mind market pressure – together political pressure – foster reform hopefully keep track. by token, however, investor patience reform measure unfold. true, third year sovereign debt crisis, often precious time wasted. but forget adverse development lead sovereign debt crisis emerge decade. clearly, cannot reverse matter weeks. the road recovery long uneven; backlash expected. look spain, country market focus presently, i wish acknowledge government already take bold step address structural weaknesses, example overhaul rigid labour rules. yet become clear spanish bank system need capital. therefore, i appreciate intention spanish government seek financial assistance euro area member states. the financial assistance provide efsf/esm recapitalisation spanish financial institutions. fund would provide directly bank but, line current efsf/esm rules, channel spanish state, case restructure fund frob. i optimistic package effectively mitigate negative feedback loop banks’ deleveraging real economy. but quick decisive action warrant spain, delay avoided, long one waits, expensive likely get. conditionality apply bank sector, make important spanish government push vigorously ahead reform tackle structural problem spanish economy. it definitely task eurosystem substitute national fiscal policies. this true regard spain, particularly true regard greece. greece must bi central bankers’ speech 5 everything power strengthen competitiveness. the country need stick agree austerity structural reform measure – ifs, buts. there basis external aid without agree reform program. there exception greece regard, would inevitably undermine balance give-and-take program countries, too. the repeat election show whether greek voter still support way forward. if not, greece must aware put aid risk. the consequence would severe, severe greece itself. a bundesbank stress time again, way europe deal crisis greece far-reaching implication nature european monetary union stability union. this deeply political question, come point policymakers long avoid take sides. attempt dodge decision muddle long option. rather, muddle would also – implicit – response, one least desirable ones, perspective stability-oriented monetary policy regard overcome crisis. a crucial question regard public finance european monetary union whether right cure prescribe frontloaded consolidation euro-area countries. a considerable number expert vehemently oppose approach. paul krugman, example, see euro area spiral disaster. and george soros accuse many − include bundesbank, emphasis frontloaded consolidation − destroy euro. it hardly come surprise i share views. rather, i suggest drag fiscal adjustment would major negative effects. of course, correct say that, normal times, consolidation dampen economic growth. current circumstances, however, anything normal, illusion believe backloading consolidation would help restore confidence. the current crisis essentially one confidence. on hand, one exaggerate risk restrictive fiscal policy stance, rescue package extremely accommodative monetary policy stance help cushion adjustment. the long-term benefit frontloaded consolidation, i convinced, significantly exceed short-run negative effects. nevertheless, ongoing discussion whether euro area shift focus austerity towards growth. indeed, crisis cannot overcome without growth. this much undeniable. what hotly dispute question constitute right approach stimulate growth. after ecb president mario draghi propose growth compact, get applause quarter long spell growth compact comprise. he promote relaxation austerity course – either programme country country face close market scrutiny, country consider fiscal leeway. on contrary: he deny existence contradiction goal consolidation growth. instead, point need structural reform member state euro area, particular concern product market labour markets. in sense, i appreciate portuguese prime minister’s support mario draghi. he quote saying: “there overnight structural reform effect show immediately, know capacity grow depend reforms. they one implementing.” this could express good clearer. and i confident that, implementation structural reform started, investor return even effect reform fully unfolded. those currently short european sovereign debt euro decide right time come go long again. the second requirement last solution current crisis prevention future crisis much need strengthen european monetary union’s institutional framework. 6 bi central bankers’ speech for me, right now, become evident european monetary union’s constitutional set far sustainable. to make european monetary union sustainable two path follow i briefly discus subsequently: truly improve maastricht treaty build foundation fiscal union. with respect shortcoming i mentioned, already see number accomplishments. the fiscal rule stability growth pact reinforced. the introduction reverse majority rule, example, make difficult country excessive deficit avoid sanctions. second, member state agree launch macroeconomic imbalance procedure euro area. the purpose macroeconomic surveillance identify potential risk early on, prevent emergence harmful imbalances, correct excessive imbalance already exist. third, head state government euro-area country agree “move towards strong economic union” announce fiscal compact. the key component fiscal compact strengthen commitment bring budget member state least close balance structural terms. to end, fiscal rule tighten eu level, new rule introduce nationally. the uk has, unfortunately, agree fiscal compact. however, i appreciate irish voter give clear “yes”. while fiscal compact certainly major step right direction, far cornerstone “fiscal union” euro area. the fiscal compact aim strengthen current framework, success hinge crucially member states’ willingness implement apply rules. european authority equip supranational right intervene national budget member state apply rule properly. therefore, fiscal compact – ratify member state yet – justify call monetary policymakers extend central banks’ balance sheets. nor substantiate extensive joint liability. against background recent proposal call bank union appear premature. such bank union, potentially comprise euro area deposit-guarantee system, euro area resolution fund common euro area supervision large systemically important bank group could well represent sensible step forward. yet follow deep fiscal union would imply significantly increase risk share amongst countries. introduce bank union without establish genuine, democratically legitimate fiscal union would risk undermine bail-out clause discipline effect financial market fiscal policy. from formal perspective necessitate amend eu treaty – mean unlikely short-term fix current challenge mainly relate recapitalisation need bank systems, political risk contagion effect within euro area. the true regard propose introduction eurobonds. this i respectfully disagree olivier blanchard, imf chief economist, quote saying: “… german good reason reject bear brunt irresponsible policy states. but fiscal treaty.” and concluded: “the german accept eurozone go way eurobonds.” under current framework, issuance commonly guarantee sovereign bond would actually increase exist mismatch liability control. i think, that, least time being, euro-area government reluctant surrender fiscal autonomy european authority. 4. conclusion the euro area consist independent member states. each member state constitutional tradition respect government. to extent, status euro area similar article confederation draw late 1770s, legally establish unite state america serve first constitution. bi central bankers’ speech 7 we necessarily become unite state europe. it quite possible reform maastricht framework truly self-responsible member state – words, european monetary union plan – guide u sustainable monetary union. or people europe might indeed make leap substantial deepen european integration, particularly term economic fiscal policies. both option viable. the decision take yet indicate direction europe take. however, absolutely doubt political ensure continuity european monetary union. especially observer outside euro area, give often slow decision-making processes, strength commitment underestimated. we euro area believe continuity euro. and euro area embark necessary reform i outline today, emerge crisis strong ever. thank much attention. bi central bankers’ speech 1 yaseen anwar: international regulatory initiative enhance global financial stability speech mr yaseen anwar, governor state bank pakistan, 9th islamic financial service board (ifsb) summit, host central bank republic turkey, istanbul, 16 may 2012. * * * mr. chairman, secretary general ifsb, distinguish guests, lady gentlemen! it pleasure honor join 9th ifsb summit. i greatful ifsb invite share view “international regulatory initiative enhance global financial stability” esteem audience. in remark today i briefly discus event lead recent reforms, importance regulatory initiative introduce far pakistan’s standing. the crisis hit global financial landscape 2007 remain bad since great depression 1930s. though originate financial market innovative “opaque” financial products, impact virtually every aspect world economy consequence affect masses. the instrument mean disperse financial risk instead allow financial institution general bank system particular become highly leverage ultimately lead financial meltdown. a result, put innovation financial market spotlight, also singled-out regulatory supervisory weakness assess risk associate financial institutions, market innovative financial products. the euro region still face effect financial turbulence form sovereign debt crisis. the fragile gdp growth unemployment data uk, usa crisis hit advance economy still fall short pre-crisis level. on positive note, financial crisis provide valuable lesson improve effectiveness financial system regulation supervision. to policymakers, remind present state international financial system require complete overhaul function market institutions. from supervisory perspectives, show available prudential regulation simply effective prudent enough ensure financial system stability. the lesson learn financial crisis signify far-reaching change structure function financial system institutions. the international regulatory body include financial stability board (fsb), imf bi along national supervisory body develop set regulatory supervisory reform aim increase effectiveness financial sector supervision. furthermore, g-20 leader various summit endorse policy framework recommend fsb bcbs, make country reach consensus selection reform agenda. much focus reform improve soundness bank system, address systemically important financial institution (sifis), develop macroprudential policy tools, strengthen account standards, disclosure requirement crisis resolution framework. we know excessive leverage bank sector, particularly advance country one key reason lead recent crisis. bank take excessive off-balance sheet exposure maintain inferior quality capital base insufficient liquidity buffers. in order avoid situation future, basel committee bank supervision (bcbs) introduce fundamental reform basel ii capital adequacy regime issue number reform enhancement exist basel framework. these enhancement commonly refer basel iii aim 2 bi central bankers’ speech raise level quality capital, introduction leverage ratio, capital conservation buffer, counter cyclical capital buff liquidity coverage net stable fund ratios. similarly, order facilitate national supervisory authority small medium size bank avoid sudden credit crunch already fragile economies, bcbs also set rather relax timeline 2013 2019 adoption basel iii. it therefore expect increase capital requirement consolidation international bank prove major step towards promote financial stability. however since basel iii affect banks, regulator financial sector insurance expect encourage implementation solvency ii insurance company order reduce presence shadow bank restrict risk move towards le regulate entity create regulatory arbitrage. in recent times, important reform measure pursue improve regulation oversight shadow institutions, limit arbitrage opportunities, arise transfer risk relatively le regulate areas/sectors. the regulator therefore, focus minimize regulatory gap shadow bank framework. to bridge gap, financial stability board (fsb) work closely development effective regulatory regime shadow bank system would largely focus a) mitigate spill-over regular shadow bank bank part intermediation chain shadow bank sector, b) reduce buildup leverage shadow bank securitization, c) assess systemic risk pose shadow banking, d) reduce pro-cyclicality incentive pose secure lend (repos) e) reduce vulnerability money market fund possible runs. while focus improve soundness financial institutions, reform emphasize heavily global national systemically important financial institution (sifis) moral hazard pose vulnerable. since initiation reforms, considerable debate identification sifis institution capacity become sifis. factor institution size, suitability interconnectedness include “time vary judgment base assessments” prescribe identification sifis. under new reform agenda, emphasis change too big to fail (tbtf) status sifis devise resolution regime well safe exit mechanism entities. further, supervisory authority focus enhance supervision sifis mitigate financial risk propagate interconnectedness institution cause system-wide distress. similarly multipronged strategy adopt address risk pose g-sifis (global sifis) comprise development new international standard resolution regimes, intensive effective supervision, requirement cross-border cooperation, recovery, resolution planning. the reform also impose cost sifis form increase capital requirement range 1% 2.5% risk weight asset enjoy economy scale scope high loss absorb capacity. a per fsb bcbs assessment, long term economic benefit additional capital requirement term great resilience institution far exceed modest temporary decline gdp implementation horizon. another significant regulatory initiative post-crisis period great focus adopt macroprudential framework along traditional inflation target monetary policy models. central bank regulatory body traditionally use microprudential tool ensure financial system stability increasingly use macroprudential tool along traditional microprudential tool ensure soundness stability financial system. the scope macroprudential policy framework broad include (a) identifying, monitor limit systemic risks, (b) design calibrate instrument execute macroprudential policy (c) build institutional governance arrangements. bi central bankers’ speech 3 though initial stage, macroprudential framework already start deliver key result include broad coverage central bank financial stability analysis monitor systemic risks. furthermore, much work do close data gap come technique ass systemic risk development new macroprudential tool capacity identify systemic risk forward-looking way. the stress test framework also redesign regulator incorporate extreme shock (tail risk) capture systemic risk identify effect macroeconomic vulnerability individual institution well overall financial system. however, challenge task build institutional governance arrangement call additional debate among policy makers. the post crisis reform also stress need improve bring uniformity international account standards. in regard, international account standard board (iasb) financial account standard board (fasb) initiate convergence project account standard practices. the fsb make recommendation converge account standard iasb fasb four area include lend activities, impairment financial assets, address valuation uncertainty fair value measurement guidance offsetting/netting financial instruments. accordingly, iasb fasb jointly develop common impairment model ass record impairment value financial assets/instruments. both board also agree expand scope joint project financial instrument address net financial asset liability statement financial position. furthermore, disclosure requirement also revisit reform agenda. much focus improve disclosure structure credit products, instrument exposure take special purpose entity (spes), on- off- balance sheet item banks. similarly, basel iii also improve disclosure requirement exposure securitization, off-balance sheet exposure exposure asset-backed paper mortgage-backed securities. in recent survey organize fsb find disclosure recommendation improve disclosure practice certain oecd countries. however, felt disclosure spe securitization exposure hedge need certain improvements. the financial crisis resolution framework also revisit post-crisis period scope enhance integrate crisis management resolution framework. similarly, fsb put forward principle cross-border cooperation crisis management include effective coordination amongst national supervisory agencies, central bank government finance ministry make advance preparation manage financial crises. in backdrop recent global financial crises, remuneration director executive bank financial institution lately come scrutiny around globe. in order put thing right direction, grow effort globally address issue relate rationalization compensation financial sector. institution like bis, fsb many national regulator like fsa, apra hkma, among others, make purposeful attempt bring issue excessive remuneration forefront make transparent fair, make enhance disclosure requirements, also draw detail structure requirement guideline determine remuneration compensation executives. fsb issue “principles sound compensation practices” april 2009 relevant “implementation standards” september 2009. both document late adopt consolidate form basel committee bank supervision january 2010. pakistan small, open economy, domestically active financial sector limit interconnectedness advance economies. like many develop countries, face direct impact crisis bank system financial markets. in term bank concentration, top 5 bank (all locally incorporated) account 51% industry 4 bi central bankers’ speech assets; foreign asset system 10.4% total assets. moreover locally-incorporated bank foreign branch don’t significant exposure complex financial asset cause financial meltdown u.s. europe. sbp always require bank meet high capital liquidity standards, exceed international norm several areas. more importantly, strong legal framework, test effectiveness last decade half. sbp successfully restructure number banks, successfully demonstrate problem bank resolution regime. sbp regulator bank sector, introduce implement key regulatory reform prudential measure ensure financial system stability. further, order align regulatory framework international regulatory standard best practices, regularly review evaluate standard issue possible implementation keep view local legal, regulatory economic environment. similarly, sbp take step improve effectiveness macroprudential supervision revise prudential regulation like rationalization loan classification loan loss provision requirement whereby loan loss provision framework make stringent economic boom relax stress economic conditions. in addition, sbp devise stress test mechanism stress test solvency liquidity profile bank system various extreme scenario also conduct macroeconomic stress test macroeconomic indicator set influence financials solvency liquidity profile banks. we also work subject consolidate supervision conglomerate direct indirect hold influence bank shareholding well large exposures. a legal framework formulate consultation coordination regulator non-banking sector i.e., security exchange commission. we believe framework provide overarch supervisory control major stakeholder financial services. additionally, disclosure standard bank revise make performance bank transparent management bank accountable. while regulatory reform agenda pursue vigorously policy maker regulatory body across globe likely strengthen financial system may possibly instrumental prevent financial crisis foreseeable future, history say reform initiate crisis could prevent next crisis time nature dimension crisis different early ones. this suggest may fundamental structural problem financial system like risk transfer rather risk sharing, development speculative product name risk management instrument (derivatives), allow unprecedented growth financial sector without comparable growth real sector etc. incidentally, key feature principle islamic finance belief risk sharing, encourage growth financial sector tandem real sector prohibit investment speculative activities. i would thus suggest national international supervisory authority objectively evaluate potential islamic finance principle mitigate existential risk face financial system. i would also request islamic finance scholar practitioner reach conventional counterpart highlight potential islamic finance system address issue face financial system. finally, i reiterate every crisis bring opportunity, upon u benefit it. let crisis one whose lesson help u improve soundness stability international domestic financial systems. thank you. bi central bankers’ speech 1 stefan ingves: financial crisis financial regulation – think five turbulent year speech mr stefan ingves, governor sverige riksbank chairman basel committee bank supervision, swedish economics association, stockholm, 13 june 2012. * * * palmstruch bank estate realm in 1656, johan palmstruch found sweden’s first bank, stockholm banco. in 1661, facilitate handle money, palmstruch launch first banknotes. they initially successful. but end bank failure palmstruch become tempt issue many banknote relation underlie value deposit bank. in response failure, riksdag resolve form bank estate realm 1668. this bank late rename riksbank today world’s old central bank. palmstruch’s story illustrate importance price stability – also risk financial instability. today, i would like discus financial crisis financial regulation perspective national economy. i want explain value orderly well-reasoned financial regulation prevention financial crises. bank normal companies. for one thing, bank crisis result large cost entire economy. the public sector thus obligation towards citizen attempt prevent manage financial crisis best ability. i start touch benefit risk financial system, balance other. i go describe global financial crisis met. follow this, i discus global financial crisis turn euro crisis, role bank play crisis. in final part speech, i try provide answer society good avoid crisis like future. the economic balance benefit risk financial sector i elsewhere describe bank system motorway junction economy. in banks, and, generally, financial system, households’ companies’ income expenditure meet like flow traffic come directions. a robust structure need make interaction proceed smoothly. when lot traffic move high speed, structure must also clear focus safety. the high speed limit, great safety margin must be. bank important national economy the riksbank define financial stability maintenance financial system’s basic function resilience disruptions. the system convert savers’ money productive investments, ensure pay exchange good services, allocate risk among will take risk not. the bank single important provider basic functions. the banks’ income largely consist payment consumer bank specialisation functions. this income also reflect fact bank borrow short term – example wage account – lend long term – example 2 bi central bankers’ speech mortgages. a cheap lend short term long term, bank also earn money way. in comparison company sectors, bank little equity. to extent natural, banks’ core activity borrow money, say take debt. leverage mean bank earn lot money maintain low equity/assets ratios. of course, leverage apply companies, but, see, bank particular reason take great risk companies. vulnerability contagion risk demand special bank regulation the combination banks’ central function high indebtedness create risks. this matter credit risk – risk get money lend back – liquidity risk – risk unable borrow money. the bank vulnerable due high level indebtedness. problem one bank also risk spread banks. this kind contagion happen asset liability side bank’s balance sheet. deposit lend surplus different part world manage global interbank market. the banks’ asset thus largely consist loan banks. the banks’ liability largely consist loan banks. the bank dependent confidence – illustrated, classic form, bank run. rumour bank face problem lead people want take money out, may give bank problem – even problem start with. so bank series characteristic distinguish normal companies. if normal company unable meet payments, file bankruptcy. if bank default payments, consequence financial system – real economy – enormous. this mean difficult let bank go bankrupt, least bank large time troubled. so disciplinary mechanism must find – tough regulation thorough supervision. special legislation cover bank distress also needed. of course, bank regulation primarily way allow public sector safeguard public interest. but regulation bank also way mitigate principal-agent problem bank’s management borrower one hand, bank’s owner lender other. for second category, often difficult expensive monitor risk bank’s asset side. one important aspect bank regulation requirement amount capital bank maintain. a capital adequacy requirement play central part discussion financial stability, i would like examine little depth. there difference private social benefit cost financial regulation demand bank regulation infrequently meet resistance interest party claim regulation expensive. not least, resistance aim high requirement banks’ capital adequacy, interest party claim capital expensive loans. but context, important make distinction private cost social costs. high capital adequacy requirement entail private cost banks. but public sector participant primarily discuss social consequences. bi central bankers’ speech 3 one cornerstone modern financial research basic theory establish modigliani miller 50 year ago.1 this say value company depend company fund – certain assumptions. in principle, model show form fund significant difference debt company private individuals. and is, course – limit liability company basically mean protect owner private consequence company become bankrupt. be able fund business operation borrow is, course, necessary and, cases, effective. in efficient markets, lenders’ risk handle mean interest rate contract clauses. the limit liability company thus historically wealth-generating social institution. nevertheless, example illustrate high cost fund equity matter private social costs. another factor separate cost borrow fund tax system. company may deduct interest loans, pay corporate tax profit equity. but private economic difference – social perspective, difference subsidisation debt-financing preference equity. this specifically apply bank may systemically important – would socially costly allow file bankruptcy. so market often expect state save bank ropes, one way another. these so-called imply guarantee create even great difference social private costs, risk lead bank take even great risks. bank vulnerable, contagious sometimes systemically important. there great difference private social cost-benefit calculations. economic theory empirical experience give u good reason regulate banks. but difference social private cost also make clear many well-motivated social measure meet resistance private interests. the global financial crisis illustrate risk clearly the global crisis painfully demonstrate risk bank activity financial instability. of course, experience crisis lie behind comprehensive agenda regulation develop recent years. so i think i would describe course crisis, authority meet it, lesson believe learned. the risk realise crisis 2007–2009 the factor trigger global financial crisis increase problem u mortgage sector 2007. these problem spread, many mortgage repackaged so-called structure products, sometimes point unrecognisable. these instrument hold number agent – complexity instrument make difficult see agent major minor problems. at time, many bank low equity/assets ratios. when problem spread financial sector, even relatively limit loss could thus lead major problems. the lack transparency weak resilience lead almost-total lack confidence financial institution autumn 2008. bank become hesitant lend other. a bank largely obtain fund loan financial 1 modigliani, f & miller, m h (1958): “the cost capital, corporation finance theory investment”, american economic review 4 bi central bankers’ speech institutions, lack confidence lead drying-up liquidity within financial real economies. the crisis meet somewhat similar way unite states, europe sweden on whole, financial crisis meet similar way oecd countries. the automatic stabiliser put work fiscal policy, many country launch target fiscal policy stimulation measure break fall. the central bank reduce interest rate low levels. almost economy also take measure prevent even deep problem financial sector. in unite states, crisis originated, federal reserve authority provide emergency liquidity assistance bank part financial system. the department treasury’s tarp (troubled asset relief program) purchase problem asset bank financial institutions. the guarantee programme banks’ deposit expanded. in addition, 2009, stress test carry 19 large u bank spring 2009. ten bank deem need new capital, also succeed raising. it seem likely test help restore confidence equity/assets ratio u bank system. in europe, bank important supply capital real economy unite states. so, side atlantic, support channel via bank system great degree. the ecb increase liquidity, partly offer loan long maturities. in addition, ecb support market cover bond government security thereby support bank system euro area. it able prevent european bank encounter serious problems. many small bank – number major bank – force close. these liquidation often carry governmental participation support. the cost government capital contribution guarantee comprehensive. these lie behind large part fiscal policy problem currently face many european states, subject i return to. the critical period swedish bank autumn 2008 spring 2009. the liquidity shortage financial market make difficult bank renew loans. this join threat pose crisis baltic country swedish banks’ exposure there. the consequence value swedish bank security fell drastically demand government security rose. in situation, swedish authority implement series measures:  the swedish national debt office issue extra treasury bill and, practice, let bank exchange mortgage bond liquid government securities.  the government riksdag extend deposit guarantee quickly pass law enable support bank sector.  in addition repo rate cut implemented, riksbank provide liquidity several ways. we lend money long periods, ease policy collateral introduce counterparties supply liquidity bank system. we create swap line federal reserve ecb meet bank system’s need foreign currency. we also contribute crisis management neighbour country create swap line iceland, latvia estonia. finally, also extend emergency loan carnegie kaupthing sverige. bi central bankers’ speech 5 the riksbank doubt consider sweden’s crisis management successful. and analyst also share assessment – including, example, goodhart rochet review riksbank’s work carry last year.2 unlike central banks, also able phase crisis measures. the crisis cost enormous amount the crisis entail huge costs, society whole tax-funded public sector. andrew haldane, executive director financial stability bank england, show crisis cost uk taxpayer 1 per cent gdp. the correspond figure unite state 1 per cent, usd 100 billion.3 eurostat calculate figure eu whole 0.7 per cent, eur 90 billion.4 but figure direct public cost keep financial system le feet. the real social cost crisis significantly higher. financial crisis low output growth path. in addition, part effect permanent, even difficult say large part. a historical estimate cost financial crises, calculate present value, 60 per cent gdp. for global financial crisis, figure considerably higher.5 the bank play important role sovereign debt crisis the bank also central problem succeed global financial crisis, say sovereign debt crisis euro area. a i mentioned, several government europe force manage problem bank sector, often great expense. those country domestic property bubble hit particularly hard. but financial exposure unite state country affect crisis impact bank system several countries. these stress lead financial problem many european bank countries, and, eventually, current sovereign debt crisis. the crisis create vicious circle real, financial public economy the current european sovereign debt crisis origin period 2007. in absence common fiscal policy, budgetary discipline euro area safeguard stability pact. but, 2003, could already see implementation stability pact weak. the financial market also treat euro country homogenous block long time. consequently, warn signal form interest rate differential country absent. when global financial crisis impact often weakly-capitalised bank systems, ability many country support financial system become questioned, crisis become acute. the crisis often describe vicious circle real, financial public economies: weak growth economy lead 2 goodhart, c & rochet, j-c (2011): “an evaluation riksbank’s monetary policy work financial stability 2005-2010”. 3 haldane, a (2010): “the $100 billion dollar question”. 4 this report in, example, european bank federation (2011): “facts figure 2011/2012”. 5 haldane give interval 90–350 per cent global economy, depend assumption extent permanent effects. 6 bi central bankers’ speech problem bank sector; bank problem generate cost state; public sector implement austerity measure maintain credibility, reduce growth. this vicious circle also work opposite direction: problem bank sector spill lend growth, weaken public finance state’s ability back bank system necessary. incidentally, pattern interaction problem financial, real public economy recur throughout history. reinhart rogoff describe economic problem burst speculation bubble lead financial crisis subsequent sovereign debt crisis time last 800 years. development bank system, 2007 so far, european bank regain credibility way u bank 2009 swedish bank 1992 1993. a great deal uncertainty still prevail european bank robust long-term. accord one estimate, total decline value asset european credit market amount eur 184 billion summer 2011. the publication make assessment loss year come could amount eur 200 billion, eur 125 billion would derive loss link government securities.6 the imf calculate effect sovereign debt crisis may amount eur 300 billion.7 even so, european bank sector report large balance sheet total 2010 2008. this reflect fact problem asset still addressed. for long periods, european bank problem obtain fund market. this uncertainty also reflect riksbank’s calculation stress index europe. (figure 1) 6 credit suisse (september 2011): “european banks”. 7 imf (september 2011): global financial stability report. bi central bankers’ speech 7 figure 1: european stress index state support bank sector significant. in addition eur 90 billion direct public expenditure, government central bank pay equivalent 13 per cent gdp, eur 1.6 trillion, emergency liquidity assistance support banks. the total commitment amount triple figure.8 the problem bank sector still address the management present european bank problem contrast way handle swedish bank crisis twenty year ago. of course, although often consider succeed well sweden 1992, due relatively beneficial political environment, rather intellectual superiority. even so, difference illustrate important insight economics – specifically, significance asymmetric information. like central banks, ecb intervene 2008 support liquidity various means, include offer loan long maturities. unlike sweden, extraordinary loan facility continue available. furthermore, ecb support market cover bond government securities. in crisis situation, necessary maintain liquidity among banks. the riksbank swedish authority 2008–2010. in 1992, swedish government issue guarantee banks’ commitment aim preserve confidence swedish bank sector. but guarantee liquidity enough. confidence european bank market still low. few lender prepare lend european bank market term long term. this theory asymmetric information come in. a nobody know certainty bank remain solvent long term, cautious investor 8 european commission (2011): “state aid scoreboard: report state aid grant eu member states, autumn 2011 update”. 8 bi central bankers’ speech treat bank high-risk counterparties – way car buyer akerlof’s “market lemons” treat use car potential wrecks.9 when we, sweden, introduce bank guarantee 1992, win time bank close down, divide recapitalised government assistance. the bank leave robust able regain market’s confidence. this action reduce uncertainty and, course time, contribute keep government expenditure down. in europe, similar measure carry limit extent. this delay linger uncertainty contribute current sovereign debt crisis. before problem bring light deal with, hard see long-term solution european bank sector. a new framework – way forward at time crisis managed, u interest financial market must think ahead build robust framework. the world doesn’t need new 2008. encouragingly enough, take important step towards create structure may prevent new problems. but still lot work do. the crisis teach u lesson risk financial sector obviously, experience authority around world crisis form basis new secure financial framework. academic research also contribute valuable insights. it obvious risk financial sector underestimate global financial crisis. one underestimation concern degree correlation risk individual institutions. but could also argue we, regulatory side, little naive regard risk moral hazard governance banks. to generalise slightly, could say that, 2008, felt quite safe saw risk individual institution look manageable. today, know better. even individually well-diversified bank asset could highly expose macroeconomic risk. in addition, bank largely act other’s counterparties, one bank’s problem easily become another’s. if bank provide loan suddenly long wish continue lending, bank borrow money face problems. and, affect before, bank impact one bank rapidly need sell assets, push prices. to add vicious circle negative effect real, public financial economy i already discussed. to continue generalisations, could also say previously usually believe market discipline enough ensure business incentive would correspond socio-economic efficiency. follow crisis, know case. private economic incentive decision-makers bank strong market discipline always enough achieve transparency effective risk management (to take two examples). the observation u subprime loan often sell credit rat swedish sovereign bond good enough example this. the private benefit – corporate profits, prefer – debt-financing relative equity lead moral hazard. risk pass lender taxpayers. the management bank reward accord return equity. by use risk models, bank 9 akerlof, g (1970): “market ‘lemons’: quality uncertainty market mechanism”, quarterly journal economics. bi central bankers’ speech 9 able keep risk weight low, mean maintain much equity. new framework establish basis insights. here, i briefly explain basel iii – new regulatory framework bank – entails. i also briefly discus think behind macroprudential policy, become something in-word recent years. basel iii increase demand bank the important area global basel iii accord deal quantitative demand capital liquidity place banks. the bank sufficient equity… a financial crisis lead considerable losses, basel committee maintain bank need substantial resilience. so capital requirement increase basel iii, common equity tier 1.10 the minimum requirement banks’ equity set 4.5 per cent risk-weighted asset – double requirement basel ii. a capital conservation buff 2.5 per cent, add counter-cyclical buffer, create strong shock absorber previously existed. i return counter-cyclical buff i discus macroprudential policy. the capital adequacy requirement also complement pure gross solvency measure, mean equity may fall 3 per cent total assets. all all, banks’ capital position strengthen considerably compare previous regulations, contribute boost confidence, individual bank system whole. …and carry clear measure liquidity in light crisis autumn 2008, basel committee decided, first time, quantitative requirement liquidity banks. basel iii work two liquidity measure – one short-term one long-term. the short-term measure base on, principle, every bank sufficient liquid asset survive least 30 days. it difficult consider requirement unreasonable. the long-term measure, principle, limit gap maturity bank’s asset maturity debts. so limit duration risk bank. in end, basel iii implement national legislation the regulation i sketch eventually enter national legislation. they fully implement 2019, several sub-targets way. in eu, basel iii implement refer crr/crd iv.11 those follow ongoing negotiation know country eu institution different view implementation take place eu. an important divide line extent country able stipulate high requirement nationally formulate common eu regulations. 10 basel iii define common equity tier 1 as, principle, share capital retain profit (i.e. previous profit minus dividends). 11 an abbreviation capital requirement regulation capital requirement directive. 10 bi central bankers’ speech the basel committee clear regulation implementation form minimum standard. a know, riksbank authority sweden believe good reason move quickly ahead set high requirement minimum regulation basel iii. our reason swedish bank market distinctive feature entail risk international framework manage bank crisis. although bank live globally, die locally. ultimately, swedish bank responsibility. macroprudential policy become distinct policy area responsibility national bank system lead final point speech: macroprudential policy. the crisis teach u relatively stable institution necessarily add stable system, reason i already discussed. there clear need system perspective. this perspective macroprudential policy. the idea behind macroprudential policy address risk financial system whole thus complement microprudential focus risk individual institutions. the macroprudential policy analysis divide two dimensions: structural cyclical. the structural dimension address concentration risk interlink the structural (or cross-sectional dimension) relate concentration risk link different part financial system give time affect risk crisis hit system whole. i already discuss link financial institution contagion risk entail. exist newly-invented tool propose apply deal structural risks. the former include strict capital adequacy requirement limit activity exposures. the newly-invented tool include plan manage bank crisis (so-called recovery resolution plans), liquidity requirement special capital adequacy requirement institution deem systemically important. work underway within framework basel committee identify globally systemically important bank subject strict capital adequacy requirements. the swedish authorities’ demand high level capital adequacy major swedish bank course example thinking. the cyclical dimension address risk management time the cyclical dimension (also refer dynamic dimension time dimension) relate risk system whole develop time. the crisis period precede clearly illustrate tendency towards exaggerate cyclical behaviour often characterise financial markets. the demand loan usually increase period strong growth, perception risk often appear weaken. when downturn comes, lend tighten many player want sell asset time, aggravate downturn financial real sectors. cyclical risk also meet use exist tool tool especially design purpose. a loan limit impose lender sweden form mortgage cap. although finansinspektionen introduce cap consumer-protection reasons, measure also used, least potentially, counter-cyclical purposes. liquidity requirement also cyclical dimension. the basel iii regulation comprise counter-cyclical buff build good time lend increase fast trend. when downturn comes, authority release buffer, give bank safety margin counteract credit tightening. bi central bankers’ speech 11 macroprudential policy require organisational development the advance macroprudential policy also lead organizational change supervisory work. in increase number countries, individual authorities, authority work collaboration, give direct responsibility macroprudential policy. however, question responsibility macroprudential policy analysis tool always simple. macroprudential policy encompass clear element supervisory central bank activities. i discuss speech nationalekonomiska föreningen year ago. then i make remark separate responsibility monetary macroprudential policy, without coordination, could result game authorities, could lead outcome desire authorities. in unite kingdom, sole responsibility give central bank. a financial policy committee set alongside exist monetary policy committee. such solution course mean coordination two almost parallel committees, although different focus, become important issue. in eu, european systemic risk board (esrb) set ecb frankfurt. central bank supervisory authority represent esrb, central bank majority vote decision made. in sweden, finansinspektionen riksbank set council cooperation macroprudential policy january year. this council discus assessment risk financial system whole discus appropriate risk-prevention measures. the council also discus analysis development tool method area macroprudential policy. the council temporary solution await permanent distribution responsibility macroprudential policy. at present, financial crisis commission work issue. the recently appoint inquiry capital adequacy regulation focus specifically responsibility future counter-cyclical capital buffer. in region, cooperation nordic baltic country also important effort discover manage systemic risks. this cooperation also cover plan preparation deal potential crises. a summary three reflection let conclude i started. palmstruch discover benefit financial system, also experience individual temptation associate irresponsible lend dependent bank operation public confidence. palmstruch also live see state – rather drastically – learn lesson experience. in speech i provide introduction bank financial regulation – bank needed, also risk entail. i argue difference cost-benefit calculation social private level justify strict regulation financial sector declare regulation always meet resistance. i speak global financial crisis, meet become debt crisis euro area. i also speak course take future, why. if i ask sum speech three reflection would follows:  we distinguish economic cost financial regulation social private levels.  problem bank sector cannot resolve unless something them.  bank lend little money little le everybody else’s. now i look forward discuss association. bi central bankers’ speech 1 masaaki shirakawa: the era linkage among asia across pacific ocean remark (via videoconference) mr masaaki shirakawa, governor bank japan, federal reserve bank san francisco conference, san francisco, 11 june 2012. * * * 1. introduction i privilege opportunity speak invaluable conference hold federal reserve bank san francisco. today, i would like talk strengthen linkage among asia across pacific ocean, well challenge finance tackle achieve sustainable growth asia. unfortunately, monetary policy meet schedule day tomorrow allow join san francisco. nonetheless i grateful give opportunity speak way. i realize new linkage across pacific, relate topic i want discus today, form innovative information technology like this. since voyage christopher columbus 1492, economic, cultural political exchange two side atlantic ocean five centuries. since nineteenth century, two side atlantic ocean regard center civilize world. compare long history trans-atlantic linkages, history trans-pacific linkage quite brief. thirty year columbus make voyage, fleet lead ferdinand magellan discover cross pacific ocean year 1520 1521. however, substantive trans-pacific economic exchange begin forty-nine come join california gold rush population u.s. pacific coast increase substantially. the exception manila-acapulco galleon trade, spanish trade ship sail acapulco manila twice year spanish viceroy mexico rule philippines. the big obstacle linkage across pacific gigantic scale ocean. in order sail acapulco manila, spanish people 16th century build large galleon could, whose size much 2,000 ton (chart 1). compare famous mayflower whose size estimate 180 tons, easily imagine exceptionally big spanish galleon were. even modern era, first trans-pacific undersea telegraph cable build 1903, 45 year construction trans-atlantic cable. non-stop trans-pacific flight become widespread 40 year ago, 1970s, boeing 747 “jumbo jets” fully introduce (chart 2). thus, long ago people begin see asia-pacific region economic bloc. indeed, asia-pacific economic cooperation, apec, establish forum government asia-pacific country 1989. although remain geographical distance asia-pacific economies, owe technological innovation far le obstacle economic exchange before, asia-pacific country become able enjoy benefit sit around sea together. apart historical context, last year couple big event remind strong linkage exist within asia across pacific. the first one tragic great east japan earthquake. this massive earthquake severely damage supply chain manufacture japan (chart 3). when factory micro-controllers, integral part automobiles, come halt, resultant shortage substantially affect automobile production line japan also overseas asia unite state (chart 4). in term negative impact supply chains, flood thailand since 2 bi central bankers’ speech last summer also strike production line hard disk drives, disrupt computer manufacture asian economy include japan. these natural disaster reveal strength linkage among asia-pacific economies. another event remind strong linkage across asian-pacific region extremely quick popularization tablet pc smart phones. indeed, see people look smart phone almost everywhere. today’s industrial linkage necessarily take traditional form division labor depict textbook international trade. with new “concepts,” firm become increasingly capable attract wide-ranging resource world bring new concept reality. a show case tablet pcs, asia-pacific region become important “incubator” innovation. an estimate break-down cost apple’s iphone, whose retail price 649 dollars, consist manufacture cost 8 dollars, component cost 188 dollar gross profit margin 453 dollar (chart 5). the concept ipad iphone generate silicon valley. during process turn concept real merchandise, trans-pacific flow goods, human resource financial service directions, development component technologies, manufacture process distribution channels. in processes, silicon valley company also many asian firm china, korea, taiwan japan involved. 2. asia global economy asia act growth pole enhance resilience global economy now, let briefly illustrate economic growth asia-pacific region strengthen linkage among country region, basis discussion. the economic growth asia continuously exceed global economy recent years. indeed, relative strength asian economy pronounce since global financial crisis. accord imf world economic outlook, asian growth, stand 5.9 percent 2011, expect continue grow relatively high rate 6 percent 2012. meanwhile, growth advance economies, stand 1.6 percent 2011, expect remain low 1.4 percent 2012 (chart 6). accord imf, asian economy expect increase share global economy 30% 40% year 2030 current trend asian growth maintain (chart 7). the asian share global economy also increase term trade (chart 8). in regard, japan’s “white paper international economy trade” publish 2011 provide insightful analysis global trade structure. this paper divide world six areas, is, nafta, eu, asean, mercosur, china japan (chart 9). accord analysis, share trade advance economy nafta, eu japan total much around 60 percent 1990, figure decline little 30 percent 2008. on hand, share trans-pacific trade among nafta, asean, mercosur, china japan exclude nafta japan increase around 25 percent 1990 around 45 percent 2008 (chart 10). this fact illustrate dramatic development trade network among asian-pacific region. the growth asia lead global economy even global financial crisis. despite burst house bubble u.s. financial turmoil failure lehman brothers, global economy fall deep prolong slump experience great depression 1930s (chart 11). a background resilience global economy, let point contribution make emerge economies, especially emerge asia, well various policy response take government central bank worldwide. with strong growth emerge economies, bi central bankers’ speech 3 global economy multiple growth “pillars”, fortify resilience. needle say, may appropriate overemphasize so-called “de-coupling” globalize economy. nonetheless, endogenous economic development associate rise live standard asian emerge economy surely continue enhance robustness global economy. asia new frontier global economic growth i would also like emphasize high growth asia, enhance resilience global economy, also expand new growth frontier non-asian economies. a many advance country face common issue age population fiscal imbalances, enhance growth potential become imminent challenge countries.1 in addition, solution european debt problem ultimately rest ability effort peripheral country boost productivity growth sufficiently. in regard, asian economy could offer great potential, vast pool human resource become major high-tech suppliers. moreover, emerge asia expect substantially grow consumption markets. accord industry survey conduct early year, china surpass u.s. become world’s large smart phone market shipments. to exploit asia’s potential, advance economy build systematic productive linkage asian economies, instead view asia simply labor-intensive production base. case point japanese retailers, medicare service industry private education industry use focus domestic markets. they formulate global business strategy target broad asian market. moreover, environmental energy-saving engineer technologies, advance economy could contribute alleviate growth constraint associate rapid rise live standard asia. it would also fruitful advance economy consider could make use asia’s human resource supply capacity overcome problem associate age population. establish strategic coordinate linkage asian economy would expand growth frontier thus bring “win-win” relationships, would beneficial asia rest world. 3. economic development financial stability asia asia’s strength challenge term finance next, i would like talk relationship economic development asia, new linkage role finance, indeed main topic conference. a mention earlier, asian economy recover relatively smoothly swiftly global financial crisis remain drive force world economy. a one major factor behind resilience asia, i would like point overall stability asian financial systems. in view, three major factor behind financial stability asia. first, asia’s economic fundamental relatively strong. most emerge asian country excess domestic save fiscal condition also good advance economies. the external balance country generally remain surplus. 1 regard issue associate demographic changes, see shirakawa, “demographic change macroeconomic performance: japanese experiences” (opening remark 2012 boj-imes conference) [2012] 4 bi central bankers’ speech against background, capital inflow asia quickly rebound sudden contraction initial stage crisis. second, business model asian financial institution different european u.s. institutions. in asia, traditional bank business play major role financial intermediation, “originate distribute” business model, one major cause financial crisis, never popular. moreover, asian banks’ exposure structure product limited. third, base asian experience financial crisis 1990s, many asian country include japan already make various effort enhance stability resilience financial systems, strengthen banks’ capital build financial safety nets. now advance economy focus “macro-prudential” policies. in regard, asian economies, base experience financial crisis 1990, already make use various macro-prudential tool loan-to-value ratio curb excessive real estate loans. a such, asian economy move ahead advance economy term implement macro-prudential policies. in spite relative stability, asian financial system also face challenges. one policy challenge foster development capital markets, especially corporate bond markets. in emerge asia, would huge finance need build social infrastructure public transportation, energy supply communication networks. in view length finance need build infrastructure well risk associate possible maturity mismatches, well-functioning capital market, well credit intermediation banks, play important role long-term domestic financing. moreover, co-existence different finance tool bank borrow corporate bond could enhance resilience financial systems. in regard, asia already take various step include introduction asian bond fund. japan’s possible contribution toward financial development asia on front, i firmly believe japan able contribute asian financial stability well development financial infrastructure asia, two reasons. first, japan’s financial system, whole, stable resilient. give japan experience financial crisis 1990s, various measure already take strengthen financial system. partly due efforts, japan’s financial system remain mostly stable, survive successive event failure lehman brother financial institutions, great east japan earthquake european debt problem. to date, internationally active japanese bank generally set aside sufficient capital, position contribute, financial intermediaries, satisfy asian need various financial services. second, internationally active japanese bank also japanese non-financial firms, establish linkage asian economy core overseas business strategies. internationally active japanese financial institution allocate resource asian business part global strategy increase lend asia. they also explore various business m&a finance asia. for example, japanese “mega” banks’ loan asia share total overseas loan continuously increasing, reach around 30 percent (chart 12). recently, european bank streamline exposure emerge economies, japanese bank fill part void create “deleveraging” european bank (chart 13). such japanese banks’ activity would certainly contribute stable financial intermediation asia. bi central bankers’ speech 5 also japanese non-financial firms, economic development asia also provide new growth frontier. in view widen gap save investment japan’s corporate sector due sluggish growth domestic investment opportunities, japanese non-financial firm expand direct investment m&a activity emerge asia explore business frontier seek high rate return. such activity confine large companies, medium-sized manufacturer service provider also involved. in 2009, aggregate amount japanese firm’s direct investment asia exceed amount invest european union (chart 14). such activity japanese financial institution firm would contribute sustainable growth asia facilitate steady flow risk capital productive investment asia, include japan itself. on hand, order japanese economy enhance growth potential, critical financial institution firm improve productivity profitability take advantage growth potential asia term supply demand. 4. toward new “win-win” relationship in view strengthen linkage among asia across pacific, i would like highlight three task policymakers order asia rest world achieve sustainable growth establish win-win relationship broad perspective. first all, i would like reiterate importance asian country continue effort maintain economic stability strengthen fundamental policy framework. a asia’s share global economy increases, possible impact global economy stem fluctuation asian economy policy adopt country asia could become pronounced. in term economic fundamentals, emerge asia, lag bite behind advance economies, also require tackle issue age population near future. for example, work age population china expect start decrease around 2020 (chart 15). how effectively promptly country respond issue, enjoy “population bonus”, could significant implication economic fundamentals. regard growth constraint spaceship earth, policy effort aim protect environment save energy would also become important. a emerge economies’ share global economy increases, growth expectation global economy often lead rise commodity prices, constrain policy conduct emerge economy intensify inflationary pressures. in regard, policy effort environmental protection energy save alleviate growth constraint enhance emerge countries’ resilience fluctuation commodity prices. i believe japanese firms, strength environment-related technology, could make valuable contribution front. from policy framework perspective, also imperative influential economy maintain sufficient exchange rate flexibility. under economic financial globalization, inflexibility exchange rate may trigger abrupt change international capital flow increase burden monetary prudential policies. in regard, i truly welcome recent effort asian country make enhance exchange rate flexibility. second, regard financial stability policy, still struggle question reconcile borderless nature globalize financial service national nature financial intermediary locate within border home-country sovereign state. if look first half decade since 2000, western nation since end 19th century world war i, see period economic prosperity 6 bi central bankers’ speech almost always coincide big wave globalization. look back history, cannot avoid progress globalization, would sure way raise growth potential advance economy face unfavorable demographic emerge asia try raise live standard further. a financial aspect large economic globalization, cannot escape financial globalization either. moreover, since money scalable move beyond border instantly extremely low cost, little wonder financial globalization go future. on hand, financial service provider cannot free home country’s “nationality” matter far financial service globalized, long current system national border maintained. there debate whether provider could save emergency cost taxpayer specific jurisdiction. ultimately, perceive quality debt issue financial institution cannot separate entirely credibility home country resilience regulatory supervisory framework. at least, order perform function sufficiently, financial service provider must back public confidence institutional framework home country’s effective supervision. in fact, see sign “re-nationalization” fund current financial environments. at present, initiative g20 financial stability board, policymakers discuss various issue stem tension financial globalization sovereign states, cross-border resolution globally active financial institutions. indeed, issue quite big challenge policymakers now. third, also important promote mutual understand different national economy financial structures. a i already mentioned, resilience asian economy play key role prevent global economy fall deep prolong slump. a fact illustrates, global economy would vulnerable shock consist homogeneous country term economic structure policy framework hybrid system embrace diversity. in spite development information technology strengthen linkage among global economy, various “differences” among country region likely continue exist least foreseeable substantially-long period time. nonetheless, creative concepts, innovation source growth emerge new linkage economic diversity. since live world diversify economies, also various form linkages, range ultimate form currency union much loose ties. thus, important policymakers seek appropriate form combination linkages, take difference economic structure nations’ development stage fully account. in addition, occasion international discussions, constructive dialogue need foster mutual understand difference learn one another. the economy advance country tend affect common economic cycles, thus, policy discussion inevitably tend focus similar theme “great moderation”. in regard, development asian emerge country add diversity world economy, fresh viewpoint enable policymakers explore new frontier policy debates. 5. conclusion in speech today, i seek explain current think give deepen linkage among asia across pacific. before conclude speech, i would like refer one issue might need pay attention financial linkage within economic area continue deepen. that is, issue time zone differences. bi central bankers’ speech 7 you watch live, slight time lag video signal transmit tokyo san francisco. that said, 12th june me, tomorrow you, i actually talk “the island day after” international date line. for you, speech deliver 11th june, diary show important speech schedule 12th june. we communicate across pacific real time, date mind different. a date speech, i rely secretary ensure misunderstanding. however, come finance, date mean lot more. suppose i commit send money two day now. should money reach recipient 13th, 14th? moreover, side take account mutual weekends, 4 day week transaction processed. these problem could probably solve lay rule beforehand. still, complicate issue could arise term risk management, include bankruptcy procedure set motion. the foreign exchange settlement risk associate time zone difference substantially reduce cl settlement. nonetheless, many currency emerge economy yet available cl settlement (chart 16). the example i use today seemingly small problem. nonetheless, solve practical problem one one world become close seamless economy global economy include asia-pacific region become able realize full potential. in regard, i sincerely hope discussion hold conference constitute another step right direction. thank attention. 8 bi central bankers’ speech bi central bankers’ speech 9 10 bi central bankers’ speech bi central bankers’ speech 11 12 bi central bankers’ speech bi central bankers’

hamilton, 12 june 2012. * * * thank insurance day kind invitation join event. it’s great pleasure back bermuda opportunity speak also spend bite time meet bermuda firm former colleague bermuda monetary authority. in addition obvious personal interest bermuda, clearly close tie bermuda irish insurance market. a number bermuda insurance company significant presence ireland use base pan european activity. and broadly, wear hat member european insurance regulator eiopa management board, close tie bermuda eu. bermuda important source risk capital insurance service european union, important source diversification risk provide benefit wholesale ultimately retail consumer across european union. for example, 37% emea property cat risk place bermuda company accord recent aon benfield data. france, germany, spain benelux place 18–25% total premium bermuda companies. it therefore encourage see spite difficult operate condition last year bermuda insurance market continue play important role internationally bermuda monetary authority continue make good progress drive enhance regulatory regime. what i propose today start brief update solvency ii implementation. secondly, i want choose 3 particular aspect solvency ii consider bite detail. and, finally, i would like take opportunity say word equivalence process mean bermuda. by time almost everyone insurance industry chairman secretaries, underwriter loss adjuster indeed europe bermuda, u elsewhere, hear solvency ii. it new regulatory framework set risk base solvency requirement insurance reinsurance company operate within european union. it organise around three pillars: first pillar set quantitative solvency requirement cover aspect insurance business, include asset risk prescribe eligible form capital. the second pillar aim qualitative requirement concern risk management governance standards. and third pillar design encourage market discipline require high level transparency disclosure regulate firms. this framework clear improvement current european solvency i rule book. unlike solvency i, risk based, cover asset side balance sheet provide incentive investment risk management, include use internal models. importantly, found balance sheet base market consistent economic value. solvency ii single piece legislation rather interconnect group law european rules. the solvency ii directive adopt supplemental piece legislation know omnibus ii conclude process approval europe make important amendment core solvency ii law. in addition directive framework supplement significant raft call level 2 regulation eiopa, european insurance authority, promulgate wide range bind technical standards, guidance material flesh detail regulatory framework, often know level 3 measures. 2 bi central bankers’ speech this add certainly highly complex corpus rules. while solvency ii many benefit distinct improvement current european framework, complexity certainly source concern. regulators, large firm certainly small firm struggle degree assimilate implement significant scale change. this complexity indeed impact implementation timetable directive. the process finalise omnibus ii unfortunately delay brussels process, knock effect squeeze time available consult on, issue implement range secondary rules. the current target member state government domestically implement european framework 30th june 2013 directive come force insurance firm start 2014. while timeline certainly challenge even slip little, certain solvency ii get close significant implication insurance industry europe globally. there lot dimension solvency ii could discuss impact industry, i would like take opportunity focus three brief time available. first, word impact solvency ii life industry, big open issue remain final negotiation directive relate rules. at question impact market consistent economic valuation principle life industry business model, particularly respect provision long term guarantees. industry express concern prescribe fix common discount rate time require mark-to-market change asset values, long term guarantee product particular could expose spike solvency requirement time short term market volatility. similar relate concern exist regard impact mark-to-market requirement asset generally light recent experience sovereign debt particular. again: short-term concern volatility drive mark-to-market change fix income portfolio insurance company could lead volatility solvency buffers. this cause concern among observer number fronts. first worry framework discourage provision long term guarantee products, provide useful source save investment retail consumers. second worry framework may inherently pro-cyclical exacerbate pressure dispose asset time increase market volatility. these real reasonable concern tackle final negotiation directive. discussion underway adapt framework allow adjustment applicable discount rate certain match asset liabilities. also, call counter cyclical premium develop – allow adjustment discount rate offset excess short-term volatility certain aspect fix income portfolio. there number different technical approach achieve end ever devil detail, desire outcome framework seek square circle provide risk sensitive solvency framework, time permit continue provision guarantee product avoid dangerous pro-cyclical effects. while highly technical debate detail discount valuation requirement particular portfolio asset back certain insurance products, i think important highlight one key outstanding issue significant impact development long-term save product relevance current turbulence euro sovereign debt markets. the second subject i would like mention briefly internal models. solvency ii permit insurance company propose use internal model alternate directive’s standardise formula calculate solvency requirements. the framework calibrate provide incentive firm invest develop sophisticate risk management. this welcome encouraged. but risk manage well. solvency ii’s use internal model broadly similar basel framework fact provide even great scope firm modelling, basel set certain bi central bankers’ speech 3 minimum correlation assumption model solvency ii not. there clearly strong incentive insurance company optimise use capital directive adoption models. this perhaps strong general insurance market life market due anticipate relative strengthen solvency standards. internal model are, however, subject supervisory approval, course approval insurance company’s board. to mind important approval process doesn’t get bogged detail endless documentation review stay focus key driver overall solvency calculation arise use model. regulator industry spend lot time argue detail calibration specific risk factor solvency ii framework. but solvency requirement different line business different aspect risk combine overall solvency requirement swing significantly result judgement make regard correlation diversification. if big swing number occur, forefront regulatory approval process challenge insurance companies’ boards. diversification course inherent part insurance business model aware, risk

largely positive, albeit work areas. the protract process solvency ii implementation europe fact give time bermuda country adapt framework order ready. follow assessment eiopa ultimate decision rest

understand drive force behind systemic financial crisis speech mr vítor constâncio, vice-president european central bank, 2011 bernácer prize award ceremony honour mr lasse heje pedersen, madrid, 28 june 2012. * * * lady gentlemen, it great pleasure address word honour year’s winner 2011 bernácer prize, professor lasse pedersen new york university. the development global financial market witness past year unprecedented nature raise number challenge policy maker central bank alike. in time like important ever use advice bright talented scholar order find answer complex question develop effective tool real-world applicability order combat potentially adverse effect financial instability without jeopardize primary mandate medium-term price stability. without doubt, lasse pedersen one lead mind re-shaped think financial markets, contribution past decade greatly improve understand drive force behind systemic financial crisis propagation liquidity shock across market throughout economy. naturally, academic research play important role central bank general provide foundation conduct monetary policy impact real economy. the eurosystem exception naturally find constant exchange global research community form research seminar conference well regular academic visitors. moreover ecb regularly fund policy-relevant academic research via lamfalussy fellowship. in 2010, eurosystem launch macroprudential research network mar objective develop core conceptual frameworks, model tool would provide research support order improve macro-prudential supervision european union. lasse pedersen’s research focus role liquidity financial markets. while much classical theory asset price assume frictionless world, work depart idealisation acknowledge real-world feature institutional structure way capital invest around globe profound implication determination asset price well stability financial system itself. today, trade financial market – stocks, bonds, currencies, derivative – take place individual rather financial institution bank investment firms. this important implication function market introduce several important type frictions. a witness past years, many entity large, least term balance sheets. besides give rise too-big-to-fail problem heart current financial crisis, size financial institution profound implication way investment portfolio construct asset traded, make large difference whether agent want buy sell 100 share 100,000 shares. for large investors, impact action market price long negligible potentially incur large transaction cost due “market impact”, fluctuation market liquidity – ease security transform cash – become first-order concern. base real-world insight, acharya pedersen 2 bi central bankers’ speech develop liquidity adjust capital asset price model (capm),1 show investor require compensation bear risk associate asset’s fundamental also command additional premium relate asset’s liquidity risk. their theory strongly support numerous empirical study explain real-world phenomenon episode flight liquidity witness past years. another salient feature financial institution feature prominently current financial crisis leverage. in fact, market participant finance entire trade position equity rather fund part investment pledge security collateral repurchase agreement asset-backed commercial paper. this imply asset price also affect fund liquidity, concept refer ease security use raise outside capital. in year precede 2007–2008 financial crisis, leverage financial sector build steadily fuel high demand dollar-denominated short-term debt conjunction low interest rates. when first rumour problem market sub-prime mortgage begin spread, uncertainty exposure potential loss directly translate fund liquidity problems. in equally rigorous elegant contribution, pedersen co-author markus brunnermeier – winner 2008 bernácer prize – show shock fund liquidity market liquidity reinforce culminate downward spiral give rise financial instability systemic risk.2 if fund condition worsen, initial loss leverage position may lead force selling, temporary excess supply security cannot absorb liquidity provider precisely speculative capital become costly. in turn, reduce market liquidity lead low price increase volatility, thus create negative feedback effect development imply tighten fund liquidity, culminate fire sale on. the event around collapse u house market 2008 lehman bankruptcy underline central role vicious circle propagation shock across market market participants. uncertainty exposure potential counterparties lead temporary breakdown interbank market, thereby disrupt banks’ ability manage liquidity additionally distort transmission monetary policy. because many investors, include hedge funds, heavily rely bank funding, problem ultimately spill many asset market liquidity provider force become liquidity consumers, lead market virtually cease exist others saw repeat failure famous law one price, instrument (nearly) identical cash flow trade different prices.3 another important contribution lasse pedersen co-author relate measurement systemic risk development indicator like marginal expect shortfall (mes) financial institution jointly leverage use estimate systemic risk.4 fortunately, lasse pedersen’s research help understand phenomenon also provide exact prescription policy maker improve market stability break vicious downward spirals. in particular, research 1 viral acharya lasse h. pedersen (2005) “asset price liquidity risk”, journal financial economics, 77, 375–410. 2 markus brunnermeier lasse h. pedersen (2009) “market liquidity fund liquidity”, the review financial studies, 22, 2201–2238. 3 nicolae garleanu lasse h. pedersen

acharya, v., t. cooley, m. richardson, i. walter (editors), “ regulate wall street” , john wiley & son bi central bankers’ speech 3 prescribe intervention aim improve fund liquidity measure break mention downward spiral restore market liquidity, thereby avoid failure illiquid solvent financial institutions. additionally, show measure broaden universe acceptable collateral adjust margin requirement serve important monetary policy tool time protract liquidity complementary interest rate policy. in line this, european central bank has, many monetary authority around globe, adopt several non-standard measure effort combat potential market breakdown i think fair say success unquestionable. while considerable progress make respect understand causes, consequence propagation systemic financial crises, knowledge far sufficient. further advance particularly need field macro-prudential policy regulation, eurosystem aim continue contribute fill knowledge gap, particular via macroprudential research network involvement european systemic risk board. i confident lasse pedersen continue make extraordinary contribution come year hereby extend best congratulation win 2011 bernácer prize. i thank kind attention. bi central bankers’ speech 1 rodrigo vergara: chile’s late monetary policy report financial stability report presentation mr rodrigo vergara, governor central bank chile, monetary policy report financial stability report, finance commission honorable senate republic, santiago de chile, 18 june 2012. the monetary policy report june 2012 financial stability report first half 2012 find http://www.bcentral.cl/eng/index.asp * * * introduction mr. president finance commission senate, senator josé garcía, senator member commission, ladies, gentlemen. i grateful invitation board central bank chile share view recent macroeconomic financial developments, prospect implication monetary financial policy making. these view contain detail monetary policy report june 2012 financial stability report first half 2012. for several quarter world economy suffer constant swings. we say time cause consequence financial crisis 2008 yet resolved. thank combination economic policy response healthy economy financial systems, emerge world succeed mitigate effect resume growth trajectory. but develop world, especially eurozone, unable regain strength. we see continue tension world financial markets, doubt future behavior global economy, together risk appearing, disappear reappear again. a time passed, evident sign improvement economies’ outlook, problem exacerbated. weak growth need households, firms, bank government reduce debts, create vicious circle hamper solution macroeconomic financial problem face advance economies. certainly, case unite state different case eurozone, institution way solve internal imbalance different. in eurozone, situation economy hardly sustainable. however, differences. while economic block whole practically balance current account, vary one country next. germany keep excess save several years, result current account surplus, many peripheral country post deficit (figure i). exchange rate wage rigidity help resolve imbalance within region. overall, past quarter part necessary adjustment take place. germany increase import peripheral europe, cut export countries. solve imbalance eurozone take time easy. any solution costly, without doubt. the event recent week confirm crisis far imbalance persist develop world keep financial market stress. the reappearance risk tension see reflection that, deepen difference behavior world economy (table 1). thus, today face significant risks. after improvement first quarter year, condition eurozone relapse financial market experience tension level last december worse. the baseline scenario march monetary policy report assume temporary, limit friction would occur, although warn exist risks. in recent month risk resurfaced. there 2 bi central bankers’ speech new debate possible disorderly resolution eurozone crisis. several economy question political support fiscal austerity measures. economic financial condition spain worsen risk premium record highs, despite announce capitalization bank industry. in addition, still doubt whether country need similar action. financial market respond increase risk premium great appetite safe assets. stock price fall across board, volatility up, dollar appreciate interest rate government bond economy perceive safe drop record lows. at time, commodity price fall sharply, especially oil. a late 2011, main effect tension emerge economies, aside low commodity prices, depreciation currencies, fall stock price increase risk premium external bonds. chile spared, although statistical close report effect limited. compare march, peso/dollar parity depreciate somewhat 5 percent; stock market, measure select price index ipsa pesos, lose 7 percent, sovereign premium chilean cd rise nearly 40 basis points. money markets, meanwhile, operate normally. in contrast develop world, chile domestic output demand still strong. in first quarter, y-o-y gdp growth exceed march’s forecasts. however, quarter-to-quarter term lose strength respect late 2011 grow accord trend. inflation low expected, which, combine drop international fuel prices, reduce risk short-term evolution. in general, medium-term inflationary risk still latent domestic market remain tight. in context, board keep monetary policy interest rate (mpr) 5 percent since january, condition future movement implication domestic external condition inflation outlook. chile healthy position confront deterioration global scenario. we build economic institution allow u reach substantial level growth, necessary tool mitigate adverse shock face economy. but immune. in globalize world today, change condition rapidly propagate economies. the movement financial market i mention ago proof this. try isolate rest world would useless, harmful long run. the important thing u capacity shield negative event and, necessary, take action reduce effect country. we already lehman brother crisis hit 2008. we couldn’t prevent global recession affect economy, succeed foster fast, sustainable recovery 2009 onwards. in case, domestic macroeconomic situation vary four years. today, inflation 3 percent, gdp grow near-trend rate mpr neutral range. this provide room respond monetary policy necessary, although time magnitude measure evaluate special prudence light actual effect external development economy. our financial system, meanwhile, solid resilient sudden change international economy. the board central bank firmly determine adopt measure need mitigate adverse effect worsen external scenario, also must careful allow medium-term inflationary risk end trigger unwanted increase inflation. in baseline scenario believe likely, world economy remain weak give u le impulse expect month ago. although chilean economy affected, continue perform well. inflation stay around 3 percent. but external risk face say baseline scenario significant. let look set detail, examine risk identify monetary policy report financial stability report. bi central bankers’ speech 3 macroeconomic scenario a i said, external impulse chilean economy next two year weak forecast march. the poor performance develop world – several quarter already – compound early sign weakness emerge economies, thus exacerbate risk come abroad. i want begin develop world. in eurozone, new financial tension tighten credit constraints, ongoing fiscal measure contribute boost growth near term. the recession foresee region year deep previously estimated. the develop economy grow slowly. the u.s. fall short march forecasts, due slow recovery labor market, real-estate sector still unable leave subprime crisis behind, household deleveraging process continue course, little additional room apply measure boost growth. but, compare march, big difference term world growth lie emerge world. in contrast 2011, main emerge economy lose dynamism. some indicator china suggest decline growth rate sharp forecast march. this prompt adoption expansionary fiscal monetary policies, india follow suit. the rest emerge asia feel effect low growth china, u.s. europe export manufacture industry. in latin america, although heterogeneity, poor performance brazil first quarter stand out. other economies, like mexico, peru, colombia chile remain strong, sustain domestic demands. this world scenario weak economy reduce inflationary pressure due low oil price trigger relaxation monetary policy several emerge economies. the baseline scenario forecast chile’s trade partner grow 3.6 3.9 percent 2012 2013, respectively, little le foresee previous monetary policy report. this also result low price copper oil expect march. in summary, baseline scenario consider reduce external impulse associate slow world growth somewhat tighten external finance conditions. it also consider new stress episode occur external financial market (table 2). a observe recent months, event trigger negative news come fiscal accounts, economic growth bank situation eurozone. the feeble external outlook contrast performance chile’s domestic demand output last quarters. in first quarter year, gdp grow 5.6 percent, exceed forecast march monetary policy report. in quarter-on-quarter terms, expand trend rates, lead board estimate output gap still narrow. this view base fact that, although labor market continue show sign tight, sign intensified: employment reduce rate expansion, unemployment rate settle low level y-o-y growth wages, still strong, moderate lately. in first quarter, domestic demand grow somewhat le output, private consumption investment still robust. inflation behave favorably past months, march’s forecasts. this, combine oil price fall external markets, reduce risk envision short-term trajectory. still, service component inflation continue large contributor increase, medium-term risk remain present, due close output gap tight labor market (figure 2). market inflation expectation moderate short term remain around 3 percent projection horizon. the baseline scenario foresee gdp grow year 4 5 percent, range forecast march. although economy outgrow forecast first quarter, worsen external condition result output slow deeply 4 bi central bankers’ speech forecast march. still, gdp growth drift substantially away trend, board estimate 5 percent. this projection also consider y-o-y growth consumption moderate further, line decelerate labor income le expansionary lend condition month ago. interest rate consumer loan rise lately, coincide decline y-o-y growth credits. in addition, survey lend condition first quarter reveal great constraint supply consumer loan financial institutions. demand consumer loan continue rise, accord survey. for investment, persistent construction infrastructure component – largely associate execution mine energy project – suggest remain strong come quarters. accordingly, measure real terms, amount 26.9 percent gdp 2012, 26.2 percent gdp 2011. the effect worsen external scenario visible mainly inventories. the baseline scenario estimate 2012 inventory percentage gdp vary le 2011, reflect inventory adjustment enterprise carry uncertainty come abroad. consumption investment also partly affect worsen global conditions, main determinant aforesaid factors. all element combine depict scenario 2012 domestic demand grow le 2011, although still fast output. the baseline scenario foresee current account balance payment post deficit 3.1 percent gdp year, is, big 2011, somewhat small forecast march. despite low price assume copper weak domestic demand, expect adjustment domestic demand plus drop oil price behind small deficit (table 3). the board estimate y-o-y cpi core inflation continue hover around target end projection horizon, time second quarter 2014 (figure 3). this trajectory assume wage adjust reflect productivity inflation target. a work assumption, real exchange rate assume remain fairly unchanged, estimate within range believe consistent long-term fundamentals. finally, baseline scenario also us work assumption that, short term, mpr stable. the baseline scenario reflect event believe likely information hand statistical close report. there risk scenarios, however, which, materialized, may reshape macroeconomic environment – cases, significantly – and, therefore, may alter course monetary policy. on opportunity, evaluate alternative scenarios, board estimate risk balance downward bias output, unbiased inflation. the great risk originate abroad, situation eurozone. this complex development recent month revive possibility extreme scenarios. most importantly, economic financial problem region could work costly disorderly manner, example greece leave monetary union. despite small size within eurozone, outcome could inflict severe damage rest world contagion big european economies. the macroeconomic financial situation spain continue spur doubts, reflect steady increase risk premiums. the lack clarity capitalization plan announce spanish bank industry, difficulty meet fiscal target give gloomy growth outlook impact sovereign debt still cause concern. similarly, apprehension increase country region, italy, bulk public debt slow growth. the couple risk premium spain, italy france provide evidence risk. also possible reversal current tensions, instance agreement favor compliance adjustment measure agree new announcement support economic authority zone, bi central bankers’ speech 5 could buy time advance necessary structural changes. the outcome yesterday’s election greece winner political option whose program line country stay eurozone, mitigate somewhat eventuality greek default trigger crisis rest eurozone. however, still premature draw conclusions. but undoubtedly come day bring important news must watchful effect economy. additionally, event bring new information. more detail capitalization plan spain’s bank ec meet late month may shed light new bailout measures. other risk world growth prospect beyond eurozone. doubt persist u.s. transition sustainable medium- long-term debt trajectory proceed. special attention due possibility political difficulty reach agreement fiscal front could trigger automatic adjustment foresee towards 2013, hurt gdp growth. in emerge world, sharp and/or long chinese slowdown foresee baseline scenario cannot rule out, hind growth economy due weight global economy, affect commodity price significantly. domestically, aforesaid, medium-term risk inflation still present. the growth rate domestic demand output dropped, albeit fast expected. although board estimate output gap narrow further, output take dynamic path, pressure push inflation demand monetary policy response. domestic demand outgrow gdp last two years, thus widen current account deficit. households’ save low compare early years, corporate save decrease past year investment record-high levels. if domestic demand become dynamic, could amplify current account deficit. this could risky scenario weak world growth. a note financial stability report, aggregate solvency liquidity chilean economy remain stable. this important, consider banks’ enterprises’ access external credit could hamper deterioration global financial environment. in case, despite impact external volatility price assets, financial market operate normally. in context, i would like highlight need continue advance initiative strengthen regulatory supervisory framework. one case bill reform insurance company currently debate congress. the banks’ solvency liquidity index stable first half. in context good rents, core capital hover around 10 percent regulatory capital – measure risk-weighted asset – around 14 percent. meanwhile, since last financial stability report bank industry increase long-term debt certificates, medium-sized bank pursue strategy attract retail deposits. another favorable development great diversification bank different type credit abroad. also worth note hoard liquid asset foreign currency. the stress test present financial stability report show bank industry’s current capitalization level allow cushion episode characterize gdp slowdown, high finance cost local currency exchange rate depreciation associate materialization external risk scenario. a household debt, note that, aggregate, borrow increase tandem disposable income. this translate fairly stable aggregate debt indicators, whether compare debt level financial burden disposable income wage mass. corporate debt show similar pattern, increase along economic activity, without widespread deterioration financial indicators. thus, view chilean financial system suffer material increase systemic vulnerabilities. 6 bi central bankers’ speech however, financial stability report also identify element might source risk must closely monitored. the construction real estate sector strong lately. activity real estate market strong sale counterpart, house commercial use. while vacancy rate commercial sector remain low, expect substantial expansion supply inertia, especially top-quality offices, one factor must monitor closely give risk scenario face economic activity. the evaluation new project take element consideration. in token, aggregate house price evolve line economy’s level interest rate income. however, higher-priced districts, price still outgrow historic trends, possibly due limit land available. it important keep mind materialization negative risk scenario could lead breakdown current price trends. the potential implication price adjustment influence return execute project and, additionally, collateral back mortgage loans. with respect household debt, two factor deserve careful attention. one rate expansion. this, continue grow present rates, debt financial burden household could rise substantially negative risk scenario materializes. in context, consolidate data base particularly important, allow proper risk administration supplier enhance monitor capacity supervisors. the second factor behavior credit-risk indicators. although moderately, since mid-2011 increase banks’ non-performing consumer loan delinquency rate commercial store (figure 4). this element, well sustain growth credit-card finance car loan also take account evaluate credit risk households. medium-sized, retail, investment bank persistently dependent institutional finance sources. besides, despite small relative weight foreign bank external debt local banks, reduction credit bank base peripheral europe result great concentration bank abroad. the complexity today’s scenario call prudent monetary policy make careful risk administration, order prepare deal significant change macroeconomic scenario. the international economy’s situation worrisome worsen could major effect chile. domestically, risk persist relate inflation, central bank’s task vigilant. the board monitor closely evolution external internal macroeconomic scenario consequence inflation, reaffirm commitment conduct monetary policy way project inflation stand 3 percent policy horizon. allow final remarks. conclude remark a happen often past several years, presentation report coincide increase global financial stress pose important challenges. the short-term inflationary risk identify march lessened, although medium term still present. our immediate challenge, however, deal best way possible effect external crisis economy. the board central bank will adopt whatever measure deem necessary adverse scenario occur. event abroad monitor special attention. for moment, however, estimate worst-case scenario possible likely, although likely before. in projection use work assumption that, short term, monetary policy rate remain stable. a change scenery certainly lead change decisions. a i say before, board – present bi central bankers’ speech 7 session – monitor macroeconomic condition closely act promptly whenever say change warrant reorient monetary policy use tool disposal. there room so. let share think i perceive meet i hold recent month monetary authority around world. the central bank governor develop economies, plus emerge markets, get together every two month share view global economic financial situation. two thing call attention three meet i attend since i assume governor cbc. on one hand, severity gravity situation develop countries. be distant geographically main financial center world, chile often fail grasp full dimension hardship face economy interact us. these meet allow u see firsthand situation feel true magnitude. on other, i amaze high prestige chilean economy enjoy arenas. it clearly set apart others, strength, sound macroeconomic administration efficacy institutions. of course make u confident give u good tool confront possible shock come abroad. our responsibility twofold. on one hand, keep inflation low stable, help achieve sustainable growth. on hand, contribute power identify address risk threaten normal function financial system. this certainly help create environment facilitate economic growth population’s welfare. this main contribution institution make development country, board central bank chile firmly commit fulfil role.

be trade-off price stability financial stability? be central bank blindside success price stability neglect financial stability? do central bank necessary mandate instrument handle multiple objective time maintain credibility? how one ensure accountability multiple objectives? be need revisit best practice monetary policy? while currently grapple issues, mean new. against background, i sequence presentation follows. first, i briefly trace evolution central bank objective centuries. second, i review central bank objective practice emerge market economy (emes). third, i highlight experience india conduct monetary policy combine financial stability. finally, i conclude draw three practical lesson central bank term monetary policy framework, institutional design communication pursuit monetary financial stability. evolution central bank objective let first turn central bank history insights. what motivation set central bank 17th century? while early central bank set issuance currency finance governments, financial stability consideration get embed trade expand bank financial sector developed. for instance, swedish riksbank, first central bank, set 1668 joint-stock bank lend fund government act clear house commerce. the bank england (boe) set 1694 act government’s banker debt-manager. how central bank objective change 19th century? most central bank begin assume financial stability function though articulate way understand now. draw criticism function panic 1825, 1837, 1847, 1857, boe adopt “responsibility doctrine” propose walter bagehot. the doctrine require boe subsume private interest public interest bank system whole. a per bagehot’s rule, boe lend freely basis sound collateral offered, penal rate prevent moral hazard. thus, 2 bi central bankers’ speech role central bank lender last resort (lolr) espouse bagehot remain cornerstone financial stability function even today.1 how central bank change 20th century? the function central bank come align public policy objectives. frequent bank panic u lead creation federal reserve 1913 lolr one main functions. however, feed could prevent great depression monetary policy follow “principle real bill doctrine”.2 after great depression, central bank transform growth employment facilitator put place deposit insurance. this keep world economy insulate major bank crisis late 1930s mid-1970s. but fiscal activism belief employment permanently increase cost inflation, support early version phillips curve,3 lead accommodative monetary policy. this manifest high inflation 1970s. in order address inflation surge accompany economic stagnation, intellectual opinion swing favour price stability support work economist like milton friedman, advocate dominant role monetary policy.4 thus, price stability emerge primary objective central bank 1980s. how financial stability fit framework? the understand around time monetary policy direct maintain price stability would lessen incidence severity financial instability. the argument price stability obviate information problem borrower lender ensure financial stability efficient allocation resources. study base experience advance country us, uk, canada japan also concur view price instability contribute financial instability (bordo wheelock, 1998).5 do financial crisis 21st century epicenter advance country change world view central bank objectives? the dominant view, particularly among advance economies, monetary policy ideally single objective, correspond single tool, operationally independent accountable central bank. in fact, follow wisdom, many countries, advance emerge markets, set explicit inflation target mandate inflation control paramount objective monetary policy since 1990s. explicit emphasis price stability often come certain legislative change central bank emphasis fiscal rule many countries. although central bank cognisant importance financial stability conduct monetary policy, distinction monetary policy financial stability policy generally maintained. the current global crisis seem undermine view monetary policy single objective price stability. the pre-crisis view, also call “jackson hole consensus”, central bank respond asset price financial imbalance extent affect short term inflation forecast. however, 1 the term first use francis bar (1797) systematically explain thornton (1802) first identify function bank england. thornton, h.

though directly derive explicit mandate (table 1). indeed, resilience financial system emerge market recent global financial crisis owe financial stability already important monetary policy objective (de gregorio, 2011).24 even many emes formally adopt inflation target (e.g., chile, brazil, south africa, indonesia, thailand mexico), practice follow “flexible inflation targeting” framework, discretion use respond shock also pursue objectives.25 emes formally adopt inflation target (e.g. china, nigeria, malaysia india) price stability one key objective monetary policy (table 2). multiple instruments, include quantitative tool cash reserve ratio, use moderate pace domestic credit growth well monetary impact large capital inflow china, india russia. in east asian emes, importance financial stability need prevent financial imbalance active use macroprudential policy measure emphasise asian crisis. accordingly, central bank give either sole share responsibility pursue financial stability addition traditional mandate monetary stability (watanagase, 2012).26 in south africa, prudential regulation supervision bank assist complement central bank pursuit financial system stability. similarly, central bank brazil actively use macroprudential measure deal emerge financial risks, particularly excess capital flow economy. accord bi survey (2010), emes significantly outnumber advance economy user type macroprudential instrument.27 global financial crisis highlight importance use broad set instrument financial stability. in regard, central bank emes monetary policy prudential supervision within purview seem good equip address financial stability issue compare advance economies. now, i turn specifically experience india. financial stability: indian framework the core function reserve bank india (rbi) enshrine preamble reserve bank india act, 1934 as, “to regulate issue bank note keep reserve view secure monetary stability india generally operate currency credit system country advantage”. in addition, rbi also microprudential regulator bank regulation act, 1949 entrust power regulate supervise commercial bank co-operative banks. the rbi also

medium-term make easy central bank look price stability, also consider variables, output gap exchange rate. in sense, flexible it also imply departure corner solution ‘impossibility trinity’ fix exchange rates, independent monetary policy perfect capital mobility. 26 watanagase tarisa (2012), remark monetary policy workshop strengthen macroprudential framework organise imf regional office

bankers’ speech supervise non-banking financial company (nbfcs) reserve bank india act, 1934. similarly, foreign exchange management act, 1999 empower regulate foreign exchange market oversight payment system derive payment settlement system act, 2007. draw wide mandate, monetary policy india evolve multiple objective price stability, financial stability growth. these objective inherently contradictory, rather mutually reinforcing. the reserve bank’s approach recognise price financial stability important sustain high level growth ultimate objective public policy. the reserve bank’s approach financial stability proactive preventive rather reactive. it role monetary policy authority, well integrate macroprudential regulation microprudential supervision, implicit mandate systemic oversight enable reserve bank exploit synergy across various dimension (subbarao, 2011).28 even crisis, institutional arrangement financial sector already place inter-regulatory co-ordination monitor financial stability economy. a high level co-ordination committee financial market (hlccfm) set 1992 governor reserve bank chairman, chief security exchange board india (sebi), insurance regulatory development authority (irda) pension fund regulatory development authority (pfrda), finance secretary government india members. however, post-crisis, collegial approach financial stability strengthen constitute financial stability development council (fsdc). the fsdc, head finance minister, set december 2010 wake global financial crisis specific mandate, inter alia, systemic financial stability. the fsdc expect deal issue relate financial stability, financial sector development, inter-regulatory co-ordination macroprudential supervision economy include function large financial conglomerates. a sub-committee fsdc, head governor reserve bank, replace hlccfm primary operate arm fsdc. this sub-committee also set dedicate crisis management framework. in addition, various committee reserve bank’s central board monitor financial stability issues: board financial supervision review reserve bank’s supervisory regulatory initiative board payment settlement system oversee overall function payment system. another development signify reserve bank’s role context financial stability set financial stability unit bank july 2009 mandate conduct effective macroprudential surveillance financial system ongoing basis enable early detection incipient sign instability. the reserve bank also bring biannual financial stability reports. incidentally, imf conclude financial sector assessment programme, fact come close heel comprehensive self assessment financial sector carry reserve bank. thus, rbi one central bank recognise financial stability one objective monetary policy even crisis. lesson central bank in opinion, global financial crisis fundamentally alter way use view monetary policy financial stability interface them. however, 28 subbarao, d. (2011), “financial stability mandate central banks: issue international indian context”, rbi bulletin, july. bi central bankers’ speech 7 issue entail work three key areas. first, relook monetary policy framework term objective instrument towards clear recognition financial stability. second, put place appropriate institutional mechanism draw upon countries’ experience history good co-ordination among concern regulatory entity deliver financial stability. third, address communication challenge multiple objective preserve central bank credibility ensure price financial stability. let elaborate three aspects. (i) monetary policy framework the view monetary policy framework allow policymakers lean build-up financial imbalances, even near-term inflation expectation remain anchored, gain importance. while little doubt monetary policy framework central bank need change, moot point ideal monetary policy framework good analysis macroeconomic effect financial imbalances? one approach could formally broaden set information variable monetary policy decision making: way, example, two pillar approach ecb multiple indicator approach reserve bank india factor financial consideration monetary policy.29 the multiple indicator approach advantage broad-basing monetary policy operation large set information money, credit, asset prices, interest rate exchange rate provide flexibility conduct monetary management. such approach, however, may involve great element judgment. at operational level, widely accept presentation monetary policy reaction function combine inflation growth objective “taylor rule”. the taylor rule augment add financial variable standard monetary reaction function base inflation output gap enhance central banks’ ability react financial stability concerns. however, efficiency formulation need tested. whichever framework adopted, flexibility central bank respond potential imbalance risks, apart growth inflation control. (ii) institutional design good coordination the recent crisis subsequent response shed new light critical role central bank promote financial stability. however, need recognise add responsibility come cost conventional role price stability. this relevant particularly central bank emes admittedly, yet achieve level credibility advance economy counterparts. for many emes, exchange rate stability important objective, without price stability possible maintain exchange rate stability. furthermore, financial market institution grow complexity, oversight regulation could beyond single entity central bank. hence, financial stability would joint responsibility, though central bank could dominant role virtue natural lender last resort. however, need explicitly incorporate financial stability role central bank statute establish accountability framework. the challenge central bank achieve multiple objective without lose credibility monetary authority solely responsible price stability. this would possible policy implement various stakeholder financial stability coherent. accordingly, appropriate design co-ordination mechanism require derive synergy monetary policy macroprudential policy make effective use policy tool available multiple body mandate financial stability. 29 for discussion multiple indicator approach, please see: mohanty (2010), “monetary policy framework india – experience multiple-indicators approach”, rbi bulletin, march. 8 bi central bankers’ speech the design co-ordination mechanism may, however, vary across country depend nature size financial system historical experience. in fact, effort towards great institutionalisation co-ordination mechanism already begun. most prominent example newly create bodies, advance country emes, like financial stability oversight council us, financial policy committee (interim) uk, european systemic risk board european union, financial regulation systemic risk council france, financial stability council chile, council stability financial system mexico financial stability development council india (table 3). in countries, financial stability framework strengthen set committee central bank gauge systemic risk (e.g., brazil 2011). under new institutional design, show table 3, though financial stability recognise share responsibility, central bank assign lead role countries. even detail newly create body differ, thrust same, i.e., good co-ordination gauge systemic risk plan appropriate response. furthermore, increase sovereign risk concern number economies, particularly advance economies, good policy response expect fiscal authority also part new institutional framework financial stability. however, even collegial approach financial stability, policy co-ordination go easy, especially problem time-inconsistency objective function authority may always (praet, 2011).30 it also important guard risk active involvement government bring back fiscal dominance compromise autonomy regulator central bank. (iii) central bank communication in market-determined system, central bank place great reliance transparency communication enhance monetary policy transmission establish accountability public decision-making. so far experience show communication monetary policy issue move complete secrecy, constructive ambiguity transparency. for instance, feed ecb recent year frequently provide fairly direct indication future interest-rate decision official statements. we, rbi, also start give forward guidance since september 2010. however, several challenges. it easy communicate clearly single objective. go forward, central bank broaden mandate institutional design grow complexity, also communication challenges. for example, central bank ease monetary policy financial stability concern even inflation high, risk unhinge inflation expectations, turn could complicate financial stability. during recent crisis, many instance communication challenge face central banks. for instance, u feed face communication challenge regard quantitative ease exit policy unconventional measures. we, rbi, face communication challenge reduce cash reserve ratio (crr) bank january march 2012 liquidity concern even inflation tolerance level. while interpret premature reversal tight monetary policy stance, others saw pure liquidity action inconsistent monetary stance. if policy measure properly guide understand intended, may transmit right signal eventually prove noise financial market entities. 30 praet, peter (2011), “the (changing) role central bank financial stability policies”, speech 14th annual internal bank conference, organise federal reserve bank chicago european central bank, chicago, november 10. bi central bankers’ speech 9 guidance central banks, best, could conditional provisional nature immediate available information set, limitation macro models, incomplete knowledge uncertainty evolution economy periodic unanticipated shocks. thus, transparency communication double-edged sword time could produce unintended consequences. a central bank broaden objective also hone communication skills. conclusion to sum up: financial stability objective central bank turn full circle predominant objective, virtual neglect reinstate recently important objective draw lesson global financial crisis. however, financial market institution grow complexity make difficult single entity deliver financial stability. therefore, financial stability share responsibility wherein central bank predominant role. this necessitate fresh look monetary policy framework, institutional design policy co-ordination effective communication. moreover, need explicit recognition financial stability objective, particularly statute central bank, establish accountability framework. while apparent whether price stability ensure financial stability, clear price instability could jeopardise financial stability. financial stability objective, therefore, cannot override price stability objective, continue predominant objective monetary policy. thank you. 10 bi central bankers’ speech bi central bankers’ speech 11 12 bi central bankers’ speech bi central bankers’

bank canada chairman financial stability board, atlantic institute market studies, halifax, nova scotia, 21 june 2012. * * * introduction i want thank atlantic institute market study (aims) invitation speak halifax. one halifax’s great entrepreneur samuel cunard, whose ship empire, like centre, still bear name. launch 100 year ago, cunard business prosper last great era global change. in remark today, i speak transformation currently way global economy. in touch situation europe, challenge international monetary system, i concentrate central role open, resilient financial system sustain global growth. the transition multi-polar world i would like start put recent darken global economic outlook perspective. europe build single market 500 million people 27 countries, free movement goods, services, capital people. in process, transform economy southern eastern europe. it also play consistently positive role rise national interest address global problems. on global scale, never history economic integration involve many people, variety good much capital. this process lift hundred million people poverty create potential hundred million follow path. the gap rich poor country narrow dramatically soon global middle class outnumber poor. the shrink disparity unite state china particularly striking. in 1990, gdp per caput unite state almost 30 time high china; 2010, ratio fall six times. the crisis accelerate transformation. but transition smooth, preordained. downside risk europe materialising, threaten pace global growth. more broadly, rebalancing global economy stalled, much advance world remain mire prolong deleveraging. during challenge time, must remember realise europe’s globalisation’s potential require open system. it reasonable expect capital flow, net basis, advance economy towards high expect return emerging-market economies. this happen last wave globalisation turn 20th century canada, emerge economy, run current account deficit average 7 per cent gdp three decades. these good imbalances. import capital invest productive capacity late serve pay accumulate debts. global imbalance past decade often bad, positively un-canadian. in cases, public capital flow emerging-market economy 2 bi central bankers’ speech advance economy invest non-tradable good housing. in others, private flow overshoot complacent, deregulate “new era”. large current account imbalance inherent part strong global growth, order sustainable, must be: • product private decision take context sound macroeconomic policy robust market structures; • finance open, resilient financial system. in many respects, problem face today product two flaw monetary unions: one formal – european monetary union; informal – bretton wood ii. in cases, financial reform integral solution. european monetary union europe’s problem today partly product initial success single currency. after euro’s launch, european financial system quickly become integrated, cross-border lend exploded. easy money feed booms, flat government fiscal position support bank balance sheets. in aggregate, euro area’s debt metric may look daunting: total euro-area public debt burden low unite state japan, current account rest world roughly balanced, time. but blindingly obvious, aggregate mask large internal imbalances. for example, since 2007, public debt spain increase 30 percentage point gdp, portugal 40 percentage points, greece 50 percentage point ireland 80 percentage points...and counting. much increase consequence private loss real estate bank sectors. indeed, euro crisis remind u that, one way another, excessive private debt usually end public sector. further, price stability across euro area compose large difference national inflation rates. in eight-year run-up crisis, inflation crisis economy twice core countries. most importantly, unit labour cost peripheral country shoot relative core economies, particularly germany. the result deterioration competitiveness make continuation past trend unsustainable. europe stagnating. it gdp still 2 per cent pre-crisis peak, private domestic demand sit stun 6 per cent below. the contraction drive bank loss fiscal shortfalls. these understandably receive much attention, remember challenge symptom underlie sickness: balance-of-payments crisis. what european do? to repay creditor core euro area countries, debtor periphery must regain competitiveness. this neither easy quick. a sustain process relative wage adjustment necessary, imply large decline live standard one-third euro area. a comprehensive adjustment necessary. the burden cannot increase unemployment fall wage country like spain. deflation peripheral country likely prove tolerable unite kingdom gold standard 1920s. an increase german wage private demand (and inflation) bi central bankers’ speech 3 would ease transition. it strike german real wage barely grow two decade crisis. moreover, essential structural reform way across deficit country boost productivity. with domestic income squeezed, require investment finance abroad. unfortunately, european financial system aggressively renationalised recent months. intra-european cross-border lend – grow 25 per cent per year run-up crisis – fall rate 10 per cent per annum since. while european central bank (ecb) adroitly step breach, reliance central bank lend recipe robust private investment. bold step require restore single financial market. and bold step consideration. one example current european proposal create bank union. by centralise bank restructuring, re-capitalising bank european rather national resources, move towards centralise (or federalised) supervisory oversight harmonise (or good still mutualising) deposit insurance, europe break increasingly toxic link bank sovereigns. the recent agreement recapitalise spanish bank system mark progress towards great financial fiscal union reinforce monetary union. it evidence europe’s resolve address problems. if measure combine swift implementation financial stability board’s (fsb) financial reform agenda, i outline moment, prospect relaunching deeper, robust pan-european financial system. bretton wood ii the second flaw monetary union heart current international monetary system: so-called bretton wood ii arrangement, centre china unite states. the current international monetary system hybrid of, one hand, mainly major advance economy float exchange rate liberalise capital flow and, other, group country actively manage exchange rates. the result system facilitate timely symmetric adjustment shock structural change. for example, despite economic miracle, china’s real exchange rate appreciate two decade global financial crisis. in decade crisis erupted, china’s relentless accumulation reserve contribute low real interest rate and, time, subdue macroeconomic volatility. market participant increasingly assume stable macroeconomic environment would persist – prompt search yield, rise leverage dramatic underprice risks. when combine inadequate supervision financial system ill-conceived deregulation house financial markets, u.s. private non-financial debt quickly rise level last see great depression. with 20 per cent global output, unite state import 60 per cent global capital (on net basis) eve crisis. this would problem capital invest expand productive capacity. unfortunately, enough was. now, debt cycle decisively turned. creditor demand repayment, global growth require global rebalancing. 4 bi central bankers’ speech how pay debt austerity necessary condition rebalancing, seldom sufficient. there really three option reduce debt: restructuring, inflation growth. whether like not, debt restructure may happen. if done, best do quickly, sufficient scale restore sustainability. policy-makers need careful delay inevitable merely fund private exit. some suggest high inflation may way burden excessive debt. to effective, would need couple various form financial repression, include capital control force hold government debt. this counsel despair. an inflation surprise need large sudden work. move opportunistically high inflation target would risk unmooring inflation expectations, destroy hard-won gain come entrenchment price stability, increase real rate would exacerbate unfavourable debt dynamics. financial repression would massive sustained. it would undermine system help bring u prosperity past three decades. the palatable strategy reduce debt increase growth. private growth flourish environment macro instability. fiscal sustainability price stability essentials, luxuries. private growth need enable environment, include tax competitiveness framework infrastructure investment. it need sound financial sector diverse, resilient open. sustainable private growth role financial reform this yet assured. most immediately, risk series contingency measure could extend global scale current european trend towards renationalisation. that one reason european initiative expect come week important. more broadly, financial reform agenda must address legitimate emerging-market concern resiliency advanced-economy financial systems. because worries, pressure localisation protect domestic system renew use capital control dampen volatility cross-border flows. if allow persist, nascent trend could seriously restrain global capital flow necessary next stage global transformation. the imbalance state market i recall german finance minister, peer steinbrück, fateful g-7 meet wake lehman’s failure, relate meet woman east germany early week tell that: “i see fall communism i see fall capitalism.” the complete loss confidence private finance time could arrest provision comprehensive backstop rich economy world. even heroic efforts, global financial crisis cost $4 trillion lose output 28 million lose jobs, build perilous fiscal deficits. a typically case, much cost bear countries, business individual directly contribute fiasco. bi central bankers’ speech 5 to restore confidence system, must create truly global system, part rebalancing relationship government markets. government must discard myth finance self-regulating self-stabilising, financial policy-making long concentrate national levels. give reality global finance, enough house order unless seal world – end much poorer. an open, resilient global financial system central transformation global economy. in order achieve that, financial sector reform must. the g-20 serious agenda, aggressively implemented. the current intensification euro crisis sharpen resolve. build resilient financial institution achieve strong bank system override priority, hence importance assign full implementation basel capital liquidity standards. a simple, effective, leverage standard import canada. it protect system risk think low fact not. these measure low probability failure. however, goal fully risk-proofed system. that neither attainable desirable. end too-big-to-fail since failure still happen, remain need reduce impact, one reason focus end too-big-to-fail. more fundamentally, must address, all, unfairness system privatise gain socialise losses. by restore capitalism capitalists, discipline system increase and, time, systemic risk reduced. most importantly, knowledge major firm market far away fail, without meaningful consequence home, restore confidence open global system. to achieve objective, bondholders, shareholder management – rather taxpayer – must bear brunt losses. to end, fsb member country commit place bail-in authority. in addition, global systemically important bank must place resolution recovery plan within next six months, supplement cross-border co-operation agreements. the framework systemic institution extend domestic banks, global insurers, key shadow banks. when implemented, great supervisory intensity high loss absorbency ensure system never behold fate single firm group firms. create continuously open market an important element end too-big-to-fail ensure key market withstand failure systemic firms. it unacceptable core market seize crisis, relatively small firm save concern would take market failed. create continuously open core market require change plumb derivative repo markets, along good data track exposures. move shadow bank market-based finance the fsb work strengthen oversight regulation shadow bank source competition (to promote efficiency) diversity (to promote resilience) regulate sector. this require change money-market fund managed, 6 bi central bankers’ speech term securitisation and, importantly, link regulate bank sector shadow bank managed. timely, consistent implementation finally, fsb increasingly focus timely, full consistent implementation agree reforms. this essential preserve advantage open globally integrate financial system. recent experience demonstrate mutual confidence lost, retreat open integrate system occur rapidly. a return nationally segment global financial system would reduce systemic resilience financial capacity investment growth. conclusion let conclude comment current economic environment. the recovery advance economy continue dampen ongoing need repair sovereign, bank household balance sheets. while u.s. economy expand modest pace, risk around european crisis materialise risk remain skew downside. the emerge world continue engine global growth, although weak demand advance economy effect past policy tighten slow pace expansion china major emerging-market economies. a result modest global economic momentum heighten financial risk aversion, commodity price fall recent months, although remain historically elevate levels. despite ongoing global headwinds, canadian economy continue grow underlie momentum consistent gradual absorption remain small degree economic slack. total cpi inflation expect fall 2 per cent short term, result low gasoline prices, core inflation expect remain around 2 per cent. canada’s relatively favourable economic performance continue rely significantly resilience canadian household spending, support accommodative monetary policy well-functioning financial system. our economy cannot, however, depend indefinitely debt-fuelled household expenditures, particularly environment modest income growth. notably, house investment rise first quarter, account unusually elevate share overall canadian economy. in context, canadian authority co-operating closely monitor financial situation household sector, respond appropriately. today, federal authority take additional prudent timely measure support long-term stability canadian house market, mitigate risk financial excesses. against backdrop, extent economic expansion continue current excess supply economy gradually absorbed, modest withdrawal present considerable monetary policy stimulus may become appropriate, consistent achieve 2 per cent inflation target medium term. the time degree withdrawal weigh carefully domestic global economic developments. a i argue today, global development depend importantly sustain open, global system. at g-20 meet week los cabos, mexico, leader reaffirm “multilateralism even great importance current climate, remain best asset resolve global economy’s difficulties”, commit “timely, full consistent implementation agree policy support stable integrate global financial system”. bi central bankers’ speech 7 this resolve bode well secure global transformation and, it, realise full potential canadian prosperity. bi central bankers’ speech 1 thomas jordan: the swiss economy global economic outlook introductory remark mr thomas jordan, chairman govern board swiss national bank, medium news conference swiss national bank, berne, 14 june 2012. * * * the swiss national bank (snb) maintain minimum exchange rate chf 1.20 per euro enforce utmost determination. it remain prepare buy foreign currency unlimited quantity purpose. even current rate, swiss franc still high. another appreciation would serious impact price economy switzerland. the snb tolerate this. if necessary, stand ready take measure time. the target range three-month libor remain 0.00–0.25%. essentially, snb’s conditional inflation forecast unchanged march forecast. it base three-month libor 0.0% continue assume swiss franc weaken forecast horizon. for 2012, forecast show inflation rate –0.5%. for 2013, snb expect inflation 0.3% 2014, 0.6%. consequently, foreseeable future, risk inflation switzerland. the snb expect global economy recover slowly. while emerge economy make major contribution global growth, momentum advance economy remain subdued. in europe, particular, economic activity extremely weak account financial debt crisis. switzerland experience significant economic slowdown rest year. only unexpectedly strong winter half-year snb expect growth around 1.5% 2012. the risk swiss economic situation remain exceptionally high. the uncertainty future development euro area risen. if global activity prof disappoint turmoil financial market increases, downside risk emerge economy price stability switzerland. the imbalance swiss residential mortgage real estate market increase last quarter. consequently, snb welcome federal council decision make available countercyclical capital buff counter adverse development domestic credit market. global economic outlook let u examine economic outlook inflation prospect little detail. in first quarter 2012, global economy continue grow moderate pace although vary considerably one region another. the emerge economy still make major contribution global growth. by contrast, overall momentum advance economy subdued, although here, too, difference one country another considerable. japan experience strong growth first quarter due catch-up effect. in us, momentum moderate. in euro area, number country deep recession, germany, gdp continue expand strongly. overall, economy euro area stagnated. a last monetary policy assessment, assume global economy continue recover slowly. this drive globally expansionary monetary policy strong domestic demand emerge economies. in euro area us, development likely subdued. here assume european financial sovereign debt crisis gradually ease. however, risk respect remain high. in particular, difficult situation greece spain already lead significant deterioration 2 bi central bankers’ speech confidence household company euro area. a result, economic situation remain vulnerable. these high risk also affect financial markets. follow temporary recovery begin year, situation financial market present tense. a substantial correction take place share markets. by contrast, investment perceive safe, us, german uk government bonds, record all-time low yield correspondingly high price gains. real yield investment negative territory maturities, measure term inflation expectations. in addition, interest rate money market record-low level worldwide. swiss economic outlook in switzerland, real gdp rise fast expect first quarter. the stabilise effect minimum exchange rate euro play major role development, good export decline slightly first quarter, international environment remain weak, export service rose. an improvement consumer confidence encourage substantial increase private consumer spending. however, gdp growth also support temporary effects. value add bank industry benefit optimistic mood financial market first month year. in manufacture hospitality industry, however, activity declined, underscore particularly negative impact strong swiss franc industries. for second quarter, expect significant slowdown gdp growth. since global economy expect recover slowly, value swiss franc still high, demand export likely remain subdued, even subsequent period. the high level uncertainty pressure profit margin impact negatively corporate investment. only unexpectedly strong winter half-year snb expect growth around 1.5% 2012. swiss inflation outlook the inflation outlook switzerland remain largely unchanged monetary policy assessment march. since fourth quarter 2011, annual inflation rate negative territory. this mainly attributable base effect, last quarter price level remain almost unchanged previous quarter. thus minimum exchange rate put halt deflationary situation arise result strong appreciation swiss franc last summer. survey inflation expectation confirm deflation expect present. a survey also show, continue danger inflation. this correspond conditional inflation forecast reach 0.8% end three-year forecast horizon. overall, path inflation subdue march forecast, due fact swiss franc weaken le rapidly forecast time. monetary financial condition let u turn monetary financial conditions. these virtually unchanged first quarter 2012. after march monetary policy assessment, euro remain le stable major currencies. since begin may, weaken around 5% u dollar. a result, swiss franc depreciate slightly export-weighted terms, even exchange rate remain unchanged regard euro. interest rate swiss franc money market continue fluctuate around zero. in past quarter, libor persist low level, around 10 basis points. for foreseeable bi central bankers’ speech 3 future, interest rate expectation remain exceptionally low, level interest rate future – derive libor future contract – fact, cases, substantially zero. yield bond high credit rat also low switzerland. at begin june, ten-year confederation bond attain new all-time low, around 0.5%. thirty-year bond trade market yield 1%. for short medium-term maturities, yield negative territory, case negative. the low interest rate continue reflect robust growth lend rise real estate prices. a result, imbalance swiss residential mortgage real estate market increase further. follow presentation, colleague jean-pierre danthine take close look risk financial stability connection mortgage real estate markets. snb monetary policy let u return snb’s monetary policy. the debt problem euro area country deteriorate seriously recent period. accordingly, euro lose value country since may. this lead increase upward pressure eur/chf exchange rate. even difficult environment, consistently enforce minimum exchange rate chf 1.20 per euro. to defend minimum exchange rate, purchase foreign currency. this lead expansion swiss franc liquidity snb balance sheet. even minimum exchange rate first introduced, draw attention fact enforcement could significant consequence balance sheet. another appreciation swiss franc would constitute substantial threat swiss economy risk deflationary development come about. this necessary accept expansion balance sheet arise enforcement minimum exchange rate. the snb position bear ensue risks. even level chf 1.20 per euro, swiss franc still high, present large part economy difficult situation. consequently, continue enforce minimum exchange rate utmost determination buy foreign currency unlimited quantity purpose. if necessary, stand ready take measure time. management foreign currency investment i conclude today comment management foreign currency investments. in recent period, topic return spotlight public discussion. in particular, possibility establish sovereign wealth fund snb’s foreign currency hold give rise discussion. in respect, important, first all, point snb hold foreign currency form banknote bank deposits. the fund invest different investment category currencies. for considerable period, snb hold traditional instrument – government bond country high credit rat – also bond issue private sector borrower shares. hold share currently make 10% foreign currency investments. in order diversify investment further, 2010, snb include additional currency australian singapore dollar well swedish krona danish krone investment universe. since first quarter 2012, snb also invest korean won. additional investment opportunity advance emerge economy continually evaluated, bond shares, although subject adequate level liquidity market question. 4 bi central bankers’ speech the idea sovereign wealth fund may appear attractive first glance. however, current situation, little assist switzerland swiss monetary policy. the sovereign wealth fund norway oil state cannot serve model management snb’s currency reserves. all invest state income surplus derive commodity exports. a swiss sovereign wealth fund fund snb foreign exchange, contrast, would finance money creation. from point view, three follow points, particular, speak sovereign wealth fund. first, creation fund would help enforce minimum exchange rate. the decisive factor snb’s willingness buy foreign currency unlimited quantity swiss francs. second, investment abroad subject exchange rate risk, whether government bonds, shares, real estate, commodity investment infrastructure, irrespective whether appear snb balance sheet separate sovereign wealth fund. consequently, outsource foreign currency investment would reduce switzerland’s exchange rate risk. third, outsource foreign exchange sovereign wealth fund would call question independence monetary policy snb, well freedom action monetary policy. the size composition snb’s balance sheet reflection monetary policy. the snb must also position dispose asset purchase determine composition balance sheet required. only way conduct independent target-oriented monetary policy. bi central bankers’ speech 1 vítor constâncio: financial stability – measurement

financial stability analysis, macro-prudential policy actions, much assess implication rupture financial system wide economy. from viewpoint, development macro-financial model link financial

view key elements. it also broadly reflect effort ecb develop implement appropriate financial stability analytical toolkit. this topic i turn. 2. the ecb’s tool financial stability analysis beyond academic research, lot analytical macro-prudential work undertake ecb, it’s case central banks. our main aim work position carry systemic risk assessment real time, directly regularly support policy discussions. for purpose, disposal number tool technique help u form comprehensive view prevail systemic risk help assess quantify impact risks, materialise, bank sector ultimately real economy. more concretely, structure financial stability analysis usual way three broad elements. the first entail identification important source system-wide vulnerability base analysis individual collective strength different part financial system – institutions, market infrastructures. the second assessment potential cost – real economy – combination identify risk vulnerability materialise. a proper indicator systemic risk entail properties, probability adverse event occur potential impact event occurring. a last element methodology examine network fragility contagion. start identification potential source systemic risk, analysis focus two broad type indicators: the first set indicator characterise current state financial stress financial system, i.e. indicator work “thermometers” level tension financial system. a crisis tend exhibit many different manifestations, obvious single metric gauge current level systemic stress. in practice, cross-check report variety complementary indicators. let mention examples. one class approach employ practice ecb classify “market base indicators” – is, focus signal financial market financial institutions. at least four example distinct indicator category mentioned. first, general financial market stress quite accurately capture so-called coincident indicator systemic stress, “ciss”, succinctly synthesis interaction stress across key market segment also take account explicitly correlation structure different segments.18 a second indicator class measure focus specifically systemic stress within bank sector – examine onset systemic stress 17 see christiano, l, motto, r., rostagno , m (2010) financial factor economic fluctuations” ecb wp n. 1192; cúrdia, v. m. woodford (2010) “credit spread monetary policy” journal money credit

system”, ecb work paper no 1426 (march). 6 bi central bankers’ speech lens joint probability default basis cd price financial institutions.19 a third group market base indicator focus squarely liquidity condition – either specific market segment (e.g. money market) across financial market segments.20 lastly, novel method self-organising financial stability map provide alternative mean gauge systemic stress visual mean – thereby provide useful complement numerical signal methodologies.21 another separate class indicator regularly report characterise current state financial stability classify “structural indicators” – is, examine potentially excessive leverage credit development – well disequilibria specific asset price segment specific economy sectors. example indicator category numerous, clearly encompass model credit boom well various estimate valuation real estate markets.22 both set indicator provide indication buildup imbalance suffer one drawback. assumption need make define excessive developments. these assumptions, accordingly, must robust otherwise risk challenge addressee policy recommendations. the second set indicator explicitly strive predict vulnerable state financial system, i.e. early warn indicator – form univariate indicators, multivariate model early warn systems. the key feature category early warn indicator signal evaluate early warn framework, thus historically measure performance term correctness timeliness signals, potentially take account relative preference policy maker type 1 type 2 errors. this active field ecb – representative example respect would work alessi detken argue global credit gap robust early warn indicator costly aggregate asset price boom work lo duca peltonen build systemic risk stem combination domestic global macrofinancial vulnerabilities.23 of course, trigger exact time crisis extremely difficult predict. however, underlie vulnerabilities, least base past experiences, seem often detectable – one need least control “known knowns” “known unknowns”. indeed, many crisis follow similar pattern feature excessive leverage. accordingly, fact early warn seem possible practically become part layman’s lexicon – least give widespread even popular appeal analysis historical crisis (e.g. reinhart-rogoff). despite strides, much remain do policymakers fully confident enough implement make use robust early warn systems. let move assessment tools. one major tool perform financial stability assessment stress testing, primarily bank sector, also conduct insurance sector – include sensitivity scenario analyses. stress test tool allow evaluate impact bank sector solvency severe, plausible macro-financial 19 see, instance box 8 june 2012 ecb financial stability review,

bankers’ speech 7 scenario reflect key systemic risks. on basis, use (top-down) stress test tool rank impact prevalent macro-financial risk order gauge resilience bank sector. the top-down, macro-prudential, stress-testing framework develop ecb prove particularly valuable financial crisis euro area sovereign debt crisis. systemic risk emerged, intensify evolve rapidly, call flexible operational tool could deliver quantify impact assessment timely fashion. the tool comprehensive enough cover individual bank incorporate real-financial interaction well network model ass contagion risk. these feature notwithstanding, despite increase prominence financial stability analysis communication, stress test limits. notably, even state-of-the-art stress test framework characterise substantial methodological limitations. the major challenge face stress tester today range deal inevitable subjectivity relate scenario building, model integrate consistent way within framework elements, endogenous bank responses, interbank spillover macroeconomic feedback effects. many available model also difficulty capture well often non-linear tail risk effect scenario typically mean reflect. finally, stress test result good data available, particular central bank macro-prudential authority without supervisory access key deficiency. finally, let add even though top-down stress test framework far perfect suffer many deficiencies, prove useful tool challenge granular bottom-up approaches, eba eu-wide stress tests, especially detect outlier response individual bank latter case. the last broad element ecb financial stability analysis rapidly burgeon literature contagion. i review ecb work area speech last october.24 in speech, i mention several analytical perspective use examine contagion form relevant ongoing sovereign crisis euro area – highlight model capture interaction sovereigns, well sovereign banks. such model make use multiple technique uncover contagion – namely, multivariate frequency decompositions, regime-switching approach exploit generalise measure risk aversion entity-specific frameworks. clearly, issue contagion distinct network analysis. while work area broad, i point recent ecb work feature late financial stability review – tool result present regard application network analysis actual collateral hold simulate interbank networks.25 ultimately, work field remain still relatively nascent i sure highly relevant application follow time. 3. the macro-prudential policy framework instrument eu single market let turn design macro-prudential policy framework definition policy toolkit expect available authority address identify systemic risk europe. 24 see “contagion european debt crisis”, keynote lecture vítor constâncio, vice-president ecb bocconi university/intesa sanpaolo conference “bank competitiveness post-crisis world” milan, 10 october 2011. 25 see special feature c june 2012 ecb financial stability review, “evaluating interconnectedness financial system basis actual simulate networks”. 8 bi central bankers’ speech since outbreak financial crisis, policy maker gradually place emphasis macro-prudential approach financial regulation. the first step process establishment financial stability board global coordinate body follow set authority explicit macro-prudential mandate national level well. an important milestone process establishment esrb europe last year. besides role facilitate discussion macro-prudential mandate institutional set-up national level, esrb play key role develop toolkit macro-prudential policy instrument national authority use within european legal framework. in context, major policy challenge europe currently face implementation basel iii standard way would allow authority use policy tool macro-prudential purpose well. i would like highlight regard basel iii already include element specific macro-prudential toolkit, counter-cyclical capital buffer, require bank build capital buff period excessive credit growth. these buff release stress situations, would help institution avoid become constrain regulatory requirement may thus enhance ability maintain lend activity. however, close look basel iii agreement, acknowledge element new framework traditionally consider micro-prudential nature. the capital liquidity rule design address risk level individual institutions. still, depend instrument calibrated, could, principle, also use address macro-prudential concern mitigate systemic risks. this topical issue policy perspective europe, give discussion final phase implementation basel iii call “crd iv”, include proposal directive regulation. importantly, regulation introduce new feature financial regulation, namely prudential standard lay legislative proposal directly applicable eu member states. you may already aware concern recently raise authority member state regard ability use policy tool fall regulation macro-prudential purposes. concretely, claim that, capital liquidity rule micro-prudential instrument introduce element “single rulebook”, would imply “maximum harmonisation” prudential requirements. consequently, member state may legally prevent adopt stringent rules, even systemic risk would justify that. i share concerns. however, i would also like highlight issue i consider prerequisite conduct efficient macro-prudential policy single market. first, regard “single rulebook”, ecb express many occasion support towards approach. we underline “single rulebook” contribute consistent implementation prudential measure single market, improve transparency ensure level play field financial institutions. by avoid regulatory arbitrage distortion competition, “single rulebook” also beneficial perspective financial integration europe. at time, however, let also underline significant risk financial stability emerge systemic risk identify national level may impact jurisdiction spillover effect common exposure financial institutions. it therefore paramount importance national authority possibility impose, well identify subset instruments, stringent rule define regulation. give member state may well different stage economic financial cycle within europe, also significant difference structural feature financial sector across eu countries, authority control appropriate set tool address cross-sectional time dimension systemic risk well. bi central bankers’ speech 9 in view, appropriate macro-prudential regime single market three main features: first, adjustment prudential rule identify subset instrument possible direction strengthen harmonise minima. these instrument could include capital liquidity ratios, leverage limit large exposure (loan-to-value debt-to income ratio limit crd iv). second, calibration subject upward adjustment, definition remain intact ensure ratio comparable across institution countries, thus respect principle single eu rulebook. third, macro-prudential regime subject strict safeguards, ex-ante coordination esrb order avoid, least minimise, possible unintended consequence spillover effects. these safeguard include identification assessment macro-prudential concern respective country national authority esrb, particular spillover effect expected. furthermore, implementation macro-prudential measure subject close monitor regular evaluation esrb well disclosure requirements. i’m view principle respected, set framework would enable u mitigate build-up excessive risk financial system contribute smooth function financial system single market europe. against backdrop, let finally say word recent development field europe. first, month extensive discussion european body forums, compromise reach european parliament 14 may last ecofin meet 15 may crd iv. this important development i look forward successful trialogues council, parliament commission. rapid progress agreement clear rule game crucial also view meet g20 commitment timely comprehensive implementation basel iii. third, regard propose regulation approve council, compromise text include element would allow national authority apply measure fall “single rulebook” macro-prudential purposes. overall, welcome development. my critical remark regard text regulation state clearly calibration quantitative limit tighten definition remain intact, since way ensure direct comparability prudential ratio across eu. i also think list measure enlarge much and, instance, context i agree proposal risk weight certain exposure change would distort comparability ratio across member states. let conclude say find right balance principle “single rulebook” require flexibility implement macro-prudential measure national level remain key policy challenge decision maker europe. however, look development financial market recent policy initiative field, i’m convince establishment efficient well-functioning macro-prudential framework may substantially contribute smooth function single market strengthen financial stability framework. the latter would particularly beneficial euro area risk financial stability transmit even fast elsewhere lack trust part financial system felt across entire currency area. safeguard financial stability euro area demand euro area-wide perspective effective macro-prudential framework – preventative side – accompany well-functioning resolution mechanism – crisis management side. in respect, know, ecb support establishment financial union euro area, base three elements: european deposit insurance scheme, european 10 bi central bankers’ speech resolution fund euro area bank supervisory authority. very briefly, would entail: first, single deposit insurance scheme apply bank euro area avoid unfair completion; second, subset euro area financial institution systemically important operate significantly cross-border would subject european resolution fund; third, subset systemically important financial institution would subject euro area bank supervisory authority. the resolution fund would institution point non-viability need resolve bailouts “going concerns” minimize need public funds. the possible moral hazard risk single deposit guarantee bank without many subject european supervision would addressed, instance, impose need pay insurance country would happen would contribute least 50% replenishment fund. besides contribute clear commitment future euro project one key benefit arrangement would ensure euro area bank financial system separate financial situation sovereigns. with major step would accomplish overcome present european crisis consolidate concrete way future monetary union. bi central bankers’ speech 1 ardian fullani: bank system economic development speech mr ardian fullani, governor bank albania, joint press conference mr gani gërguri, governor central bank republic kosovo, tirana, 12 june 2012. * * * honourable governor gërguri, honourable participants, i honour take part proceed joint activity organise central bank republic kosovo bank albania. it take place jubilee year coincide 100th anniversary albania’s declaration independence. after long cavalcade torment existential discourses, finally country enter irreversible process transformation convergence democracy market economy standards. the respective financial system part process, thank dedicate hard work do institutions, achievement numerous. the bank industry country grow rapidly recent years, enjoy stable financial health. it make significant contribution finance economies, lead stable economic growth years. it pleasure see central bank republic kosovo grow day day, assume characteristic modern central bank, like counterpart region. let take opportunity express appreciation commendable work do central bank republic kosovo’s staff, lead old friend, mr. gani gerguri. i fully convince have, even future, responsible commit institution aim successfully fulfil challenge mission confront dignity challenge ahead. distinguish guests, for long time, economy find global crisis pressure. recently, almost trade partners, country region euro-area economy display acute symptoms. this situation induce elevate uncertainty regard probable macroeconomic implication contamination financial stability countries, mainly existence several european bank groups. despite international turmoil, economy succeed maintain stable performance. consumption private sector investment continue play primary role expand kosovo’s economic activity, albania, external demand play primary role. the indicator remain check. however, trend must monitor scrupulously constantly. at present, maintain basic balances, i.e., macroeconomic balance financial one, major objective. these two pillar represent legal mandate. therefore, must utmost consolidate inherit balances, make cautious analysis take appropriate measure best absorb risk pose country’s macro-financial stability. currently, fulfilment legal mission become difficult challenge task, full surprises. our country represent small economies, whose share influence play active impose role international arena. moreover, i increasingly convince economy net importer material good international crisis. 2 bi central bankers’ speech personally, i think moment currently experience constitute historic opportunity us, leave good name competent manager time great crisis. a long thing go well, fail understand need ongoing adaptation, constant correction. this reason mostly lead creation “financial bubbles” economy. apparently, decision-makers lack ability willingness stop blow bubbles, hence burst. from viewpoint, i ass bank albania’s experience carry element preliminary correction, i.e., preventive elements. let specific. since early 2005, address interplay macroeconomic stability financial stability prudentially. while historic stability keep inflation check, exist many unclear thing bank system stability. i would like remind you, briefly, fact talk period bank system transform 100% private capital credit expansion dominate bank business. since 2005, outstanding credit economy expand 7–8 percentage point gdp. moreover, 75% credit denominate foreign currency hedge exchange rate risk frequently overlooked. it time competition market share increase tremendously among banks, even expense credit quality. periodic examination conduct bank supervision identify several vulnerability could threaten financial stability system. i would mention: lack electronic credit register; risk management weaknesses, structural weakness internal audit; lack transparency deal customer supply products. one important issue worth mention bank management general, managers’ role integrity particular. identification weakness require investigating, take administrative measures, make legal regulatory change solve problems. to end, several initiative launched, including: establish credit register; create financial stability department; conduct prudential supervision; create regulatory base protect albanian consumers; and, undoubtedly, public education. the latter, particular, important issue constitute one cornerstone financial stability central bank’s monetary policy success. a financially educate public make few mistake financial decision react swiftly predictably economic development policy pursue central bank authorities. therefore, financial education public remain priority bank albania. individual decision-making household business assess much meet inflation target maintain financial stability. this assessment support fact individual choice base financial literacy good interpretation economic information provide benefit whole society. financial literacy essential point view individual social welfare. it see public good contribute strengthen stability, efficiency economic policies, all, increase individual’s financial welfare, hence overall economic welfare. this bank albania adopt slogan: “education costs, priceless.” the bank albania’s approach financial education focus three directions. first, promote deep knowledge awareness basic economic financial concepts; secondly, knowledge bank albania, role policies, decision-making; third, knowledge economic information interpretation. the bank albania start financial education public communicate openly actively various group interest. bi central bankers’ speech 3 our experience show u financial education integral part national strategy. consequently, seek cooperation understand albanian government (the ministry education science), bank albania become initiator define financial education strategies, policy practice education system. the bank albania play active role prepare teach programs, implement coordinate teach process, student perceive financial education part high-school education curriculum. this activity special significant contribution bank albania make financial education. it crown publication book “personal finance hands”, conceptualise high schools, incorporate elective subject high-school curriculum, distribute schools, train economics teacher also included. this difficult process consume considerable human financial resources, interest arouse fully justify it. education institutions, student long term benefit financial education, positively expect initiative. along them, whole economy also benefit. financial education financial stability two important issue two example avant-garde policy pursue bank albania. these policy common fact effect change behaviour individuals, business overall economy gradual life-long. in cases, matter side movement, direction policy lead economy. credibility institutions, confidence financial system financial literacy help people manage financial affair raise standard living, also propose support right policies. they also contribute sustainability efficiency financial system whole economy. improve macro-financial management financial education help each-other successful journey. today’s activity, organise central bank one nation, also part journey. currently, keep focus harmonise central banks’ position ensure macro-financial stability, way enhance credibility economy region improve foreign investment climate. cooperation coordination policy central bank financial authority create regional market, increase value exist investment economy general. harmonisation economic agenda maintain macroeconomic financial stability, increase opportunity regional cooperation open new joint projects, way promote new private investment attain real convergence economies. lady gentlemen, let congratulate organize event good work do far. it wonderful see many individual

many country adopt past 20 year so.1 certainly inflation performance new zealand far superior inflation target regime (figure 1). i expect inflation target familiar people let briefly recap framework entail new zealand context. then i use recent business cycle new zealand illustrate framework cop significant shock new zealand economy. figure 1 headline cpi inflation source: statistic new zealand 1 roger, s (2009) “inflation target 20: achievement challenges” imf work paper, wp/09/236, october. 2 bi central bankers’ speech what inflation target look like new zealand inflation target framework number element include explicit numerical target meet define time horizon, well typically specify process central bank hold accountable monetary policy action expect communicate monetary policy decisions. in new zealand, aim keep future consumer price inflation 1 3 per cent average medium term.2 like many central bank range publication use provide view inflationary pressure explain monetary policy actions. the prominent quarterly monetary policy statement. although principle inflation target across country difference details. for example, new zealand different accountability structure single decision maker rather committee monetary policy decisions. we also differ central bank publish interest rate track think would necessary achieve inflation target. these difference appear make difference ability achieve inflation target. how inflation target framework cope recent business cycle new zealand? the recent business cycle new zealand one long large past 60 years.3 the reserve bank analyse cycle help ass monetary policy. this analysis provide useful case study use inflation target small open economy, like new zealand’s. an analysis driver business cycle publish bank’s march

2004, great deal respect forum create open dialogue. one would think return south african reserve bank would relatively straightforward previous experience central banking. however, i find different world. not environment central bank operate change dramatically, expectation central bank reflect extend mandate also changed. in early mid-2000s lead global financial crisis emerge macroeconomic theory policy consensus. the period know great moderation, follow apparent trend towards macroeconomic convergence, particularly advance economies. business cycle appear synchronise low amplitudes, low inflation prevail countries. some go far suggest business cycle inflation dead. inflation target become broadly accept monetary policy framework, make price stability override objective. the

flexible inflation target framework, south africa. what appear change burden stabilisation growth stimulus fall increasingly central banks, particularly country long fiscal space. in many countries, response crisis initially monetary fiscal policy easing. however, measure take resolve crisis unanticipated consequence that, many instances, lead excessive unsustainable deficit debt ratios. for example, 2007, government debt gdp ratio u uk 62 per cent 44 per cent. by 2012 almost double expect reach 103 per cent 87 per cent respectively. in euro area, debt ratio greece ireland increase 105 per cent 25 per cent, 157 per cent 122 per cent period. of four countries, u currently experience positive growth. the cost service debt also increase significantly, particularly peripheral eurozone countries, doubt sustainability persist. this rapid expansion result fiscal consolidation retrenchment become order day many, mainly advanced, countries, even growth fully recovered. in short global crisis continue mutate, face challenge systemic bank weakness number countries, instance spain, sovereign debt possible default part eurozone, high rise unemployment. the unemployment rate eurozone rise 10,9 per cent, spanish unemployment 24,1 per cent. fiscal austerity reinforce slow growth, consequently increase burden monetary policy. although mandate may same, share responsibility long there, expect central banks. at time expectation may beyond monetary policy reasonably expect deliver. in context consider whether conduct monetary policy south africa much different post crisis period. some argue current accommodative stance monetary policy part new mandate, deviation inflation targeting. we would argue bank’s action consistent flexible inflation target framework. since crisis, economy grow estimate potential output (around 3,5 per cent), absolute output gap, difference level output potential level output, coincidentally also around 3,5 per cent, persistently negative. it require period above-potential growth close gap, unless destruction capacity would reduce size gap. a negative ouput gap also imply le pressure inflation. although inflation move outside target, consider view mpc inflation would return within target, and, give subdue state economy, felt bi central bankers’ speech 3 inappropriate speed process tight monetary policy stance. this view also reinforce absence excess demand-side pressure relatively well-anchored inflation expectations. in 2006–08 period, contrast, inflation exceed target, growth excess bank’s estimate potential, measure growth 5 6 per cent per annum, high rate growth credit extension household consumption expenditure. under circumstances, tight monetary policy stance justifiable appropriate. it also important note recent central bank intervention always stimulate growth directly low interest rates. in context crisis, recently fiscal policy constrained, focus time help dysfunctional part financial market work better. this recognition central place financial market efficient work real economy. these policy aim prevent negative feedback loop financial sector stress real economy, result number significant form unconventional monetary policy actions, particularly country interest rate reach zero bound. there number illustration this. quantitative ease (or credit ease refer us) initially aim primarily provide liquidity specific segment financial market long function efficiently. during crisis loss confidence bank financial instruments, lack trust banks, disrupt segment market interbank markets. central bank respond become counterparties buy unconventional asset significant scale. between 2007 2011, central bank balance sheet advance economy increase around 10 per cent gdp excess 20 per cent gdp, total almost us$8 trillion. more recently u feed initiate maturity extension programme (more popularly refer operation twist), whereby feed sell short term treasury security buy long term securities, effort bring long term interest rates. the aim give boost ail domestic house market, mortgage often price long-term rate us, well corporate bond market. the long term refinance operation (ltro) ecb, euro1,3 trillion liquidity inject european bank system danger seize up, another example measures. the objective keep bank interbank system operating, cushion real economy bank sector stress. some activity intend provide additional stimulus economic growth, also strong financial stability element. this lead u area central bank mandate change significantly: is, responsibility maintain financial stability. prior crisis, financial stability generally imply mandate central banks. the fall-out crisis lead increase number central bank give explicit financial stability macroprudential mandates. this distinct microprudential supervision regulation bank system focus regulator limit individual bank institution bank system. a broad macroprudential focus would look build-up financial imbalance risk pose position take leverage financial institution broad financial sector economy general. for example, low interest rate environment high rate growth credit extension banks, fund use finance purchase asset result build-up bubble house equity markets. the issue central bank react asset price subject much debate prior crisis. the dominant view time financial imbalance crisis occur low inflation environment, did, central bank position recognise predict them. nor appropriate tool prick incipient 4 bi central bankers’ speech bubbles. interest rate would raise unacceptably high level low inflation environment order deal bubble emerged. the consensus view asset price take consideration monetary policy extent impact inflation, role central bank confine clean bubble burst. unfortunately, well aware, five year bubble burst central bank still clean up. but influential voices, notably come bank international settlements, argue low inflation/low interest rate environment 2000s cause asset price bubble first place. in words, ironically, successful attainment low inflation lead long term financial stability problems. this approach argue favour monetary policy lean excesses. the view narrow focus, short time horizon policy, blind policy maker long term systemic financial stability risk could take long time evolve. since crisis, widely accept perspective emerge see monetary policy macroprudential policy different objectives, different instruments. this approach attempt avoid conflict objective trade-off application interest rate instrument. others however contend feasible completely separate two policies, interest rate affect financial stability, macroprudential tool affect credit growth therefore inflation. while macroprudential oversight emerge distinct policy focus, still unanimity best governance arrangement oversight. some central banks, example bank england, establish financial stability committees, place mandate financial stability squarely court central banks. a different approach express lars svensson swedish rijksbank argue case fiscal policy, financial stability policy conceptually different monetary policy, conduct completely different institution different individuals. more significantly, generally agree interest rate main instrument monetary policy, choice efficacy financial stability instrument still much work progress. give different institutional structure different countries, type instrument also likely differ country country. however common theme evolve think topic. it generally accept excessive credit extension heart asset price bubbles, therefore instrument use direct prevent excessive leverage relevant markets. charles goodhart, example, argue house market epicentre financial crises, sufficient focus instrument prevent excessive build-up house relate credit. these include set maximum loan-to-value ratio property transaction borrow restriction relation disposable income. other possible macroprudential instrument include reserve requirement particular type loans, contracyclical capital buff bank capital surcharge systemically important banks. in general microprudential tools, previously apply many country anti-inflation measure since jettisoned, reconsider narrow focus. it still premature pronounce efficacy success policies, remain work progress. in reality financial stability generally share responsibility financial crisis resolution often require fiscal intervention application public money. this potential create challenge central bank independence. even narrow monetary policy independence remain intact, boundary monetary macroprudential policy often blurred. however, jaime caruana bi argue address bank last year, always strong opposition central bank resist asset price accelerations, take away punchbowl party get going, argument independence apply even great force, independence need political cycle also financial markets. bi central bankers’ speech 5 in south africa, implicit financial stability mandate bank make explicit letter minister finance governor february 2010. the bank’s financial stability committee reconstitute meet alternate month mpc. furthermore, recognition share responsibility financial stability, financial stability oversight committee established, jointly chair governor minister finance. the focus bank fsc crisis prevention, fsoc review current conditions, primary purpose committee crisis management resolution. furthermore, government decide regulation supervision financial sector move “twin peaks” approach. this mean prudential regulation become responsibility sarb, market conduct province financial service board. this significant reform add task responsibility bank. work ongoing determine appropriate policy instruments. to date, counter-cyclical measure introduce address fallout ongoing global economic crisis, south africa’s bank system emerge largely unscathed. while room complacency, policy decision take respect financial stability. one area potential concern financial stability acceleration growth unsecured lend bank sector, although unsecured lend restrict bank sector only. this form lend grow rate excess 30 per cent and, face value, anything grow elevate rate must cause concern. but also need see context total loan advances, unsecured lend form part, still grow relatively moderate levels. both fsc bank registrar bank keep close eye developments, try understand phenomenon fully. without come definitive conclusion issue, number point raised. firstly, concern financial stability, microprudential, monetary policy perspective? from monetary policy point view, would need understand extent lend translate excessive expenditure potential inflationary consequences. at stage, seem case. while may well unsecured lend may contribute growth rate 5 per cent household consumption expenditure, growth line real income growth consider unsustainable excessive. in fact, sign moderation rate growth household consumption expenditure first quarter 2012, particularly respect durable goods. furthermore little evidence cpi inflation drive meaningful way excess demand pressures. a microprudential approach would focus risk profile key ratio individual institutions. this part function registrar banks. at stage, sign stress bank bank system whole. to contrary, ratio impair advance total loan advances, remain stubbornly high time, decline 5,8 per cent march 2011 4,6 per cent march 2012. from systemic perspective, risk bank sector stage appear limited, unsecured lend (which include traditional form unsecured lend overdrafts, credit card loan sme’s), around 8 per cent, relatively small proportion total lend although ratio rising. if loan sme’s, overdraft credit card excluded, ratio 4 per cent. from financial stability perspective, also need consider whether likely lead asset price bubble elsewhere system. the house market remain subdued, house price index still reflect fall prices. although equity market reach all-time high april fall back recent day follow increase global risk aversion, would difficult argue bubble. in event link high rate growth unsecured lend equity bond price movement extremely tenuous best. 6 bi central bankers’ speech growth credit extension bank private sector relatively muted. growth twelve month private sector credit extension 7,3 per cent april, 9,2 per cent previous month. it significant total loan advance households, include unsecured lending, still grow annual rate around 7 per cent. there potential concern possibility excessive burden household debt. although ratio household debt disposable income still high, declining. have peak 82,3 per cent 2008, ratio decline 74,6 per cent final quarter 2011. household debt nevertheless still rising, slow pace disposable incomes. so macro level, appear cause concern. the concern, however, could distribution debts. there risk household become over-leveraged, would suggest limit set national credit act adhere to. a concern often express is: happen interest rate cycle turn many new borrower may find difficult service loans. some loan fix interest basis monthly repayment commitments, thus service loan materially affect interest rate increases. there also evidence growth unsecured loan result loan great value long repayment term extend exist client prove repayment record. it also possible observe structural change respect bank lending. mortgage credit extension subdue difficult past household access mortgage bond finance consumption expenditure. so extent, may adjustment away mortgage adjustment take place, sustainable rate increase observed. but rate charge unsecured lend much high mortgages, consumer get access expensive credit, although evident yet data cost service household debt decline consistently since end 2008. these development closely monitor sign unsustainable increase could systemic implication bank sector, financial stability general inflation. but i illustrate above, answer simple. in conclusion, context central bank operate become increasingly complex. the global growth outlook deteriorate recent weeks, couple increasingly volatile risk averse financial market response uncertainty eurozone, central bank expect play core role help manage resolve crisis. the scope fiscal policy play meaningful role limit high sovereign debt ratio part underlie problem. there also increase concern sustainability expand central bank balance sheet abnormally low global interest rates, see already sow seed next crisis. at time, financial stability focus, tighten bank regulation move towards basel iii effect increase deleveraging banks, particularly europe, raise cost capital banks. these development focus ensure stable financial system future, process contractionary impact growth. the potential conflict different mandate evident. in south africa, make exceptional liquidity provision, monetary policy accommodative would absence below-potential growth rate persistently negative output gap. inflation expect return within target range near term, remain contain forecast period. the bank system stable despite challenge expect implement basel iii, especially long term. however, vigilantly monitor global development possibility contagion economy. bi central bankers’ speech 7 it important that, extend mandate central banks, clear understand central bank cannot do, appreciation possible conflict different objectives. central banks, normal times, function uncertain environment. in prevail difficult global condition uncertainty even high level, many action take precedence. it therefore incumbent upon central bank share information together learn collective experiences. a line various mandate become increasingly blurred, danger burden expectation could excessive, ultimately undermine confidence credibility central bank themselves. these challenge consider central bank others, require u good understand immediate challenge mutating, extremely severe global financial crisis. at time need appreciate measure require deal crisis may well unintended consequence central banks, mandates, independence, capacity role society. thank opportunity speak you. bi central bankers’ speech 1 daniel mminele: take stock global south african environment address mr daniel mminele, deputy governor south african reserve bank, 6th annual cocktail function financial market department, pretoria, 10 may 2012. * * * 1. introduction good even lady gentleman welcome financial market department’s annual cocktail function. it customary u take stock every year happen global domestic environment. we last meet april 2011, time adverse development euro zone gather momentum financial stability risk intensifying, thereby threaten sustainability global recovery. it year later, much do various front try resolve crisis, continue face significant global economic financial market challenges. downside risk remain elevate continue hold back strong sustainable global economic recovery. geopolitical tension remain threat, potential trigger sharp rise oil prices. central bank continue play fundamental role, attempt prevent collapse financial system continue downward economic adjustments. in process central bank venture even deep new territory, martin wolf financial time last week describe new world post-financial-crisis central banking, create significant institutional intellectual challenges. in europe, firewall increase long debates, auspex g20 imf, country also come together provide additional financial resource imf purpose crisis resolution prevention. will measures, beyond ensure global economy fall back recession, enough restore require level confidence financial markets? recent market move appear suggest not. have action raise risk moral hazard, investor expect central bank continue pump money financial system; system become hook central bank money? jaime caruana1 point action buy time, doing, may actually make easy waste time, increase risk “balance sheet recession” lead protract weakness, also potentially raise political economy risks. it would indeed unfortunate essentially temporary relief breed sense complacency regard repair work still necessary. while may able answer question tonight, let briefly touch global domestic financial market developments, update activity financial market department past year. 2. global economic development financial market while volatility global financial market decline first half 2011, third quarter witness renew rise tensions, first drive congressional debate debt ceiling unite states, renew concern solvency peripheral euro area sovereigns. greece may forefront news flow, late 2011, concern spread number sovereign issuer euro 1 central bank balance sheet recession. panel remark mr jaime caruana, general manager bis, board governor federal reserve system 2012 conference “central banking: before, crisis”, washington, 23–24 march 2012. 2 bi central bankers’ speech zone periphery, result sharp widen spreads, turn spill banks’ fund cost generally tight financial condition rest world. a already indicated, become necessary central bank respond unconventional manner: u federal reserve lengthen maturity security portfolio (in become know “operation twist”); bank england bank japan expand respective balance-sheets via additional security purchases; ecb first time (and two instalments) supply bank almost eur1 trillion three-year repo funding. the goal measures, however, broadly similar: stabilize fund structure bank system, thereby fend risk severe credit crunch. these measure help limit undue market volatility risk force illiquid solvent sovereign insolvency. at time, public private creditor work voluntary restructure plan greek sovereign debt. the market’s initial response positive. risk indicator decline markedly december 2011 march 2012, vix index particular fall level 15, le around low record begin financial crisis. intra-euro zone sovereign spread undergo sharp compression, bank cd spreads, reduction risk-aversion spur mark rally equities. yet many question remain unanswered. for example, vulnerable sovereign state take advantage “window opportunity” implement necessary strengthen public finance improve competitiveness? will credit non-financial entity start flow strongly bank able secure solid financing? will authority manage implement fiscal austerity measure without unduly damage growth prospect europe? and issue whether geopolitics push oil level threaten fragile global recovery. let briefly add europe source risk, are, e.g., major fiscal challenge us, could come head early next year. the jury still questions, investor concern seem rise again, especially respect credibility fiscal consolidation plan europe. at recent meet g20 finance minister central bank governor last month, optimism tail risk face global economy start recede. however, persistence downside growth risk need on-going structural reform global rebalancing also highlight need keep firmly g20 agenda. 3. implication south africa a case since begin financial crisis, south africa immune fluctuation international markets. our bank system solid well-capitalized, financial market (including interbank market) experience problem require official intervention, external public finance situation look far manageable many develop economies. yet country’s strong trade link european union; reliance commodity exports; liquid sophisticate financial market provide many channel transmission external shocks. the past year’s fluctuation domestic equities, bond exchange rate, well sensitivity local gdp global cycle, bear testimony relationship. supply-side problem undermine south african growth 2011. some external, include disruption automobile sector’s supply chain follow devastation japan. others internal – i refer safety-related interruption mine industrial action mine manufacture sectors. the consequence, however, gdp growth average 3,1 per cent 2011, less increase reserve bank project time last year. admittedly, latter half year bring good news domestic demand front. thus, real gdp accelerate 3,2 per cent (quarter-on-quarter annualized) fourth quarter, drive sustain solid expansion consumer spend acceleration private bi central bankers’ speech 3 public fix investment. yet, many factor justify caution – uncertain global environment – reserve bank’s late projection 2012 growth 3,0 per cent still fall marginally short growth rate achieve last year, rate growth require put serious dent unemployment. in regard, late figure show unfortunate rise unemployment first quarter 2012. the past twelve month also saw mild breach reserve bank’s 3–6 per cent inflation target, headline cpi rate increase 6,3 per cent january retreat 6,0 per cent march. price pressure past year remain essentially cost-push nature. the moderate pace “core” inflation (4,4 per cent march exclude food, petrol energy) show despite evidence price pressure become broad-based, still expect remain contain relatively subdue state domestic economy. in fact, highlight mpc march 29, reserve bank expect cpi inflation gradually decline second quarter year onwards, project average 5,2 per cent end forecast period end 2013. the behaviour domestic fixed-income market past twelve month would suggest investor large agree reserve bank’s interpretation inflation acceleration temporary largely supply-driven nature. despite volatile global markets, rand-denominated bond yield decline past year, test post-recession lows, breakeven inflation expectation markedly different year ago. both government bond swap yield curve flat ten-year maturity. and performance longer-term bond appear part dictate investor expectation subdue growth globally locally, plan fast reduction government budget deficit compare initial national treasury target may also reassure investors. activity domestic bond market non-resident investor illustrate relatively constructive approach towards emerge market debt general, south african bond particular. statistic show net foreign purchase local bond positive ten twelve month april 2012, despite hefty sell-off september 2011, cumulate net purchase amount r74,5 billion. in comparison, previous calendar-year record 2006 stand r34,3 billion. in recent weeks, announcement possible inclusion south africa world government bond index late year, provide impetus local currency bond market non-resident inflows. this positive development criterion inclusion base level sophistication bond market regard size, credit quality lack barrier entry, well liquidity transparent price discovery process. this represent another endorsement south africa’s financial market world-class. other financial assets, however, experience volatile environment past year. equity prices, measure jse all-share index, fail post gain whole 2011 despite recovery latter part year. furthermore, continuation late 2011 rally early 2012 quickly lose steam, bear testimony continue investor concern speedy return solid economic growth. in contrast positive inflow bonds, net non-resident activity local equity result net sale r25,4 billion twelve month april 2012. the exchange rate rand, repeat wild gyration early financial crises, remain vulnerable shift global risk appetite swing commodity prices. follow relative stability first half 2011, currency weaken beyond r8.00/us$ september foreign investor sell domestic bonds, even resumption bond purchase ensue month fail bring rand back previous range. the past month period moderate volatility, rand seemingly drive – so-called “commodity

increase level flexibility reserve bank’s liquidity management operations, eliminate lack synchronisation reserve bank’s main repo auction mpc interest rate announcements. this lack synchronisation

connection storting’s deliberation government’s financial market report. my statement today base bank’s annual report, also executive board’s assessment period recent monetary policy meet new information. norge bank’s conduct monetary policy orient towards low stable inflation. the operational target monetary policy consumer price inflation close 2.5 per cent time. at time, monetary policy shall contribute stabilise development output employment. when i last year, key policy rate raise 2.25 per cent. inflation low around 1¼ per cent, prospect growth advance economy recover capacity utilisation inflation norway would pick up. the key policy rate keep unchanged june meeting, interest rate forecast imply likely interest rate increase summer. norge bank did, however, underline risk possible appreciation krone inflation might become low result economic divergence norway countries. in course summer autumn, international growth prospect worsen considerably. financial market tension heightened, market participants’ key rate expectation low appreciably. yield government bond country weak public finance jumped, equity price declined. money market premium move banks’ fund cost rose. 2 bi central bankers’ speech the turbulence weak growth prospect abroad feed norwegian economy. at monetary policy meet august, september october, executive board decide leave key policy rate unchanged 2.25 percent. around turn year, financial turbulence intensify risk downturn increased, particularly europe. the debt crisis euro area make difficult expensive european bank procure market

meeting. europe downturn. many country struggle large deficit mount government debt. structural reform implemented, pension scheme tighten tax system review. at time, tight credit standard increase capital requirement limit supply bank credit. in addition, number country must restore competitiveness period high cost growth prior financial crisis. in short run, tighten measure pull activity push unemployment. central bank country use strong measure prop activity inflation. a show chart, key rate among many trade partner close zero expect remain low long period. in us, uk japan central bank make large-scale government bond purchase order push long-term interest rates. the european central bank (ecb) also stretch itself, example provide long-term loan banks. the ecb operation winter

situation budget development spain country southern europe. the political unrest greece grow fear greek government debt default curb risk appetite markets. yield italian spanish government bond increased, us, uk german government bond yield fall historically low levels. international equity index declined, particularly europe. 4 bi central bankers’ speech despite prolong downturn abroad financial market turbulence, activity norwegian economy remain robust. capacity utilisation close normal past year. gdp mainland norway expand 2.4 per cent 2011 accord preliminary figures. price norwegian export good favourable relative import prices. the oil construction industry boom employment supply labour rise. unemployment low fairly stable. at time, house price move household debt still rise fast household income. on hand, segment export industry feel adverse effect development europe strong krone. key policy rate low inflation low downturn abroad strong krone drag growth sector norway. very low interest rate abroad high premium money credit market reinforce picture. there unusually wide difference various interest rates, reflect high level money bi central bankers’ speech 5 market credit premiums. many household pay 4 percent house loan interest rate corporate loan range 5 6 percent. when set interest rates, bank give weight exclusively bring inflation back target. weight also give effect interest rate output employment. at time, weight give risk prolong period low interest rate lead elevate risk-taking excessive debt accumulation household business sector. such imbalance may spillover effect ahead, substantial effect output employment. in march 2012 monetary policy report, norge bank clarify consideration express bank’s response pattern. in connection, bank adjust criterion give weight interest rate forecasting. the key policy rate set inflation bring back target. at time, inflation target flexible, mean path inflation weigh development output employments. interest rate set also robust. this mean interest rate set monetary policy mitigate risk buildup financial imbalances. normally, key policy rate cannot achieve several objective simultaneously. in case conflict objectives, choice interest rate path involve trade-off different considerations. if monetary policy take account low level inflation, key policy rate would rapidly reduce keep close zero good while. inflation might pick faster, partly result weak krone. in light trade-off considerations, however, bank want accelerate pace inflation. the result would pronounce impact output employment increase risk buildup financial 6 bi central bankers’ speech imbalances. a prolong period low interest rate may increase risk debt asset price drive level unsustainable time. when weight also give two criteria, interest rate path therefore become high even though level key policy rate low historical perspective. the norwegian economy well poise face new shock challenges. while many trade partner struggle low growth, high unemployment mount government debt, norwegian economy still feature buoyant activity, low unemployment government budget surpluses. the petroleum industry oil revenue give u solid economic foundation compare countries. at time, oil revenue high cost level pose certain challenge norwegian economy. with today’s high oil prices, petroleum investment likely expand sharply year ahead. petroleum-related industry fare well. public sector enterprise also enjoy favourable stable environment. internationally expose industry face sluggish market high costs. norway’s dual economy come clear evidence. petroleum activity influence norwegian economy partly actual production activity partly government spend petroleum revenues. in 2011, petroleum revenue spend central government budget 5 percent mainland gdp, demand petroleum sector 17 percent. bi central bankers’ speech 7 high oil price investment growth fuel demand labour oil sector supplier industry. in economy close full employment, lead intensify competition skilled labour. the result reduce profitability internationally expose industries. the phase new, profitable industry increase spend public budget effect crowd activity. some decline industry inevitable consequence domestic spend oil revenues. for economy sustainable long horizon, important find appropriate balance prevent excessive crowd expose sectors. monetary policy little contribute regard, whereas fiscal policy economic policy instrument decisive. rapid wage growth many year lead high domestic cost level. measure common currency, cost level norway relative trade partner 20 percent high historic average norway’s oil age. a result high cost level, internationally expose industry vulnerable weak international growth, fall export price strong krone. the real value krone increase recent years, reflect solid domestic economic growth, high oil price relatively weak growth among trade partners. a long available resource norwegian economy, increase petroleum revenue spend central government budget push real value krone undermine competitiveness. this likely continue long plough oil money economy. the petroleum fund mechanism moderate predictable petroleum revenue spend central government budget nevertheless make considerable contribution stabilise economic development ahead. by limit petroleum revenue spend real return fund, also ensure future generation share benefit provide petroleum wealth. house price historically high level. the rapid growth household income key factor behind rise house price time. in recent years, tendency amplify high immigration hence strong population growth. 8 bi central bankers’ speech in spite vigorous build activity, number complete dwell still low relation population growth. this house gap develop several year push house prices. a tight labour market low interest rate push direction. the rise house price rate debt accumulation closely linked. since mid-1990s household debt norway rise appreciably fast income. on average, household debt twice high disposable income. a rise share household face debt burden make vulnerable interest rate move normal level economic development norway take turn worse. in situation, many household might find challenge service debt may reduce household spending. a pronounce fall household demand negative impact corporate earn enterprises’ capacity service loan norwegian banks. the key policy rate influence number variables, include krone exchange rate, debt house prices. in interest rate setting, bank seek take account key relationship economy, influence real economy inflation. but limit task give monetary policy. monetary policy cannot alone prevent financial imbalance secure competitiveness norwegian business sector. the objective monetary policy low stable inflation bank one instrument – interest rate. inflation expectation firmly anchored, mean norge bank give weight stabilise economic development interest rate setting. but monetary policy cannot overburdened. when assess various considerations, monetary policy must pursue primary objective – low stable inflation. other economic objective must pursue use policy tool financial regulation, tax system fiscal policy. thank attention. bi central bankers’ speech 1 jens weidmann: everything flows? the future role monetary policy speech dr jens weidmann, president deutsche bundesbank, 2012 zew economic forum, mannheim, 12 june 2012. * * * 1. introduction professor franz, lady gentlemen, i delight able speak today zew economic forum. professor franz, thank much invitation. at first glance, title may leave slightly puzzled. “everything flows? the future role monetary policy” conjure number associations. the title could allude massive increase liquidity result non-standard measure take many central banks. some may also think pre-socratic philosopher, heraclitus, know dictum constant flow pass things. “everything flows” thus also refer change role general condition monetary policy. both association correct inter-connected. the central banks’ contribution combat crisis one reason current role monetary policy debate intensely. this true across globe, especially euro area specific set-up unique situation pose sovereign debt crisis. there doubt crisis deliver important find monetary policy monetary union. however, key message today make clear paradigm valid date mean suddenly lose validity. on contrary, give challenge face today, recklessly throw long-held principle overboard turn back lesson past. ultimately, monetary union current institutional form create result lesson learn past errors. and that, i much mean german hyperinflation begin 1920s, often assume foreign observers. instead i mean monetary policy experience gain 1970s 1980s extremely heterogeneous development inflation europe. country politically independent central bank clear primary objective price stability, germany, much low inflation rate country central bank oblige follow politicians’ instruction additionally call upon pursue fiscal economic policy goals. this one reason bundesbank, culture stability, choose found model eurosystem. an independent central bank necessary stable prices, needed. price stability also jeopardise unsound public finances. if public finance get hand, central bank come overwhelm pressure jump fiscal policy’s rescue and, doing, undermine primary objective price stability. this lesson derive theoretical models, evidence time time past. a particularly good example history latin monetary

depart bimetallic standard impose enforce rate exchange 2 bi central bankers’ speech banknotes. this enforce monetary finance war debt trigger first severe crisis latin monetary union fuel permanent mistrust member states. the recent past – notably financial crisis – also important lesson monetary policy. one example asymmetrical monetary policy, provide strong counter-measures speculative bubble burst. this inflate risk financial stability. in environment market participant pocket full return risky investment successful bear part cost unsuccessful, risk appetite take harmful dimension economy. when consider future role monetary policy relation policy areas, go back draw board draw wealth experience economically prove evidence. this do, do. although outstanding political significance monetary union – still – undisputed, political project must also economically sustainable; long term, cannot enforce economic conditions. economic mechanisms, risk moral hazard, may law nature; however, relevant constraint politician cannot ignore forever. thus, order overcome crisis prevent happen again, essential apply coherent approach: short-term emergency measure institutional change must stand way long-term stability objective. and interaction monetary policy, financial stability measure fiscal policy must compatible special condition monetary union. this coherence currently given. however, i see deficit much area monetary policy. it commitment primary objective price stability prove worth must therefore upheld, especially view increase effort mandate expanded. nevertheless, deep rift develop fiscal economic policy foundation monetary union. this foundation emphasis member states’ individual national responsibility sovereignty, is, however, increasingly undermine result progressive communitisation risks. it i see need adjustment need europe make pivotal decision, long delayed. it reason topic fiscal union, deep integration political union currently everyone’s lips. in following, i therefore focus fiscal economic policy foundation euro area particular. but first, i would like begin take short look monetary policy financial stability policy. 2. core function monetary policy relation financial stability there currently lack suggestion regard adjust pre-crisis monetary policy consensus supposedly new circumstances. the bottom line much advice direct central bank raise inflation target. although benefit low inflation rate question such, suggest that, give policy area push limit, monetary policy, too, ought contribute reduce debt imbalance crisis country mean high inflation rates. to cut long story short: approach completely unsuitable solution problems. besides, price pay would far high, namely loss credibility monetary policy precondition price stability. place confidence central bank solution time inconsistency problem monetary policy, confidence like confidence general: take great deal time effort build certain point easily squandered. however, confidence form basis public acceptance monetary union. discussion benefit high inflation target expand monetary policy mandate – fruitless may – put confidence grave risk. bi central bankers’ speech 3 the commitment monetary policy primary objective price stability historical achievement must compromised. instead, monetary policy must combat future upside inflationary risk tenacity. the step necessary achieve objective must impede delay consideration irrelevant monetary policy. this apply also, especially, regard ensure financial stability. an unstable financial system impair transmission monetary policy jeopardise price stability without danger reflect inflation expectation measure inflation good time. but important financial stability is, implication monetary policy? i convince decisive contribution monetary policy financial stability remain price stability, whereby longer-term outlook become even important. monetary policy must look beyond cycle. it must succumb purely short-term crisis logic thus create new risk stability price financial system. conversely, financial stability policy require macro-prudential instruments. previous unsound development individual country monetary union show macro-prudential measure must also applicable national level – regardless compatibility europe whole. central bank play important institutional role area future. this mean specifically renationalisation monetary policy. instead, successful financial stability policy take burden monetary policy, allow focus maintain price stability. in view extent risk contagion effect crisis, loud call integration financial stability policy europe point common deposit insurance resolution system well bank union. the question essentially this: boat regard bear burden, would good jointly monitor risk properly regulate issue joint liability advance? give cross-border bank structure contagion effects, essentially good idea europeanise financial supervision, already take place – two many example european supervisory authority eba, already take work, recent proposal directive make european commission design restructure resolution regimes. there bank union that, however. the aim good prevention crises, also ability cope crisis fiscal terms, mean money – small amount that. the degree europeanisation financial stability policy closely link europeanisation fiscal control intervention right connection, inseperable. this i see great challenge – monetary policy entire monetary union alike. 3. on financial economic foundation monetary union the crisis expose weakness monetary union. some member state experience severe unsound development financial system, national financial policy economic structure – unsound developments, institutional framework fail prevent underestimate term impact. the foundation monetary policy prove weak. for reason, foundation must strengthen deepen order euro area remain stability union regain confidence. this require clarity objective monetary union achieve it. clarity especially term depth integration aim transfer responsibility national european level entails. we must find framework coherent clearly allocate responsibilities. clarity confidence require political consensus must, all, bear approval public design treaty constitutions. this way solid foundation created, upon stability union based. if foundation 4 bi central bankers’ speech incomplete, brittle threaten undermined, confidence destroyed. policy course try mend crack build support part danger collapsing. however, nobody feel safe inside build anymore. in principle, two approach achieve stable monetary union. first, member state could return principle stipulate maastricht treaty current constitutions, emphasis must put side individual responsibility – make decision bear consequence themselves. the guide principle national sovereignty subsidiarity. fiscal economic policy thus remain chiefly national responsibility, stability national bank financial systems. a strict framework interest rate premium pay capital market ensure incentive place member state pursue stability-oriented policies. there place scenario far-reaching joint liability. in approach, current framework also strengthen intensify crisis prevention measures. this comprises, particular, macroeconomic surveillance procedure, currently envisaged, tight restriction fiscal policy, include improve monitor implementation. the aim low deficit debt quota leave page become reality. this way public finance absorb macroeconomic shock without endanger state’s solvency. furthermore, essential make financial bank system significantly robust order limit contagion despite ever close financial ties. this necessitate improvement regulation financial system supervision, much great resilience crises. if properly designed, crisis resolution instrument, esm, provide vital contribution stabilisation. all all, i do, however, currently see danger joint liability extended, result exist institutional framework clearly stretched, possibility control intervention lag behind. this pose acute threat balance liability control. whereas, instance, fiscal compact aim ensure stringent prevention measures, clear wish forego risk premium aid programme make use significantly weaken incentive sound public finances. the alternative “return maastricht” transition true fiscal union, currently subject intense debate. this idea nothing new. this issue topic debate bundesbank long monetary union even established, issue raise financial crisis. allow make one preliminary remark i move discus individual aspect possible fiscal union great detail. “fiscal union” difficult term pin take number forms. provide adequately structured, fiscal union prove cornerstone coherent institutional framework monetary union. however, even ambitious project fiscal union mean solve problem many country face today: high unemployment lack competitiveness go disappear overnight. the need adjustment would still exist give strong interdependencies, would probably require even close oversight regard macroeconomic imbalance member states. above all, however, transition fiscal union would mean guarantee stability union. the crucial point here, addition adequate structure, would common european stability structure develop actually implemented. irrespective change regulatory framework, fiscal union, country experience macroeconomic financial imbalance would consequently implement structural reform put public finance order get economy back feet. depend form takes, fiscal union could contain substantial transfer components. i am, however, convince euro-area public would accept simply gloss structural problem individual country mean transfer payments, especially likely problem would become entrenched. bi central bankers’ speech 5 the focus debate quite legitimately issue surround joint liability. the idea introduction measure alone solution current problem delusional belief introduction single currency automatic guarantee economic prosperity individual member states. such measure may well help cover unsound economic development somewhat longer, yet underlie economic issue cannot rectify way. on contrary, expansion joint liability therefore answer spectre reform fatigue europe. the discipline effect financial market would consequently undermine incentive reform would diminish country need adjustment. this would away important corrective national economic policy, would severe blow europe’s economic outlook globalise world stability-oriented monetary policy. furthermore, creditworthiness country provide assistance would also put risk. in addition, political acceptance would lose country result perceive excessive demand excessive advantages. the monetary union would consequently lose anchor thus basis kind stability. these medium-term risk must brush aside favour short-term ease acute fragile economic situation. joint liability therefore introduce end integration process fiscal union beginning. rather, must also succeed, especially fiscal union, maintain strengthen incentive necessary economic reform fiscal consolidation. and also succeed if, i already mentioned, liability control bring back line fiscal union structure manner compatible stability. not surprisingly, precisely country face acute finance problem severe loss confidence fiscal policy cry joint liability loud emphatic. the support see european institutions, which, nature, advocate great centralisation european level, understandable. it is, however, worth note advocate joint liability often country oppose surrender national sovereignty regard financial policy decisions. it clear joint liability hold promise deliver benefit extend country’s scope action, whereas fiscal union could restrict scope action national level. a understandable stance may be, stable union cannot found basis. my impression germany much open regard issue surrender national sovereignty many partner countries. in order establish stability-oriented fiscal union, firm belief imperative euro-area country summon two thing  first, willingness submit bind manner strict budgetary rules.  second, willingness hand sovereignty area central level effectively monitor compliance rule and, all, enforce them. consequently, although necessary, would acceptable bear risk certain extent jointly. in context, sequence step take crucial. if reverse order, would risk – not, fact, strong probability – second step never take or, least, take properly. but might stability-oriented fiscal union structured? there are, course, large number option this, depend far competency shift european level, revenue spend power centralise transfer element extended. i wish assume status quo; words, much subsidiarity possible form national fiscal responsibility fiscal objectives, set out, example, 6 bi central bankers’ speech stability growth pact fiscal compact. and basis i would like outline number minimum requirement stability-oriented fiscal union. this minimal approach advantage allow broad range economic policy culture member states, since integration advances, le room difference concept statehood, social security system pay negotiation structures. let u illusions: still exist major difference respect, even germany france. in germany, government spend 46% nominal gdp, whereas figure france 56%. and germany respond demographic challenge phase increase retirement age 67, recent increase retirement age 60 62 france reverse cases. the core element fiscal union limit absolute essential consist strict effective budgetary rule set bind ceiling national borrowing. give experience past years, would monitor european commission ecofin council, ideally new, independent euro-area institution. in event country abide budgetary rules, national sovereignty would automatically transfer european level scale ensure compliance objectives. in speech petersen institute, jean-claude trichet, former president ecb, describe aptly “federalism exception”. one option, example, could right make tax increase proportional cut expenditure – possibility call them. in effect, national sovereignty would largely retain fiscal policy decision-making capability room manoeuvre would preserve long country question comply limit borrow debt. in kind framework, consolidation path would safeguard european level even majority find relevant national parliament. along credible establishment framework reliably safeguard compliance fiscal rules, joint liability euro-area member state could introduced, say, issue jointly guarantee partially guarantee bond bank union comprise key element joint liability. a stringent fiscal union line fundamentally suit place monetary union strong, endure foundation. a time go on, union also live stability union. before arrive goal, however, two obstacles, i allude earlier, overcome. first, fiscal union equip comprehensive democratic legitimacy. it matter quantum leap. european integration would noticeably extended, national sovereignty self-determination would hand over. what crucial happen democratic legitimacy give clear manifestation general public affect member states. this way create confidence new framework popular acceptance back therefore endure. the second obstacle, link first one, far-reaching amendment european treaty national constitutions. this necessary fiscal union envisage expressly forbid exist legal framework. the aim amendment create reliable stable structure cannot simply change yet short term. an establish respect legal framework key precondition strong integration different nations. this process require certain amount time, indispensable. this fiscal union lack transparency, introduce circumvent exist regulation standards, leave whim everyday politics would build sand sustainable basis stability union. democratic legitimacy base broad public support amendment legal framework closely linked. while joint liability, example, irreversible, change eu fiscal rule might put negotiation time. example bi central bankers’ speech 7 experience deal rule stability growth pact well concrete design fiscal compact, fall short goal originally set. above all, germany perceptible stability contribution make give step integration. the recent past shown, however, that, monetary union, germany’s interest protect exist treaty german veto. from german perspective, therefore crucial consensus adopt cornerstone stability-oriented fiscal union that, agreed, secure way endure cannot change yet majority decision. by outline caveats, i mean argue deep integration, quite opposite. but exist decentralise framework euro area shortcomings, deep integration guarantee stable monetary union – especially take second step first. a stable monetary union depend “united state europe”, without stable currency match fiscal framework permanent stable political union. 4. conclusion lady gentleman i cover broad range topic past half-hour. the role monetary policy changing, far remove change fundamentally. it case resist strong encroachment – guide principle “course correction, go reverse”. the fiscal economic policy framework monetary union require far amendments. europe face pivotal decision stability union preserved, engage public debate precisely politically unpleasant questions. a monetary policy, responsible action also mean heed lesson past repeat early mistake – especially time upheaval. this message may appear simple, perhaps even dull. i nevertheless find helpful important. if everything flows, current situation, simply let carry along events. it precisely time like become even clear give support permanent value. thank attention. bi central bankers’ speech 1 yaseen anwar: manage systemically important financial institution (sifis) speech mr yaseen anwar, governor state bank pakistan, second meet financial stability board (fsb) regional consultative group asia, kuala lumpur, 14 may 2012. * * * lady gentlemen, good evening. it indeed pleasure kuala lumpur again, i grateful governor zeti invite lead discussant one key challenge regulatory reform agenda – “managing systemically important financial institutions”. in minutes, i cover need specific regulation sifis, progress make far design policy framework, perspective emerge market general pakistan particular, regulatory challenge face supervisory authorities, remain done. in aftermath global financial crisis (gfc) 2007–08, entire supervisory perspective towards financial institution regulation take u-turn. in pre crisis era, supervisory authorities, mainly advance countries, choose rely market discipline favor somewhat self regulation financial industry. the approach stem perception financial institution best position understand market risk associate financial products. overly prescriptive regulation think stifle innovation diversification – across border across activities. the prevail version international accord capital liquidity standards, basel ii, reinforce practice. most framework rely banks’ assessment risks. however gfc, particularly collapse lehman brother fall 2008, trigger problem throughout financial system across world change supervisory perspective towards financial industry regulations, particularly call “systemically important financial institution (sifis1)”. the lehman bankruptcy ensue financial instability loss real output bring forth several shortcoming international financial architecture expose risk result lack policy framework deal sifis. in pre-gfc era precisely institution deem quite invincible. however, huge cost implicit government guarantee let sifi fail adverse impact global financial stability, raise serious concern “too big fail” (tbtf) status sifis. post crisis era witness increase discussion change tbtf status sifis devise resolution regime well safe exit mechanism entities. resultantly, immediately lehman failure, saw international financial authority place financial sector reform top priority agenda. over last years, see increase realization among financial authority diversification may beneficial large bank idiosyncratic risk, similar pattern diversification many global bank across world actually contribute towards build systemic risk. further, also recognize prevail regulatory framework police sufficient address “negative externalities” large financial firm create. supervisory authority arrive consensus 1 sifi definition: an institution, market instrument consider systemically important failure malfunction cause widespread distress, either direct impact trigger broad contagion. the interpretation, however, nuanced authority focus impact financial system, others consider ultimate impact real economy key (financial stability board (2009)). negative externality associate institution perceive allow fail due size, interconnectedness, complexity key criterion identify sifis. 2 bi central bankers’ speech box 1: sifis identify either use model base approach contribution, participation bottom approach use set simple indicator bank size, interbank lending, interbank borrowing. a bi article “systemic importance: some simple indicator (2011)” empirically test find simple indicator reliable proxy model-based measure systemic importance. alternatively fsb propose three key indicator identify sifis. these size, interconnectedness complexity. whereas five indicator use designate global-sifis fsb are: size, interconnectedness, complexity, substitutability cross jurisdiction activity. sifis require enhance supervisory focus account relative size, interconnectedness market(s) complexity. to reduce probability failure institution minimize risk financial stability real economy, imperative strengthen regulatory framework enhance supervisory capacity deal sifis. before express view regulatory framework sifis, i would like appreciate commendable work do progress make fsb, bcbs multilateral agency financial reform agenda last years. enhance international accord capital liquidity standards; i.e. basel iii, set forth critical reform agenda improve solvency resilience financial institutions. a number policy measure supplement basel iii, among others, include framework deal global sifis (g-sifis). start initial “guidance ass systemic importance financial institutions, market instruments: initial considerations” issue november, 2009 jointly imf, fsb bis, substantial progress make tackle sifis challenge. a key development take place november, 2011, g-20 leader cannes summit endorse policy framework systemically important financial institution (g-sifis). a multipronged strategy adopt address g-sifis comprise new international standard resolution regimes, intensive effective supervision, requirement cross-border cooperation recovery resolution planning. one key issue concern sifis identification. the method use identification sifis vary widely – complex model simple indicator (see box 1 discussion method identify sifis). to facilitate process, fsb bcbs assign determine g-sifis resolution plan additional loss absorption requirement apply base methodology develop bcbs. accordingly, fsb bcbs identify 29 systemically important bank global level2 sample 73 banks. these include 25 bank usa western european block, 3 japan 1 china. fsb update list annually base assessment publically disclosed. to address great risk pose g-sifis, intensive regulatory approach prescribe them. they require meet additional loss absorbency requirement range 1% 2.5% risk weight asset (rwa). these requirement applicable phase start january 2016 full implementation january 2019. a per fsb bcbs assessment, long term economic benefit term great resilience institution additional loss absorbency requirement far exceed modest temporary decline gdp implementation horizon. another positive development front countries, notably switzerland, unite kingdom sweden already take action implement high capital requirement bank deem systemically important national level. recently, financial stability oversight council (fsoc) usa propose guidance 2 see annexure 1 list g-sifis fsb bi central bankers’ speech 3 process factor use designate non-bank financial institution sifis. some jurisdiction already adopt legislation improve resolution regime like germany, supervisory power significantly extend restructure resolve banks. on hand, many institution actively lobby identify sifi, additional significant regulatory requirement sifis endure. emerge market emerge economy financial system remain fairly resilient face recent crisis. it possible firstly financial system emerge economy primarily domestically active fis. this argument support fact 29 designate g-sifis3 one bank asia; “the bank china” could make list. secondly, financial system emerge economy remain relatively conservative – activity mainly center traditional bank business capital market financial institution remain relatively underdeveloped. the difference financial structure business model develop emerge economy raise concern regard relevance reform – mainly address cause gfc – emerge economies. moreover, since asian financial crisis 1997–98, financial authority carry extensive reform keen continuously monitor adapt change market conditions. nonetheless, common understand supervisory authority around world need give special attention sifis focus development specific, relevant appropriate regulatory standards. in regard, asian economy quite well aware issue involve implementation framework. firstly, emerge asia center global economic growth. to sustain growth, need financial intermediation also likely increase. while global consensus use public fund resolution sifis last resort, also circumstance use public fund may le costly economy excessively “taxing” bank system. asian economy must weigh cost new regulation institutions, perceive benefit regulation economy society. secondly, international standard must customize accord asian economy business models. the regulatory supervisory regime must target well-defined risk could systemic implications. pakistan’s perspective sifis pakistan small, open economy, domestically active financial sector. in term bank concentration, top 5 bank (all locally incorporated) account 51% industry assets; foreign asset system 10.4% total assets. moreover locally-incorporated bank foreign branch don’t significant exposure complex financial asset cause financial meltdown u.s. europe. apart conservative financial structure, i.e. le risky asset banks’ balance sheets, sbp always require bank meet high capital liquidity standards, exceed international norm several areas. more importantly, strong legal framework, test effectiveness last decade half. sbp successfully restructure number bank successfully demonstrate problem bank resolution regime. we already practice enhance supervision significant financial institutions, identify 3 17 europe, 8 u asia 3 japan 1 china. the initial sample 73 bank include australia, belgium, brazil, canada, china, france, germany, india, italy, japan, korea, netherlands, spain, sweden, switzerland, unite kingdom unite states. 4 bi central bankers’ speech size. the supervisory framework include quarterly review individual bank off-site surveillance, periodical special on-site inspection regular interaction banks’ aim reduce probability failure institutions. the multi-pronged strategy prove quite effective far. sbp ensure adequate safeguard place limit direct impact external shocks. not surprisingly, pakistan’s financial system withstand global financial crisis reasonably well. sbp vigilant towards change market dynamics, locally abroad, already process review pakistan’s bank industry vis-a-vis basel iii capital liquidity standards. regard deal sifis, high-frequent monitor in-depth supervision main tool deal large banks, essentially so-called sifis us. however, look forward development framework identify deal domestic sifis (d-sifis) fbs, bis, imf. till time framework global sifis may useful start point country like deal domestic sifis. in view that, already initiate assessment process. recently, conduct in-house study base simple indicator approach ass possibility domestic sifis pakistan; initial assessment suggest bank large market share term asset – systemically important banks. these find endorse early hold belief regard significance asset size pakistan’s bank industry. regulatory challenge there multiple challenge face regulatory authority design implement framework sifis identification, implementation cross border resolution – accelerate reform domestic resolution regime tool framework cross-border enforcement resolution actions. one major issue highlight crisis gap legal framework deal fail financial institutions. though capital buff help build resilience, however, cannot avoid failures. therefore gap legal framework must address sifis, too, must able exit market orderly manner without expose taxpayer risk loss. emerge economy need cautious adopt regulatory framework propose sifis. a detail assessment possible legal, regulatory economic implication imperative adopt customize sifi regulatory framework one’s financial structure. an important challenge regulator develop framework allow financial sector grow, innovate, support need economy, without compromise stability financial system. nonetheless, effective framework deal sifis would include combination strong market discipline; capital buffers; comprehensive recovery resolution arrangements; strengthen market infrastructure reduce probability failure. go forward in near future expect see development area manage sifis, particularly d-sifis. a highlight above, fsb already work basel committee extend framework d-sifis. the selection criterion expect resemble g-sifis, institution place different “buckets” accord size, interconnectedness, lack substitutability. once framework introduce november year, expect detail deliberation implementation new framework emerge develop economies. development resolution regime remain key element d-sifis framework, make sure critical function financial institution continue event failure. give involve legislative processes, move towards development bi central bankers’ speech 5 resolution regime may somewhat slow. therefore, emerge market develop economy (emde), take lead propose framework g-sifis, need start work development resolution regime rather wait final d-sifis framework. another important issue emerge market economy stability perspective account presence foreign financial institutions. the regulator emerge market may fully equip understand risk profile globally active institution operate countries. risk also arise due financial interlinkages emerge foreign financial markets. for host emerge economy, important issue possible market disruption adverse impact local lend decision depositor safeguard result problem parent institution level. regulatory college therefore encourage home regulator across regions. the practice conduct regulatory college systemically important institution would assist regulator deal global issue coordinate manner. i would like point regulation monitor sifis one aspect overall macro-prudential regulations. in order implement complete reform agenda, sifis framework need dovetail initiative financial stability. these may include elaborate crisis management framework, work countercyclical measures, framework effective resolution problem institutions, legal cover enforcement etc. increase coordination among authority top level well operational level critical successful implementation global financial agenda. for purpose, need establish work committee regional consultative group term reference. i therefore propose establishment

heterogeneity monetary union: what learned? speech peter praet, member executive board ecb, 14th ecb watcher conference, frankfurt main, 15 june 2012. * * * i would like thank maarten dossche arthur saint-guilhem contribution preparation speech. it great pleasure speak today has, years, become prime opportunity european central bank exchange view ecb watcher challenge face monetary policy euro area. my remark today focus question imbalance term competitiveness private public sector debt gradually lead worry degree heterogeneity euro area. i also highlight effect ecb’s liquidity-providing operations, argue contribute homogeneous financial condition across euro area allow smooth adjustment process transitional period need order reabsorb accumulate imbalances. i will, however, also argue operation regard temporary support, underlie structural problem weakness require truly structural response complete overall architecture emu. when euro first introduced, many critic claim emu would work euro area countries’ business cycle economic structure sufficiently similar. but economic integration really need imply economic uniformity? i think so. this clearly see unite states. regional economy hit different economic shock perform differently owe differ economic structures, even extend periods. at time, institutional safeguard require order ensure heterogeneous development become self-reinforcing pose threat overall macroeconomic stability. here euro area, acknowledge economic condition have, today, become increasingly heterogeneous. but let state clearly front imply common currency cannot succeed euro area. to mind, mean need address institutional shortcoming weakness emu order allow euro area cope heterogeneous economic development large asymmetric shocks, case unite states. there, too, economic monetary union occur overnight; long process. otmar issing1 argued, decade ago, “one size must fit all”. provide institution adapt, emu beneficial all. since introduction euro, many u aware institutional deficiencies, term prevention imbalance regard management imbalance event crisis. the crisis force u address deficiencies. allow me, remainder remarks, look imbalance arise euro area ecb’s monetary policy respond them. 1 issing, o., “the single monetary policy european central bank: one size fit all”, international finance, 4:3, 2001, pp. 441–462. 2 bi central bankers’ speech how imbalance arise euro area? financial uniformity increase imbalance the situation prior financial crisis best describe one euro area country achieve high degree convergence term financial conditions, time large macroeconomic financial imbalance gradually accumulating. with advent euro, significant convergence term financial condition various euro area countries. euro area bank able trade one another unify money market. consequently, also significant convergence term interest rate bank charge household firms. indeed, necessary condition single monetary policy affect economic agent way. however, sovereign bond various euro area country also price rate similar, rate bear little relation fiscal macroeconomic fundamental individual countries. with benefit hindsight, puzzle outcome. clearly, single monetary policy imply single money market interest rate, well single long-term risk-free interest rate. and inflation expectation converge across euro area, sovereign bond yield could expect become le dispersed. however, despite single monetary policy, difference default risk individual countries, consumer firm remained. but financial market le wary risks, thereby establish improper incentive public private sector borrowers. one simple summary indicator degree economic heterogeneity cross-country inflation differentials. these reflect difference country term business cycle, productivity growth function labour product markets. they also affect countries’ real interest rates, well international price competitiveness good services. monetary union result inflation differential euro area fall level comparable unite states. however, although two inflation differential similar size, persistence see euro area remain much greater, point possible existence macroeconomic imbalances. a result, since introduction euro, persistent inflation differential euro area give rise divergence relative price twice large one observe unite states. (slide 2) the main driver persistent inflation differential relate cross-country difference observe since introduction euro implementation structural reform little real convergence so-called “balassa-samuelson effects”. in euro area countries, government fail implement necessary reform product labour markets. consequently, wage growth exceed productivity growth price rise fast countries. (slide 3) these inflation differential lead divergent development international competitiveness contribute accumulation unprecedented current account position euro area. (slide 4) in number countries, lead economic activity gradually shift away export-oriented manufacture industry towards domestically orient construction sector. because sectoral reallocation typically slow process, difficult readjust countries’ economy quickly response crisis. in addition, country high degree downward wage rigidity, impediment rapid adjustment. accumulation private public sector debt country moreover, persistently high inflation rate country imply persistently low real interest rates, particularly light high degree convergence term nominal lend rates. country low real interest rate experience strong credit growth house booms, place pressure wage prices. (slide 5) low real bi central bankers’ speech 3 interest rate also mean easy government borrow, slow fiscal consolidation. government adopt sufficiently counter-cyclical policy limit accumulation debt counteract accumulation debt private sector. in fact, economic boom base strong domestic consumption rise property prices, lead improvement cyclical fiscal balance long boom go on, government incentive tighten fiscal policy bust set in.2 the accumulation imbalance exacerbate institutional deficiency the question naturally arise unsustainable degree heterogeneity occur euro area unite states. in unite states, regional imbalance tend mean-reverting, owe high level labour mobility flexible product labour markets. at time, also le scope unsustainable accumulation debt state level. most state adopt legislation prevent accumulate level debt see euro area.3 the institutional design euro area clearly give rise moral hazard lack capacity credibly engage measure prevent rise imbalances.4 although unseen accumulation debt euro area countries, financial market allow set financial condition way private public sector borrower country could essentially continue borrow interest rate borrower country much sound fiscal macroeconomic fundamentals. a result, financial flow run country strong productivity growth country weak productivity growth, fuel persistent economic boom base accumulation debt. to efficient, financial flow instead run towards country high level productivity growth. heterogeneity crisis ecb’s response the financial crisis lead strong increase heterogeneity within euro area. the re-emergence cross-country differential term financial condition contribute divergence macroeconomic financial fundamentals. conversely, heterogeneous financial condition mainly reflect persistent fiscal, macroeconomic financial imbalances, well persistent structural problem several countries. the first dimension heterogeneity concern real developments. some country recover well others continue affect persistent structural problems. but macroeconomic imbalance begin adjust. competitiveness improve country labour cost use persistently exceed euro area average. that said, adjustment remain limited. sizeable imbalance persist, particularly high level public private sector debt vulnerability financial sector. look ahead, essence government policy decisively address various fiscal, financial structural impediment growth. this bring second – evident – dimension heterogeneity, namely sharp divergence observe financial condition euro area countries. in course crisis, secure unsecured money market become increasingly impaired, 2 see, instance, bénétrix, a. lane, p., fiscal cyclicality emu, trinity college dublin, mimeo, 2012. 3 see, instance, henning, r. kessler, m., “fiscal federalism: u history architect europe’s fiscal union”, bruegel essay lecture series, 2012. 4 see, instance, persson, t. tabellini, g., “federal fiscal constitutions: risk share moral hazard”, econometrica, 64, 1996, pp. 623–646. 4 bi central bankers’ speech especially across national borders. countries’ sovereign bond yield diverge significantly. corporate bond market also experience tensions. overall, ample evidence country-specific factor become important drive yields. the emergence fragment financial market within euro area begin aftermath lehman brothers’ default intensify follow onset sovereign debt crisis may 2010. financial integration come halt partly reversed, see fact non-bank debt security increasingly purchase domestically, non-domestic euro area holder sell bonds. (slide 6) euro area countries’ financial sector retreat within national borders. a result fragment financial conditions, transmission ecb’s monetary policy stance interest rate increasingly impaired. moreover, bank country government finance strain face restrict access money market source financing, give interconnectedness bank sovereign states. have allow continue, fund restriction would probably hamper growth credit household non-financial corporations. this, combine deleveraging needs, could result “credit crunch” several part euro area, negative consequence economy price stability euro area. in react exceptional degree heterogeneity, ecb’s monetary policy continue guide objective ensure price stability euro area whole. key ecb interest rate reduce significantly. in addition, non-standard measure adopt order support function transmission mechanism bring back liquidity dysfunctional markets. for instance, light constraint fund market banks, maturity longer-term refinance operation successively extended, culminate three-year operation conduct december 2011 february 2012. follow operations, fund constraint eased, money market spread declining. (slides 7 8) moreover, already broad collateral framework extend further, correspond risk control measure mitigate eurosystem’s exposure risk. this make easy collateral-constrained bank continue participate refinance operations. overall, banks’ recourse refinance operation particularly strong country bad affect crisis. while open all, ecb’s non-standard measure use intensively country face financial stress. cross-country difference use non-standard measure thus largely reflect heterogeneity financial condition across euro area. our policy measure help reduce heterogeneity financial condition thereby ensure smooth transmission monetary policy across euro area. the extent heterogeneity banks’ finance need also infer national central banks’ balance target2. these balance reflect national central banks’ net claim liability result commercial banks’ cross-border payment target2. the increase net liability national central bank reflection mainly fund stress individual bank systems, financial outflow compensate increase recourse eurosystem refinance operations. (slide 9) our policy measure have, particular, increase ecb’s intermediation banks. look interbank market, reduce willingness lend, especially across borders, hamper distribution liquidity bank need it, particularly bank country face financial stress. increase deposit hold eurosystem bank financially strong country see indication degree disintermediation money market. (slide 10) bank country tend recipient cross-border payment flow therefore need le central bank liquidity bank country face financial stress. the surplus central bank liquidity bank financially strong country raise concern liquidity could fuel asset price bubble part euro area, bi central bankers’ speech 5 potentially pose threat price stability. these concern warrant current juncture. thus far, moderate recovery see asset prices. a regard house market, development money credit – traditionally good lead indicator boom house price – remain subdued. however, continue pay close attention developments. conclusion to sum up, measure adopt ecb contribute great homogeneity pass-through policy rate economy, view maintain price stability. however, monetary policy cannot provide last solution underlie problem cause persistent heterogeneity. while ecb help ensure smooth adjustment process offer temporary relief, cannot replace necessary structural adjustment. instead, government need act variety policy area – particularly regard fiscal consolidation, structural reform financial stability – within reinforce governance framework european level. this way put euro area back sustainable growth path. the crisis highlight several shortcoming institutional framework emu, need addressed. this framework fail ensure sound fiscal discipline euro area countries, well prevent correct accumulation financial competitiveness imbalances. crisis management financial sector repair – rescue resolution financial institution – leave national authorities, despite considerable cross-border activity financial sector. we saw clearly interconnectedness bank sovereign state lead adverse feedback loop sovereign bank financial conditions, significant consequence macroeconomic stability euro area whole. several step already take view enhance governance framework emu improve prevention correction fiscal, macroeconomic competitiveness imbalances. at time, overhaul framework financial supervision regulation initiated. finally, firewall crisis management instrument establish order safeguard financial stability, particularly address risk contagion across country financial market segments. look ahead, step need take order supplement single monetary policy integrate framework bank supervision, resolution deposit insurance, well far extensive coordination government policy affect competitiveness. a president say morning, achieve this, euro area country inevitably need surrender national sovereignty increase coordination national policies. the global economy become increasingly integrated. the importance national sovereignty wan result increase economic interdependence global level. it illusion think that, integrate world, country able decouple development countries. thank attention. 6 bi central bankers’ speech bi central bankers’ speech 7 8 bi central bankers’ speech bi central bankers’ speech 9 10 bi central bankers’ speech bi central bankers’ speech 1 miguel fernández ordóñez: presentation 2011 annual report address mr miguel fernández ordóñez, governor bank spain, govern council bank spain presentation 2011 annual report, madrid, 8 june 2012. * * * lady gentlemen, the presentation annual report 2011 take place extremely difficult set europe general, spain particular, mark acute euro area sovereign debt crisis double-dip recession spanish economy. the year 2011 characterise worsen euro area sovereign debt crisis. initially affect small number country situation relative vulnerability, spread others sound economic fundamentals, duly turn systemic. the fresh downturn euro zone detract area’s recovery also one main determinant halt ongoing pick-up world growth begin year earlier. two main factor lay behind crisis. first, insufficient adaptation domestic economic policy demand monetary union membership, translate build-up major imbalance place economy position vulnerability. and second, lack political consensus european level tackle weakness euro’s institutional design, largely explain spread tension country whose misalignment less scale. throughout 2011 2012 date, positive step taken. several country launch ambitious fiscal adjustment programme undertake bank system recapitalisation restructure processes. and structural reform labour market service sector approved. also, europe-wide scale, debt-ceiling monitor mechanism reinforced, procedure sanction non-compliance. further, new treaty stability, coordination governance, move promote explicit recognition commitment budgetary stability national legislations. along progress fiscal realm, new framework establish prevent correct macroeconomic imbalances. this excessive imbalance procedure, known, instrumental early detection vulnerability set place necessary corrective measures. with establishment european stability mechanism, likewise headway create permanent crisis-management mechanism. in sum, significant progress. but frequently change have, market say, “behind curve”; implementation excessively slow subject many frictions, fuel investor doubt ability european government move forward forge consensus matter pivotal governance area. under conditions, ecb action decisive preserve stability area. when debt market tension rear second half 2011, ecb react various measures. these gear confirm expansionary stance monetary policy, restore function transmission mechanism break feedback loop bank system risk sovereign risk. in addition, significant non-conventional measure approved. these include notably lengthen horizon liquidity loan term three years, two special auction hold december 2011 february 2012. the three-pronged measure adopt – span domestic economic policies, european governance reform and, notably, ecb action – prove essential contain heighten tensions, might lead systemic crisis unforeseeable 2 bi central bankers’ speech consequences. that said, measure conclusive solution; simply help gain valuable time government could continue move resolve challenge outstanding measure adopt might begin bear fruit. to definitively resolve european sovereign crisis require major progress various fields. in short term, ongoing reform governance must complete put practice, include full start-up european stability mechanism. a suitable balance must also strike two complementary objectives: fiscal consolidation economic growth. here, “fiscal package” agree end 2011 must supplement new “growth package”. look medium term, profound reflection need euro area want 10 years’ time. this crisis highlight vulnerability may emerge monetary union lack common fiscal financial policies. it thus worth consider great transfer sovereignty areas. on home front, challenge spanish economy face enormous. the late episode sovereign debt crisis severely impact agents’ confidence economy’s finance conditions, place position extreme vulnerability. follow two consecutive quarter negative growth, economy recession prospect recovery immediate. moreover, prolong cyclical weakness prevent swift headway redress public finance reduce private-sector debt, cast doubt resilience financial system. that trigger tension debt market activate perverse feedback loops. lastly, spanish economy risk see capacity obtain external fund severely blocked. while short run actually constrain ordinary fund flow (given bank system’s possibility resort ecb funding), prolongation situation extremely harmful medium term. spain situation despite fact authority implement far-reaching reform recent year resolve inefficiency economic functioning, correct serious deterioration public finance redress restructure financial system, order restore finance flows. resolve problem take long expected, lead reform fatigue. it important persevere economic policy action undertaken. in way level competitiveness need ensure smooth function euro area may regained, ordinary fund channel restore imbalance build recent years, particular relation public finances, finally corrected. these requirement must meet economy begin generate employment grow. the adjustment continue fall domestic demand, weigh correction imbalances, fiscal consolidation drive tight finance conditions. the external sector continue soften impact domestic spend activity, due buoyancy export slackness import rest world, contribution insufficient halt decline output. in setting, job destruction continue apace 2011 2012 date. and, owe uncertain prospect spanish economy, turnaround expect short term. however, episode progressively overcome, approve labour market reform foreseeably favourable impact employment generation, contribute adjust work condition firms’ specific circumstance provide efficient reallocation productive resources, ultimately prompt increase productivity levels. the cyclical weakness adverse behaviour labour market feed sufficiently cost price-formation mechanism, still show considerable inertia. the adjustment unit labour cost achieve primarily thank high productivity bi central bankers’ speech 3 gain bring job destruction, ease inflation correct less extent gap build upturn. this behaviour highlight slow imperfect function competitiveness channel, principle lead containment price cost economy accumulate big external misalignments. indeed, achieve last improvement competitiveness require great cost price adjustment productivity gain associate genuine improvement productive efficiency. however, since 2007 spanish economy’s external deficit substantially corrected, dip 10% gdp 2007 3.4% gdp 2011. underpin narrow deficit buoyancy export sluggishness imports, step weakness domestic demand. notwithstanding, culmination adjustment conditional upon certain element deficit energy balance magnitude investment income payment component, negative balance equivalent 2.7% gdp 2011, closely relate high level international investment position. these factor accentuate importance reform contribute correct deficit boost sustainable competitive gain medium long term. the correction imbalance particularly press reliance external save become major factor vulnerability spanish economy crisis. the increase dependence external finance pre-crisis period consequence sizeable accumulation debt household firms, also lead spanish bank system become oversized. the need correct imbalance pose add difficulty recovery economy, give restrict headroom available raise investment consumption resort external financing. it also crucial continue restructure bank system. hence, solvent demand recovers, may service normal flow finance which, spain rest continental europe, rout essentially credit institutions. but household firm still relatively lengthy process debt reduction ahead them. accordingly, short term, recovery growth cannot credit-led past. along lines, credit non-financial private sector 2011 fell around 4%, although significant difference sector sector. in case household pace debt reduction somewhat slower, whereas firm reduction credit mark sectors, construction real estate development, become oversized great extent crisis. in contrast, need adjustment le large corporation whose growth largely base increase geographical diversification. all forego factor influence pattern exit recession. the need reduce debt level will, couple fiscal consolidation demands, continue limit possibility expand domestic spending, mean recovery turn net external demand. at time, necessary begin reverse dynamic external debt, require progress attain balance foreign trade position, overcome obstacle pose high investment income component dependence energy imports. a pick-up competitiveness thus pivotal external demand stand shortcoming domestic demand boost growth supply side, current circumstance way forward. to overcome crisis economic policy gear medium term need help complete correction macroeconomic imbalance still place, restructure sector allow structural reform outstanding tackled. 4 bi central bankers’ speech fiscal consolidation unavoidable growth medium term restored, despite fact scale time adjustment require may adverse effect short term. this strategy available restore market confidence. compliance objective set require rigorous budgetary implementation, level government contribute. the strengthen budgetary framework recent budgetary stability law assist connection. the law set explicit ceiling deficit debt level line demand european level, include strict report requirement new coercive mechanism ensure compliance tier government fiscal targets. the fiscal consolidation strategy also take account medium long-term consideration affect public finances, particular associate population ageing, namely spend pension health care. lastly, say weakness labour market growth main factor behind limit progress correct budget deficit 2011. without recovery employment growth, costly long run pursue fiscal consolidation, boost structural reform must priority. among these, promote so-called flexicurity full vital, complement fresh liberalisation drive market good service conducive competition, train new technologies, innovation improvement human capital. another key economic policy priority continue ongoing clean-up, recapitalisation restructure spanish bank system. since 2009, measure area adhere set common principles, although change economic condition market mean government adjust them. these principle include notably limit far possible use public fund minimise length time state stake banks; promote integration restructure process counter excessive fragmentation size sector; pursue clean-up bank balance sheet withstand asset quality impairment; reinforce bank solvency; resolve structural weakness save bank model, promote transparency. among measure adopt 2011 annual report refer royal decree-law (rdl) 2/2011 strengthen financial system. this legislation raise core capital requirement 8% generally, 10% unlisted bank high dependence wholesale funding, doubt greatest. to ensure bank could meet requirements, decide fund orderly restructure bank sector (frob) act backstop. further, rdl stipulate obligation institution require public aid operate banks, aim reinforce fund-raise capacity, transparency towards investors. these measures, along pension reform, contribute positively ease market tension witness first half 2011, risk premium fall one point 200 bp. follow approval rdl, bank authority focus ensure compliance legislation, pursue bank integration process implement business model change arise amend regulation govern save banks. under provision rdl, 13 bank increase capital €13 billion, mean second stress test conduct european bank authority, capital increase needed. however, crisis worsen spread summer 2011, community authority demand temporary increase capital requirement large bank creation temporary extraordinary buff associate potential sovereign debt portfolio losses. these new requirement apply five large spanish banks, additional capital need somewhat €26 billion calculated. bi central bankers’ speech 5 a result developments, significant progress clean-up restructure spanish bank system. from onset crisis begin year, provision around 13% gdp set aside, bank shore solvency significantly increase capital, save bank convert bank around 30 institution disappeared, management pass case sound efficient banks. a regard sector’s capacity size banks, staff office number fell around 12%, stand similar figure end-2004, average size bank term asset increase twofold. yet progress enough restore investors’ confidence soundness bank system. give double-dip recession, insufficient reduction budget deficit continue effect sovereign debt crisis, doubt persist quality construction real estate development-related assets. in attempt dispel uncertainty, various measure adopt first half 2012. further principle govern ongoing restructure financial system, measure address accelerate clean-up bank balance sheets, reinforce solvency, boost integration process promote transparency. rdl 2/2012, approve february, stipulate increase provision construction real estate development-related assets, creation capital buff cover potential loss arise problem loan associate land ongoing developments. more recently, may 2012, government approve rdl 18/2012, clean-up sale financial-sector real estate assets. the aim dispel doubt quality spanish credit institutions’ non-doubtful real estate portfolio. to this, provision construction real estate development-related asset classify trouble raise substantially, bring forward impact potential additional impairment portfolio. bank undergo capital shortfall result new requirement reinforce capital, resort financial aid frob necessary. overall, clean-up capital increase arise two rdls approve year see considerable reinforcement bank system’s buff potential losses. indeed, measure fully implemented, provision set aside spanish bank sector since early 2008 amount close 19% gdp. in addition, legislation demand problem foreclosure transfer asset management companies, programme private appraiser value entire credit portfolio bank sector set train. allow conclude reflection two issue i consider important: restore confidence, importance independent regulatory agencies. in difficult circumstance face spanish economy, critical variable neither growth unemployment, matter serious recent development been, rather deterioration confidence. the priority aim action authority restore lose confidence, since without resume growth job creation possible. the low level confidence hit recent month week mean resolve spain’s fiscal financial problem become difficult costly. the potential impact confidence should, therefore, primary determinant action authorities, political representative economic agents. here particular effort make explain decision adopt different level government spain well-received value markets, structural reforms, pension reform recent organic law budgetary stability, among others. there likewise common effort, interest sector spanish economy, disseminate address depth additional measure shortly adopt tackle crisis. there important press task short term restore lose confidence. and here, collaboration call politician economic social agent position responsibility, institution economic policymaking responsibilities. 6 bi central bankers’ speech a fundamental determinant confidence credibility regulatory supervisory institutions, base ability exercise power professionally independently. this always essential element country’s economic reputation, confidence call question recovery growth depend external finance economy. adam smith observe famous work wealth nation closely relate open trade was. and today see rich democratically sound country world competent independent regulatory supervisory agency act counterweight government potentially succumb interventionist temptations. internationally, currently accept government important task perform financial field. these may include design restructure strategies, determine resolution instruments, decide use public funds, etc. but also broad consensus task implement independent regulator supervisors. by assign regulatory supervisory remit independent institution act use sound technical criteria, danger decision subject vagary politics lobby group interest remove extent. reason technical capability also come play. independent professional supervisor time resource build enormously rich knowledge which, give particular characteristic financial activity, essential tackle problem sector, minimise error unwanted side-effects time. have independent regulatory supervisory institution mean guarantee mistake made. but presence ensure decision taint momentary political considerations. i cannot say banco de españa, supervisory mission, occasionally mistaken. but i assure decision banco de españa always base exclusively professional criteria. this important facet independence. independence something innate. it label badge confer anyone. independence demonstrated, exercise exercised. nobody independent are, rather do. but another important aspect ensure independence institution prevent government interest group affect independence. in specific case banco de españa, respect authority independence reputation crucial maintain confidence bank system home abroad, overcome major challenge currently face. naturally, respect independence regulatory supervisory agency unavoidably accompany obligation part account performance function parliament. such accountability representative nation obligation agency also right, since transparency provide parliament mainstay safeguard independence institution possible interference authority interest groups. allow thank here, deputy governor, govern council member director general, bank’s staff collaboration past six years. i deeply recognise competence dedication discharge important responsibilities. but i like conclude express particular appreciation participate supervisory function banco de españa past years. bank supervision, bank regulation legal service involve major action affect vulnerable institutions, as, instance, remove manager 30 credit institutions, convert save bank commercial bank assess numerous clean-up recapitalisation plans, comply time bi central bankers’ speech 7 mandate different government minimise use taxpayer funds. it tell image (measured ratings) major bank systematically world’s 23 big bank throughout crisis until, recent weeks, downward spiral downgrade ensue doubt bank system whole spread. but time despondency. i convince that, time put everybody place, work year crisis acknowledge rightly appreciate all. thank you. bi central bankers’ speech 1 daniel k tarullo: shadow bank financial crisis speech mr daniel k tarullo, member board governor federal reserve system, federal reserve bank san francisco conference “challenges global finance: role asia”, san francisco, california, 12 june 2012. * * * the three decade precede financial crisis characterize unite state progressive integration traditional lend capital market activities. this trend diminish importance deposit source fund credit extension favor capital market instrument sell institutional investors. it also alter structure financial service industry, transform activity broker-dealer foster emergence large financial conglomerates. although structure foreign bank system le noticeably changed, many foreign bank draw increasingly result wholesale fund market make significant investment mortgage-backed security proliferate first decade century. the financial crisis underscore failure american regulatory system keep pace development reveal need two reform agendas. one must aim specifically problem too-big-to-fail institutions. the must direct so-called shadow bank system, refer credit intermediation involve leverage maturity transformation partly wholly outside traditional bank system. a i note occasions, reform date concentrate too-big-to-fail institutions, though many reform yet fully implemented. the shadow bank system, hand, obliquely addressed, despite fact acute phase crisis precipitate run system. indeed, oversight regulate institution strengthened, opportunity arbitrage shadow bank system may increase. today i want focus development regulatory reform agenda shadow bank system. a follow academic policy debate know, significant, ongoing disagreement concern role various factor contribute rapid growth shadow bank system, precise dynamic run 2007 2008, relative social utility element system. conclusion draw debate important eventually frame broadly direct regulatory plan shadow bank system. however, neither necessary wise await conclusion order begin implement regulatory response, i follow discussion vulnerability create shadow bank suggestion near- medium-term reforms. fragility shadow bank system it purpose today discus history complex nature shadow bank system. there rich grow academic literature devote task. however, i want identify feature shadow bank reasonably well-established particularly salient reform efforts. first, many respect foremost, bear note use term “shadow banking” refer simply function credit intermediation maturity transformation. shadow bank also refer creation asset think safe, short-term, liquid, such, “cash equivalents” similar insure deposit commercial bank system. of course, many financial market actor learn dismay, period stress asset insure deposits. 2 bi central bankers’ speech the year precede financial crisis saw surge volume dollar-denominated, seemingly safe, seemingly liquid financial instruments. the causal interplay factor lead surge still actively debated. but seem reasonably clear rise demand investor safe, liquid asset tool precautionary transactional liquidity rise demand short-term finance certain borrower – notably financial intermediary look fund longer-term asset – play important, probably reciprocally reinforce roles. example investor demand safe, liquid asset hard identify. one source foreign official investors, mostly emerge market countries, invest $1.6 trillion unite state four year precede crisis, largely u.s. treasury agency securities. much activity arise investment foreign exchange reserve country run large current account surpluses. some reserve undoubtedly build precautionary measure light financial problem emerge market late 1990s, others attendant policy manage exchange rates. this official sector demand safe asset largely entirely focus u.s. government securities, rather cash equivalents. but source demand absorb roughly 80 percent increase u.s. treasury agency security four-year period, potentially crowd investor thereby increase demand cash equivalent appear comparable safety liquidity. a second source demand nonfinancial firms, respond market disruption associate default enron firm decade ago boost hold cash. the pressure hold large amount cash likely increase major rat agency begin publish liquidity risk assessment nonfinancial firms. a third source demand cash equivalent result adoption elaborate investment strategy many institutional investors. for example, investor use derivative short-selling part overall strategies, need cash cash-like instrument margining collateral purposes. moreover, course, amount asset professional management increased, demand safe, liquid investment also inevitably increased, since intermediary need place park fund await investment need meet unexpected withdrawals. the grow demand safe liquid asset meet largely shadow bank system’s creation asset seemingly safe seemingly liquid.1 new variety shadow-banking activity created, pre-existing type grow larger, shadow bank system become much internationalized. for example, volume asset-backed commercial paper, abcp, grow enormously. many abcp vehicle issue short-term, highly rat liability buy longer-term, highly rat securities, often mortgage-backed securities. many vehicle sponsor abroad, especially european banks, issue dollar-denominated abcp u.s. market buy dollar-denominated asset u.s. market. the overall volume activity large, although net flow u.s. europe not, leave european bank sponsor abcp vehicle huge exposure market participant stop believe abcp risk-free. 1 insure demand deposit traditional bank help meet need large investors, limit extent. such account unattractive large investor limit scale federal deposit insurance corporation (fdic) deposit insurance; large deposit are, beyond insurance cap, effectively unsecured exposure single bank, small deposit multiple bank inconvenient. the expansion fdic insurance noninterest bear accounts, regardless size – occur november 2008 schedule expire end year – make deposit attractive heavily utilized. bi central bankers’ speech 3 it seem clear tail risk associate many shadow-banking instrument understand many market actors, include seller buyers. an important contribute factor buyers’ side help set stage 2007–2008 financial crisis widespread acceptance risk-free asset could create augment already think low-risk asset promise large financial institution provide liquidity bear credit loss unlikely event support might needed. when, stress conditions, credibility promise come question, susceptibility run increase dramatically. in cases, explicit contractual provision liquidity support credit enhancements, provide abcp vehicle sponsor banks. in cases, support implicit, convey market asset historical pattern provide support. form implicit credit support present variety important fund channel and, considerable degree, persist today. three example money market funds, triparty repo market, security lending. money market fund aim maintain stable net asset value one dollar per share meet redemption request upon demand. a model nonbank “deposit” cash equivalent.2 unlike mutual funds, money market fund allow round net asset value one dollar per share long underlie value share remain within one-half cent dollar. but drop unrounded net asset value one-half one percent cause money fund “break buck”, scenario losses, least theory, would pass along fund’s investors. however, fund sponsor historically absorb loss whenever necessary prevent fund break buck, two exceptions. even though legal obligation so, sponsor voluntarily support fund 100 time 1989 2003, presumably allow fund break buck would damage sponsor’s reputation franchise. this tendency well understand investors. indeed, standard reference book money market state “money fund run entity deep pockets, may federal insurance, certainly something akin private insurance . . . likely prove adequate cover loss sustain fund”.3 many money fund sustain significant capital loss market asset-backed commercial paper collapse summer fall 2007. a previous decades, loss money fund absorb funds’ sponsors. indeed, money fund see highly safe 2007 receive large net inflow concern portion financial system increased. but when, 2008, reserve primary fund provide support relatively small loss money market fund, illusion money fund effectively safe insure bank account shattered. a general run money fund ensued. within two days, investor withdraw nearly $200 billion prime money market funds, 10 percent assets. this contribute severe fund pressure issuer commercial paper. the run ultimately prompt – stop – unprecedented intervention treasury federal reserve provide insurance liquidity support industry. 2 see patrick mccabe (2010), “the cross section money market fund risk financial crises”, finance economics discussion series 2010–51 (washington: board governor federal reserve system, september). 3 anthony crescenzi marcia stigum (2007), stigum’s money market, 4th ed. (new york: mcgraw-hill) p. 1117. 4 bi central bankers’ speech a second example triparty repo market, grow $2.8 trillion outstanding finance early 2007. in general, repo, “repurchase agreement”, sale security agreement repurchase security late date; economics repos similar short-term loan collateralize longer-term assets. so-called triparty repos, typically use broker-dealer raise finance cash-rich institution money market funds, insurance companies, central banks, utilize particular settlement mechanism. the third party triparty market clear bank, handle settlement account hold institution broker-dealer cash borrower cash lenders. because composition size broker-dealers’ inventory change rapidly level trade activity, broker-dealer find flexible inexpensive short-term finance offer triparty repos extremely attractive. to extent borrow appear riskless lenders, broker-dealer potential supplier triparty repos safe, liquid asset demand. broker-dealer borrow triparty repo market want access security routine trade purpose – example, make delivery client day. to allow that, market develop critical operational feature call “daily unwind”. each day, clear bank “unwind” repo trades, return security borrower cash lenders, even longer-dated term transactions. however, security still require finance day. to end, borrower rely intraday overdraft two major clear banks. at end day, transaction “re-wound”. thus, risk associate portfolio security fully transfer twice day. the lender market widely believe two clear bank would always unwind mature trade morning, return cash account, despite contractual provision require clear bank so. the fact lender believe protect way clear bank help perpetuate illusion that, particularly lend overnight, invest money-like asset would always highly liquid safe, even though reality borrower usually entity could go bankrupt. this illusion fade financial crisis progressed. significant strain create concern financial strength broker-dealers, uncertainty value underlie collateral, belated recognition clear bank contractually obligate unwind mature trades. only prospect dealer failure become real – example, case countrywide’s broker-dealer affiliate august 2007 bear stearns march 2008 – lender appear see risk clearly. in addition, presume stabilize function collateral weakened, since default dealer clear bank could leave lender security post collateral desire, operational capacity, even, cases, legal authority hold, least liquidate orderly way. the response point flee, ignore protection putatively afford collateral. only unprecedented official-sector action triparty repo market suffer kind disastrous run money market funds. a broad run triparty repos would severely impact major broker-dealer thus u.s. security industry whole. the primary dealer credit facility – institute emergency basis immediately failure bear stearns – provide emergency lend dealers, inject liquidity system, provide backstop reassure markets. this public-sector support prevail implicit private-sector support come question, help stabilize triparty repo market. my third example fund channel characterize tacit credit support security lend market, drive large part demand security financial institution want establish short position need collateral support transactions. security lender market typically owner large pool security bi central bankers’ speech 5 pension plans, endowments, insurance companies. the security borrower post collateral, usually cash unite states, custodian bank typically invest behalf security lender supposedly safe liquid investments, include money market funds, triparty repos, short-term instruments. the gain reinvestment activity provide significant amount – cases, – compensation security lender associate participate lend program.4 the custodian bank universally provide contractual indemnification security lender require absorb loss security lender security returned. but investment returns, risk loss reinvestment cash collateral would return borrower securities, generally cover indemnifications. nonetheless, number security lender seem believe otherwise, many case expectation fulfil custodian bank agree financial crisis bear least loss cash collateral reinvestment programs. although experience money market funds, triparty repos, security lend vary details, share common underlie pathology: offer document stern warn notwithstanding, explicit implicit commitment combine history discretionary support create assumption, even among sophisticate investors, low-risk asset free credit liquidity risk – effectively cash, slightly high return. this risk illusion lead pervasive underprice risk embed money-like instrument make artificially cheap source funding. the consequent oversupply instrument contribute importantly systemic risk. reliance private mechanism create seemingly riskless asset generally work relatively calm year lead financial crisis and, extent, well crisis. but, many cases, discretionary support come question time acute financial-market stress, precisely need most, question arise ability willingness large financial institution follow implicit commitments. investor remind potential exposure, lead wholesale sometimes disorderly flight. the unwind risk illusion help transform dramatic correction real estate valuation – would serious consequence economy – crisis threaten entire financial system. shape regulatory response ideally, regulatory response shadow bank system would ground full understand dynamic drive rapid growth, social utility intermediation activities, risk create. such response would comprehensive, mean would cover effective efficient manner activity create vulnerabilities, without regard activity denominated, transaction form used, conducted. of course, many key issue still debated, even agree desirability comprehensive response may differ basic form. we continue seek analytic policy consensus must precede creation regulatory program meet conditions. more work need fundamental issue implication private money creation intermediary behave like bank without bank-like regulation. these implication potentially quite profound central bank bank regulation, consider shadow bank 4 much attention devote security lend wake crisis focus program run aig. in addition general issue involve reinvestment cash collateral, aig’s security lend program specific fundamental flaw go beyond concern discuss here. 6 bi central bankers’ speech system cause volume money-like instrument create outside purview central bank regulatory control grow markedly. but regulator need wait full resolution contest issue development comprehensive alternatives, would prudent so. we act address obvious source vulnerability financial system. i believe forego discussion implicit support various shadow bank instrument help identify area misunderstand mispricing risk likely, result destabilize run real possibility. let suggest three more-or-less immediate step regulator abroad take, well medium-term reform undertaking. first, create great transparency respect various transaction market comprise shadow bank system. for example, large segment repo market remain opaque today. in fact, present way regulator market participant precisely determine even overall volume bilateral repo transaction – is, transaction settle use triparty mechanism. it encourage treasury department’s new office financial research work improve information market, security exchange commission consider approach enhance transparency closely relate security lend market. second, risk run money market mutual fund reduce additional measure address structural vulnerability persist even measure take sec 2010 improve resilience funds. the sec currently consider several possible reforms, include float net asset value, capital requirements, restriction redemption. clearly, suggest chairman schapiro, action sec address vulnerability evident 2008, also preserve economic role money market funds, preferable route. but absence action, several second-best alternatives, include recent suggestion deputy governor tucker bank england supervisor consider set new limit banks’ reliance fund provide money market funds. a third short-term priority address settlement process triparty repurchase agreements. some progress make since 2008, clearly remain done. an industry-led task force establish 2009 orchestrate implementation important improvement settlement process. the unwind, reliance vast amount discretionary uncommitted intraday credit two clear banks, push late day, reduce period intraday credit extended. in addition, new tool develop good intraday collateral management, improve confirmation process instituted. though useful steps, key risk reduction goal effective elimination intraday credit yet achieved. a second phase triparty reform underway, federal reserve use supervisory authority press action clear banks, course manage settlement process, also dealer affiliate bank hold companies, clear banks’ large customer triparty transactions. but approach alone

official launch financial institutions’ director education (fide) forum, sasana kijang, bank negara malaysia, kuala lumpur, 12 june 2012. * * * it great pleasure morning launch financial institutions’ director education (fide) forum. the establishment forum, initiative found director fide program contribute effort enhance corporate governance practice malaysian financial sector. many make invaluable contribution conception development fide program ongoing refinement. the program unique highly effective, deliver palpable change contribute high standard corporate governance financial industry. this turn support stronger, resilient financial institutions. follow recent global financial crisis, corporate governance practice financial industry come significant scrutiny. there increase pressure management, board financial institution regulator significantly improve governance practice financial industry notably incentive systems, accountability controls. the problem lead build-up however, new. issue around misalign incentive over-emphasis short term performance encourage reckless risk-taking, addition lack transparency, pervasive conflict interest long focus public attention especially relation company disperse shareholding structures. these issue however, far serious involve financial institution give significant externality inflict society follow failure financial institutions. bank particular especially vulnerable consequence governance failure give critical importance public confidence survival. since crisis, substantial work several front devote strengthen resilience financial institutions. new capital liquidity standard key focus global regulatory reform work transpose global standard national regulation well underway many countries, include malaysia. while deliver significantly improve framework risk-taking financial institutions, remain, best, poor substitute good governance. evidence draw contrast institution operate regulatory framework, experience different outcome crisis. the comparison revealing. of significance observation – include recent case massive bank loss – behaviour culture significant part recent governance failures. despite independent director elaborate control structure place, firm fail decision management board effectively perform oversight role. this principally attribute lack sufficient collective knowledge board inadequate competence individual director turn lead poor judgement hamper ability board rein excess early stage. competency gap generally allow individual board senior management exert dominant undue influence decision make process, without subject sufficient scrutiny effective challenge. this occur board able grasp risk associate inordinately complex activity institution engage in. this generally compound failure provide effective countervail influence overzealous risk-taking culture among front-liners principally drive pressure deliver short term returns. 2 bi central bankers’ speech of course, sound process structure continue central role good governance framework. this provide parameter within decision made. however, grow significance behavioural, cultural ethical issue suggest governance framework must give great attention “softer” aspect governance. a clear reason challenge fluid operate environment demand great exercise judgement management. behavioural, cultural ethical norms, likely consequence, assume importance define boundary within management make judgements. a institution become large complex, board must also ability confidence ass nature risk financial institution’s strategic plan business direction. this entail behavioural cultural change within boardroom involve change board dynamic ability effectively harness collective knowledge expertise board. it involve courage break away status quos promote “group think” diversity. development supervisory approach also reinforce trend. the bar corporate governance continue raise intensive supervision focus board effectiveness. supervisor increasingly look evidence mix technical strategic competency board support meaningful engagement within board, board management. assessment also make whether board function manner promote independence judgement, extent board able define acceptable risk appetite institution oversee translation appropriate policy behavioural norms. follow asian financial crisis, strengthen governance financial institution key priority culminate number regulatory reform establish framework governance practice exist today. in many respects, financial sector malaysia progress ahead current developments. a set governance principle rule introduce early part recent decade. this include parameter sound practice respect risk-aligned compensation – issue focus current global regulatory reforms. this follow closely implementation improve risk-based supervisory approach place board senior management oversight centre effective control environment within financial institutions. a rigorous process assess individual nominate assume role director, chairman chief executive financial institution also introduced. a part effort bring behavioural cultural change strengthen governance practice financial industry, fide develop introduce 2008. we encourage result improvement observe governance risk management practice among financial institution malaysia. our supervisory oversight show director exercise active role ensure effective alignment implementation risk policies, business strategy capital management. the quality engagement board management also improve substantially particular, major strategic decision risk developments. our supervisory engagement board also benefit issue raise area concern material developments. there also increase effort strengthen mix skills, experience expertise board composition improve overall effectiveness boards. this result independent director appoint board financial institutions. the environment confront financial institution continue immensely challenging, particularly come year global financial condition remain highly volatile uncertain, regulatory reform start take effect. in environment, number area become important reinforce effectiveness board sound governance. bi central bankers’ speech 3 first, board-level engagement risk issue need strengthen further. this achieve board sound understand institution’s business model, strong grasp change complexion risk institution exposed. commit resource therefore available board support understand material development affect institution, hone judgement matter concern risk strategy. this include relevant meaningful management information flow risk analysis board, ability retain talent include external expertise required, ability attract individual relevant competency experience serve boards, budget board development education. second, grow expansion financial institution scale complexity, need inject great diversity board enable board collectively deal broad range issue across institution’s activities. this need embed within framework board renewal succession. a institution expand across borders, diversity also enhance board’s appreciation regional global trends, improve ability board provide strong leadership response cultural nuance competitive dynamic different markets. this also important effective oversight group-wide risk strategies. third, increase expectation place boards, board need mean objectively evaluate performance examine way board effectiveness improved. overcome cultural norm impede formal process open honest engagement among peer remain challenge. in way weak process evaluation management performance would cause concern, would hold true board. guide self-evaluation framework reinforce environment encourage candour openness, supplement third-party independent reviews, work well institutions. more progress area maintain high-performing board rather prescriptive approaches, would likely yield result fall short desire outcomes. let take opportunity discus key initiative currently pursue bank area governance financial institutions. the bank make proposal new financial service legislation augment general duty responsibility board company act provide emphasis specific key consideration responsibility board financial institutions. board would need regard interest depositor policyholders, long term viability institution place reasonable standard fair deal oversight implementation business risk strategy institution. the statutory duty would also include explicit duty ensure oversee effective design implementation sound control environment. work also commence update streamline current regulatory guideline corporate governance banks, insurer takaful operator view reduce duplication across different standard sharpen focus overall responsibility board risk control. exist prescriptive rule would give way broad principle behaviour. the review also good align regulatory framework current supervisory approach. a thematic review remuneration practice financial sector also plan take account might influence risk-taking behaviours. also train review supervisory process assess suitability person serve board financial institutions. this review leverage work fide forum. look ahead, financial sector blueprint set additional recommendation strengthen incentive enablers sound governance risk management standard anticipation grow complexity financial landscape. 4 bi central bankers’ speech let draw remark close. the task provide stewardship, direction oversight financial institution essentially fall squarely board. the responsibility go great i believe need best director financial industry – importance financial sector broad economy, financial institutions, pervasive role support economic activity, powerful influence raise standard corporate governance across corporate malaysia. i expect fide forum instrumental role realise vision professionalise role directors, show way best governance practices. on part, bank greatly welcome initiative facilitate new opportunity great engagement director financial sector collective body, regulatory issue developments. on note, great pleasure officially launch fide forum. i wish every success. bi central bankers’ speech 1 stefan gerlach: fiscal imbalance monetary stability address mr stefan gerlach, deputy governor central bank ireland, german-irish chamber industry commerce, dublin, 28 september 2012. * * * i grateful laura weymes help prepare remarks. 1. introduction i delight today. let start acknowledge important work chamber undertake since establishment 1980 promote close link irish german companies. a may know, term trade eu, germany rank jointly 2nd large market irish exports, 3rd large source irish imports.1 our close economic link germany important, particularly present environment german economy continue grow absorb exports. today i speak fiscal imbalance problem create monetary policy. one visible outcome current sovereign debt crisis fiscal deficit public debt become large many country inside outside euro area. give severe economic difficulty ireland number economy euro area experience last years, issue prominent public debate. since difficult reduce fiscal imbalance quickly, clear pubic debt remain large foreseeable future. it therefore timely talk matter concern raise central banks. in remark i hope shed light large fiscal imbalance currently many country concern imbalance raise central banks. i review number institutional arrangement force euro area intend limit need government borrow prohibit ecb lend governments. i also reflect large debt likely reduced. 2. the state public finance europe ireland let start review debt deficit evolve europe time. across euro area, average general government deficit rise le 1% gdp 2007 eve crisis 6% gdp 2010 (figure 1). in period, average debt ratio rise 66% 87% 2011 (figure 2). for euro area eu country (and also japan us) deterioration even pronounced. between 2007 2010 increase debt ratio 30% gdp record ireland, greece, latvia, iceland, uk, u japan. annual deficit large 7% gdp also record several country include greece, spain, portugal, u uk. specifically, irish general government debt rise 25% gdp 2007, much 60% limit maastricht treaty, 106% gdp 2011, project rise 2013. in period, headline balance deteriorate surplus 0.7% gdp 2007 peak stagger 31% gdp 2010 (of two-thirds relate bank support measures). in 2011 deficit almost 1 of total export (goods services) european union, 17% go unite kingdom, 9% belgium germany. on import side, 19% come unite kingdom, 9% netherlands 5% germany (based cso data). 2 bi central bankers’ speech 13% gdp.2 therefore, unfortunately, spite nearly 16% gdp budgetary adjustment measure undertake since 2008, deficit 8.3% project year, fall slightly 7.5% 2013. three factor lead rapid increase public debt wide european context. first, large recession trigger financial crisis lead tax revenue much weak projected. to mitigate effect, government raise tax rate rely one-off revenues. in spite effort total revenue share gdp remain relatively flat (figure 3). second, recession lead high expenditure unemployment support welfare spending. between 2000 2010, social transfer share gdp increase 4.2% ireland, euro area average 1.8%. third, government country face large bill rescue trouble financial institutions. in euro area end 2011, spend bank support measure constitute 4.9% total gross government liability outstanding, impact 6% gdp record ireland, germany, netherlands belgium.3 in ireland gross debt-worsening impact bank-related outlay 2008 2011 amount almost 47 billion euro 30% gdp, truly stagger number. of course, figure could small loss-sharing bank bondholder greater. while burden share subordinate debt-holders eventually total 10% gdp, share prevent initially breadth original government guarantee subsequently programme agreement. 3. the adverse effect public debt why central bank concern large public debts? there several reasons. 3.1 debt growth first, large public debt tend reduce economic growth, turn mean low future income great difficulty government finance spending. there large body evidence link elevate debt level subsequent period low growth performance.4 in brief, public debt-to-gdp ratio exceed 90% gdp appear reduce median real economic growth 1%.5 while seemingly small, extend period time effect dramatic impact income levels, therefore tax collection governments’ ability finance spending. why high debt reduce growth? a debt grow, government face increase interest burdens. to finance these, may force raise tax increasingly high level cause economy function le efficiently. moreover, consumer may recognise large debt imply high future tax therefore cut spend anticipation these. furthermore, historically, government large debt frequently resort financial repression, is, regulate financial system way artificially expand demand public debt. this reduce interest rate debt financed, sometimes extent real interest rate 2 disregard €5.8bn portion pcar 2011 bank injection aib/ebs ilp, underlie deficit –9.0% gdp. 3 the large amount general government liability outstanding end 2011 relate bank injection (as percentage gdp) record ireland (30%), germany (11.2%), netherlands (7.4%), belgium (6.6%). 4 see reinhart rogoff (2010), reinhart rogoff (2012), kumar woo (2010), checherita rother (2010), cecchetti et al. (2011) review evidence. 5 see reinhart rogoff (2010) cecchetti et al. (2011). bi central bankers’ speech 3 fall zero.6 of course, regulation tax financial sector make difficult costly borrowers, particular grow firms, obtain credit. furthermore, whenever debt large, always risk adverse economic event occurred, debt would become large, force government restructure them. a consequence result credit risk, interest rate public debt tend increase debt-to-gdp ratio rises. this problematic yield treasury bond frequently serve floor interest rate firm household borrow. large grow government debt therefore tend raise cost private sector finance itself, slow growth. in euro area lead situation firm household different country face sharply divergent lend rate conditions, depend fiscal situation sovereign, despite fact ecb set single short-term interest rate entire monetary union. this evident figure 4 show increase interest rate new loan household business since end 2009 great peripheral euro area country experience great fiscal difficulties. 3.2 debt inflation a reason large public debt worry tendency end high inflation.7 historically, lack central bank independence play central role process. government large deficit debt past frequently manage finance borrow central bank, instance central bank participate directly auction new government debt. while mechanism play crucial role episode hyperinflation, also operative moderate inflation experience european country late 1970s 1980s. but modern economy number device make inflationary finance form impossible. legal independence prohibition government borrow central bank crucial importance. furthermore, central bank operate high level transparency make difficult finance government without public become aware this. any attempt extend credit directly government therefore stoke inflation expectations, cause long interest rate rise. in turn, slow economy, offset benefit would accrue government operations. central bank independence high level transparency thus serve safeguard inflationary boom trigger weak government finances. transparency help another way. many central bank communicate public level inflation aim for. for instance, bank canada bank england adopt inflation target announce target inflation are. similarly, ecb swiss national bank announce price stability override target monetary policy define numerically.8 since inflation objective public knowledge, public scrutiny force central bank tighten monetary policy inflation rise target protract period. 6 period negative interest rate prevalent 1945 1980, recently since 2008. reinhart sbrancia (2011) find real interest rate negative roughly half time 1945 1980. annual liquidation debt via negative real interest rate amount 3-4% gdp per annum u uk. 7 there long literature establish close link public deficit inflation, see sargent wallace (1981), sims (1994), woodford (1994, 2001), catao teronnes (2003). for discussion fiscal deficit hyperinflation, see sargent (1982) dornbusch fischer (1986). 8 the ecb’s objective inflation “below close two per cent.” inflation survey suggest financial market participant believe ecb aim inflation 1.7 1.9 % per annum. 4 bi central bankers’ speech to mind, risk high level public debt average inflation rate rise, rather central banks’ control inflation worsen. it easy see why. if inflation rises, central bank must determine whether increase likely last temporary.9 in latter case, need increase interest rate since inflation return previous level own. in practice, course, difficult know whether increase inflation permanent transitory, policy maker judge whether raise interest rate immediately, wait see situation evolves. if public debt large, monetary policy maker may worry high interest rate worsen fiscal situation increase cost debt service slow economy therefore dampen tax revenues. a result, risk may delay tighten policy response rise inflation, result reduce inflation control amplification business cycle. it therefore essential public debt reduce high level reach many countries. 3.3 some current problem the current difficulty experience euro area illustrate two reason large fiscal imbalance problematic monetary policy. the financial crisis lead real economic activity weaken severely. at time, rapid increase public debt attendant difficulty finance force government number country tighten fiscal policy sharply improve debt trajectories, weaken economic activity.10 to offset fall demand, interest rate cut almost zero several countries. nevertheless, growth return central bank therefore adopt unconventional monetary policy measures, whose effectiveness yet fully established, support economic activity.11 needle say, would natural use fiscal policy expand economic activity impossible simple reason debt already large. a problem government debt become large trigger perception credit risk, function financial market deteriorates. large government debt worsen credit worthiness bank holder government debt. this cause money market function poorly, particular since government debt serf collateral secure lending. furthermore, raise interest rate economy broadly raise banks’ fund costs. finally, reduce collateral base banks, impair banks’ access central bank funding. these problem evident euro area, government debt level interest rate vary sharply countries. the net effect weaken transmission monetary policy creation asymmetry across monetary union. for reason ecb’s govern council adopt september 6 programme outright monetary transaction mitigate adverse effects.12 4. institutional limit debt deficit since large public debt highly adverse consequence economy, number institutional arrangement adopt limit debt accumulation euro area european union broadly. it useful distinguish rule deficit 9 temporary increase inflation arise wide variety price level shock increase energy price exchange rate changes. 10 while tight fiscal policy theory stimulatory, practice likely contractionary. see literature “expansionary fiscal contractions”, e.g., alesina perotti (1995), giavazzi pagano (1990). 11 such measure include increase size, frequency maturity liquidity provide operations. a number central bank also purchase financial instrument issue public private sector. 12 http://www.ecb.int/press/pr/date/2012/html/pr120906_1.en.html. bi central bankers’ speech 5 debt rule embed institutional arrangement underpin ecb intend make impossible government finance way privilege access central bank funding. 4.1 rule debt deficit since establishment maastricht treaty 1992, eu introduce number fiscal rules. in 1997, stability growth pact (sgp) introduce rule intend ensure fiscal discipline. these rules, essentially limit fiscal deficit 3% gdp public debt 60% gdp, however, suffer poor compliance eu, even crisis take hold (figure 5). the onset present fiscal crisis expose number weakness sgp framework include lack definition “satisfactory pace” debt reduction, poor enforcement mechanism fact assessment compliance often base overly optimistic underlie budgetary forecasts. in response deficiencies, much strengthen sgp, know six pack, enter force november 2011, entail strong preventative arm strong corrective action requirements. the six pack ensure strict application fiscal rule define quantitatively constitute “significant deviation” medium term objective (mto). the mto require structural balance ensure sustainability public finances, set sgp. furthermore, excessive deficit procedure launch country’s debt excess 60% gdp, basis deficit exceed 3% gdp, previously case. finally, financial sanction euro area member impose early stage proportionate graduate manner. furthermore, timely imposition sanction likely since vote rule changed. the recent articulation eu fiscal rule fiscal compact (or treaty stability, governance co-ordination, tsgc), require country ensure convergence respective mtos. it introduce explicit budget rule, whereby state must strive budgetary balance achieve structural deficit –0.5% gdp.13 in addition, member state henceforth require reduce excess debt 60% gdp average 1/20th per annum. importantly, fiscal compact require budget rule must implement national law, preferably constitution, compliance monitor independent institution automatic correction mechanism put place correct divergence rules. it interest note pass many development fiscal sphere – introduction numerical objective deficit debt, write law, involvement independent monitor – limit governments’ ability run large deficit similar change introduce monetary policy framework recent years. thus, common legal act govern central bank indicate price stability override objective monetary policy define numerical terms. moreover, adoption high level transparency, central bank make easy outside observer monitor conduct policy. 4.2 regulation concern ecb the treaty function european union contain two article intend promote monetary stability. this achieve remove risk pressure national government force central bank finance fiscal imbalances. specifically, article 123 prohibit “overdraft facility type credit facility european central bank central bank member state … favour … central governments, regional, local public authorities” “the purchase directly 13 this ceiling exclude one-off measure cyclical effects. 6 bi central bankers’ speech european central bank national central bank debt instruments.” furthermore, article 124 prohibit measure, base prudential considerations, grant central governments, regional, local public authority privilege access financial institutions. however, article prohibit ecb operate financial market buy sell marketable instruments, include government debt.14 that course natural. in pursue statutory objective central bank operate range financial markets, particularly government debt markets, since large liquid since government debt historically see risk free. such operation course also augment demand public debt, thereby reduce interest rate debt make easy government finance themselves. but effect entirely incidental monetary policy. 5. reduce public debt public debt currently large many country must reduced. the european union adopt number measure restrict governments’ ability run deficit require many reduce public debt. but debt reduced? what mechanism rely on? a preliminary, useful recall many historical example episode public debt rise high levels. both world war i world war ii public debt reach level high even high observe country today. however, debt were, many cases, soon reduce sharply. to see public debt reduced, note growth debt-to-nominal gdp ratio depend three factors. 1. interest rates: high interest rate, great cost debt service. 2. real gdp growth inflation: fast growth real gdp high rate inflation, great growth nominal gdp thus tax revenues. 3. primary (or non-interest) budget deficit: large deficit, great rate growth debt.15 one way reduce debt thus seek reduce interest rate debt market level regulation. for instance, interest rate ceiling requirement increase banks’ financial institutions’ demand public debt use reduce interest rate burden. financial repression form common world war 2 lead rapid contraction debt/gdp ratios. of course, regulation merely amount taxation holder public debt. while may facilitate debt reduction, lead financial market worry may happen again, therefore cause demand high interest rate purchase government debt future. thus, reduce debt way may desirable. in case, presume regulatory environment different today. i thus don’t think play much role reduce current high debt levels. a second strategy seek increase growth rate nominal gdp. this mechanism also play important role debt reduction world war 2, growth pick sharply 1950s 1960s inflation high korean war boom 14 see article 18 statute european system central bank european central bank, protocol 4 treaty function european union). 15 debt may change even deficit zero, e.g., transfer local government debt national government restructure public debt. bi central bankers’ speech 7 early 1950s. while i expect many government adopt structural reform increase real gdp growth come decade, large debt tend reduce growth. it therefore seem unlikely growth rely restore fiscal stability. high inflation could theory also reduce debts. however, adverse consequence economic performance high variable inflation good know previous period high debt. moreover, inflation tax. while parliament power introduce taxes, central bank not. rely inflation debt reduction difficult democratic society. moreover, euro area elsewhere, monetary policy set objective stabilise inflation low level would undesirable change objective. overall, i therefore think economy grow inflate away debt ease may do past. this leaf third mechanism, primary surpluses, way debt reduced. primary surplus achieve either reduce spend raise taxes. while economic research suggest fiscal stabilisation effort rely expenditure cut likely successful rely revenue increases16, precisely necessary budget surplus achieve entirely matter elect parliament decide since fiscal policy large redistributional effects. my point simply debt must reduce budgetary surplus since avenue debt reduction closed. of course, 29 june eu summit open another possible avenue debt reduction use esm directly recapitalise banks.17 a decision recapitalise bank directly, oppose via sovereign previously favour method, would reduce burden already stress sovereign avoid reinforcement sovereign-bank link evident number countries. will monetary policy hind facilitate governments’ effort reduce debts? while monetary policy best set independently, i believe monetary policy focus price stability make easy government reduce debt. the reason simple. it seem unavoidable tight fiscal policy restrict overall demand good service economy. in turn tend reduce inflation pressures. to prevent inflation fall low, seem likely many central bank maintain interest rate low level extend period time, support growth debt reduction. 6. conclusion public debt number country rise sharply financial crisis reach high levels. a consequence, growth likely low otherwise would been, turn make difficult reduce debt. but let debt remain high level option. while exact path fiscal adjustment immediate future vary light country-specific circumstances, case ireland agree troika, reduce debt level detrimental effect income effect grow time. it may also increase risk deterioration central banks’ inflation control, harm function financial markets. unfortunately, seem unlikely current high level public debt melt away low interest rates, rapid growth inflation. regardless relief movement towards bank union potential benefit direct esm bank recapitalisation could deliver, country need restore stable fiscal balances. in place low interest 16 see blochliger,

others process senescence leave company prone bankruptcy soon next economic downturn come along. in case, generally fell banker pull plug. it usually refuse accommodation, stop drain unrecoverable resources. interestingly, several large historic case mentioned, irish bank find heavily expose one might expected. perhaps irish bank close view good understand potential risk back then, perhaps reasons, creditors, include bank abroad, seem absorb expose large loss several failures. perhaps experience one ingredient contribute embolden irish bank feel invulnerable downturns. perhaps one day fully understand fundamental decision-making bank (during property bubble) end insulate adequate attention basic risk-controls – indeed end common sense! optimal restructure when restructure work well, asset fail firm, along human capital embody employees, find good alternative use. receiver liquidator certainly work get good price physical assets. aircraft ship own gpa irish ship may laid-up while, find employment bi central bankers’ speech 3 later. employee always fare well. the collapse often happen period weak global activity associate level unemployment home abroad make hard displace worker get job. the plight misfortunate former irish ship worker rightly highlighted. there inherent conflict interest different stakeholder restructure though, work-outs contribute overall economic efficiency. indeed, sometimes key protagonist may aim build monopoly attempt aggressive risk-shifting. that’s public policy, example, competition policy, merger monopoly policy, may need activated. in past, government sometimes get involve directly. for example, irish steel look like closing, prospect many worker displace depress labour market condition mid-1980s, perhaps remain dole years, weigh government time decision provide fund keep firm go year subsidise activities. but great awareness opportunity cost government rescue company reduce frequency years. prop doom company always good even seem benefit. few bemoan demise irish car assembly business. indeed, decade business collapse follow anglo irish free trade agreement, manufacturer car part export employ people assembly industry re-assembling ckd (completely knock down) car kits. make sure it’s do well – avoid delay deal owner face clean post-crisis mess, procrastination ever-present cancer. hop something turn natural reaction alternative face inevitable take step crystallize loss directly affect stakeholder firm include employee trade creditors. but hide consequence procrastination impose cost elsewhere economy – cost destroy even job elsewhere. that experience japan 1990s, ireland can’t afford suffer similar protract delay. an unhealthy firm balance sheet mean access deny new fund enable expansion, upgrade innovative investment could generate output employment growth. indeed, especially current crisis drive balance sheet problem operate account problems, delay financial restructure likely threaten job distress company itself, well impose indirect cost dependent companies. owner resist restructuring, especially mean stand lose control business. they course large financial, seldom emotional, interest retain position may also think expertise make asset company. in instances, creditor agree proposition. in book,2 professor cahill suggest lend bank (most foreign) may find “bitter pill” retain ceo goodman international executive control sizeable equity stake restructure company. other high-profile case saw conventional presumption old shareholder top management go. that basic modus operandi government current bank crisis far bank concerned. in case nama, deal huge number property-owners developers, modus operandi date appear reflect kind extend triage borrowers, keep on, others eventually not. 2 in refresh memory cases, i find edward cahill’s corporate financial crisis ireland (dublin: gill macmillan, 1997) great assistance. 4 bi central bankers’ speech asset management company in-house operation banks? some may find irony fact bank among main actor drive restructuring. after all, experience far-reaching balance sheet restructuring, shareholder wiped-out subordinate debt-holders also nurse losses, central bank lend fill hole leave depart creditors. that job loss bank sector date bad economy average reflect government’s decision step keep operation bank go service provided. (incurring far big ever cost see corporate restructuring, government also try avoid wide financial instability well loss credit stand would accompany loss hit depositor creditors, story, begin exactly four year ago today, main theme many occasion i dwell here). anyway, despite this, bank also change gear become heavily involve loan recovery associate task balance sheet restructure many distress corporate (and individual) customers. but one improve bank engineer restructuring? this question widely discuss around turn millennium, researcher practitioner try draw lesson applicable east asia crisis (which hit half dozen rapidly grow country 1997–8 leave debris corporate insolvencies), early experience bank crisis japan, scandinavia unite states, well develop country cases. the broad conclusion debate3 centralise asset management companies, sweden u resolution trust corporation, work well need restructure mainly class property companies. this main asset company relatively easily transfer depend specialise production chain, patents, firm-specific know on. to overstate somewhat, value real estate may, especially downturn, pretty much independent manage it. in rise market, swede manage well realize property portfolio time. the international literature also warns, however, large state-owned amcs become vulnerable improper political pressure, especially large prominent firm become bankrupt. fortunately evidence pressure occur respect nama current irish crisis, indeed legislation set nama build protection pressures. on hand, non-property relate distress may (according international research) best manage bank themselves. specific company know-how help devise best solution maximise value firm’s asset – provide restructure process insulate denial over-optimism may contribute poor loan underwrite first place. the bank turn need provide sufficient capital allow fearlessly accept crystallise unavoidable loan-losses, sufficient liquidity able provide finance set restructure firm back onto healthy growth path, eventually move limbo financial distress. a this, acknowledge bank staff startout skill-set need implement corporate restructuring: different business loan underwriting. and bank divert many effective staff activity may effective foster new lend relationships. 3 cf., example, marinela e. dado daniela klingebiel, “decentralized creditor-led corporate restructuring: cross-country experience.” world bank policy research work paper 2901, october 2002. bi central bankers’ speech 5 ireland’s institutional arrangement deal situation date seem mirror international consensus appropriate institutional arrangements: nama big property loans, bank remain bad loans, massive recapitalisation of, extensive liquidity provision to, banks. the difference one scale rather design. in particular, loss destabilise finance state, limit ability react. there suggestion block bank asset could move balance sheet main banks. certainly bank large block hard-to-value hard-to-sell asset balance sheet drag investability bank tail-risk loss embody contribute over-scaling banks. in practical terms, though, management numerous sme asset task large decentralise operation. the operational risk transfer task another agency would considerable. even ultimate ownership loan asset might possibly shift point order improve balance sheet bank hence stand wholesale markets, i foresee would practice continue manage restructurings. one recommendation literature private sector involve much practical restructure process. private sector restructure specialist high-powered incentive find quick profitable solutions. of course process costly. private-equity firm buy distress asset discount think achieve restructure resold. their time horizon relatively short return threshold high. where question clean privately-owned bank, cost simply imply transfer within private sector. but private shareholder already wiped-out, state bear costs. it decision matter must therefore balance prospect effective restructure private firm cost impose. private sector solution neglect irish case. to date considerable deleveraging bank private sector: asset sale total €32 billion past three year – abroad. find grand solution improve situation thus easy. but reason delay. on contrary, every month pass un-restructured distress corporate energy-sapping lose opportunity recovery. urge central bank regulator, bank build internal capacity hiring, train education, deal situation. there improve understand best deal numerous case distress sme borrowers. this include matter collect adequate borrower information: adopt realistic approach post-restructuring viability calculations; ensure time-bound execution accordance concrete implementation guidelines; quantify track progress process case and, procedure quality assurance. yet bank know make sufficient progress turn understand robust mechanism scale deliver adequate stream realistic viable restructurings. it’s often question financial (balance sheet) restructuring, also need operational restructuring, something generally go well beyond skill-set traditional lender. often personal guarantee involved, owner fully hook: new personal insolvency legislation provide backstop element. thousand case need deal decisively manner. this truly daunt organisational challenge banks, one which, encourage press central bank, step up. but, i sure acknowledge, much work do progress date painfully slow. 6 bi central bankers’ speech give large number firm still pressure, implementation effective speedy surgical approach corporate restructure could big impact. by reinvigorate irish business sector, would ultimately help boost economy-wide employment. require unusual scarce skill judgment, task urgently deserve heighten attention. bi central bankers’ speech 1 josef bonnici: an alternative model bank malta – case set cooperative bank maltese economic reality address professor josef bonnici, governor central bank malta, seminar “cooperative banking”, valletta 27 september 2012. * * * honourable ministers, distinguish guests, lady gentlemen. a previous speaker shown, cooperative banks, though often news, time perhaps thankfully, considerable presence countries, particularly, only, european countries. indeed, data 2010 show europe cooperative bank hold market share 20% deposit similar market share loans. their presence particularly mark france, three cooperative bank group (credit agricole, bpce credit mutuel) account 50% market share loan 60% deposits. there also significant presence italy, enjoy market share 34% deposit 30% loans; germany, market share 19% deposit 16% loans; netherlands, market share 43% deposit 30% loans; finland, market share 34% deposit 32% loans. they include, apart well-known french bank already mentioned, respect name rabobank holland raiffeissen bank germany. cooperative bank also significant presence south korea, japan, canada, morocco, mexico brazil. so question immediately arises: come institution ever set malta? after one would think idea cooperation solidarity, spirit seven basic principle international cooperative alliance (ica) would strong appeal malta. these seven principle consist of: voluntary open membership; democratic member control; member economic participation; autonomy independence; education, train information member employees; cooperation cooperatives; and, especially, concern community. moreover, cooperative sphere activity here, around time. indeed, start cooperative movement malta date back late year 19th century (around 1884), first form legislation regulate cooperative – cooperative society ordinance 1946 – come effect 12th december year. initially movement take root agriculture fishery sector, time employ significant part population. but later, malta develop socially economically, movement continue flourish expand, new cooperative set practically every sector economy. indeed, currently 60 cooperative malta, 5000 members, spread wide range activities. these include traditional agriculture fishery sector, transport media, management market consultancy services, wholesale, health, maritime, archaeology, restoration, fair trade, tourism, youth service community care. our cooperative affiliate international cooperative alliance (ica), abide seven basic principle establish alliance mention previously. bank u long time. indeed one trace origin bank malta time knight st john, though rapid development take place british rule, help island’s strategic central position british empire. in 1826, anglo-egyptian bank start operation here, series merger acquisition late become barclay’s bank dco (dominion, colonial overseas), soon establish extensive branch network island. a number small maltese-owned bank also established, eventually merge become national bank malta, also establish branch network. there follow period two major bank nationalised, follow subsequent 2 bi central bankers’ speech liberalisation economy privatised, government retain 25% share bank valletta. more bank begin operate malta join european union, commercial, joint stock banks. no one, till recently, seem think set cooperative bank malta. the distinctive characteristic cooperative banks, previous speaker explained, bank entity that, part, own members. the latter owner customer bank. but characteristic. generally, cooperative bank deeply root region communities. they much involve local development contribute sustainable development communities, member officer generally belong community operate. their main concern make spectacular short-term gain small group shareholders, eradication poverty long-term development region operate. hence retail, wholesale banks, abide old maxim banking: know customer. while help first time buyer buy home grant mortgages, instance, trade mortgages. perhaps precisely local bank share many characteristic cooperative bank need set cooperative bank proper never far felt here. in fact, establish bank also – almost necessity, give malta’s small size – deeply root local community, principally gear contribute sustainable development community. they predominantly retail, wholesale banks, operate traditional business model, one largely shield problem international financial turmoil last years. they take deposit (mainly) small local saver make loan (mainly) small medium-sized local business help people buy house provide mortgages. their officers, like cooperative bank elsewhere, belong community operate generally know customer local environment. in addition, one involve european investment fund’s jeremie programme, programme design specifically help small medium size enterprises. the bank question commit eur 5 million period three year 280 local sme beneficiary programme. indeed, one could say mainly ownership structure local commercial banks, joint stock (or “shareholder value”) banks, differ cooperative banks. in respect different. so leaf u question: scope set cooperative bank malta? be isn’t space institution? or local market small, community adequately serve bank already operate here? i think answer questions. but point made, i think valid point, competition – necessary ensure customer get best possible service least possible price – depend heavily variety business model rather large number institution give roughly kind service more-or-less way. increase competition result add firm business model, also, indeed perhaps more, add firm different business models. where diversity, alternative choose from, competition enhance benefit increased. perhaps i point several decade ago many people, include many local business community, afraid approach bank loan. they prepare give receive credit directly other, believe neither charge charge interest, borrow bank explicitly charge interest make profit “at expense”. never mind implicit rate interest credit give receive way probably high charge banks. i surprise still people around, potential entrepreneurs, still reason way, therefore may “financially bi central bankers’ speech 3 excluded” economy. might perhaps niche cooperative bank, set shop here, might able exploit? furthermore, i think perhaps i modify observation i make earlier: namely, need set cooperative bank malta never far felt. on second thoughts, perhaps, entirely true. for one small banks, one that, surprisingly, found jesuit priest 1910, actually begin life cooperative society. it originally call lega dell’ apostolato della preghiera, main aim set number initiatives, underlie social purpose. these included: save bank, intend instil habit thrift among work classes; mutual benefit society; print press; publication maltese language periodical; even school teach languages, music crafts; emigration bureau help maltese citizen wish settle countries; scheme free provision food, medicine medical care needy; public lotto office; recreational club members. it – least save bank part operation – become private limit company recently 1970, malta’s first bank act enacted. and this, perhaps, give u clue maltese cooperative bank today. perhaps scope one, niche exploited, legislative framework, evolve far, doesn’t permit it! for truth matter law govern bank activity law govern cooperative malta, law govern cooperative banks! in current legislative framework, latter seem fall two stools. our bank act envisage joint stock banks, bank whose customer owners, law govern cooperative society malta, though provide establishment fund register cooperative oblige deposit 5% annual operate surplus help pay research education train member general development cooperative movement, provide establishment cooperative bank – institution license accept deposit make loans. clearly, bank, banks, able establish here, either bank act, law govern cooperative societies, both, amended. but precisely minister azzopardi say propose introductory speech: amend relevant legislation. then, amendment propose minister come force, good position judge whether scope set cooperative bank malta. bi central bankers’ speech 1 paul fisher:

standards, reflect broad change term conditions, come two year flat gdp growth 3 year decline credit growth household business uk (chart 6). and despite period mpc re-launched quantitative easing, help bring long term yield gild record lows. central bank normally intervene provide bank medium-term fund reasonable spreads. but enough enough! the fl address underlie problem euro area financial sector, give many problem outside uk’s direct control, become necessary u something innovative. bi central bankers’ speech 9 i want use opportunity today expound principle underlie fls. it deceptively simple scheme inevitably misunderstand intend achieve works.3 to begin, i wish make clear fl design support uk economy, banks. there many feature scheme make different choice over-riding objective – full, quarterly disclosure usage, bank bank, obvious. let summarise key feature fl follow details. we reduce fund cost bank build society provide relatively cheap liquidity. in practice lend treasury bill four year exchange wide possible range collateral bank accept – include pre-positioned portfolio loans. those treasury bill use liquid asset support expansion lend turn cash necessary. we charge fee 25 basis point per annum long bank’s stock lend contract period end 2013. the firm 18 month draw bills. this essentially swap highly liquid asset illiquid one part wide programme bank extend range collateral take operations. so portfolio loan eligible collateral first time market-wide facilities. one benefit expansion operation much accessible small bank build society don’t large portfolio tradable securities. every firm sign fl able borrow amount equal least 5% initial stock lend standard definition bank already collect data.4 if firm expand lend period end-2013, able borrow equivalent additional amount too. there therefore strong incentive bank boost lend every pound additional lend increase amount bank borrow cheaply pound.5 if firm’s lend stock contracts, however, access 5% allocation price scheme also high – rise linearly maximum 150 basis point lend contract 5% more. you might reasonably ask questions: • why set minimum access amount complicate pivot price? • how sure increase credit flow may needed? in particular sme business first-time home buyers. • what isn’t sufficient demand credit? • won’t bank pocket benefit cheap funding? indeed question i often ask i want put answer record today. 3 the bank publish explanatory note fls, available here: http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/ markets/documents/explanatory_notefls120713.pdf 4 draw sterling loan uk private non-financial corporation (pnfcs) households, fl group, include uk resident monetary financial institution relate specialist mortgage lender within group. 5 if lend expand 7% example, draw amount treasury bill equal (7+5=) 12% initial stock. 10 bi central bankers’ speech the first point i want make reply bank uk far perfectly competitive market. the six big lender account vast majority lend uk business household – seventh large account le third much number six. in large part quantitative success scheme depend large lender do. but bank different strategic position start with. they portfolio wish shrink, others expand. but plan reduce overall stock lending, give market condition capital liquidity positions. and order reduce part lend receive state aid. the fl intend undermine competitive financial stability objective force bank change strategic decisions. what want encourage expansion core portfolios. and want encourage new entrant step pick major bank cannot. so answer first question minimum allowance asymmetric price structure design encourage core lend bank nevertheless must shrink balance sheet aggregate – macro impact fl won’t sufficient unless bank incentive participate. and bank expand lend benefit low price great proportionate access. the scheme design every firm potential use support lending. but mean cannot expect every bank fl increase stock lend real economy 18-month period. it expect firm still show overall reduction, even fl successful. the crucial impact whether fl enable lend would do absence. the bank cannot give detail individual firm’s previous new lend plans. it explain fl enable support economy. most already announce reduction interest rate loosen term conditions. some respond lend firm would previously not, earn return compensate extra risk. all approach help. of course, one big problem face macroeconomic policy maker difficulty set ex ante success criteria. we can’t perform control experiment macro economy. what matter whether policy make outcome good would otherwise – alternative reality – “counterfactual” economic speak – always matter conjecture debate. nevertheless i believe scheme provide right incentive increase supply credit. a second problem macroeconomic policy cannot rely usual “ceteris paribus” assumption economic theory – make large change policy everything else change too, include behaviour expectation people try influence. and policy effect relatively small nevertheless absolutely significant policy change large enough. in fact, fl design take advantage pressure change behaviour. the fl provide strong incentive bank build society – lend, benefit. either price effect deleveraging and/or quantity effect expanding. and build incentive enhance competitive pressure lenders. they cannot afford miss lend opportunity – competitor take advantage. i think help answer second question whether lend go people perceive need need it. the fl seek allocate credit particular part economy directly – bank take view matter. but smes first time home buyer particular think credit hungry. bank collectively need meet demand individually make fls. bi central bankers’ speech 11 not necessarily every bank support every sector. but big firm don’t small bank will. we rely pressure demand supply, competition, ensure credit flow demand. the normal business model bank lend rate relate fund rates. the process immediate fund different source – retail wholesale, secure unsecured, might use support lend activities. there reason think provision cheap fund via fl cause bank change business model regard. indeed incentive scheme bank build society cut lend rate hence lend get cheap funding. since scheme announce see widespread fall fund cost across different source equally wide variety lend rate reductions. the final benefit term low lend rate uncertain: i envisage strategy degree pas end le 100% great 100%. the key point cost fund reduced, supply credit expand hence quantity lend rise. so bank make money result fls? well try to! the scheme depend bank exploit opportunity make loan profitable loan everyone’s interest. if don’t respond lend otherwise would done, competition probably mean make few profit firm take business. shareholder urge management take advantage opportunity. the fact that, sign up, bank build society agree bank england publish detail usage scheme, mean pressure intense. what question state demand? i personally talk business many different part country. those smes get finance want – many have, despite unfavourable public commentary – complain length time taken, bureaucratic process onerous term conditions. few actually complain price new loan – many come pressure renegotiate exist cheap arrangements. so fl help? let’s clear one thing. it bank lend to. if firm go under, simply can’t repay loan, bank lose money: fl credit risk stay banks. and intention bank put risk make imprudent loans. although many good quality business seek extra credit, every one good credit risk might make local journalist mp, need wary judgement anecdote. but fl put pressure bank lend profitably can. that may “turn conversation around” bank seek lend opportunity rather business home buyer struggle find accommodate banks. if demand credit turn weak add competitive pressure supply credit. in summary, i confident fl help supply credit. before introduction, likely stock credit would contract next 18 months. perhaps still may. but return positive credit growth would good outcome could previously hop for. but i want underline one thing expect outcome: i expect banks’ usage scheme exceed lend growth. partly i know bank act base case contraction. and partly fund could use refinance exist loan cheap rates. but also first instance, set fund draw advance needed, delay. that one feature design macroeconomic benefit mind. at every stage ask design choice would best support lend growth. i believe make right choices. 12 bi central bankers’ speech i would like conclude note one lesson crisis important properly function financial sector, expert allocate save consumption investment. financial market line pocket participants. they exist social economic benefit service provide. i believe industry understand accept this. we need focus policy encourage benefits. for policy effective, also need join up. the fls, jointly launch bank hm treasury, support action mpc, fpc fsa show new arrangement among authority ensure policy work together get economy back track meet objective low stable inflation, sustain growth financial stability. bi central bankers’ speech 1 mario draghi: build bridge stable european economy speech mr mario draghi, president european central bank, annual event “day german industries”, organise federation german industries, berlin, 25 september 2012. * * * lady gentlemen, it privilege invite address bundesverband d deutschen industrie afternoon. the bdi many way mirror strength german economy. it simultaneously represent global multinationals family-owned small businesses. it combination small, medium large firm give german industry uniqueness resilience. and reward recent year strong growth high employment. the euro area whole face challenge times. financial market fragmented. economic growth broadly flat first half 2012. growth also remain highly uneven, part euro area economy expand solid pace, others still phase adjustment. but central message today that, provide policy-makers persevere necessary reforms, number reason positive euro area heading. we see sign improve sentiment financial market expect economy return growth next year. at time, considerable progress make front strengthen foundation euro area. above all, member state euro area undertake determine measure address root cause current challenges. individually, government implement fiscal structural reform essential growth. collectively, reform governance euro area guarantee sound policy future. we european central bank (ecb) continue maintain price stability, foundation growth job creation. we introduce new measure ensure price stability remove unfounded fear euro area. these measure support financial market sentiment deep reform implement across euro area. however, measure build bridge towards stable future. it must complete decisive measure government address fundamental challenge complete euro area’s institutional architecture. they currently make progress direction. the key challenge go forward ensure immediate upturn strengthen rather weaken commitment. action member state strengthen euro area’s foundation let begin action take member state strengthen euro area’s foundations. across euro area, strong budgetary consolidation take place. the international monetary fund (imf) forecast euro area’s primary budgetary position almost balance year. this mean that, apart debt service, expenditure cover current revenues. this quite achievement international context: japan, example, 9% gdp primary deficit year, u.s. 6% u.k. 5%. and euro area perform well average: individual country primary budget 2 bi central bankers’ speech deficit low three countries. it country need make large adjustments. important improvement also take place competitiveness. for example, country full eu-imf programme see unit labour cost improve around 10% since 2008, relative euro area average. this translate current account deficit average five percentage point gdp low then. and due low imports, also rise export induce high competitiveness. at time, member state take significant step improve euro area governance. governance fiscal policy decisively strengthen fiscal compact. this agreement powerful tool keep fiscal policy balance reduce debt sustainable levels. governance financial policy also give proper attention. the european commission recently propose single supervisor euro area banks. single supervision particularly important single currency area country immediately affect instability originate member countries. such single supervision ultimately lead stable financial system. take together, action show clear progress make towards address fundamental cause current challenges. deficit reduced. rebalancing happening. and governance reformed. action ecb ensure price stability let turn ecb’s recent actions. we play role improve overall confidence remove unfounded fear euro area affect ability ensure price stability – notably recent announcement outright monetary transactions, omts. let briefly explain rationale decision. the euro area experience severe fragmentation financial markets. in recent months, see highly divergent borrow cost real economy different part euro area. in analysis, difference large justify individual credit risk. they reflected, considerable extent, unfounded fear future euro area. for example, loan family germany house purchase five- to-ten-year maturity interest rate 3%; rate comparable borrower spain 7.5%. at time, average firm germany pay around 3% new loan five years, average firm italy pay 5.5%. in circumstances, monetary policy cannot work properly. this key channel ecb ensure price stability cost credit, particular bank credit. bank credit account 70% external finance euro area firms, ratio even high small enterprises. but unable influence borrow cost part euro area, channel disrupted. firm household le access financing, economic growth stall region face risk deflation. in words, ability ensure price stability whole euro area compromised. the ecb’s govern council therefore face choice: accept situation allow singleness monetary policy undermined; take action within mandate restore normal transmission monetary policy across part euro area. we decide favour latter. our action aim repair monetary policy transmission provide credible backstop government bond market remove unfounded fear tail risk euro area. insofar support investor confidence, help stabilise condition markets, bi central bankers’ speech 3 corporate bank bonds. this ultimately fee even borrow cost real economy across euro area. early sign suggest positive effect. since begin month, euro area bank issue 27 billion euro new debt – since march year. some bank able access market almost six month previously. non-financial corporation also issue around 43 billion euro new bonds, high figure five last six months. it early tell full impact measure borrow condition firm households. it take time effect action fee systematically. but fact see positive sign quickly revealing. it show investor fundamentally confident overall trajectory euro area. they ready re-invest first sign stabilisation. this underscore central message today: euro area make progress – investor recognise progress. the benefit stability euro area whole i describe measure take member state ecb begin improve confidence. this ultimately lead great overall stability. the benefit accrue country difficulty. they accrue euro area whole. this particularly true open outward-looking country like germany. german industry sector deeply embed wide european economy. the stability euro area key sustain prosperity. for reason, ecb action maintain price stability whole euro area directly interests. a long recognise country, low inflation stable exchange rate ensure level play field german firm prosper. they compete base sophistication innovativeness, without unfair distortions. at time, part large stable currency area provide buff external shocks. this become essential ever globalise world. these factor lead real economic benefit germany. it intra-euro area trade increase around 25% gdp 1999 almost 40% gdp 2010, extra-euro area trade increase 20 percentage point period. almost 65% foreign direct investment germany come euro area – one half million job depend investment. in words, stable euro area support strong german economy. and stable euro area objective measure i described. moreover, measure support investor confidence also support proper function financial system. for instance, target2 data suggest balance fall slightly peak august. this highlight fact investor confident adverse scenario materialise, prepare make cross-border loans. this support demand across euro area smooth function single market. i understand observer country concern medium-term implication policy. so let clear: always medium-term orientation. we steadfastly commit mandate maintain price stability. and measure announce fully support commitment. first all, action sole purpose ensure proper transmission monetary policy. they aim finance governments, would activated. our operation would take place secondary market, ensure money would pas investor hold sovereign bonds, governments. 4 bi central bankers’ speech moreover, explicit measure successful accompany reform government address deep-rooted issues. the govern council make strong commitment reform pre-requisite consider operations. this ensure government continue take essential measures. euro area citizen certain remain alert risk price stability. we always deliver price stability past – indeed, average rate inflation germany since launch euro low since 1950s. and continue deliver price stability future. the credibility commitment clear. indicator inflation expectation show citizen financial market expect inflation remain low line mandate. we take seriously trust citizen put u meet expectations. we let down. build bridge long term i discuss action ecb take ensure price stability positive early impact having. of course current improvement sentiment mean everything solved. the ecb’s action build bridge future. the project must complete decisive action government – individually collectively – address underlie cause current challenges. this require effort government restore fiscal sustainability across euro area. it require deep structural reform achieve long-term competitiveness growth. government must remain firmly commit current reform efforts, seek relax economic condition start improve. to secure long-term stability also require second level actions. for citizen investor fully regain confidence euro area, need convince design flaw permanently fixed. a concert effort government complete economic monetary union therefore essential. this require choice extreme options. some observer argue long-term stability require return original maastricht framework. others suggest need full federation, unite state europe. in view, neither approach necessary. we ensure future stability elevate european level policy essential union function effectively. i ask work identify policy lead president european council together president commission eurogroup. in view, stable prosperous union must build four pillars. the first pillar financial union maintain stable integrate financial market. this imply single supervisor control risk-taking bank reduce regulatory capture – single resolution system ensure bank fail without drag sovereigns. a regard commission proposal single supervisor i mention earlier, i confident government find agreement appropriate perimeter supervisory responsibilities, well issue relate democratic accountability. for part, guarantee firm separation monetary policy supervisory tasks. we also ensure close cooperation national supervisor competence resource implement supervision. the second pillar fiscal union effectively prevent correct unsustainable budgets. the consequence misguide fiscal policy monetary union severe remain self-policed. so stable emu would ultimately require establishment true budgetary oversight european level. bi central bankers’ speech 5 the third pillar economic union guarantee high standard competitiveness. country must able generate growth high employment without excessive imbalances. this imply must minimum standard key economic policy incentive continue structural reform. the fourth pillar political union engage euro area citizen deeply make pillar legitimate. this essential ensure sovereignty select policy field pooled, democratic participation deepen parallel. a firm commitment government complete economic monetary union best complement ecb’s actions. it ensure that, support immediate confidence, build bridge stable prosperous euro area. and send clear signal investor euro area vision sustainable future. conclusion let draw close. in exceptional times, regain stability sometimes require exceptional measures. we cannot always look past answers. we may need take new step achieve longstanding goals. that situation facing. for member states, new step need restore competitiveness. a sustain commitment reform effort require rethink institutional architecture euro area. for ecb, new step need maintain price stability face fragment financial markets. these new step departure mandate. indeed, way ensure continue fulfil mandate. all measure i describe today fundamentally ensure stability. in current circumstances, great risk stability action, inaction. this ecb acted. the euro support strong industrial sector germany depends. it support openness, growth prosperity. and ultimately, support peace stability. this euro irreversible. thank attention. bi central bankers’ speech 1 guy debelle: credo et fido – credit trust text 2012 richard searby oration mr guy debelle, assistant governor (financial markets) reserve bank australia, deakin, melbourne, 25 september 2012. * * * it pleasure deliver richard searby oration deakin university. i feel honour follow esteem speaker precede me. dr searby singularly impressive career throughout make great contribution community australia many different arenas. a i read record, one area little direct involvement finance, perhaps unfortunately, could well benefit guidance. it current state financial sector i talk today. a aware, global financial system state turmoil five year now. the repercussion widespread, although thankfully australia spar bad impact. in part world, obviously europe, unite state unite kingdom, fall-out financial crisis see million lose jobs, many number years. this stark greece spain around one quarter workforce unemployed. young people enter workforce two country little prospect find meaningful employment time soon; experience scar income prospect whole work life run risk lead dangerous breakdown social cohesion. the crisis much financial genesis loss extend part global economy. unlike recent downturns, recovery number country particularly protract time around. in number countries, even five year on, level output 2007 still yet reattained. this represent sizeable loss income wealth. tonight, i go talk one element contribute financial crisis long-lasting, might mean still way yet run. the issue i want focus importance trust banking, finance generally. hence title talk today. credo latin “i believe”, get word credit, fido latin “i trust”, get fiduciary fidelity.1 so credit fundamentally issue trust. without trust, don’t credit. that lack credit phenomenon play number country around world moment, again, thankfully, australia. the lack trust contribute unwillingness financial institution extend credit difficulty government obtain funding. in turn, lack credit growth exert major restraint economic recovery number country around world. in post-war period, easy monetary policy invariably help foster rebound economic growth follow recession. an important transmission channel monetary policy take effect almost always pick-up lend business households. that clearly happen many country moment. central bank country reach deep toolkits revive lend foster economic recovery. but lack trust significantly curtail ability normal implementation macropolicy tools, monetary fiscal, engender sustainable economic recovery. 1 my high school latin teacher please see return, decade fact, efforts. 2 bi central bankers’ speech the outline talk firstly discus role financial sector play economy. then i examine crucial role trust play financial intermediation ensure financial system run smoothly. follow that, i document breakdown trust occur past five years. to finish positive note, i outline avenue might take restore trust financial system. some theme address speech entitle “credit trust” deliver colleague bank england, andy haldane, september 2009.2 andy highlight reduction trust take place previous two year – first two year financial crisis. but three year 2009, situation even worse. the lack trust financial system intensified. distrust spread beyond finance system institutions. this particularly evident europe, lack trust quarter longevity euro, lack trust bondholder european government repay full. in case greece, lack trust prove well-founded. this diminish trust political economic institution particularly worry development. i fear path back long one. in walk life, include finance, trust take long time build, quickly easily shattered. the financial sector economy to set scene, i start brief description financial sector does. i hope i avoid jargonistic, please forgive i lapse economists’ speak every while. the financial sector play important role function economy, primarily intermediation. simply put, financial sector sit saver borrowers. it take fund raise saver through, example, deposits, lend wish borrow, businesses, governments, households. if system work well, allocate fund productive use. this benefit saver whose money invest profitably, economy society large. it important note financial sector intermediate sector. it end production chain produce something directly generate utility society. it critical link along way, oil keep economy tick over. when oil dry up, economic engine start malfunction ultimately grind halt. in regard financial sector different part economy. it one reason subject considerably regulation oversight, although clearly experience past year indicate many part world oversight regulation deficient. when finance sector stop function properly knock effect part economy way sector generally don’t. the experience end 2008 follow collapse lehman brother demonstrate point starkly. the contraction global economy breathtaking rapidity, also simultaneity, way hadn’t see before. i step bite deep process financial intermediation provide good sense trust come process. again, apology get bite arcane, hopefully bear me. why financial intermediary exist? why don’t i saver lend directly company? 2 haldane a (2009), “credit trust”, speech give association corporate treasurers, leeds, 14 september. bi central bankers’ speech 3 one main reason presence economist refer asymmetric information. asymmetric information arise i know situation do. it would difficult individual saver know whether lend business go put fund borrow productive purpose position repay loan become due. a financial institution bank practise credit assessment reduce information asymmetries. when bank make loan, due diligence lender ass capacity lender repay. while due diligence cannot completely eliminate information asymmetry, allow bank make reasonable assessment risk incur make loan. on basis risk assessment, lender charge borrower interest rate compensate risk incurred. with appropriately diversify portfolio loan then, bank overly expose particular development. the risk mutualised. if problem one loan, lender earn sufficient interest rest loan portfolio cover loss. the lender, thereby saver provide fund lender, compensate risk incurred. relative lend fund directly, saver benefit (hopefully) professional risk assessment reduce information asymmetry risk mutualisation. one difficulty process apparent i say possibility risk portfolio loan correlated. in plain english, one loan go bad, likely loan go bad time? for example, economic downturn rise unemployment, lender might find loan become problematic expected, affect realisation risk. the interest rate charge may sufficient compensate lender one realisation risk may adequate large number simultaneous realisation risk. in addition intermediate funds, one also think financial sector intermediate risk. a i’ve said, financial institution wide range loan books. by hold diverse portfolio risk, institution is, theory, le vulnerable realisation risks. but financial institution doesn’t always hold risk books. through channel securitisation, financial institution also distribute risk around financial system institution are, least theory, good place hold risk. who might good place take risks? some possible candidate pension superannuation fund insurance company long horizon diversify portfolio assets. it interest question whether good bank pool risk book whether good risk book bank instead distribute round system. if risk distribute around system, bank make loan may le incline appropriate amount due diligence, long directly expose consequences. in principle, entity buy risk bank also appropriate amount due diligence. but experience past year show chain process, remove end-holder risk originator risk bad process due diligence becomes. on hand, bank hold much risk balance sheet, many risk crystallise, bank likely find ability continue intermediate fund severely curtailed. it cut back lend – what’s commonly refer credit crunch – worsen economic environment. there plenty example history, include current crisis. so conceivably, risk intermediate much funds. 4 bi central bankers’ speech these consideration currently play debate volcker rule unite state “ring-fencing” propose vickers report uk bank system. the conclusion reach case good separate investment bank (or risk generation) arm financial institution commercial bank regular lend arm institution. then, risk blow investment arm, detrimental spillover commercial bank crimp ability continue lending, thereby limit impact economy. alternatively, one consider world fractional risk banking, analogous fractional reserve banking. with fractional reserve banking, i refrain lend portion fund you, others, deposit i repay you, decide withdraw fund short notice. a long depositor don’t want fund back time, is, long isn’t bank run, i fine. in case fractional risk, i would retain part exposure balance sheet rather pas you, give incentive monitor risk continue due diligence. this often describe “skin game”. trust finance have spend bite time set scene describe process financial intermediation works, i focus main argument: role trust play finance. trust pervasive many level financial system, large part asymmetric information. there trust depositor bank. the depositor trust fund safe bank. this embody frank capra’s famous movie, it’s wonderful life, jimmy stewart save day paean trust, stop run bank. trust sort particularly important bank undertake maturity transformation, is, borrow short lend long. for example, bank will let deposit money “at call”, lend money period considerably long that. if depositor lose trust bank time, bank run, bank would unlikely able repay fund immediately. it could call loans. it would force engage fire sale assets, mostly illiquid loans. to prevent situation occurring, central bank provide liquidity backstop, stand ready lend money bank needed, bank’s asset (collateral). the trust arrangement almost always enough needed. there trust borrower bank. the bank trust borrower repay loan. the bank lot due diligence borrower reasonably confident lender repay. but ultimately trust involved. the bank need trust borrower provide accurate information act good faith. there will, however, always gap bank learn due diligence need completely confident loan repay full. because process financial intermediation often number link chain, also need trust financial institutions. many financial transaction don’t involve one bank lend deposit end-borrower. often fund on-lent one financial institution another, ultimately find way end-borrower. so trust need present every stage chain. one breakdown chain trust counterparties throw spanner work whole process. ultimately much due diligence done. risk always present financial system. information asymmetry always present two party financial transaction. transparency reduce eliminate risk asymmetries. bi central bankers’ speech 5 finally, historically trust regulator financial institutions. (i sure much trust moment, i discus later.) “trust me, i know i’m doing”, banker’s exhortation light touch approach regulation pervasive prior crisis many countries, obviously uk. the argument bank broadly leave devices, discipline provide market deem sufficient keep track. the breakdown trust have describe critical role trust play process financial intermediation, i describe trust break course financial crisis. the period lead financial crisis saw might labelled, context talk today, development lazy trust. thing generally go along fine, due diligence i take you, lender, word. i won’t really bother verify tell true. i won’t bother consider possible circumstance might hind ability repay me. moreover, long chain intermediation involved, often much distance ultimate holder risk source risk. too many link mean detail get lose misheard. if due diligence necessarily incomplete nature financial transactions, incompleteness likely get magnified, chain transaction. the due diligence get dissipate along chain. there presumption someone chain due diligence. and time good, no-one think challenge presumption. so complacency set in, encourage seemingly benign growth world economy. that benign environment lead incorrect price risk. now need case, seem trait human behaviour evidence many time financial history. good time beget complacency. let take quick detour here. take extreme, line argument lead view world famously associate austrian economists. good time always set u next disaster. it clear appropriate policy response this. certainly one always remain alert possible dangers. and certainly may difficult take away punchbowl party full swing. (maybe central banker never invite good parties…) but surely doesn’t mean never good times, instead endure constantly mediocre performance no-one ever get carry away. obviously need balance. to extent, one calculus. the large cost current financial crisis make one think hard whether one let previous boom persist long, great benefit lasted. but another aspect human nature belief one avoid mistake past learn them. inevitably therefore, ubiquitous assertion time different. and many aspects, time different. it easy ass difference similarity real time. the similarity generally become apparent fact. thus, mention earlier, actually need level distrust, least initially, financial system function effectively. i shouldn’t take completely word. i background check make sure tell true. i check whether circumstance change i confident still able repay me. so back breakdown trust. some time around 2007, become clear many financial market major mis-assessment risk many part financial system. while warn mis-assessment risk prior this, even position benefit mis-assessment, 6 bi central bankers’ speech michael lewis describe big short, wasn’t middle 2007 become widely hold opinion. interestingly, second half 2007, mark disconnect equity market credit markets. credit market come realisation significantly early something go badly wrong financial markets, quite considerable period time, equity market assume nothing bad garden variety economic slowdown prospect. lazy trust evaporated. the financial system switch rapidly complacency deep mistrust short period time. in particular, trust break financial institutions, best illustrate final day bear stearns march 2008, lehman brother september year (see house card william cohan too big fail andrew ross sorkin, amongst many book write two events). both institution experience run financial counterparties, unwilling roll fund concern poor quality asset balance sheet might render two institution insolvent. the crucial distinction uncertainty risk come fore. i ass riskiness asset institution assign probability likely value. i manage risk appropriately. but i uncertain unable make firm assessment value, situation lot worse. i likely pull back unwilling provide finance you, except steep term probably short term. uncertainty much pernicious risk. a i speak earlier,3 famous rumsfeld quote much apply financial crisis. risk much “known unknowns” uncertainty “unknown unknowns”. but maybe mark twain put lot better: “it ain’t don’t know get trouble. it’s know sure ain’t so.” financial institution investor know many asset financial system badly mispriced. in case financial institutions, know mispricing book rightly assume probably go competitors. but didn’t know much. they know exposure various financial institution mispriced assets. so term “counterparty risk aversion” become pervasive. the lack trust mean financial institution will lend one another increasingly short periods, ultimately overnight. a financial market version bank run portray it’s wonderful life take place. in uk, case northern rock, traditional bank run occur depositor become concern safety savings. they long trust institution uncertain ability fund itself, give reliance mortgage-backed security fund – market long function lack trust value securities. this breakdown trust lead breakdown intermediation. central bank step hole play historical role intermediary last resort. central bank replace, reasonable extent, decline intermediation fund bank sector. but considerably difficult central bank replace lose trust. the extent central bank need intermediary last resort evident vast size central bank balance sheet major advance economies: euro area, unite states, japan also uk. the central bank stand financial institution unwilling lend directly other. the euro area provide particularly clear example this. in second half 2011, bank euro area become increasingly unwilling lend other. first all, bank would lend collateral (secured lending) rather lend directly another bank 3 debelle g (2010), “on risk uncertainty”, address risk australia conference, sydney, 31 august. bi central bankers’ speech 7 without security (unsecured lending). in plain english, mean bank would lend another bank borrow bank would provide something like government security portfolio mortgage collateral loan. then even collateral provided, length time will provide loan shortened, concern borrower would survive long enough repay. this place financial institution significant financial difficulty. concern mount whether institution would able fund all. a result this, european central bank (ecb) announce would provide much fund bank europe require three year loans. so european central bank become intermediary last resort european bank system bank trust other. more recently, lack trust government europe intensified, ecb had, effect, indicate willingness act intermediary last resort government too. one main reason ecb decide lack trust longevity euro. investor concern possibility redenomination risk: possibility leave hold asset whose value markedly decreased, country leaf euro area re-introduce currency. a result mistrust, witness balkanisation financial system europe. investor one european country don’t trust bank government countries. they pull back finance across borders, prefer instead invest money close home. this almost certainly optimal allocation fund productive use. on top dangerous state affair europe, amplify diminution trust financial sector, recent controversy bank sector hardly provide justification public regain trust bank system. to extent trust slowly restore part bank system past years, shatter recent revelation surround libor scandal, allegation money launder like. the restoration trust so all, state financial system many part world good shape. so do it? a old irish saying, first response say i wouldn’t start here. but unfortunately, are. use recent experience europe example, consider number possible avenue might need rebuild trust. when come distrust state banks’ balance sheets, transparency true nature asset balance sheet clearly help. but transparency disclosure clearly need credible reduce information asymmetries. stress test balance sheet credible independent party prudential regulator (apra case australia) give depositors, investors, confidence money safe. these sort action work take solvency risk table. for depositors, reinforce presence deposit guarantees. but often sovereign provide deposit insurance. so lack trust solvency sovereign, interlinkage financial sector government amplify problem, evident case ireland spain, example. the willingness central bank provide liquidity backstop, evident europe moment, reduce liquidity risk concerns. investor concern one leave burn build everyone else already run exit. the quid pro quo support bank subject comprehensive regulation and, least important, intensive supervision scrutiny 8 bi central bankers’ speech prudential supervisor case crisis. the light touch long acceptable. one make reasonable case australia’s case, doesn’t require much change. apra long exercise intensive scrutiny bank supervises. but even australia, number lesson learn crisis process applied. the regulatory regime financial institution tighten considerably. while might impose cost financial sector increase cost financial intermediation, benefit sure outweigh costs. this particularly case see terrible cost high unemployment experience number country around world moment aftermath financial crises. a change management practice financial institution surely also necessary number cases, must start top. the culture around risk management risk tolerance clearly important element this. the practice become pervasive throughout first part century contribute excess need change. what consider acceptable way business long suffice. give role financial sector play economy, form social contract general public. a i mention earlier, financial sector enjoy level support present sector economy, crucial role plays. but leverage imply financial institution vulnerable. we need consider safe degree leverage is. that debate currently. the rate profitability financial sector also debate society need having. if financial institution perceive earn high rate profitability, particularly institution enjoy degree support public sector, impede restoration trust. it long road back restore trust. without trust, process intermediation credit provision greatly curtailed. in turn, impede path global economic recovery cost all. we lay road ahead, put road rule form regulation curb financial sector. but journey still need taken. there short cuts. bi central bankers’ speech

“profile profitability – banks’ business model transition?”, düsseldorf, 20 september 2012. * * * 1. introduction professor rolfes lady gentleman no question: cause financial crisis manifold. how fit together currently yet fully known. perhaps never fully explain – practitioner academics. however, might able achieve improve understand individual part interact. this one aim symposium like one, practitioner academic convene communicate one another. this also i glad accept invitation, i thank much. i would like today address distinctly interest individual element build-up risk element associate financial innovation – key component bank’s business model. if business model regard bank’s genetic code, business model bank intermediary make dna financial system. this interest sake. in fact, vital aid good understand another debate: universal bank system specialise bank systems. 2. from unsustainable business model financial crisis in key area financial system, several banks’ business model undergo change best describe departure traditional commercial banking. what essentially lay behind this? why able pose severe threat financial stability? few model provide much information search answer question seminal work university chicago economist douglas diamond. it bear somewhat non-descript title “financial intermediation delegate monitoring”. and seemingly innocuous question is, financial intermediary exist? put another way: what intermediary good markets? and question long sound innocent. diamond presume major information asymmetry creditor debtors. only entrepreneur freely observe investment project. potential lender choice costly monitor investment project set incentive comply contract. if borrower stand lose house, case u subprime borrowers, incentive quite flawed, indeed. if bank monitor status investment projects, diversification economy scale achieved. by finance multiple project simultaneously monitor relatively long period time, bank reduce monitor costs. by contrast, monitor individual project inefficient. this explain existence bank – intermediaries. and probably also reason – least see asset side – commercial bank wholesale bank’s “natural” business model. 2 bi central bankers’ speech through credit substitution business, many bank depart model; surrender much inherent, comparative (says diamond) advantage intermediary function; leave credit assessment rat agencies; have, cases, delegate monitoring. at time, package loan lend contracts, look appropriate incentive structure but, all, tradability. if traded, risk fob third party – or, least, think goes. in effect, securitisation technique dissolve link oversight ultimate bearer risk. the advantage intermediation forsake without create sustainable contractual solution time. even theory, way could work. a warren buffett famously put it, “it’s tide go learn who’s swim naked.” from angle, oft-cited deficiency banks’ risk management practice accident, instead, see light, logical outcome departure traditional business model. in middle world intermediation market, neither worked, simply enough incentive mitigate risk. please misunderstand me: i firmly believe innovation create real economic value add survive long term. but probably reduce scale, le complex transparent structures, embed supervisory practice. if use prudently monitor carefully, enhance performance financial system without jeopardise financial stability. another thing overlooked: every transaction generate commission income complex securitisation. a save bank cooperative bank successfully diversify earn side sell riester retirement products. it le dependent maturity transformation swing interest rates. who could possibly object that? in itself, good financial stability. and every trade transaction modern financial product drive search maximum yield proprietary trading. if bank close currency hedge deal customer active international trade, sound real economic basis. in case, investment bank serf customer’s interests. nobody really object that, either. a bank whose business model target export-oriented customer provide kind service, otherwise business model work. and obtain commission income reasonable proportion service rendered. the also true, example, m&a consultancy services. however, non-interest earn component generally volatile, especially generate proprietary trade complex investment bank products. such earn component evaporate quickly crisis put strain profitability. this show many empirical studies. we therefore ass relationship profitability resistance differently pre-crisis era. back then, many – among supervisor academic – believe one-to-one relationship profit risk. we know this: sustainability counts. and sustainability cannot exist environment high volatility. those desire sustainable profitability business model put strict limit proprietary trading. the basel iii rule govern market risk serve objective and, opinion, point right direction. they set reduce volatility profitability. volatility, close interrelationship player financial system high financial leverage reason systemic importance investment banks. bi central bankers’ speech 3 on liability side, too, quite institution depart commercial bank model. the significance market-based fund instrument increase enormously, role customer deposit shrunk. this increase banks’ dependency market-based fund make fund vulnerable market price market movements. and accompany tendency towards short-term funding. this actually lead increase interest rate risk liquidity risk. however, empirical study bundesbank show major systemically important bank – least germany – largely shield interest rate risk. on balance, hedge large percentage positions. interest income risk therefore affected. however, still liquidity risk – words, refinance risk. this see many irrelevant boom cycle. market liquidity dry quickly financial crisis, though. it become ever-more difficult roll loans, even though central bank could help. it use true “liquidity follow creditworthiness” “liquidity follow solvency”. the financial crisis show case time. even institution “healthy” asset portfolio capable run distress – least because, first, nobody entirely sure hold much “toxic assets” balance sheet – also, especially, balance sheet “shadow bank system”. spun-off spvs mean everyone suspect. 3. specialise bank versus universal banks: miss point one main concern aftermath crisis make bank system safe overall protect taxpayers, thus general public, pay price banks’ mistake – quite rightly so. some observer “in know” believe divorce investment bank commercial bank perfect way limit social cost ail banks. a high-level expert group european commission, head erkki liikanen, governor bank finland, study issues. i therefore want go aspect i think particularly important. a i say beginning, investment bank does, indeed, involve specific risks. by contrast, traditional banking, deposit lend business, often – necessarily always – characterise le risky business model. some argue separate two type bank activity would protect macroeconomically vital task supply real economy credit and, time, shield investment banking’s inherent risks. they also claim would make bank resolution easier. what i’m wondering, however, specialise bank system truly fulfil hope invest it. unfortunately, practice always possible simply put good one pot bad one crop, paraphrase grimm brothers. for one thing, cannot ignore problem draw line put practice. in particular regard corporate services, quite easy make clear distinction traditional bank service investment bank services. and, problem draw clear boundary generally result loopholes. in term financial stability, however, much serious issue stake. one proposal specialise bank system currently table – vickers blueprint – would distinctly reduce interlinkages, welcome far effect financial stability concerned. however, would probably close every possible contagion channel. bank interlink sort channels. not least, financial crisis, order prevent contagion, particular, government also give support assistance many investment bank – i would call – quasi-investment banks. 4 bi central bankers’ speech the lehman brother bankruptcy cause precisely contagion, customer deposit risk. rather, many connection financial institution including, all, counterparty derivative transactions, lehman brother particularly heavily exposed. essentially apply aig – even bank, insurer. aig also major counterparty. in case, too, government rescue package intend keep shock wave buffet financial system. and case large rescue operation germany, save hypo real estate, customer deposit main issue, either, rather danger wide-ranging domino effect – banks; pfandbrief market, affect institution major issuer; insurers, pfandbriefe key investments. not everything rosy even classical bank business. the large bank – deem “too big fail” – sole source systemic risk. the spanish case make abundantly clear. here, bank destabilise exposure real-estate market. these vulnerability create traditional lend business. proponent specialise bank system believe produce good solution “too big fail” problem. and, wisdom introduce system specialise bank judge term whether make easy supervise large, complex financial institutions. even important, i see it, whether bank can, crisis, easily resolve investment bank arm. after all, break-up lead creation small banks. this much i believe: best regulatory solution “too big fail” problem credible threat institution’s orderly market exit. this well within tradition standard insolvency law, will. and case standard insolvency bankruptcy proceed cannot apply precisely “too big fail” problem, resolution regime – credible regime – needed. develop cross-border, harmonise resolution regime therefore also core international reform efforts. shareholder creditor distress bank bear losses, wherever possible, without pass taxpayer without pose threat financial stability. in crisis, possible transfer institution’s critical function third party government bridge bank – even without prior consent institution, shareholder creditors. these critical function maintained; otherwise financial stability would risk. the decisive factor – always come money finance – credibility. be possible introduce credible resolution regime exist structures? or structure complex realistic market exit? the tbtf problem desperately require solution. if solution find credible resolution regimes, advantage universal bank need sacrificed. let repeat: credible resolution system much good option regulatory purposes. i see proponent specialise bank come from. however, fooled: simply ring-fencing investment bank banks’ core business enough prevent future systemic crises. we therefore need focus strongly underlie source systemic risk banks’ business model effectively mitigate them. this involve subject activity banks’ proprietary trade critical examination. a difficult draw clear line, would good us, here, focus le whether permit existence capital adequacy. i fully agreement mr schmitz, president association german banks, say “the decisive factor risk incur commensurate risk buffers. to extent, impose great restriction area proprietary trade exist crisis make sense right move.” bi central bankers’ speech 5 4. capital adequacy: key element solvency necessary, sufficient condition financial stability. what crucial solvency, besides quality asset portfolio, amount capital. this key element restore confidence. that relevant 2008 2009. in 2011 financial stability review, example, bundesbank follow say, “however, time systemic stress, market cease make broad-based distinction because, suppose exogenous shock actually trigger systemic crisis, almost impossible ex ante forecast position individual bank. in scenario, task restore confidence merely responsibility individual bank also call arm system whole.” injection capital one weapon cause. capital adequacy everything. but without adequate capital, come nothing. capital act substantial internal buffer. such buff large enough cushion stress strains. provide put place good time, lend cut back straightaway, even event systemic shock. the institution gain respite launch fire-sale auction shed risky asset time, bring cumulative decline value assets. here i see many practitioner object grind capital scarce expensive. most economist doubt – like bonn economist, martin hellwig – accept reason forgo strict regulatory capital requirements. the reason that, point, practitioner like argue implicitly use ceteris paribus clause, words, thing equal. in line reasoning, capital donor certain idea return capital put in. if capital share increased, expenditure great situation high borrow capital. the crux matter this: thing equal. that require return capital contain risk premium. this compensate shareholder entrepreneurial risk. and risk premium fall capital increased, mean entrepreneurial risk spread capital. under certain assumptions, even possible show much risk premium reduced: precisely amount overall capital cost remain unchanged. this substance modigliani-miller theorems. and anyone say nothing dry theory everything quite different investment bank practice, i would reply prove precisely mean use investment bank value options. and even complete neutrality finance guaranteed, way round fact risk premium require return capital go capital share go up. it simply matter economic logic. that fact alone put notion “expensive capital” sort perspective. the neutrality fund apply long distortion affect two type capital differently. even so, outside capital give preferential tax treatment equity capital way tax deductibility interest payments. tax break service debt thus low cost borrow capital. and perhaps even significant: financial crisis, explicit implicit guarantee systemically important institution mean borrow was, eventually, subsidised. from point view big bank, loan capital become cheap equity capital. be practitioners’ view equity capital lead high cost therefore right context all? no, implicit guarantee loan capital mean that, event crisis, cost transfer general public or, words, 6 bi central bankers’ speech taxpayer. this result disconnect microeconomic macroeconomic cost benefits, point german council economic experts. there fallout this, course. it set wrong incentives. it favour highly leverage business models. it give excessive stimulus risk-taking. in short, create moral hazard. thus, high input borrow capital cheap bank, cost payable elsewhere. conversely, business cost high capital requirement offset relief elsewhere, namely taxpayer – quite apart stabilise effect large capital buff financial stability. from microeconomic perspective, one can, course, well understand resistance high capital requirements. that mean resistance justify macroeconomic terms, far it. or, mr hellwig put it, “given negative externality bank use debt rather equity, reason refrain require bank capital grind equity expensive regulation would raise bank’s cost capital. quite contrary, regulation would merely counteract perverse incentive create corporate tax system inability government commit bail banks.” 5. conclusion allow summarise think four basic propositions. first: business model number bank undergo fundamental transformation associate turn away traditional business towards investment banking. second: mean profitability subject high degree volatility. third: solve “too big fail” problem, reason forgo advantage universal banks. fourth: adequate capital key element achieve financial stability. these proposition might cover everything, i see vital elements. if lesson apply reform efforts, shall already achieve great deal. i, least, shall utmost make happen. bi central bankers’ speech 1 b mahapatra: underlie concept principle dynamic provision keynote address mr b mahapatra, executive director reserve bank india, conference “introduction dynamic provision framework bank india”, organise centre advance financial research learn (cafral), mumbai, 21 september 2012. * * * the contribution make mr usha janakiraman mr tariqa singh gratefully acknowledged. thank much invite conference share understand underlie concept principle dynamic provisioning. a discussion paper subject bring reserve bank india (rbi) march 2012. we still process examine comment receive bank stakeholder may take u finalise anything regard. why make provisions? let start discussion question: make provisions? to mind provision account concept. account standard define provision liability uncertain time amount measure use substantial degree estimation. the term “provision” also use context item depreciation, impairment asset doubtful debts: adjustment carry amount assets. it requirement entity ass end report period whether objective evidence asset impair also whether liability need recognise settlement obligation involve outflow resources. when case, amount require recognise profit loss account report period. this enable present “true fair” financial position entity period, raison d’être accounting. entity strong incentive under-provisioning, because: • it generally fully tax deductible many jurisdictions; • many business executive take short term view show enhance profits. high provision reduce profits, hence dividend distribution share price; importantly, bonus payment top management staff. the hold good bank also. however, bank business add another dimension issue, is, pro-cyclicality. bank prone business cycles. in good times, demand credit bank become aggressive loosen credit standards. debtor also well service loan time. loan loss rate long-run average, need loan loss provision less. therefore, loan loss provision usually under-funded boom period. when business cycle turn economic condition deteriorate, borrowers’ credit quality tend worsen lead high probability towards default service interest principal payment. these loan become non-performing asset (npas). banks’ profit go time require make high loan loss provision non-performing loans. this cyclical property credit losses. this result bank become cautious restrict lending; result risk spill real sector economy. procyclicality thus impact amplify business cycles. in term account standard recognize credit losses, ia 39 – financial instruments: recognition measurement, financial asset impair impairment loss incur if, objective evidence impairment result one 2 bi central bankers’ speech event (i.e., loss event/s) occur initial recognition assets, loss event (or events) impact future cash flow financial asset reliably estimated. this approach provisioning, also know “incurred loss” base approach wait certain event happen default, delinquency interest principal payments, significant financial difficulty borrower, etc., loss recognized. provision loss make loss event identified, loss incurred, proactive manner ex ante event, base “expected losses”. the incur loss model come severe criticism recent global financial crisis delay loss recognition. there view early recognition loan loss base “expected losses” could potentially reduce cyclical impact recent crisis. however, accountant comfortable expect loss base provision fear could foster earn management profit smoothen compromise raison d’être account give “true fair” transparent picture financials entity report date. improvement credit risk model support concept expect loss unexpected losses. from conceptual point view, loan loss provision cover expect loss capital provide adequate buff unexpected losses. the internal rat base (irb) model approach basel ii credit risk capital computation give fillip expect loss base provision unexpected loss base capitalisation. in immediate aftermath crisis, april 2009, g20 leader call upon account standard setter work urgently bank supervisor regulator improve standard valuation provision achieve single set high quality global account standards. the basel committee bank supervision (bcbs) take forward publish document august 2009 title guide principle replacement ia 39 also send international account standard board (iasb). these principle state loan loss provision robust base sound methodology reflect expect credit loss banks’ exist loan portfolio life portfolio. the account model provision allow early identification recognition loss incorporate broad range available credit information presently include incur loss model. for purpose principles, expect credit loss estimate loss loan portfolio life loan consider loss experience complete economic cycle. post-crisis, convergence view among prudential regulator account standard setter desirability forward look expect loss approach loan loss provisioning. in reality, financial result objectively worsen economic downturn way similar rise unemployment rates. therefore apply impairment model base expect loss arguably faithful representation current conditions. the iasb, financial account standard board (fasb) well bcbs actively engage find solution complex problem. in context, expect loss base provision approach topic significant interest global financial markets. even bank accountant make incur loss base provision identify losses, call “specific” provisions, also voluntarily make sort “general” provision “floating” provisions. these “general” provision base expect loss model, prudent practice strengthen balance sheets. the basel committee also incentivises general provision 1.25% credit risk weight asset count towards tier 2 capital. bi central bankers’ speech 3 concept principle dynamic provision technique allow bank build loan loss provision profit grow draw provision economic downturn. there several variant dynamic provisioning. however, underlie principle behind dynamic provision provision set line estimate long-run, through-the-cycle expect losses. this help break pro-cyclicality create countercyclical provision buffers. dynamic provision build generally express as: dynamic provision = expect loss provision – specific provision, dynamic provision = through-the-cycle loss ratio * flow new loan – flow specific provision, specific provision correspond realise incur losses, simply put: dynamic provision = expect loss provision – incur loss provisions. ----- (1) 17. a close look formula show good time dynamic provision positive add loss provision realise incur losses, is, specific provision low through-the-cycle estimates. during bad times, opposite take place negative dynamic provision deplete loss provision buffer. therefore, provisioning, instead become pro-cyclical, become countercyclical. the spanish model let talk dynamic provision implement spain. prior introduction dynamic provision spain, spanish banks’ provision pattern close currently prevail countries. accord standard system, bank require make two type provision loan losses. first, general provision make fix percentage credit growth. this intend account loss incur average homogeneous portfolio without specifically identify suspect loans. second, specific provision delinquent asset i.e., incur loss individual loan make depend level risk loan time overdue. dynamic provision system put place spain central bank, bank spain july 2000 cope sharp increase credit risk spanish banks’ balance sheet follow period significant credit growth late 1990s. intense competition among bank result inadequate loan pricing. moral suasion also prove inadequate induce bank become conservative. there significant reduction non-performing loan second half 1990s indicate low specific provisions. in fact, 1999 spain low ratio loan loss provision total loan among oecd countries. it also high correlation provision ratio gdp growth rate (–0.97) period 1991–1999. thus loan loss provision pro-cyclical spain: low period expansion high recessions, credit risk under-pricing risk spread boom period. under new system (2000 regime) addition specific general provision, statistical provision add difference latent risk (risk parameter dependent upon credit growth) specific provision. the statistical provision charge quarterly. this imply statistical provision give period could positive negative, depend credit growth contemporary bad loans. when statistical provision accumulate generate fund call statistical provision fund. the fund upper low limit. after introduction statistical provision, upswing economic cycle turn much strong long anticipated. this, together initial design limit fund base rough estimate lead rapid increase 4 bi central bankers’ speech statistical provision fund, whereas specific provision keep minimum, environment historically low non-performing loans. in 2004 become evident accumulation statistical provision probably excessive. at time, bank spain increasingly criticise international account forum apply mechanism appear favour profit smoothing, consider contrary “fair value” principle international account standards. to correct excessive accumulation counter criticism accountants, new account regulation adopt 2004. the change involve revert two type loan loss provisions, viz., general specific provisions. general provision sum two component base two important parameters, alpha beta. alpha average estimate credit losses, say expect loss base past experience beta historical average specific provisions. the underlie principle behind dynamic provision spain build general provision account (i) expect loss new loan extend give period; (ii) historical average loss outstanding stock loan end period net specific provision incur period. formula-wise: general provision period = [alpha * incremental loans] + [(beta – delta specific provision / outstanding loans) * (outstanding loans)] general provision period = [alpha * incremental loans] + [(beta * outstanding loans) – (delta specific provision)] -------- (2) the first component general provision alpha time incremental loan grant bank. this component therefore recognise credit risk expect expansion although loan loss yet identify specific loan. the second component beta time stock outstanding loan reduce specific provision make period. one observe second component, beta historical average specific provision compare current level specific provision. this difference would positive period boom current level specific provision low historical average thus add towards balance general provision. similarly, period downturns/recession, current level specific provision may high historical average specific provision; case, second component become negative component subtract first component may cause general provision fund draw down. thus second component countercyclical nature build upturn draw downturns. the second component also reflective strength weakness lend cycle depend upon addition/drawals make general provision. alpha beta calibrate bank spain six homogeneous risk category range zero risk (cash, public sector debt, etc.) high risk (credit card overdrafts). an option also give bank use calibrate parameter base credit history experiences, subject supervisory approval. let give example make thing clearer. assume outstanding stock loan bank x rs. 1000 previous year balance loan rs. 800, thus assume incremental growth credit rs. 200. further assume alpha beta component give supervisor 2% 1% respectively. assume specific provision require current year rs. 8. for first year, bank x would make general provision equal alpha time incremental loan i.e. 2% rs. 200 i.e., rs. 4 plus difference beta time outstanding loan specific provision case work 1% rs. 1000 – rs. 8 = rs. 2. thus, total general provision rs. 6 (4+2) would make bank x year. total provision make year would sum general provision specific provision i.e., rs. 6 + rs. 8 = rs. 14. to avoid provision excess provision satisfy accountants, general provision floor 33% cap 125% alpha time outstanding loans. bi central bankers’ speech 5 these limit place 2004 bank already new upper limit time application regulation. in general, excess provision would occur long expansionary phase specific provision remain beta alpha also contribute positively. the cap intend avoid loan loss provision grow long period, produce coverage ratio (ratios provision non-performing loans) unrealistic. the total provision dynamic provision model viz., summation general provision specific provision thus work alpha time incremental loan plus beta time outstanding credit. the spanish model conservative create general provision equal alpha time incremental credit growth i.e., general provision still increase due first component even current level specific provision equal historical average specific provision. however, economic downturn second component solely responsible reduction stock provisions. the fsa model have explain basic tenet behind spanish dynamic provision model, also important briefly cover fsa, uk model dynamic provision suggest turner review march 2009. under fsa model, dynamic provision difference long term loan loss estimate incremental specific provision. thus, dynamic provision create incremental specific provision low long term loan loss estimate akin expect losses. the total provision require year model viz., dynamic specific work long term loan loss estimate. under fsa model, flow dynamic provision calculate use stock loan outstanding begin year set under: dynamic provision (to make year) = long term loan loss estimate – incremental specific provision ---- (3) i take follow example rbi’s discussion paper: 6 bi central bankers’ speech key assumption example are: i. ten-year economic cycle, ii. an average long-run loss rate 0.8% loans, unchanged mix loan within portfolio, iii. an average risk weight 60% loans. it also assume that, mainly application variable scalar approach probability default (pds), risk weight vary cycle. the example start loan book rs. 100 downturn, dynamic provision approach implemented. in early years, dynamic provision reserve impact. because set good part cycle, prior downturn, balance may run year actual credit loss exceed long-run average. a economy revert normal conditions, growth start return credit loss fall. during year 4 9 latter le long run average, allow dynamic provision reserve build up. this automatically reduce year 11 12 order provide substantial coverage average loss next downturn. the example show dynamic approach would operate build buff good part cycle, could use downturn materializes. it base upon exist spanish approach; however, separate alpha factor cover growth stock loans. bi central bankers’ speech 7 the peruvian model some south american country also introduce dynamic provisioning, notable one peru. peru introduce cyclical provision form general provisions, link rate growth gdp. when gdp growth exceed certain threshold rate (i.e., boom period), cyclical provision activated; gdp growth rate fall threshold level, cyclical provision deactivated. it assume gdp growth precede credit growth gdp good systemic growth indicator credit. propose indian framework let come need introduction dynamic provision framework india theoretical model suggest discussion paper march 2012. although rbi follow policy countercyclical variation standard asset provision rate base available data judgement, current provision framework inbuilt countercyclical cycle smoothen element base analysis credit cycle loss history. the need introduce countercyclical provision framework long recognize rbi. however, lesson global financial crisis strengthen need introduce framework. in december 2009, minimum provision coverage ratio (pcr) introduce rbi ensure build provision buff bank general make good profits. however, intend interim measure till time comprehensive scientific study base credit history bank attempt rbi. a mention above, concept dynamic provision generate lot interest supervisor world spanish bank remain profitable global financial crisis. a india already think implement countercyclical approach, dynamic provision concept come handy start work area. after study various approach dynamic provision implement various country viz. spain, peru, etc, dynamic provision framework design rbi keep view uniqueness indian bank system. let briefly talk theoretical model discuss rbi discussion paper march 2012. dynamic provision framework india le base fsa model. the theoretical formula under: delta dynamic provision = expect loss – incremental specific provision = alpha * outstanding loan – incremental specific provision ----- (4) the provision framework suggest rbi two component viz. (i) specific provision (ii) dynamic provisions. while specific provision would per rbi guideline npa provisioning, dynamic provision would difference long run average expect loss portfolio one year specific provision make year. thus, ensure every year charge profit loss account account specific provision dynamic provision maintain level alpha time outstanding loan i.e., expect losses. a observe above, dynamic provision create specific provision less expect losses. the framework thus ensure point time, provision equivalent expect loss made. thus, objective dynamic provision framework smoothen impact incur loss profit loss account cycle, provide general provision cushion expect losses. that essence indian dynamic provision framework. let discus important aspect relate propose framework dynamic provisioning. although still review light suggestion feedback receive banks, i briefly touch upon important aspect framework: 8 bi central bankers’ speech loss give default (lgd) use calculation expect loss base downturn lgd (instead normal lgd) use internal ratings-based approach credit risk (irb) basel ii. however, moderate put cap this. in india, really see severe downturn/cycle. the parameter calibrate u base data 5–10 years. calibration loss parameter base say 10 year data may adequately reflect severity probable loss may occur downturn current cycle. in order make sound estimation, actual loss data least 2–3 cycles, say 20–25 year generally required. therefore, risk calibrate dynamic provision rate base average loss rate 10 years, reasonable element conservatism require add calibration. it therefore felt downturn lgd rate base data last 10 year could good measure require conservatism. however, ensure bank unnecessarily burdened, cap put place. when dynamic provision framework first implemented, bank transfer entire amount general provision float provision balance dynamic provisions. thereafter, dynamic provision grow amount equal difference expect loss specific provision make year. for purpose determine provision may count towards capital, addition calculation dynamic provision base downturn lgd, bank would also require compute dynamic provision base normal lgd notional basis. the difference two would treat general provision count towards tier 2 capital, dynamic provision base normal lgd would treat specific provisions. in order ensure bank draw dynamic provision absorb high loss due credit appraisal credit supervision weakness deplete slowdown occurs, draw propose allow specifically rbi base evidence slowdown. a suitable framework release dynamic provision formulate rbi. in time dynamic provision release rbi, bank allow dip dynamic provision profitability sufficient accommodate specific provisions. methodology adopt calibration alpha (expected losses) expect loss next one year calculate use basel ii irb formula i.e., pd*lgd. movement npa data 5–10 year use calibrate pd lgd. alpha calculate system wide basis bank well four asset classes, viz., housing, retail, corporates (other infrastructure sme) others base sample 9 bank comprise 32.53% gross advance schedule commercial bank march 31, 2010. impact propose framework while impact propose framework individual bank assessed, system wide basis, provision charge profit loss account stand 1.37% gross advance annually. from system-wide data collect rbi, average annual charge profit loss account account standard asset provision specify provision (including write offs) 8 year period (from 2003 2010) amount 1.04% gross advances. the additional charge mainly attribute calibration alpha base downturn lgd. bi central bankers’ speech 9 issue some issue worth debate consider implement dynamic provision following: data challenge for calibration alpha, apart “bank whole” data, data call bank respect 8 segment viz. infrastructure, commercial real estate (cre), small medium enterprise (sme), other corporate, retail, housing, credit card others. however, useful data purpose study could submit 9 bank retail, house other corporate (corporate exclude infrastructure, sme cre). due this, study limit retail, housing, other corporate (corporates exclude infrastructure, sme cre) others (which residual category). ideally, alpha (expected loss) calculate different loan segment may exhibit different level riskiness thus warrant high provisioning. calibration alpha base forward-looking through-the-cycle probability default various asset classes/rating class base credit history individual bank reflect credit risk profile. however, possible bank alpha calibrate base individual credit history stage requisite data capture them. further, system-level alpha could calculate stage important segment require separate alpha factor owe data issue. however, ensure improve calibration, discussion paper propose increase number segment apart increase number year data size sample due course. calibration parameter require bank make provision base standardize parameter calculate system wide basis may penalize bank manage credit portfolio good manner risk under-provisioning case risky bank poor credit portfolio. however, may address require bank gradually move calculation alpha base credit history. time implementation it argue dynamic provision implement upturn ensure build cushion may use downturn. with indian economy bank system experience asset quality stress presently, conscious call take implement dynamic provision stage cycle. lend cycle effect a dynamic provision system usually design use information credit loss previous lend cycle. but guarantee system design way enough cope credit loss next downturn. even spain, period use calibration include bad recession 40 years, clear system enough cover credit losses. profit smooth there widespread criticism dynamic provision disguise crucial information lump together provision cost incur expect loss income statement therefore counter objective ensure availability timely reliable information bank performance. this can, however, overcome adequate disclosure extent specific dynamic provisions. such disclosure signal user financial statement difference dynamic provision represent 10 bi central bankers’ speech loss expectation base historical data specific provision loss actually identify loan portfolio. interaction account standard one question invariably arise implement dynamic provision would whether concept accordance international account standards? thus far, answer negative since concept dynamic provision deviate principle incur loss follow currently accounting. however, wake crisis, two major global standard setter iasb fasb agree principle incur loss model limitation need replace expect loss model. the “trigger events” require loan write current incur loss model ia 39 propose replace forward look expect loss base provision approach new ifrs 9 set replace ia 39. a per current update ifrs 9, propose implement expect loss model, entity shall take account information past loss events, current condition reasonable forecast economic condition future events. it therefore doubtful whether dynamic provision system fully accordance principle forthcoming ifrs 9 since exclusively base historical loss experience. we need carefully watch development account front figure dovetail dynamic provision concept account principles. however, progress make iasb fasb develop expect loss base provision standard slow. why spanish bank face problem now? the spanish bank system credit one equip among western economy cope global financial crisis appreciate conservative prudent bank rule – specially dynamic provision see policy make circle model rest world. however, crisis presently face bank system spain mainly due real estate bubble burst 2007 become focal point interest supervisor regulators. apprehension raise whether spanish bank actually face crisis merely postpone losses, make even bad bank sector. it apparent bank spain report losses. this think give boost bankia, large mortgage lender spain, revise earn 2011 €309 million profit €4.3 billion loss. there newspaper report state exploit term dynamic provision become euphemism old account trick call cookie jar accounting, spanish bank understate past profits, shift late period mask future losses. spanish bank claim excess reserve long deplete effect profit smooth earn management, make bank look healthy fact, quite opposite. the spanish case exemplify limitation provision framework prevent exuberance bank lend inherently risky sector economy. economic cycle powerful negate impact prudential rule extent serial underestimation risks. while partial recognition loan loss buy time short run, long run lead problem due loss credibility. with specific reference spain again, loan loss reserve prove insufficient house collapse. in 2004, spanish central bank put cap 125% general provision reportedly pressure banks. also, floor 33% place 2004 late removed. from time onwards, spanish bank lend already grow 14 per cent annually go boom, grow 25% 2005 2006. the reserve naturally prove insufficient crisis struck. this strengthen belief economic cycle harsh deep previous one wipe provision base early cycles. bi central bankers’ speech 11 it note dynamic provision panacea ill plague financial system. it need accompany macro-prudential tool aim mitigate pro-cyclicality systemic risks. further, calibrate dynamic provision system, care need take maintain countercyclical reserve line expect loss avoid insufficient buff excessive provision coverage. there guarantee dynamic provision enough cope credit loss downturn cycle turn deep anticipated. conclusion the crisis experience spain cannot dilute efficacy concept dynamic provisioning. dynamic provision tool certainly deserve attention policy maker regulator distribute loan loss evenly credit cycle apply break important source pro-cyclicality banking. no prudential rules/regulations help save bank system failure corporate governance. to avoid pitfall observe spanish model, rbi prefer take downturn lgd calibrate expect loss alpha. this prudent approach. let conclude. we discuss need provisioning; drawback incur loss base provision model; post-crisis, need countercyclical provision tool base expect losses; underlie concept principle dynamic provisioning; framework implement spain; propose framework india; issue implementation lesson recent crisis spain. dynamic expect loan loss provision contribute financial stability recognize loss early cycle time loan origination build buff

pontifical council justice peace, frankfurt main, 19 september 2012. * * * i ask share view today note pontifical council justice peace reform international financial monetary system. lack global financial regulation i highly welcome general tone pontifical council’s note stress need financial sector serve overall economy and, accordingly, common good. with respect financial regulation, note rightly point lack truly global regulation global financial market key factor financial crisis start 2007. while financial market around globe become integrate interconnect past decades, financial regulation remain largely national – despite ongoing coordination effort international committee groupings. the crisis highlight inefficiency international coordination financial regulation necessitate numerous ad-hoc intervention public authorities. those event make clear although rule regulation partly agree internationally, transition national rule legislation fragment and, times, even inconsistent. not surprisingly, financial institution strong incentive engage regulatory arbitrage. an internationally coordinate regulatory response therefore warranted. minimum body internationally agree rule i agree conclusion pontifical council need minimum, share body rule regulation global financial markets. but one size fit all. accordingly, line principle subsidiarity, rule set international level allow sufficient flexibility adapt peculiarity national financial systems. however, i see need create new “global authority” purpose. over past years, financial stability board (fsb) emerge central body coordinate international financial sector reform agenda set train g20 leader washington summit 2008 develop subsequent meetings. the fsb bring together international institution standard-setting body well regulators, central banker finance minister advance emerge economy important financial sector globally. in meantime, fsb gain track record several important cornerstone reform agenda set place. take policy framework deal systemically important financial institution new regulatory standard bank capital adequacy liquidity – commonly term basel iii – examples. g20 leaders, late 2011, agree strengthen fsb’s role order enable keep pace grow role promote development implementation regulation. accordingly, june 2012, g20 leader endorse fsb’s recommendation strengthen capacity, resource governance. i strongly support development fsb i convince improve elaboration international rule regulation well international cooperation regulation supervision help achieve international level play field. 2 bi central bankers’ speech rigorous monitor national implementation while rule-making international level necessary condition financial stability, mean sufficient. for rule effective, translate national law regulation timely consistent manner. therefore, need strictly monitor implementation, disclose respective findings, let peer pressure work magic. the fsb international standard-setting body jointly develop coordination framework implementation monitor ensure consistent implementation reform agenda. a another important part implementation monitoring, international monetary fund together world bank regularly assess adherence member country international standards. thereby, fund promote international monetary cooperation exchange rate stability. in response weakness detect financial crisis, fund initiate various reform aim strengthen internal governance well analytical capabilities. i highly welcome reform improve fund’s work. to sum up, i regard strengthen exist body field global financial regulation international monetary system right way forward two main reasons. firstly, allow build upon substantial expertise gather exist institutions. secondly, jurisdiction obviously reluctant cede national sovereignty supra-national level. the endure debate creation fiscal union europe provide one vivid example regard. accordingly, creation global regulatory authority seem practical point time. moreover, i regard current practice set rule global financial market appropriate. in first step, set rule international level. a second step, rigorously monitor translation national law regulation ensure consistency global level play field. a i point out, adequate institution global level fulfill tasks, currently i see need create new authority purpose. thank attention! bi central bankers’ speech 1 amando m tetangco, jr: manage risk financial stability world – different prudential world? speech mr

gentlemen, good evening. it pleasure join tonight six (6) organizations… since last general membership meeting, i tell two organization add meeting. in words, “clan” get bigger. among six organizations, cover broad spectrum market activity oversee… cash market, foreign exchange market, security underwrite broke trust. this gather impressive sheer breadth operate interests, fall purview bank regulator…this assembly therefore present unique opportunity bsp share view several different organization time. i would therefore like thank invitation. the operate environment a i do year general membership meeting, i shall begin remark touch target expectation policy horizon. if attend mid-year economic brief last monday (17 september) picc, i think would agree that, immediately precede economic brief host bsp-iro, public’s interest economy palpable. the excitement economic prospect remain high. the presenter government side optimistic, reactor private sector side upbeat. our current growth rate already doorstep national government’s announce real gdp growth target 2013 6–7 pct…inflation expect benign target headline inflation still set 3–5 pct 2014… the country’s external position see remain robust. in fact, current bop gir already level forecast 2013, higher. indeed, would seem economic policy reform invest year converge towards solid high economic performance…but, take in, need prudent… let u overvalue good prospect l become complacent… you markets, all, familiar still fragile global environment operate in. over past two weeks, ecb feed announce new asset purchase program – omt (although conditionality) qe3…central banker know use acronym also, don’t we? both much await market…both seemingly open-ended… signal prolong easy monetary policy advance economies…and, reaction far been, expected… to take add risk, layer policy uncertainty peel away. at bsp, watchful developments. if program still don’t produce desire effect growth unemployment u europe, risk clearly downside. of particular concern u adverse feedback loop financial 2 bi central bankers’ speech sector real sector due 1) interlock sovereign debt bank crisis euro zone…2) overhang fiscal cliff us, and…3) soften chinese economy. the 2007/08 financial crisis graphically illustrate u feedback loop strong could take non-trivial length time unwind…it also teach u although focus price stability necessary, sufficient condition protect economic growth… furthermore, remember lesson look health individual financial entity would safeguard system whole…indeed, recent crisis teach u many thing – importantly, teach u policy ensure monetary stability financial stability must go hand hand. i know market player listen speech bsp governor, radar up, hop hear “directionals”… on peso hope hear peso going. have hit top yet?... on interest rates, hope hear headed. have hit bottom yet?... be top? bottom? be bsp hold steady?... these important concerns, course, peso interest rate are, fee directly quite concretely everyday life filipinos. but, i don’t speak directionals tonight… everyday come across quote financial prices… so i certain already know stance bsp… one, that, exchange rate remain market-determined… although, folks, aware bsp watch conduct market… two, policy interest rate always primarily dictate inflation outlook…but balance concern excess segment market real asset capital flows. you know current assessment – inflation policy horizon remain well within target range 3–5 percent. you must also know implication interest rate interest rate remain low period. many already good handle bsp conduct monetary policy exchange rate policy. i say success communicate monetary policy market. but still need work convey nuance come financial stability. so, instead one-dimensional directionals, i would like u spend next minute discuss financial stability. in bsp, believe important pursue financial stability financial stability make transmission policy (including monetary policy) effective… moreover, pursue financial stability help financial institution good allocate resources. when risk/return tradeoff know steady, return “predictable” even risk relatively higher. in words, financial stability benefit policy maker market. so what’s new financial stability? the original draft speech contain bsp financial stability framework…our definition financial stability…the governance framework bsp…and push agenda go past bsp borders. but interest time, let focus couple point (well, five point precise) help good appreciate mean bsp talk financial stability, hopefully along way, discussion help also understand mean institution represent. let begin capital. the bsp “focused” capital adequacy – perspective strengthen ability capital absorb losses. l i misunderstood, i want emphasize regulation past never simply bi central bankers’ speech 3 exact compliance specific ratio. what different today focus. now goal make capital efficient mitigate potential loss type bailouts saw jurisdictions. today, (in sense) “stricter” go (or go) numerator denominator ratio. by this, broaden risk account capital. this bsp view car financial stability perspective. the car keep compliance officer awake night… it concern everyone here, include confine trade rooms…. lady gentlemen, type transaction risk undertake define amount kind capital institution have… but already know that… example 15pct risk weight ndf. it kind policy framework drive new regulation put out… and second point…we view regulation use “systemic” lens. after additional ndf risk weight, must note bsp become visibly concern issue systemic implications. these reflect in, among others, refinement sda trading, intend contain possible carry trade fund sdas, initiative improve report real estate exposures, expect ensure possible exposure contain net account limit set. these reform recent put out… many lie ahead – money market capital market derivative market. some pipeline 1) define benchmark yield curve price transparent independent one large market participant’s rejection (i mean actions) auction market, 2) awaken moribund repo market liquidity improve one-sided quote thing past, 3) standardize otc derivative structure product would leg stand on, 4) obtain component shadow bank unregulated activity bring surface. while i list forthcoming reforms, let also share talk regulatory circle consumer protection elevate core bank function simply advocacy… you keep mind happens, would materially impact product development, disclosure practice market efforts, one hand, trade settlement infrastructure, other. this bring third point. market infrastructure … the perennial elephant room… friends, new international guideline introduced. let rattle acronyms. i afraid it’s central banker love acronyms. regulator even big penchant these!… csds (for central security depositories), ss (for security settlement systems), ccps (for central counterparties) trs (for trade repositories). i say bsp take in…. but guideline place, consider adopt best practice guideline domestic operate context. i assure you, bsp consultative roll guidelines... time, bsp allow parochial motivation cloud best market financial stability. move fourth point… in consider financial stability, bsp push change financial governance framework start financial institution itself. i realize point may seem odds i say parochial motivations…. but solid governance structure bank would precisely help institution veer away insular thinking. governance never mean reactive function regulator. our recently release revise compliance framework highlight accountability bank action process undertake. we also issue new corporate governance risk management guideline trust (i tell latter undergo considerable discussion coordination…is indicative tough trust practitioner are?) 4 bi central bankers’ speech finally, would serious oversight i touch monetary policy aspect financial stability. our calibration monetary policy rate towards price stability clearly real economy implications. in addition, interest rate benchmark monetary policy set directly impact cost leverage volume credit exposures. obviously, use one policy lever (in case, policy interest rates) would always able address – time – two policy objective (price stability vs. financial stability) without conflict. hence, use enhance policy tool kit policy coordination imperative. to operationalize bsp, recently create bsp financial stability committee (or fscomm) addition bsp advisory committee (which recommend monetary policy monetary board). from five item i enumerate earlier, clear financial stability cross three pillar central banking. to close “divide”, fscomm set high level bsp, main committee man three deputy governor 3 senior officer bsp… i pleasure directly oversee committee. close remarks: market conduct ensure reform success i give guideposts, mile marker road financial stability – see bsp. the bsp put regulation create enable regulatory environment… but, everything say done, market execute transactions. a wise man warn deal market, one anticipate much destination, ride itself. financial target tell u want go risk-taking risk management get u there. no doubt, ride enjoyable give high, don’t manage risk well, – drag everyone else – might end one big traffic jam, gutter. lady gentlemen, i ask everyone – lack good term – “behave”… a michael corleone say sonny, “it’s personal, it’s strictly business.” acceptable behaviour give collective responsibility requires. and collective responsibility prudential concerns. turn head, prudential concern collective responsibility gain (as well losses) always shared. this apply much cash market, foreign exchange market, security underwrite brokering, trust fiduciary activity certainly banking. i therefore ask organization institution tonight, let u effectively partner one another because... stake far great bottom line single balance sheet… stake far outweigh high ride…. lady gentlemen, together. bi central bankers’ speech 1 jörg asmussen: new ecb premise top ceremony welcome address mr jörg asmussen, member

morris county chamber commerce. it always pleasure speak business community i thank invite today. i get office new york city regularly inform – first-hand – economic condition challenge across second federal reserve district. each visit within region help strengthen relationship diverse people district build deep understand economic challenge face. today, i want talk bite feed – it. then i’ll provide think national local economic outlook. normally regional outreach speech i say little monetary policy. but since federal reserve make meaningful decision last week important people understand reason motivation actions. i conclude brief discussion policy. after that, i’ll happy answer question feed why, economic outlook. a always, i say reflect view necessarily federal reserve system federal open market committee, also know fomc. what new york feed by way introduction, i briefly review colleague i new york fed. the new york feed one 12 regional federal reserve bank that, together board governor washington d.c., make federal reserve system, nation’s central bank. the federal reserve independent within government. by law, charge manage nation’s monetary policy – take action raise low interest rate promote full employment price stability. the federal reserve also charge promote financial stability, without cannot achieve economic objectives. we play important role nation’s payment settlement system, might think plumb financial system. and specific mandate promote economic development regions. a president new york fed, i serve vice chair fomc, federal reserve committee meet eight time year washington set interest rate make decision monetary policy. the member committee strive achieve statutory mandate. sometimes different view specific policy choice hand, view completely appropriate: hard question – particularly difficult economic circumstance face today. in fact, i think make good decision committee don’t think alike. but unite commitment dual mandate maximum sustainable employment price stability belief preserve independence federal reserve make monetary policy decision much public interest. that independence allow u make tough decision base data analysis insulate short-term political pressures. 2 bi central bankers’ speech at fomc meetings, committee member present current outlook region nation. in formulate assessments, consult many source – board directors, regional advisory councils, community leader key stakeholders. my meet others today part systematic effort understand go grassroots economy. to help gather information region, i meet morning fox valve, small business dover manufacture specialized, highly engineer industrial parts. after that, i pleasure participate roundtable discussion member local mexican-american business

speak students, faculty alumnus montclair state university. in addition, colleague i new york feed continually track condition district, create number tool purpose. for example, staff produce index economic activity new york city, new york state new jersey. we also track local household credit conditions, include amount type personal debt whether payment make timely way. we also conduct periodic poll credit need small businesses, important source new job region. in late poll several hundred firms, many report apply credit “discouraged.” perhaps surprisingly, many non-applicants credit profile similar firm successfully seek credit. this find suggest demand credit could pick “discouraged” firm learn might able obtain credit now. if you, representative small business, would like participate next poll, please pas card colleagues, audience, see speech glad add respondent. to promote economic development local communities, publish lot data analysis local economy, include small business poll

base economic vitality broadly. we provide house counselor community development group late information mortgage conditions, via mortgage briefs, roundtables, presentation newsletter – include interactive tool website show monthly delinquency foreclosure condition local level. this fall host conference distress residential real estate share lead expert learn senior policymakers practitioner across unite states. all all, lot keep colleague busy. regional economic condition so region doing? let start say new jersey well-positioned prosper. new jersey 11th large state – population 8.8 million population well-educated. roughly 35 percent adult 24 year old college degree, well national average. here morris county, figure almost bi central bankers’ speech 3 50 percent. the state also quite ethnically diverse: roughly 20 percent new jersey resident bear abroad. the state’s economy industrially diverse, resemble nation. new jersey employ many people healthcare, professional business services, wholesale retail trade, leisure hospitality. in northern part state, see disproportionate share job industries: finance, particularly hudson county; good distribution, relate ports, rail line truck warehouse activity prominent here; pharmaceutical manufacture r&d; private education. the area obviously benefit important link new york city. in particular, many resident area, include myself, commute day city. so recovery proceed here? base new york fed’s indices, economic activity state begin recover november 2010, year nation new york city. since then, activity recover moderate pace, although still operate previous peak. employment new jersey decline substantially downturn. our employer cut 250,000 jobs. this represent 6 percent loss – roughly par loss nationwide. le one four job recover date, slightly weak nationwide recovery and, course, much weak i would like see. over past year, private sector see moderate job gain lead key sector i mention earlier, particularly professional business services, education health, leisure hospitality. but state continue shed job manufacture little recovery construction. state local government cut back employment substantially 2010, though modest pick past year. unemployment among new jersey resident remain high. july’s read 9.8 percent put state’s rate well u.s. average. more broadly, state’s family fare financially? while median household income among new jersey family second high nation – $69,400 – roughly tenth resident live family income poverty line. although rate national rate 14 percent, vary considerably county across state, particularly high essex, hudson passaic counties. reduce poverty major challenge policymakers. the new york fed’s measure regional credit condition suggest continue financial challenge family here. a second quarter 2012, people credit report, average debt per person new jersey $63,000, roughly unchanged past several years. delinquency rate debt high: 8.4 percent debt state seriously delinquent, 7.4 percent 2011 national rate 6.7 percent. so, many new jersey household still struggle finances. although recent sign home price state start firm, nevertheless, house crisis continue take toll homeowners. a june, 9.3 percent mortgage debt new jersey 90-plus day delinquent, three percentage point national rate. and delinquency rate actually little high northern new jersey. national economic condition the performance u.s. economy since end recession 2009 disappointing. real gdp grow annual rate 2 percent period, even slow first half 2012. a result, employment gain modest, unemployment remain 8 percent – unacceptably high level – participation job market remain depressed. moreover, 5 million worker unemployed six month more. this important long-term 4 bi central bankers’ speech unemployment cause job skill atrophy make difficult people find job future. while good news job-finding rate long-term unemployed yet deteriorate many feared, ought take grant go forward. although energy price begin rise again, total inflation, measure year-over-year change consumer price index, still around 1¾ percent – le half rate september 2011. in recent months, core inflation also slow also 2 percent. high energy grain price mean headline inflation likely edge somewhat high month move slightly low again. but measure underlie rate inflation moderate, wage gain remain subdued, longer-term inflation expectation fully consistent long run inflation objective 2 per cent measure personal consumption expenditure (pce) deflator. near term, economic outlook growth pace likely remain disappointing. on positive side, motor vehicle sale august increase solidly. nevertheless, retail sale outside auto gasoline soft august household continue cautious. one bright spot house market. house start sale new exist single-family home trend gradually. nationally, home price stabilize begin rise modestly fall roughly 30 percent 2006 peak. house market condition still vary significantly across country bad perform county experience annual house price decline 8 percent more. this sector get back feet, even strong gain residential investment sector current tiny base provide modest contribution overall gdp growth. in addition, homeowner net worth remain much pre-crisis level. the near-term outlook business sector particularly worrisome right now. new order nondefense capital good information business plan spend new structure suggest weakness business fix investment. also, many indicator point sluggish manufacture activity, include ism manufacture composite index, several regional manufacture surveys, august industrial production. our empire state manufacture survey fell deep negative territory september. this manufacture slowdown stem several factors, include slowdown pace growth abroad uncertainty fiscal cliff washington resolved. so economy grow slowly since official end “great recession?” there many reasons, i would cite five factor particularly important: • access credit. although credit availability slowly improving, remain impaired, especially household less-than-sterling credit history small businesses. • balance sheet repair. although substantial progress made, many household still need rebuild net worth follow house bust. more 20 percent homeowner mortgage “underwater” – mean owe home sell for. • fiscal drag. state local government cut spend two half year federal government spend also contracting. while fiscal consolidation essential medium long term, spend cut reduce demand drag near-term growth. • risk relate europe. the crisis euro area reduce demand u.s. export weigh financial markets. • fiscal uncertainty home. family firm face elevate uncertainty relate future tax government spending, particular so-called “fiscal cliff” – bi central bankers’ speech 5 prospect sharp increase tax cut spend start 2013 congress white house cannot agree alternative fiscal plan. give sign improvement areas, include slow steady progress heal balance sheet restore supply credit, i anticipate pace economic growth gradually pick up, support low interest rates. but head fomc meet last week, i judge that, ease monetary policy further, pace improvement would unacceptably slow. monetary policy last week fomc take additional action promote robust recovery context price stability. in order ease policy, fomc deploy two complementary tools: asset purchase forward guidance interest rates. with respect asset purchases, committee say would start buy additional mortgage-backed security rate $40 billion month. in term rate guidance, committee say anticipate exceptionally low level federal fund rate would likely warrant “at least mid-2015.” a chairman bernanke explain press conference follow meeting, committee also take two step underscore commitment ongoing support recovery. first, committee say see substantial improvement outlook labor market, continue mb purchase program, undertake additional asset purchase employ policy tool appropriate does. second, committee emphasize expect highly accommodative stance monetary policy remain appropriate considerable time economic recovery strengthens. a usual, committee publish minute meet three week take place. in interim, however, i think might useful provide perspective actions. in view, decision ease policy fully consistent dual mandate policy framework. a i mention earlier, two goal – promote maximum employment price stability. we therefore seek minimize far employment long run normal level inflation longer-run goal 2 percent pce measure. because monetary policy work time lag, base policy economy today expect future. to this, make economic forecasts, base data insight broad range economic models. we also take account balance risk around base case outlook. look ahead, absence monetary easing, i conclude growth would remain subdue next several year make big inroad spare capacity remain great recession. a result, unemployment would remain unacceptably high, economic risk skew downside. meanwhile, substantial slack labor market inflation expectation stable, inflation likely remain bite 2 per cent longer-run objective. in situation, i conclude policy framework mean monetary policy ease appropriate provide benefit use tool available outweigh costs. in judgment, standard satisfy here. i confident cost manageable, base part experience use tool past four year benefit substantially exceed costs, recognizing, course, action powerful instantly transform economic outlook. so action support economic activity? buy asset extend interest rate guidance put downward pressure longer-term interest rates, low would otherwise give economic outlook. this support price asset equity homes. buy mortgage-backed security additional effect 6 bi central bankers’ speech narrow interest rate spread asset treasuries, reduce mortgage rates. moreover, extent action see support recovery provide insurance adverse shocks, confidence medium-term economic outlook also increase, make business household will invest, hire spend. if successful, long-term treasury yield could actually rise confidence sustainable recovery increases. at time, expect return private asset rise risk premia decline. this matter shift would provide support economic recovery. now true channel monetary policy affect economy may partially impair moment. for example, ongoing restriction supply mortgage credit customer le perfect credit records, impact low mortgage rate house probably le powerful normal. while restraint slowly ease house price stabilize, difficulty household low credit score obtain mortgage credit warrant ongoing attention. however, also worth note channel monetary policy affect economic activity impaired, include impact spend generate rise wealth, decline risk premia improve confidence. it important recognize tool all-powerful – monetary policy panacea ail economy. but, margin, firm face low borrow cost give economic outlook invest hire more. people refinance low rates, see value home 401k pension plan go up, spend more. i believe nudge right direction move u close self-reinforcing cycle hiring, spending, growth, investment. this type virtuous cycle seek one consistent self-sustaining improve economy. i believe late statement provide great clarity intend use tool promote statutory objectives. a chairman bernanke say press conference, idea make “more explicit, transparent public, make obvious feed what’s need provide support economy.” in particular, amount asset purchase undertake function economy evolves. if economy weaker, we’ll more. if economy stronger, see substantial improvement outlook labor market sooner, we’ll end less. from perspective, link purchase closely economic outcome underline determination generate kind recovery deliver rapid progress toward maximum employment context price stability. so “substantial improvement outlook labor market” mean me? note i focus outlook, current state labor market conditions. in context, wouldn’t enough see unemployment rate decline bit. it would also matter unemployment rate decline whether improvement likely sustain future. for example, high payroll growth support strong economic growth, fall unemployment rate due mainly decline participation labor market, would likely meet test. therefore, gauge substantial improvement outlook labor market is, i look range indicators, include unemployment rate, payrolls, participation rate, employment population ratio job find rates, well growth momentum within economy. a approach year-end, maturity extension program increase hold long-dated treasury come end. i’ll take stock respect employment inflation goal whether appropriate continue purchase longer-dated treasury program concludes. i think depend whether see substantial improvement labor market outlook bi central bankers’ speech 7 interim evidence cost benefit continue purchases. in term monetary policy regime, fomc statement note committee expect maintain highly accommodative stance monetary policy “for considerable time economic recovery strengthens.” this important situation one find today, monetary policy somewhat constrain cannot low federal fund rate zero, one powerful thing central bank provide guidance behave future. in respect, i please draw sharp distinction expect economy look like year time expect set policy base outlook. in particular, committee extend period anticipate keep federal fund rate exceptionally low level – i interpret mean current range zero 25 basis point – “at least mid-2015,” i don’t think due great pessimism economic outlook. in fact, look september summary economic projection committee member – medium-term growth outlook upgrade bite relative prior july projections. in judgment, combine statement projections, proper inference act secure good outcome – rapid progress toward full employment price stability. conclusion to sum up, many people remain without job need help support family themselves, economic expansion continuing, aren’t yet grow fast enough put back work many idle worker business facility represent productive potential economy. meanwhile analysis inflation outlook suggest price increase likely close 2 per cent long run objective come years. not factor hold back growth directly amenable monetary policy. our nation’s economic challenge cannot solve economic fortune restore federal reserve alone. others – notably next congress white house – step plate. but i confident feed promote maximum employment price stability great extent tool permit, stay course. we set policy achieve strong recovery context price stability. when finally materializes, i’ll view consistent result try achieve, reason pull back policy prematurely. if you’re try get car move stick mud, don’t stop push moment wheel start turn – keep push car roll clearly free. thank kind attention. i would happy take questions. bi central bankers’ speech 1 guy debelle: regulatory reform implication financial markets, fund cost monetary policy address mr guy debelle, assistant governor (financial markets) reserve bank australia, financial service institute australia, adelaide, 18 september 2012. * * * matt boge provide invaluable help preparation speech. it pleasure speak today home town. neil grummitt speak detail regulatory reform process currently underway australia globally. my aim consider broad implication reforms. before so, important point make. the change see bank financial system undergo purely result regulatory changes. rather number force push direction. some change see self-imposed, financial institution look lesson learn recent year seek increase resiliency future developments. some impose market term availability quantity price particular channel financing. others reflect pressure rat agencies. currently, force generally align change structure financial system direction, although may vary term degree. in sense, impact regulation may large appear surface. rather regulation is, many cases, serve reinforce force work. but regulatory change bind force long push direction. the experience many year force certain wane credit cycle full upswing. in good times, self-discipline falter weight competitive pressures, market discipline. hopefully circumstances, regulatory framework continue impart necessary restraint. today, i’m go focus basel iii reforms. other reforms, around central clear otc derivative also significant impact way many business, i leave another time. the basel iii measure strengthen requirement financial institutions’ liquidity capital. it impact reform financial market fund cost i would like address today. in think issue, important remember intent regulatory reform alter incentive financial institution thereby bring change behaviour. the price various financial product change pre-crisis levels. this “unintended consequence” (a phrase personally i think overused) desire outcome. so let give quick summary basel liquidity reforms. the 40 large deposit-taking intermediary australia require hold high-quality liquid asset quantity sufficient withstand 30-day period stress. this liquidity coverage ratio, lcr, much tough metric use past, term severity length stress period sufficient liquid asset need available, criterion qualify asset liquid. the test whether asset liquid high quality whether asset would able maintain value private market period severe stress. the financial crisis reveal universe asset lot small bank (and regulators) previously assumed. in particular, liquidity-generating capacity private sector debt deteriorate significantly period market stress, even debt highly rated. this case securitised asset – asset-backed commercial paper residential mortgage-backed security – well 2 bi central bankers’ speech unsecured paper. for many assets, source liquidity prove central bank. this true australian market well internationally. in recognition this, intent regulatory reform globally require financial institution hold liquidity debt security issue sovereign official sector bodies, subject requirement issuer highly rat security liquid. all else equal, would expect widen spread yield high-quality sovereign debt yield private debt securities. however, large extent, repricing occur globally financial crisis market reach conclusion constitute liquid asset. that is, self-evident less liquidity much private sector debt prompt financial market participant adjust liquidity risk premia require debt, quite independently direction regulators. within australian market, reassessment risk change investors’ tolerance assume risk important drive spread commonwealth government security (cgs) yield highly rat private debt securities. since financial crisis, considerable widen spread (graph 1). graph 1 it unlikely regulatory initiatives, certainly relate basel iii liquidity requirements, behind strong demand cgs see recent years. indeed, major source demand cgs come foreign investors, include central banks, sovereign wealth fund pension fund attract comparative strength australian economy sovereign’s credit standing. non-resident investor hold three-quarters outstanding cgs. in contrast, australian bank cgs (graph 2). bi central bankers’ speech 3 graph 2 within australian market, asset deem meet basel standard liquidity cgs, semi-government securities, cash exchange settlement balance reserve bank. a well known, conceivable scenario, supply cgs semi australia insufficient adis’ liquidity requirements. for reason, reserve bank announce establish commit liquidity facility (clf).1 on payment 15 basis point fee, adis able obtain commitment reserve bank provide liquidity broad range asset repurchase agreement. eligible asset include range highly rat private debt securities, include adi’s self-securitisations. the bank’s commitment adis provide liquidity asset recognise apra purpose compliance basel iii liquidity standards. central bank commit liquidity facility also use meet basel standard certain jurisdiction insufficient liquid assets. a i say before, arrangement is, large extent, formalisation pre-existing liquidity arrangement australia much consistent principle central bank describe bagehot. the imposition fee ensure intent basel standard met. by charge adis liquidity insurance central bank provides, appropriate incentive establish adis manage liquidity risk. at time, design clf contain impact regulatory-induced demand liquid assets, environment outside asset exist.2 a note already, cgs yield fall well beyond level could induce liquidity regulations. this evidence fact bank them. for banks, spread interbank rate many cgs currently trade imply 1 see rba (2011), “the rba commit liquidity facility”, medium release no 2011-25, 16 november, debelle g (2011), “the commit liquidity facility”, speech apra basel iii implementation workshop, sydney, 23 november. 2 outside asset issue bank system. 4 bi central bankers’ speech settlement balance reserve bank would high yield investment least free risk. similarly, large negative spread swap confirmatory evidence shortage cgs relative strong demand asset.3 recent trend within kangaroo bond market also illustrate broad market dynamic great influence relative price debt security prospective regulatory developments. when apra make initial assessment security would qualify liquid asset basel iii framework, concern express quarter consequence kangaroo market supranational foreign agency debt consider level 1 assets. see perspective today, apparent concern overstated. a aaa rat kangaroo debt eligible clf, payment fee, liquidity premium, distinguish security cgs semi regulatory purposes. the subsequent repricing much kangaroo debt far exceed size fee. in many cases, repricing rather due alter perception creditworthiness rat agency market participants. more generally, great store often place term whether asset eligible repo central bank not. reliance repo eligibility strike cornerstone resilient issuance program. but recent months, see number non repo-eligible kangaroo issue come market, include first-time issuers. this indicate important element determine investor demand consider level 1 asset repo eligibility. in addition issue security hold liquid assets, dimension liquidity regulation many asset need held. in regard, basel iii liquidity framework make certain assumption likely call liquidity bank would experience 30-day period stress. one assumption, base strongly experience past five years, liquidity commitment adis make financial institutions, include structure investment vehicle conduits, call upon full stress scenario. this significantly lessen incentive structure design exploit opportunity regulatory arbitrage, conduit issue asset-backed commercial paper. again, though, decline many structure hardly attribute solely regulatory change. their viability undermine investor rat agency also come view quality instrument largely tie quality support institution. this also see decline number mortgage warehouses, provider warehouse significantly increase price account much great liquidity risk. most non adi mortgage provider don’t really balance sheet warehouse mortgage on, see mark decline number market share past five years. in term support adi provide internal business units, change regulatory framework alter adis price liquidity capital usage across different component businesses. by nature, internal price rarely transparent outside observers, incentive create transfer price significant implication financial markets. this repricing across product line go currently still way run. we already see effect price undrawn line credit, example, increase price result increase liquidity cost see mark reduction prevalence. 3 heath a m man (2012), “financial regulation australian dollar liquid assets”, rba bulletin, september, pp 43–52. bi central bankers’ speech 5 another example, observe rba market operations, tendency government bond dealer fund position rate exceed unsecured borrow rate interbank cash market. to extent unnecessarily high internal fund rate trade desk foster outcome, new liquidity regulation may well encourage revision practices. call bank’s liquidity also arise unable roll maintain exist funding. assumption regard likelihood base regulators’ view form fund stable others. go forward, “run-off” assumption expect influence fund strategy adopt adis. to give one example: incentive adis issue short-term debt financial institution considerably reduce basel iii, fund borrow le 31 day maturity would need invest entirely liquid assets. thus mark decline provision debt banks. at time, demand liquid bank debt financial institutions, insurance company pension funds, increasing, part result regulatory development sectors. so decrease supply increase demand liquidity. normally, economics, situation would result change price (of liquidity case) clear market. my concern clear demand supply curve liquidity provide regulate financial system intersect reasonable price. how resolve entirely clear. if push supply liquidity outside regulate system, would good development. in case, quite probable new fund instrument emerge seek accommodate new regulations. in jurisdictions, great reliance debt 31-day notice period (given 30-day liquidity stress scenario) already observed. regulator financial institution need ensure create new stress point 31 day fund pile maturity. one product yet see effect new liquidity regulation price at-call deposits. relative type deposits, product expensive liquidity point view, still offer interest rate large spread cash rate. a bank focus liquidity cost products, i would expect see rate decline relative type deposits. indeed, would surprise repricing doesn’t occur fairly soon give liquidity regulation take full effect begin 2015. however, liaison bank suggest deposit particularly sensitive change pricing, big disadvantage term lose deposit competitor first reprice new regulations. but institution large reliance source funding, won’t able change reliance overnight 31st december 2014. just like supertankers, fund structure take long time change direction, change course need occur around now. on subject funding, one notable feature banks’ fund past three four year shift away short-term debt security toward deposits, particular, term deposit (graph 3). this shift deliberate strategy part bank bring significant change price structure. the interest rate offer term deposit retail wholesale customer price well rate bank issue equivalent maturity debt securities, certificate deposit (graph 4). 6 bi central bankers’ speech graph 3 graph 4 give forthcoming liquidity regulations, shift toward deposit certainly make sense. the basel iii framework view deposit much stable source funding, low run-off assumption type deposit wholesale debt securities. bi central bankers’ speech 7 however, relative price liquid assets, one can’t explain movement deposit price term prospective liquidity regulations. the intensity competition rate pay deposit far exceed imply regulatory incentive. why, then, bank will pay high rate type funding? to large extent, impetus come internal reassessment fund resiliency, rat agency broad market, bank’s ability attract deposit receive great attention since financial crisis. quite possibly, focus deposit-to-loan ratio similar metric misplaced. regardless, term deposit appear expensive source funding, current environment, bank presumably believe alternative would even expensive overall cost funds. nevertheless, effect change fund composition total change fund cost adis past five year fairly marginal. the increase cost fund bank and, ultimately, customers, drive considerably fundamental reassessment within financial market risk associate credit liquidity exposures. the regulatory effort towards promote stable source debt fund great capital buff financial institution drive desire foster financial system stability. a note before, apparent intense competition deposits, change direction also pursue bank initiative, presumably belief low overall cost fund market. to extent regulation push adis adopt fund structure market discipline would make otherwise adopt, difference likely small effect overall fund cost would small still. moreover, apra reserve bank argued, cost magnitude well worth pay stable financial system.4 a regard broad macroeconomic impact increase adis’ fund costs, important remember set monetary policy, reserve bank board conscious various rate credit priced. consequently, overall rise fund cost structure intermediaries, board able set cash rate target appropriately take account effect lend rates. in current environment, ample scope low cash rate sufficiently bring rate need achieve desire stance monetary policy, mortgage rate business lend rates. in regard, important stress transmission monetary policy still effective australia. not lend rate respond change board’s cash rate target, sense aggregate supply credit appear constrain ongoing change adis’ fund patterns. finally, suggest regulation may large impact supply credit current environment, bank may difficulty fund increase demand credit. however, i think concern misplaced. in environment demand credit pick world good place, fund condition intermediary also likely much easier. moreover, macro perspective, unlikely fund problem system whole world happy place, even individual institution 100 per cent sure next fund dollar come from. 4 see, example, laker j (2012), “bank regulation future banking”, remark 41st australian conference economists, melbourne, 11 july. 8 bi central bankers’ speech so, conclude. there number significant change structure financial market past five years, term price well composition fund lending. regulatory reform certainly play role changes, one main point i hope leave today regulatory reform often serve reinforce change result self-reassessment result market pressures. while force work direction current environment, regulatory reform aim ensure change stable financial structure endure environment le conducive self-discipline market pressure abate. bi central bankers’ speech 1 andreas dombret: the role state financial system dinner speech dr andreas dombret, member executive board deutsche bundesbank, ifo/ cesifo/ bundesbank conference, munich, 14 september 2012. * * * of scientist driver lady gentlemen, please let welcome tonight’s conference dinner. have discuss complex issue day, really deserve opportunity socialise one another. but so, start enjoy dinner, please let tell short anecdote:

suggested: “by now, i hear talk often i give myself. why don’t change places? i’ll pretend physicist give talk pretend driver.” next time, driver give talk – performance quite convince – planck sit audience. all go well someone audience pose question. naturally, driver unable answer it. but instead admit this, replied: “your question seem ridiculously easy me. i believe, even driver answer question.” and “chauffeur” so. please, misunderstand me: consider first-class participant list conference high quality paper selected, i convince academic conference speak authority people absolutely know trade. i doubt whatsoever score. however, i admit follow discussion medium european debt crisis sometimes hard separate “drivers” real academics. i get impression everyone opinion topic – everyone state opinion least once. take, instance, discussion bank union europe. this topic stir – quite understandably, i may add – quite unrest german economic community. petition launched, provocative counter-petitions issued, case endorse exact academics. this seem striking, give sign well-respected academics. however, petition perhaps incompatible might appear. obviously, one come different conclusion reason base different assumptions. and different assumption stem various interpretation result european summit june. the core statement petition bank union disputed. for me, core statement are: “there unconditional collective accountability debt euro area” “banking supervision europe need harmonise improved.” and although everybody may agree style detail different petitions, people probably concur two main messages. i, part, concur statements. 2 bi central bankers’ speech both message relate question central economics – also topic conference: what role assign state? and role market play? the role state ten even five year ago, opinion academic world relatively unanimous respect role state bank sector: the state regulator see obstacle economic growth, state-owned bank perceive flotsam jetsam free market economies. “let market deal issue financial sector, capital risk efficiently allocated,” academic argued. a say attribute well-respected former bavarian prime minister franz-josef strauss come mind: “a dog likely put away sausage rainy day state save money.” then come financial crisis. the distrust state among mainstream academic remained. however, distrust market well, perhaps surpass distrust state. in academic community media, debate excessive bonus bankers, distort incentive risk-taking bank and, last least, role rat agencies. to mind, crisis show that, like not, state need ultimate guarantor systemically important function bank sector. in systemic crisis, deposit insurance scheme succeed state, thus taxpayer, credibly guarantee liabilities, illustrated, example, tv appearance chancellor merkel finance minister steinbrück 2008, guarantee bank deposit germany. at time fear self-fulfilling run private deposit – clearly case market failure – discuss length economic literature. so good reason government step in. the government also power impose restriction banks’ actions, necessary. and unity liability control represent important condition limit moral hazard implication guarantee. another example international discussion large banks. due systemic importance interconnectedness, state afford let descend disorderly default. therefore, resolution regime currently discuss international fora, that, principle, also large bank exit market without cause systemic disruptions. in respect, i.e. establish clear framework limit financial stability risks, i believe state role. this exactly regulation come in: an appropriate, internationally harmonise regulation well resolution scheme endeavour ensure “too-big-to-fail” bank abuse status. there parallel consideration challenge debt crisis. nowadays, view as: “markets help discipline fiscal policies, urgently need resolve crisis” seem popular. however, popular not, matter whether statement true. it may well true time. however, seem truth view many so-called “solutions” imply ever-increasing unconditional financial “assistance”. many proposal ignore moral hazard implication might therefore simply postpone solutions. they might even increase problem mean tackle long run. financial assistance necessary buy time – nothing nothing less. it cannot long-term solution. such long-term solution achieve fiscal consolidation structural reforms. a banks, cannot ignore deny systemic importance certain country within euro area. and manner, vital ensure politician cannot use status delay necessary step simply step unpopular. bi central bankers’ speech 3 to reach appropriate assessment, also essential know whether currently still situation market successfully exercise disciplinary power – whether already move full-blown systemic crisis threat self-fulfilling downward spiral call massive intervention. but even case – let make clear – would democratically elect governments, central banks, take necessary action. central bank give advice – government authority, confer democratic legitimacy, make change regulatory systems. i sure programme conference far provide enough material interest discussion tonight rest undoubtedly fruitful, productive successful conference tomorrow. bi central bankers’ speech 1 mario draghi: interview süddeutsche zeitung interview mr mario draghi, president european central bank, süddeutsche zeitung, conduct mr alexander hagelüken mr markus zydra 11 september 2012, publish 14 september 2012. * * * sz: after decision buy bond trouble euro area country without limitations, fellow italian congratulate open wallet taxpayer germany countries? draghi: no! actually, reaction diverse. in part germany, echo negative; part southern europe, entirely positive either, strict effective conditionality. the rest world compliment us. sz: the secretary general conservative csu call “forger coins”. draghi: i trust change opinion, see results. there already positive results. the announcement facility contribute raise confidence euro area, euro across world. fund manager bring money back europe. this good euro area economy. sz: be really optimistic euro area debt crisis resolved? draghi: we certainly good path. we see extraordinary progress reform spain italy, particularly consider do last six month comparison many years. the direction policy many country flaw need corrected. this process currently way. but much still need done. and also adherence strict effective conditionality prerequisite govern council consider outright monetary transactions. sz: many german fear risk central bank spend money unprecedented scale. draghi: what situation? the risk self-fulfilling prophecy increasing: rise sovereign bond yield see aggravate situation, drive yield even higher. there risk vicious circle warrant central bank action good economic policy alone may necessarily enough country free call “bad equilibrium”. sz: to lot people, "unlimited bond buying" sound like unlimited risk pay sooner later. draghi: the obligation country meet best insurance risk. the risk well managed. and, assessment, nothing pose even great risks. sz: if country default bonds, ecb thus tax payer lose lot money. draghi: this conditionality important. moreover, outright monetary transaction focus short term, particular bond maturity one three years. sz: but 42% german population distrust ecb’s president. draghi: that hindrance work. i explain actions. we start interview. but always weigh options. sz: which are? 2 bi central bankers’ speech draghi: of course, could say “nein zu allem”, constructive. for example, decide conduct longer-term refinance operation (ltros), would see severe credit crunch across large part euro area. under conditions, i say time again, would able deliver everybody expect u deliver: price stability medium term. so, help avoid conditions. sz: how serious threat? it hard believe would stop buy bond let spain italy plunge disaster. draghi: if give country comply conditionality, ecb cannot improve monetary policy transmission country. any attempt situation would ineffective would offset country’s policy failure. sz: why didn’t make mandatory esm/efsf first buy bond primary market ecb step in? draghi: the key u strict conditionality effective monitoring. the possibility primary market purchase efsf/esm sufficient ensure that. sz: can euro area save rule german constitutional court esm? draghi: the esm important measure crisis management toolbox. however, cop crisis depend stabilisation mechanism place; particular, need determine action level individual member states. and, collectively, member state complete economic monetary union. we ecb conduct monetary policy independently safeguard price stability. sz: you keep say euro irreversible. mr draghi, speak like chancellor europe. draghi: i communicate message president ecb stakeholders, citizens, business markets. investor need long-term vision undertake long-term commitments. for them, important leader government determine keep euro irreversible. so, i say this, i say political leader fundamentally saying. sz: so cover failure politics? draghi: again, i say important so. market know euro irreversible. that help properly price euro area asset help u conduct monetary policy. sz: have ever want become politician? draghi (laughs): no. sz: why not? draghi: because thing like do. sz: before us, visit greek prime minister, antonis samaras. greece meet deficit limit 3% gdp even once. how country stay euro area? draghi: by changing. the country fundamentally change policies. and everybody tell do. sz: but greece seek help, help already received. it say samara want cut billion euro due greek bond ecb holds. draghi: we haven’t discuss this, – anyway – i’m it. sz: your new bond purchase programme remind u italy 1970s, central bank help state financing, increase problems. bi central bankers’ speech 3 draghi: that something completely different. it take place decade ago, italian central bank wasn’t independent state. in italy thing change completely since then. banca d’italia independent decades, finance government deficit. we move away clichés past want address future! sz: the bundesbank different view: jens weidmann fear ecb’s monetary policy finance fiscal deficits. draghi: no, govern council disagree view. what decide monetary policy measure. there fundamental difference buy primary market, forbid money would go government, buy secondary market money go government bond holders. article 18 statute state ecb may “buy sell […] marketable instruments” part mandate, necessary achieve price stability, course always respect treaty’s article 123 prohibition monetary financing. sz: where german opposition come from? draghi: it come history country fear inflation. but clear case efsf/esm support, parliament euro area country involved. sz: but parliament decide amount ecb go risk … draghi: no, monetary policy remain independent, prerequisite govern council consider specific monetary policy measures. sz: many german euro, doubt economic policy country like greece italy. now feel right. draghi: the euro deliver price stability entire continent. it remove exchange rate risk, foster economic cohesion, employment growth. germany benefit greatly accomplishments, well price stability great year euro. sz: the ecb get even power supervise european bank industry. so, ecb always bail ail bank print money? draghi: no, organise keep bank supervision monetary policy strictly separate. this do many central banks. we mix anything; fundamentally, chinese wall. sz: chinese wall regular bank collapsed. draghi: not central banks. sz: how ecb good job german bafin? draghi: it good job; make sure uniform supervisory practice apply across whole single currency area. the detach national government, objective decision-making. we don’t want control every small bank directly; work together national supervisors. sz: accord plans, ecb report supervision business european parliament year. be enough? draghi: we surely need substantial democratic accountability here, legislator establish consider necessary. sz: do personally know people suffer euro crisis? draghi: i visit many smes whose credit cut crisis go business. and i talk italian businesses. 4 bi central bankers’ speech sz: how uncomfortable feel country bundesbank? draghi: i often say bundesbank great institution, i respect much. it would great could always work together. we do many times, moment, different opinion best way react crisis. we share objective deliver price stability, full agreement best way achieve that. sz: and german people? draghi: we need explain good germany, intention precaution taking. sz: you could speak bundestag. draghi: it would opportunity explain great detail. if i invited, i would happy go there. bi central bankers’ speech 1 karolina ekholm: how financial crisis avoid sweden? speech m karolina ekholm, deputy governor sverige riksbank, meet handelsbanken, stockholm, 27 september 2012. * * * the view express speech necessarily share member executive board riksbank. i would like thank jill billborn, johanna fager wettergren per åsberg-sommar great assistance write speech. four year financial crisis break out, still live consequences: sovereign debt crisis euro area, sluggish recovery unite state unite kingdom, unemployment entrench high level world beyond europe unite state find hard adjust fact important export market faltering. the realisation cost financial crisis dreadfully high lead general understand economic policy must focus much prevent crises. here sweden, cop relatively well recent turbulent years. but, even here, unemployment remain high level – part high swedish growth rate merely recovery great fall gdp 2008 2009. it well-known i advocate low repo rate push unemployment fast push inflation rate currently target two per cent. a broad opinion low interest rate form risk financial stability, may seem though i take risk financial crisis break sweden lightly. but i not. i share opinion economic policy need focus counteract financial crises. but i think primarily task monetary policy. on contrary, task macroprudential policy, topical policy area i talk today. i previously speak macroprudential supervision could organise sweden, responsibility tool question could allocated.1 the question allocation responsibility mandate also investigate financial crisis commission. in opinion, important clear target mandate macroprudential policy way monetary policy. if case, policy area take granted. macroprudential policy aim counteract risk financial system whole, policy area many country try set framework.2 exactly framework look still somewhat unclear, general principle crystallise regard appropriate institutional structure instrument may appropriate use.3 finansinspektionen already instrument disposal focus health behaviour individual participant companies. but one important lesson crisis enough. our toolkit need complement tool focus system whole. today, i discus swedish toolbox macroprudential supervision could include. 1 the speech “macroprudential policy clear communication contribute financial stability” hold swedish bankers’ association 30 march 2012. see www.riksbank.se. 2 for detail analysis macroprudential policy ability counteract systemic risk, see, example, borio (2010), galati moessner (2011) viñals (2010 2011). 3 see, example lim, c., et al., (2011),”macroprudential policy: what instrument how use them? lesson country experiences”, imf work paper, 11/238. 2 bi central bankers’ speech different type risk… before i go different type tool could use manage systemic risks, i explain mean systemic risk. the riksbank usually define systemic risk risk shock occur financial system, lead substantial cost society.4 such risk arise various reasons. the crisis period crisis clearly illustrate tendency towards exaggerate cyclical behaviour often characterise financial markets. in period strong growth, usually increase demand loan corporate investment property purchases. it also seem common awareness risk decrease upturn. lender often relax requirement creditworthiness time often take much debt themselves. when problem subsequently arise result borrower find difficult repay loans, overreaction direction, severe credit tighten consequence. but systemic risk matter tendency towards exaggerate cyclical behaviour credit granting. it also matter concentration risk link different part financial system give time affect risk crisis hit system whole. for example, several bank take kind risk dependent fund sources. the high degree interconnectedness financial system – different institution different markets– increase risk contagion financial problem arise.5 circumstance need constitute risk micro level thus become risk macro level. not know risk trigger systemic crisis nature things. of course, financial system constantly change – new instrument market arise technology develops. and, financial system changes, risk outlook change too. what first seem uncomplicated “risk-free” need reality. this suggest broad set macroprudential supervision instrument need tackle systemic risks. … suggest broad toolkit macroprudential supervision so bear mind select design tool macroprudential supervision? firstly, need able counteract different type systemic risk and, this, clearly need different type tool. the principle use deal problem involve tendency towards exaggerate cyclical behaviour variously make expensive le attractive allow risk build time good, time buff create use time bad. problem cause financial system’s structure instead approach manage individual institutions’ contribution total systemic risk, example way specific requirement capital buffers, strengthen requirement transparency, limitation certain type activity. secondly, probably need tool wide area effect aim particular sub-market activity. countercyclical capital buff example tool relatively wide area effect. these base total expansion credit cover banks. i return instrument shortly. however, broadly-acting tool 4 the riksbank define financial stability mean financial system maintain basic function also resilience disruption threaten functions. the riksbank financial stability (2010). see also nordh-berntsson molin (2012), “a swedish framework macroprudential policy”, sverige riksbank economic review 2012:1. 5 rajan (2005) argue element distort incentive manager financial asset take serious risk increase result structural change financial sector, banks’ significance decrease role players, security funds, insurance companies, pension fund etc., increased. bi central bankers’ speech 3 disadvantage risk unforeseen effect sector problems. if problem clearly concentrate specific sector, tool narrow area effect thus preferred. if, example, problem rapid build-up house loan combination rapidly rise house prices, may good focus specifically house market. a narrowly-acting tool case could increase risk weight specifically house loans. however, certain always narrowly-acting tool sufficiently effective. thirdly, may need tool focus different type participant. this primarily matter use tool aim financial companies, within company problem may ultimately lead financial crisis arise. but may also reason use tool aim household non-financial companies. such tool form important complements, example dampen demand credit. naturally, already policy area directly indirectly influence financial stability. a regard house market, sector create great deal unease sweden due high indebtedness high prices, influence factor regulation tax deduction interest payments, change property tax, rent control regulation affect incentive house construction. but decision measure area primarily take basis goal safeguard stability financial system. in micro supervision, kind supervision carry finansinspektionen sweden, series different tool also use influence financial stability. however, present, finansinspektionen’s remit focus dampen risk among individual institutions, system whole. what need, quite simply, specific tool macroprudential supervision use direct aim promote stability system. this make possible counteract systemic risk create policy area system whole remain stable. the house market good example this. politically, may difficult, impossible, carry change taxation system make mortgage borrow significantly expensive, even would effective way reduce risk associate high indebtedness among households. this mean need tool counteract kind indebtedness use aim promote stability financial system. there great need tool sweden the swedish bank system large closely interwoven, mean problem one bank easily spread banks. the cost society thus extensive event crisis. increase safety margin financial system therefore highly important. it enough one bank impact problem confidence bank deal blow. the important role confidence financial market become clear autumn 2008, lack confidence lead many bank rapidly encounter liquidity problem force rely riksbank’s measure funding. in regard, swedish bank also particularly sensitive shock financial market largely obtain fund foreign currency. fund foreign currency often short duration fund swedish currency see disappear abruptly time stress. important step already taken… a series important step already take make financial system robust. a large part work take place within framework basel iii regulations. high demand high quality capital contribute towards strengthen confidence individual bank thereby also system whole. in addition, capital lead confidence bank financial market increase, make easy bank obtain access market funding. 4 bi central bankers’ speech the new regulation also bring “pure” macroprudential policy instrument form countercyclical buff special capital supplement global systemically-important financial institution (sifis). i return shortly, allow first say word new capital adequacy rules. at moment, council european union european parliament negotiate procedure incorporation new capital adequacy rule eu law. these discussion broadly focus whether individual member state able place high capital requirement minimum. i consider allow this. in sweden, need set capital requirement basis prevail circumstance swedish bank market. in opinion, must guide principle long swedish taxpayers’ money would ultimately stake event sweden impact financial crisis. the ministry finance, finansinspektionen riksbank signal capital adequacy major swedish bank need increase considerably. accord plan, capital adequacy increase least 10 per cent 2013 least 12 per cent 1 january 2015.6 the swedish bank every chance meet requirement due high earn capacity low loan losses. the four major bank systemically important national level and, additionally, nordea systemically important global level.7 the supplement systemic importance include capital level i cited. this thus measure link risk structural character. for reasons, may need sweden introduce tough requirement swedish banks’ liquidity reserve advocate basel iii regulations. the bank need become good manage liquidity problem activity give rise, particularly regard liquidity foreign currency. if bank match maturity asset liability good maintain sufficient liquidity reserve foreign currency, le sensitive shock financial markets. the basel iii accord intend two quantitative liquidity requirement introduced, one short-term one long-term. the short-term measure liquidity coverage ratio (lcr) intend ensure bank enough liquidity cope 30 day stress market conditions. the long-term measure net stable fund ratio (nsfr) aim reduce maturity difference asset liabilities. the basel committee’s plan lcr introduce 2015 but, swedish bank largely use short-term market fund foreign currency, riksbank finansinspektionen consider sweden go advance introduce lcr january 2013.8 in addition this, swedish bank also need lcr 100 per cent foreign currency euro u dollar. so, even here, consider high requirement place swedish bank basel iii regulation do. countercyclical capital requirements, macroprudential policy instrument focus one macroprudential policy instrument discuss europe present countercyclical capital requirements. these include part new basel regulations. consequently, instrument know able use sweden number years. the principle simple: financial risk increase, bank successively force increase countercyclical buffers; risk recede, permit decrease them. however, practice, instrument entirely simple design. the level countercyclical capital buff determine 6 this refer core tier 1 capital relation risk-weighted assets. 7 fsb (2011), “policy measure address systemically important financial institutions”, 4 november 2011. 8 see, example, financial stability report 2012:1, sverige riksbank. bi central bankers’ speech 5 relevant authority basis quantitative qualitative assessments. among data, quantitative assessment take account so-called credit gap, far credit growth deviate estimate trend. but fairly rough measure degree risk system, measure assessment may also fairly important. the aim countercyclical capital buff primarily strengthen bank resilience financial system. one effect introduce buff moderate fluctuation credit cycle. in upturn, substantial credit expansion activate buffers, mean bank gradually hold capital. this restrict lend thus reduce risk exaggerate credit growth rise asset prices. in situation lend tightened, banks’ capital free buff requirement reduced. the bank therefore need reduce lend extent, would otherwise reinforce downturn. here, may worth emphasise credit cycle typically coincide business cycle (the fluctuation we, riksbank, attempt dampen use monetary policy), long course. but again, primary purpose countercyclical capital buff increase resilience financial system ensure bank enough capital period risk accumulating. negotiation underway eu level regard implementation basel iii, thus also countercyclical buffer. who responsible instrument – exist authority, several authority together newly- form authority – open question sweden many countries. the swedish government appoint commission investigate implementation countercyclical capital buff sweden.9 …but basel regulation capture risk sweden the basel iii accord also place requirement banks’ leverage ratio, minimum amount capital bank must retain regardless risk class assets.10 the fact requirement leverage ratio set ceiling indebtedness bank system attractive. it guarantee kind minimum level resilience. at time, bank long rely upon risk weight correctly reflect actual risk lending. my assessment leverage ratio countercyclical buff good instrument management systemic risk help u strengthen financial system need arises. but limitations. both instrument indiscriminate difficult determine appropriate increase decrease countercyclical capital buffers. if able combat risk efficiently, also need instrument direct towards area problem exist. variable risk weight – usable instrument one instrument grow group country choose introduce variable risk weight lending.11 these see complement countercyclical capital buff aim counteract build-up risk lend specific sectors. vary risk weight thus focus instrument countercyclical capital buffers. 9 this work conduct within framework government’s inquiry fi 2012:05 “inquiry capital adequacy regulations”, conclude spring 2013. 10 this capital conservation buff hold form core tier 1 capital consist 2.5 per cent risk-weighted assets. 11 in unite kingdom, financial policy committee give mandate introduce risk weighting, so-called sectoral capital requirements, see financial policy committee statement, march 2012. see also bank england instrument macroprudential policy, discussion paper, december 2011. 6 bi central bankers’ speech the banks’ capital ratio determine capital asset risk weight use calculate risk-weighted assets. if risk weight lend sector consider high risk increased, bank must allocate capital per loan. this could dampen lend high risk sectors. our domestic bank crisis start 1990s provide one example systemic risk build become concentrate upon single sector – case, commercial properties. an increase risk weight loan commercial property might able alleviate crisis go then. in sweden, recent discussion have, all, deal risk weight mortgage loans, among low europe due historically- low loan losses. but reason question low risk weightings, account recent years’ increase household indebtedness. consequently, finansinspektionen also start work review risk weight aim increase them. i consider variable risk weight macroprudential policy instrument would advantageous include toolbox sweden. it could strengthen banks’ resilience systemic risk broad sense, reduce risk associate lend specific sector. such tool would reduce pressure monetary policy instrument manage risk swedish house market, something i personally would much welcome. this would allow influence exert expansion credit household sector house prices, without simultaneously impede credit grant sector possibly influence krona exchange rate direction would impede exports. a ceiling household borrow another way counteract systemic risk use loan ceiling macroprudential policy instrument. these certainly focus category borrower society, but, country far applied, direct household indebtedness.12 these instrument usually formulate limit amount loan relation household’s income value household’s asset form collateral loan. there internationally harmonise definition instruments, allow define differently regard loan amount, income value underlie collateral. in sweden, finansinspektionen issue recommendation almost two year ago regard limit much borrower may borrow, so-called mortgage ceiling. accord this, household loan exceed 85 per cent property’s market value loan granted. lend threshold still possible, grant without residential collateral therefore high interest rates. even finansinspektionen’s justification mortgage ceiling protect consumers, measure also use macroprudential supervision. from stability perspective, credit risk banks’ credit portfolio could reduce rule contribute towards reduce economic vulnerability households. the loan ceiling may also contribute towards stable price formation house market, rule influence much money household will put purchase housing. if counteract excessive price variation house market unsustainable accumulation debt among households, also likewise contribute towards reduce risk loan loss bank system. 12 see, example lim, c., et al., (2011), “macroprudential policy: what instrument how use them? lesson country experiences”, imf work paper, 11/238. bi central bankers’ speech 7 a loan ceiling base income would largely characteristic one base value housing, may certain advantages. if debt link price movement house markets, avoid problem price increase indebtedness reciprocally push upwards rise spiral. effectively combat future financial crisis require flexibility an efficient financial system prerequisite modern economy. a shock lead breakdown financial system’s function major economic cost form sharp fall gdp high unemployment. central government finance weaken much country enter debt crisis. from point view, may consider justifiable make every effort increase resilience financial system. at time, important always compare cost various type measure benefit, design efficient system possible. i present long list possible instrument could use conduct macroprudential supervision. by necessity, list include tools, different tool need counteract different systemic risks. but discuss something relatively new. at present, limit experience conduct macroprudential supervision practice. this mean process introduce macroprudential supervision entail certain degree trial error. quite simply, test way forward, constantly best ass efficiency instrument employed.13 the financial system complex dynamic, risk outlook change time. this mean never determine certainty financial crisis may arise. bear mind, important we, sweden, construct framework macroprudential supervision flexible limit possibility term instrument used. it also important establish process evaluate late develop modify toolbox. i consider clear but, time, flexible framework macroprudential supervision create best condition counteract future financial crises. but say would enough ensure financial crisis ever occur again. the crisis tomorrow probably completely different cause crisis yesterday, make difficult protect against. however, scale cost financial crisis justify make every effort protect ourselves. a regard question responsibility macroprudential policy ought lie, clear area closely link riksbank’s finansinspektionen’s activities. the riksbank analyse stability financial system fifteen year also currently provide recommendation safeguard financial stability reports. finansinspektionen also work stability financial system focus individual institutions. the competence experience authority utilise macroprudential policy effective sweden. while await long-term solution swedish macroprudential supervision, riksbank finansinspektionen set temporary council cooperation. in addition consult exchange information assessment risk possible countermeasures, one task council discus development instrument method within macroprudential supervision. the joint communication assessment connection council cooperation benefit itself. however, long term, 13 in absence empirical experience conduct macroprudential supervision, theoretical analysis provide guidance consequence expected. however, academic research area still infancy therefore difficult draw unequivocal conclusion present. goodhart et al. (2012) one example study investigate interplay number macroprudential policy instruments, say whether complement substitute other. 8 bi central bankers’ speech something qualify discussion forum needed. to become really effective, macroprudential policy need acquire distinct status independent policy area tool promote stability financial system whole clear allocation responsibility. assess demand responsibility demand clear allocation responsibility. another benefit establish clear effective framework macroprudential policy allow monetary policy relieve take account financial stability. in opinion, consideration create risk monetary policy become unclear unpredictable. a function macroprudential policy thus let u reduce risk financial crisis give u monetary policy efficiently stabilise inflation around inflation target resource utilisation around sustainable level. thank you! reference borio, c., 2010, “implementing macroprudential framework: blend boldness realism”, bank international settlements. bank england, financial policy committee statement, march 2012. bank england, instrument macroprudential policy, discussion paper, december 2011. ekholm k, 2012, “macroprudential policy clear communication contribute financial stability”, www.riksbank.se. galati, g., moessner, r, 2011, “macroprudential policy – a literature review”, bi work paper no. 337. goodhart, c., kashyap, a., tsomocos, d. vardoulakis, a., 2012, “financial regulation general equilibrium”, work paper 17909, nber. fsb, 2011, “policy measure address systemically important financial institutions”, 4 november 2011. lim, c., columba, f., costa, a., kongsamut, p., otani, a., saiyid, m., wezel, t., wu, x., 2011, “macroprudential policy: what instrument how use them? lesson country experiences, imf work paper, 11/238. nordh-berntsson, c., molin, j.

oftentimes acrimonious, debate. this debate, like several others development economics, one frown moderation. at one extreme “trickle down” theory hold benefit growth would automatically trickle bottom; trickle process must leave natural pace path, force counterproductive. at extreme activist view rubbish trickle hold redistributive policy must part development paradigm, even mean compromise

note, i wish productive successful engagement. bi central bankers’ speech 1 timothy lane: finance commodity market remark mr timothy lane, deputy governor bank canada, cfa society calgary, calgary, alberta, 25 september 2012. * * * introduction good afternoon. i want thank cfa society calgary invite speak today. i would like take opportunity share think role financial system natural resource economy. in particular, i would like focus change relationship financial system commodity markets. natural resource central importance canada’s economy financial system, nowhere apparent calgary. the development natural resource power much calgary’s – canada’s – recent economic growth. natural resource industry – include farming, forestry, mining, oil gas extraction relate industry – key element canadian economy, account roughly one fifth gross domestic product.1 that share roughly twice share natural resource industry unite state economy high advance economies.2 resource even important feature canada’s international trade, account roughly half exports. we strong stake, therefore, ensure resource develop wisely sustainably benefit canadians. do require several elements: appropriate policy environment, flexible labour market reliable transportation network. it also require sound efficient financial system meet need resource economy. the financial system connect resource development two main ways. first, channel finance need develop resources. canada’s equity market particular heavily weight toward resources: tsx venture exchange one world’s primary list destination resource firms, even toronto stock exchange sometimes refer “the world’s mine exchange.” bank lend finance flow also play important part. many directly involve aspect financing. second, financial system link commodity markets. here, i mean intricate web global market commodity buy sold, price determined, producer end-users commodity hedge unexpected movement prices. these market important determine return canadian producer earn output, well risk face. in remark today, i would like address second aspect: commodity market nexus financial system. my focus key trend relate financial innovation, deleveraging regulation. 1 natural resource industry include following: agriculture, hunting, forestry fishing; mine oil gas extraction; wood products; paper manufacturing; print relate support activities; petroleum coal products; chemicals, exclude pharmaceuticals; non-metallic mineral products; primary fabricate metals; utilities. 2 j. murray, “commodity prices: the long short it,” speech johnson/shoyama graduate school public policy, regina, saskatchewan, 10 february 2011. 2 bi central bankers’ speech complex global commodity market the commodity market complex several ways. there spot market forward transactions, well derivative contract options. there organize exchange over-the-counter markets. there physical financial aspects. trade take place many different geographical location many different commodity grade commodity traded. there also many player markets: producers; end-users; major commodity trade houses; commodity trade operation large global investment banks; exchange-traded fund (etfs); various institutional individual investor and, cases, government agencies. so make market global? arbitrage glue bind together market separate distance time, well market different relate products. arbitrageur take advantage price differences, buy low sell high, thus drive price together. they also take advantage difference physical financial commodity markets, tie together price across markets. various market-makers hold inventory stand ready buy sell commodities, connect supplier end-users. these arbitrage market-making activity often undertake firm difficult disentangle. of course, limit extent price converge global commodity markets. the recent behaviour oil price particularly tell example limits. western canadian crude oil sell deep vary discount compare world price. this discount due limitation transport network well difference grade. a result, western canadian producer heavy oil recently oblige sell output much $54 per barrel world price oil – eastern canadian consumer continue pay world price.3 this illustrate point price different part global commodity market diverge, canadian may reap full benefit natural resources. commodity price i’ve stress arbitrage market-making critical tie global commodity market together. these activity provide significant liquidity commodity market and, work properly, also help bring commodity price line fundamental supply demand – i mean, current supply demand, expectation supply demand evolve future. there strong evidence broad movement commodity price long term indeed reflect fundamental global level. begin 1990s, robust resource-intensive growth emerge market economy (emes) propel commodity market supercycle. the number people live city china india rise roughly 500 million since 1990. in parallel, global middle class grow 70 million people year. these trend widely expect continue, profound ramification broad range commodities.4 of course, significant variation around upward trend commodity prices. on average, commodity price decline past year, growth emerging-market economy moderating. nonetheless, commodity price whole still 25 per cent historical average real terms. in particular, real price energy metal well long-term average 3 world oil price refer price brent crude. 4 m. carney, “dutch disease,” speech spruce meadow round table, calgary, alberta, 7 september 2012. bi central bankers’ speech 3 seven year now, real food price high level 35 year (chart 1). finance commodity trade i stress role commodity market – particular market-making arbitrage – tie together global market bring price line fundamentals. these activity inevitably require finance – form finance change considerably past couple decades. i would like talk finance change discus implication commodity market financial system. there two countervail trends: strengthen link financial system commodity market decade 2008 global financial crisis, element retrenchment restructure since then. let describe trend turn. a central element finance commodity lead 2008 crisis increase participation major global investment banks. because access wholesale fund markets, provide cheap fund available participant commodity markets, large bank become increasingly important range commodity-related activities. they provide large share lend commodity dealers. they also come play central role dealer over-the-counter derivative market commodities. more recently, become involve physical trade commodities: hold physical inventories, make market commodity even create supply chain provide ship commodity storage. in parallel, globally active commodity trade house assume large expand role. these institution hold inventory commodities, store time, move around world, make market physical commodity derivatives. a trade house grew, play increasingly important role facilitate trade commodities. they financial institutions, require large amount financing. traditionally, finance mostly form syndicate bank lend secure commodity inventories, recently finance model shifting, i discuss. alongside increase role large institution trend toward “financialization” commodities. investor – individual institution pension fund hedge fund – step interest commodity (chart 2). a combination factor may contribute trend. to extent, investor may seek high return associate commodity-price supercycle. they may also seek diversify portfolio include commodity distinct asset class. whatever reason, movement investor commodity facilitate financial innovation – notably, emergence index fund and, later, variety exchange-traded fund (chart 3). more recently, high-frequency trade also become feature commodity markets, financial markets. these development together help turn commodity increasingly liquid financial assets, accessible wide range investors. in turn, flood investment fund commodity help spur innovation. there clear evidence trend toward great financialization significant determinant overall level commodity prices. a i already discussed, preponderance evidence indicate instead commodity price drive fundamental – primarily rise demand emes. research – include work 4 bi central bankers’ speech bank canada – look possible link price volume financial activity commodity market show difficult identify relationship.5 it possible that, circumstances, financial force may amplify price movement primarily drive force may thus contribute volatility – example, exaggerate spike oil prices. in contrast, argue financialization improve efficiency commodity markets. but simple pattern emerge evidence. there still range view whether financial force have, whole, contribute dampen volatility commodity prices.6 it appear, however, financialization associate close tie commodity market financial markets. one indication relationship great correlation short-run movement commodity price price risky assets, include stock price index currency (chart 4). in part, doubt reflect common macroeconomic factor drive price number risky asset – particularly, change market assessment prospect global growth. but also plausible movement partly reflect investors’ change perception risk and, cases, change availability liquid finance investment positions. (ironically, increase correlation commodity price price asset equity diminish benefit diversification investor seek invest commodity first place.) development wake crisis i describe strong link financial system commodity market decade two prior global financial crisis come head 2008. but wake crisis, global financial system undergo sea change. this turn introduce important change finance commodity trading. deleveraging significant trend global financial system since crisis – one likely continue time come.7 particularly pronounce unite state europe, deleveraging process drive partly need financial institution restore balance sheet loss incur crisis ensue worldwide recession. it also reflect tighten financial regulation make system resilient, view prevent new crisis. under term basel iii, minimum amount capital bank must hold increase five times. the largest, complex firm must hold even more.8 finally, deleveraging also reflect shrink shadow bank system – complex web securitized products, non-bank financial institutions, fund market market create large amount leverage country year precede crisis. on whole, deleveraging welcome correction – financial institution regulatory authority – excessive leverage build global financial system crisis. a process completed, result resilient global financial system. but also protract painful, pervasive effect 5 r. alquist o. gervais, “the role financial speculation drive price crude oil,” discussion paper no. 2011-6, bank canada, 2011. see also: report g-20 study group commodities, chairmanship hiroshi nakaso, trade finance expert group (november 2011). 6 a 2009 report iosco also call great transparency commodity markets, part view reduce risk market manipulation. see “task force report commodity future markets: report g-20,” technical committee international organization security commissions, march 2009. 7 m. carney, “growth age deleveraging,” speech empire club canada/canadian club toronto, toronto, ontario, 12 december 2011. 8 t. macklem, “raising house reform,” speech rotman institute international business, toronto, ontario, 7 february 2012. bi central bankers’ speech 5 global financial system economy. indeed, deleveraging financial institution well household government main force keep global economy current path gradual unbalance growth. how deleveraging affect commodity trading? bank pull back commodity sector, term lend commodity trader market-making proprietary trade activities. until recently, european bank provide 80 per cent finance trade commodity worldwide. but, bank repair balance sheets, scale back lending, bring share 50 per cent. to extent, u.s. asian bank well bank middle east step breach: increase share finance commodity houses. however, current climate, finance limit come increase cost. for bank business unite states, anticipate impact dodd-frank legislation commodity trade operation important additional reason curtail operations. the involvement bank financial trade commodities, include derivatives, decline pull sector altogether. we also see mark decline commodity asset bank management. a bank scale back commodities-related lending, scale back commodity operation – instance, reduce bonus remuneration commodity specialists. one area, however, bank maintaining, even expanding, activity physical side commodity business, increase hold physical product investment supply chain. these activity akin traditionally undertake commodity trade house themselves. recently, investor also grow cautious, pull back commodity-related investments. commodity-related asset management declined, reduce another finance flow commodity trade (chart 5). a bank scale back involvement commodities, commodity trade house grow importance change fund models. some commodity company begin tap capital market first time. sale investment-grade bond commodity company 90 per cent last year, commodity-linked junk bond rise estimate 40 per cent far year. a commodity trader increasingly fund directly capital markets, make great use innovative finance tools. some use hybrid convertible structures, (particularly asia) make broad use collateralize financing. in europe, bank use structure trade credit insurance mean deleveraging also remain active commodity trade emerge markets.9 another development partially reflect change finance condition wave merger acquisition sweep commodity-trading sector. in number cases, logic transaction bring trade house producer together. that’s new business model – indeed, oil major trade operation many years. but increasingly attractive one current climate dwindle bank finance commodities. 9 the latter shift also encourage regulation: many european country allow insurance count regulatory capital basel iii rules. 6 bi central bankers’ speech implication so far, i give thumbnail sketch change trend finance commodity markets. but development matter world economy, particularly canada? here, i would like briefly highlight three set issues. first, may implication price commodities. a i stressed, broad trend commodity price determine fundamental supply demand – notably long-term growth demand asian emerging-market economies. but function market commodity trade potential influence price several ways. the flow finance commodity trade activity affect liquidity efficiency market thus extent price reflect fundamentals. a well, financialization commodity potential affect degree short-term volatility markets. although early ass implication recent change finance pattern i describing, development bear watching. a second set issue pertain systemic risk. in particular, large trade houses, together physical trade operation large investment banks, play increasingly prominent role number commodity markets. this raise possibility institution become systemically important. just 2008 financial crisis reveal need ass systemic importance institution play central role particular financial markets, ask question institution interconnect various commodity markets. here, i two general question mind: could failure one large trade house cause serious disruption commodity market play market-making role? and, could loss trade house incur position take commodity significant knock-on effect financial system? we far answer questions, need addressed. third, commodity trade potentially important link financial system real economy. with financialization commodities, financial system stress potential affect commodity markets. commodity markets, turn, important influence economic outlook commodity-rich country canada. moreover, movement commodity price may pose risk financial institution channel fund commodity-trading activities. while possible recent trend toward deleveraging actually diminish link financial system commodity markets, development take time assess. conclusion allow conclude. a sound efficient financial system – canada globally – essential develop natural resource benefit canadians. a i discussed, relationship financial system commodity market strengthen past couple decades. however, wake global financial crisis, new trend emerge associate broad trend toward deleveraging financial institutions. the overall level commodity price drive supply demand, particularly rise demand emerging-market economies. but financialization may important implication short-term volatility price co-movements price financial assets; systemic risk; channel stress financial system affect real economy vice versa. give importance commodity canadian economy, bank canada monitor developments, view safeguard economic well-being canadians. bi central bankers’ speech 7 8 bi central bankers’ speech bi central bankers’ speech 9 bi central bankers’ speech 1 erdem başçi: financial stability turkey’s achievement date welcome speech mr erdem başçi, governor central bank republic turkey, 17th international conference bank supervisors, istanbul, 13 september 2012. * * * distinguish deputy prime minister, esteem guest distinguish member media, welcome istanbul 17th international conference bank supervisor jointly host central bank republic turkey bank regulation supervision agency turkey. in speech, i try summarize importance attach financial stability achievement make date. dear guests, there three essential factor determine growth potential country; price stability, financial stability productivity. any weakness three factor may cause considerable damage growth. the history economics teem example this. the social cost loss price stability well know economists. academic study indicate inflation rate average high 10 percentage point lead reduction gdp growth rate average quarter point.1 meanwhile, loss financial stability deep long-term impact growth employment.2 the cost prevent financial crisis much low cost crisis itself. turkey’s recent history good example statement. the economic crisis, turkey go 2001, increase country’s sovereign debt 30 percentage points, severely affect growth employment prospects. a 2002, turkey focus establish price stability, financial stability introduce structural reform aim increase productivity. a result, country’s economic prosperity grow rapid pace, financial sector gain structure resilient external shocks. the step take towards foster financial stability help turkey recover rapidly 2008–2009 global financial crisis weather european sovereign debt crisis 2011–2012 minimum damage. distinguish guests, the primary objective central bank republic turkey achieve maintain price stability. besides price stability, contribute financial stability within limit purview also list among primary duty bank. comprehend importance systemic risk along macroprudential measure mitigate risk ensure financial stability necessitate reconsideration regulatory framework global level. the enforcement dodd-frank act u european systemic risk board (esrb) europe well new regulation introduce country aim mitigate systemic risk mean macroprudential measures. in 1 barro, robert j.

executive seminar, busan, 24 september 2012. * * * distinguish deputy governors, delegate seacen member central banks! lady gentlemen! i would like welcome come busan attend seacen-bis executive seminar. in particular, special thank go mr. francesco papadia (director general market operation adviser executive board, ecb), professor takahashi ito tokyo university chief economist changyong rhee adb take time busy schedule attend seacen-bis executive seminar speakers. let also express appreciation lead discussant session chairs. take opportunity, i would also like express gratitude dr. eli remolona staff bi representative office asia pacific seacen center effort hard work organize seminar. we hold seminar today challenge policy response euro crisis theme deal financial contagion lead expert field. i hope particularly seminar good chance elucidate cause prognosis euro crisis effect emes, share experience wisdom future policy challenges. the notable characteristic recent global crisis shock certain sector spread rapidly amplify global real sector high level global financial inter-connectedness build past years. that said, seem cross-border adverse spillover excessive global liquidity result capital flow management difficulties, deem root crisis, have, large extent, fail resolve look international coordination effort far deal crisis involved. therefore i believe good case u conduct critical review point whether active policy implementation effort make major advance nation include u cop crisis effective extent far fall short term global spillover effect crisis, and, furthermore, whether various policy tool use crisis work should. a various view assessment concern expect today’s seminar, i would like make several point future global economic recovery slightly different perspective practical part emes play this. i would like begin speech argue global economy already enter state multiple equilibria, bad good equilibrium coexist. my work hypothesis equilibrium eurozone area economy attempt achieve likely local, global equilibrium. furthermore, bad equilibrium may incur negative spillover effect emes. such equilibrium tend remain unstable expect knife-edge equilibrium cannot sustainable. i believe global equilibrium attain concert policy effort advance emerge market economies. let little specific argument. the eurozone sovereign debt crisis pose threat global economic recovery financial stability, upshot may hard rule possibility affect emes unstable due excessive provision capital thus make capital market 2 bi central bankers’ speech emes highly volatile. the chance also slim sovereign debt problem major economy include european country resolve smoothly without achieve global economic growth. i believe therefore high time u concern best revive global economy, consolidate achievement financial reform implement policy authority individual country wake global financial crisis medium long- term perspective. of course, since task challenge deal order escape current crisis get back sustainable growth track multifaceted highly interconnected, solution limit single country certain region seek global level. in context, i think key maximize positive knock-on effect growth run emes advance nations. and i convince emes play big role process go forward. specific figure also bear well. emes account 54% growth global economy 2000 2005 growth contribution rise 72% 2006 2011. in addition, emes contribute 37% global gdp 1999, share go 49% 2011, hard heel advance nations. the imf recently estimate global economic outlook contribution emes global economic growth expect remain 70% next five year late 2000s, share global gdp forecast continue increase 54% 2016. for specific details, may refer result study conduct bank korea recently order examine extent emes could drive economic growth advance nations. accord study, similar positive growth repercussion emes advance economies, control conventional macro institutional factors. to put another way, 1% increase per caput gdp advance nation lead 0.4%p per caput gdp growth emes, 1% increase per caput gdp emes translate 0.3%p per caput gdp growth advance economies. give positive knock-on effect growth emerge advance economy high certain level, one country’s structural reform could positive impact countries’ growth knock-on effects. if advance emerge economy carry structural reform expand market openness time, world economy grow fast robustly. a learn asian countries’ experience overcome late 1990s asian financial crisis fast back major advance nations’ robust economic growth, emes sustain relatively high growth rate present, greatly helpful advance nation break free current dilemma reduce sovereign debt achieve economic growth. to catapult world economy onto sustainable growth trajectory, would desirable policy take major advance emerge economies? i cannot explain great detail, i think roughly five requirement meet order global economic recovery.1 first, major advance economy establish credible medium-term fiscal consolidation plan put practice put sovereign finance even keel. 1 excerpt governor choongsoo kim’s speech “out great recession: an eme’s perspective” part distinguish lecture hold imf (institute monetary financial stability) goethe university. (april 16, 2012) bi central bankers’ speech 3 second, negative spillover effect financial channel minimized. to end, eurozone member state build strong firewall ensure financial stability, provide sufficient public fund bank recpaitalized fend contagion effects. third, trade financial protectionism completely rejected. fourth, even though implementation new international financial regulatory framework desirable global financial stability, need thorough analysis study whether possibility framework could undermine incentive appropriate risk share need productive investment. last least, global financial safety net also strengthened. this pose question, kind role central bank play seek global solutions? i think central bank need remain faithful original mandate. they contribute economic growth maintain price stability financial stability establish effective macroprudential policy framework manage systemic risks. in particular, major advance nations’ central bank need bear mind monetary policy could negative spillover effect emerge market countries. i think even advance nations’ standpoint, benefit preclude possibility adverse effect would far outweigh ex-post cost cause conduct monetary policy consideration condition alone. let conclude. a i sure well aware, four year since global financial crisis break september 2008. there urgent need policy response commensurate change condition line severe global financial crisis since great depression 1930s. a i mention earlier, overcome challenge face us, need consider measure global level. to end, close cooperation global community required, bear mind grow role emes. the world economy nowadays seem wait sage like philosopher aristotle claim whole great sum parts. that because, increasingly multipolarized environment, global leadership envision “the whole” future human become important ever address transnational issues, include global policy cooperation coordination global financial regulation global sustainable growth. in face unprecedented great depression 1930s, august predecessor office bold enough change conventional wisdom recast academic framework macroeconomy new perspective. for part, also similarly need push back advance horizon new explanatory paradigm stand next twenty thirty years, historic impetus outbreak resolution global financial crisis. note “the

opinion express herein. mr governor, mr consul general, mr vice president board palestinian institute fiscal policy, deputy ministers, head public administration, director general, lady gentlemen, it great honour speak palestinian public finance institute. the establishment institute mark important step development economic governance framework palestinian territories. i wish project every success. it rely commitment many dedicate people ministry finance adetef. a jean monnet, one found father european union, put it: “nothing possible without men; nothing last without institutions.” his word relate europe fact relevant worldwide. the middle east europe always close ties. they part mediterranean region, economically financially interlinked. and currently, experience institutional transformation. in part world come call “arab spring”. in europe, consequence economic financial crisis result weakness architecture europe’s economic monetary union (emu). institution-building take time. even though european integration start six decade ago, build institution remain work progress. but understand challenge europe currently facing, take step back look briefly origin europe’s integration process. i share think i believe main shortcoming current emu framework. finally, i give view short- longer-term measure euro area take overcome crisis. 1. build europe world war ii: path towards economic monetary union in 1945, europe emerge second world war devastate continent, economically break politically divided. but even dark day war, european convince europe would eventually overcome division unite peace. one robert schuman, french statesman, 1950 make declaration become rally cry: propose europe aim close economic political cooperation. the declaration well received, also west germany. this crucial point germany france rival century-long quest dominance european continent. the schuman declaration pave way new era peaceful cooperation two nations, well countries. a new type europe begin emerge wasteland world war ii. what take shape indeed “revolutionary” – father unite europe move beyond concept nation-state jealously guard sovereignty. they place coal steel production – two industry crucial war effort – new supranational authority. six european country – france, west germany, italy, netherlands, belgium luxembourg – take first important step towards close 2 bi central bankers’ speech cooperation 1951. a process towards create durable condition peace europe set motion. the six found country come realise substantial benefit close cooperation agree deepen further. in 1957, sign treaty rome, create custom union establish european economic community. it overall aim promote harmonious economic development, raise live standard develop common market. however, found father europe saw european integration exercise economic cooperation. they share large vision future europe. thus, treaty’s preamble, signatory commit lay foundation “ever close union” among people europe. this commitment become leitmotif continent’s integration. indeed, initial group six country start process expand become group 27 countries, another one, croatia, join next year. others currently negotiate become members. proposal deep monetary integration date back werner report 1970 gain political momentum second half 1980s. at time, member state take step towards establish single market. this include also liberalisation capital movements. a consequence, europe become captive robert mundell economist call “impossible trinity” – words, impossibility simultaneously achieve three goal financial liberalisation, exchange rate stability, national monetary policy. one three goal abandoned. the choice one become increasingly clear fail attempt secure exchange rate stability exchange rate mechanism.1 give single market, include capital account liberalisation, state goal since treaty rome, give exchange rate stability need reap full benefit single market, member state agree renounce monetary sovereignty. moreover, share currency make sense country close trade ties. this especially true euro area country which, since start emu, conduct almost half overall trade among themselves. the maastricht treaty, sign 1992, make monetary policy euro area competence leave economic fiscal policy responsibility national governments. the concept economic union rely essentially single market, bind constraint economic fiscal policies. over time, turn significant institutional shortcoming. moreover, transfer core sovereign prerogative like monetary policy supranational level highly political act entail important political commitment future. in particular, participate country must undertake conduct fiscal economic policy way allow monetary union work properly. this responsibility euro area country share, responsibility government fulfil vis-à-vis peer vis-à-vis citizens. see perspective, clear concept emu go beyond economic monetary integration. let add single market political dimension proper function market require strong institutional underpinnings, enforcement contracts, consumer protection competition policy. it mandate creation federal executive (the european commission), legislative (the european 1 in late 1970s, european country agree close exchange rate cooperation set standard fluctuation band plus/minus 2.25% bilateral exchange rates. this exchange rate mechanism (erm) function well decade ultimately fell apart due divergence economic fiscal policy participate countries. speculative attack ensue ultimately trigger crisis force two large country – unite kingdom italy – leave erm 1992. bi central bankers’ speech 3 parliament), judiciary (the eu court justice). the creation single currency act political integration. under maastricht treaty european economic community become european union, proper reflection fact ultimate aim – finalité, say french – european project economic. the eu real, albeit limited, political union. 2. the maastricht framework shortcoming let review briefly i consider three important shortcoming maastricht framework – one need achieve progress urgently: i) strong fiscal institutions; ii) real convergence across euro area; iii) establishment financial market union. the maastricht treaty create european central bank (ecb), take monetary operation 1 january 1999. the monetary dimension maastricht treaty work well. since start emu, ecb keep annual inflation rate average close 2%. a regard economic policy however, new institution competence created. the maastricht treaty include general clause economic policy treat matter common concern coordinate within eu council ministers. member state also require run economic policy accordance ecb’s primary goal maintain price stability. the underlie philosophy prevent economist call “fiscal dominance”: namely, misguide policy government force hand central bank, hind pursue objective: safeguard price stability. however, surveillance economic policy rest chiefly non-binding guideline recommendations. in 1997, architecture complement stability growth pact, foresee bind commitment fiscal rules, back sanctions. these however enforce case fiscal slippage arise late on, back sufficiently strong national fiscal institutions. outside realm fiscal policies, coordination seek specific rule foreseen. this another weakness maastricht framework: absence surveillance mechanism timely detection macroeconomic imbalance resolution. those country history elevate inflation rate exchange rate devaluation benefited, start emu, unprecedented low level real interest rates. over time, lead wage price increase undermine competitiveness. this development show increasingly deteriorate current account position well bubbles, particularly financial real estate sectors, fuel capital flow country current account surpluses. when bubble burst global financial crisis 2007, government step support growth call rescue ail banks. in way, private indebtedness turn public indebtedness, disastrous fiscal consequence even country run fiscal surplus prior crisis, ireland spain, even not, greece. a shortcoming maastricht framework inability deal call “bank-sovereign nexus”. when systemically important bank run trouble, government expect step provide fiscal support contain spillovers. beyond that, bank typically large holder government debt respective sovereigns. these ties, nexus, bank government lead dangerous downward spiral another effect downward spiral, way since euro area crisis erupt 2010, fragmentation capital markets. the bank-sovereign nexus lead situation whereby cross-border lend bank go significantly, bank retreat domestic markets, encourage shareholder and, sometimes, 4 bi central bankers’ speech national bank supervisors. the crisis undermine key achievement euro, integration capital markets. a fundamental problem maastricht treaty over-reliance assumption market discipline peer pressure would provide sufficient incentive national policy-makers conduct sound fiscal economic policies. this prove case. a jacques de larosière, former imf manage director, remarked, suppose system “peer pressure” often turn system “peer concessions” “peer arrangements”. on whole, maastricht framework prove unable deal adequately high degree economic financial integration euro area. it fully understand share currency mean much share monetary policy. it commitment ensure sound fiscal, economic financial conditions. euro area country largely overlook substantial spillover effect national policy decision would fellow country emu euro area partners. the ongoing crisis bring shortcoming sharp focus. 3. short longer-term solution crisis: go beyond maastricht framework 3.1. the ecb’s contribution resolve crisis let turn europe’s policy response crisis. the emu framework rely strict separation monetary policy one hand, fiscal economic policy other. the monetary policy function carry ecb clear mandate: maintain price stability medium term euro area. to achieve goal, ecb give full political operational independence. since start crisis, ecb react forcefully. since 2008, low policy rate 4.25% 0.75% now. however, increase fragmentation capital market i describe above, sometimes lead complete drying-up certain financial market segments, impair monetary transmission channel euro area. monetary policy signal long transmit properly real sector. the divergence bank fund condition certainly key factor, addition country-specific economic situation, explain difference bank lend rate non-financial corporation across euro area countries. these divergence lead weaken pass-through monetary policy decision euro area countries. for example, among five large euro area countries, maximum difference short-term lend rate non-financial corporation (for short-term loan €1 million) reach 100 basis point recent months. across euro area countries, dispersion lend rate great ever been. in words, conventional monetary policy lose effectiveness part euro area. for ecb, singleness monetary policy stake. against background, ecb resort so-called non-standard measure ensure effective transmission monetary policy across euro area. without properly function transmission channel monetary policy, ecb’s capability maintain price stability risk. the ecb modify allotment procedure collateral policy. it also low rate minimum reserve requirement introduce longer-term refinance operations. importantly, ecb also decide resort outright purchase bond secondary markets. follow so-called security market programme, terminated, govern council ecb agree meet 6 september bi central bankers’ speech 5 modality undertake outright monetary transaction (omts) secondary market sovereign bond euro area. the omts enable ecb address severe distortion government bond market originate from, particular, fear part investor reversibility euro. monetary union sometimes misunderstand exchange rate system participate country enter leave, case erm. such perception reversibility would imply that, ultimately, one euro would worth different euro area countries. in words, single currency would long single. this perception fundamentally flawed. let clear: maastricht treaty refer “irrevocable fix exchange rates” country enter monetary union. the euro irrevocable. with omts, appropriate conditions, emu fully effective backstop avoid destructive scenario potentially severe consequence price stability euro area. a necessary condition omts country concern adhere strict effective conditionality attach appropriate programme european financial stability facility (efsf) european stability mechanism (esm). imf involvement seek design monitor conditionality. the omts instrument ecb’s toolbox help fulfil mandate, maintain price stability. they conducive monetary authority restore power control credit condition euro area and, channel, inflation medium term. 3.2. government action fight crisis ultimately, however, current crisis result lack incentive maastricht treaty pursue sound fiscal, economic financial market policies. this amend member states, ecb. the key resolve crisis thus lie first foremost governments, individually jointly. since start crisis, member state adopt number important measure strengthen institutional framework emu. a procedure surveillance excessive macroeconomic imbalance establish order detect correct divergence early stage. in case non-adherence agree fiscal economic rules, sanction apply automatic manner reduce potential political interference delay process. further improvement currently consideration, mandatory submission draft national budget group euro area finance minister – so-called “eurogroup” – vet budget submit national parliament adoption. the vet ensure divergence fiscal rule identify correct early stage. moreover, early year, 25 27 eu member state sign treaty stability, coordination governance economic monetary union, generally know fiscal compact. the compact improve emu framework introduce cyclically adjust balanced-budget rule participate country need transpose national legislation. finally, temporary crisis resolution mechanism created, european financial stability facility (efsf), remain active july 2013 despite replace permanent organisation autumn, european stability mechanism (esm). with combine maximum firepower €700 billion, two mechanism help build effective firewall stem contagion crisis. what achieve far impressive. prior crisis, would expect member state would reach consensus fundamental change way emu works. but change enough. emu need longer-term vision confront challenges. 6 bi central bankers’ speech 3.3. the way ahead – deep integration in order restore confidence, policy-makers euro area need resolutely push ahead fiscal consolidation, structural reform enhance competitiveness european institution-building. recently, president european council, close cooperation president eurogroup, european commission european central bank, put forward proposal genuine emu. the four president propose genuine emu build integrate framework budgetary policies, economic policy financial market policies, turn must underpin great democratic legitimacy accountability. when look option establish budgetary policy monetary union, exclude uncoordinated conduct fiscal policy member states, three possible model come mind. first, could fully-fledged fiscal union, central budget federal debt issuance. it card short run important step would need take establish necessary euro area-wide political legitimacy governance. the second model would involve share sovereignty national fiscal policies, reciprocal control public expenditure serve basis common debt issuance governments. such reciprocal control would also require strong democratic legitimacy, involve national parliaments. the third model would rely unqualified adherence fiscal discipline member states, without risk-sharing. none three model alone possible short run. there combination three. the desirable mix decide upon people europe appropriate democratic checks. emu unique construct, tailor european specificities, need resemble exist federation. let give examples. first foremost, euro area country regain ability save money rainy day adhere fiscal commitment new framework fiscal compact. they already agree limit mutual insurance efsf/esm. a centralise fiscal capacity could consider too, provide basis permanent transfer use promote market integration good resilience economic shocks. for instance, euro area unemployment insurance scheme could set up, would support much-needed cross-country labour mobility. indeed, integrate economic policy framework need boost economic integration ensure unsustainable policy jeopardise stability emu. the framework provide good enforcement commitment structural reforms, i.e. measure increase country’s competitiveness capacity adjust economic shocks. structural reform make emu robust. in addition, integrate financial market framework require order break bank-sovereign nexus threaten financial integration. this another important element make market-based risk share work effectively. while many euro area bank benefit single currency, significantly expand european business activities, still supervise national level. financial fragmentation, i describe above, lead perception banks’ liabilities, even though nominally same, fact different one euro area country another. this acceptable: currency union thus complement bank union. at summit june, eu member state enter political commitment, european commission propose create single supervisory mechanism bank euro area entrust task ecb. this single supervisory mechanism implement way compromise ecb’s independence constrain monetary policy. it complement single regime wind fail bank single resolution fund euro area level. finally, build deep emu require strengthen democratic legitimacy accountability. the people europe accept pool competence european level european policy-makers subject high standard accountability. bi central bankers’ speech 7 the european parliament, whose representative directly elect citizens, already play central role hold ecb eu institution account. a consequence deep economic political integration emu, euro area become, view, “political space” right and, such, require proper euro area accountability mechanisms. political legitimacy vital build popular support integration. 4. conclusion lady gentlemen, when robert schuman draft declaration start european integration process, predict “europe make once, accord single plan. it build concrete achievement first create de facto solidarity”. when look europe’s progress since second world war step-by-step build emu, indeed see hold europe together, engine, reason success, notion solidarity. solidarity sometimes narrow mean one-way support, donor recipient. of course always key consideration european construction. the eu structural funds, go europe’s poor regions, tangible measure kind solidarity. likewise, european crisis mechanism efsf esm symbol euro area solidarity. solidarity catch-phrase emu; essential all. let come back schuman’s insight “concrete achievement first create de facto solidarity”. we reach point history europe de facto solidarity create need concrete achievements. in recent year make impressive progress put emu’s architecture sound footing. the euro area country need continue path policy reform strengthen governance. the report four president october provide guidance regard. if effort maintained, i confident crisis overcome. thank attention. bi central bankers’ speech 1 h r

especially time demand food item rise expect continue rise several year now. i sure people great exposure expertise elucidate much good way grind level fact current rise food prices, particularly edible oil challenge lie ahead country like india net importer edible oil. i thank globoil india tefla’s invite me. i wish congratulate globoil india 16th anniversary – long enough period organisation grow infancy reach adulthood. around 50 per cent india’s domestic consumption edible oil meet import india import share 15 per cent world market. give this, globoil important role play i wish best efforts. i hope proceed event would help improve domestic productivity, availability market efficiency edible oils. take broad generalise view industry, i shall look role agribusiness growth economy well inflation management. in particular, i would discuss importance potential supply chain management evolve scenario. growth inflation – role agribusiness before discuss role agribusiness growth inflation, would apposite define understand concept agribusiness. way back 1957, davis goldberg1 define agribusiness lucidly sum total operation involve manufacture distribution farm supplies; production operation farm; storage, process distribution farm commodity item make them. thus, agribusiness essentially encompass today, function term agriculture denote 150 year ago agriculture subset large superset call agribusiness. a far growth inflation concerned, may aware weight attach objective growth vis-à-vis price stability choice policy measure vary accord extant macroeconomic environment. for example, great moderation, policy world focus growth enhance measures. presently, view continuance low inflation low negative growth develop economies, policy measures, mainly form liquidity enhancement low interest rates, continue focus augmentation growth. 1 quote king, robert p., michael boehlje, michael cook, steven t. sonka (2010) “agribusiness economics management”, american journal agricultural economics, special issue commemorate centennial aaea, vol.92, no.2, april 2 bi central bankers’ speech in india, however, condition different. along economic slowdown, inflation rule significantly threshold level, beyond inflation turn inimical growth. under current macroeconomic environment, indian policy maker think various measure simultaneously achieve twin objective high growth low inflation. opinion differ utility different policy measure current juncture may familiar current debate timing, sequence complementarity various measures. there is, however, near unanimity, amongst agriculture agribusiness growth necessary prerequisite moderation inflation, particularly food inflation, well acceleration sustenance inclusive growth. the impact agribusiness inflation also direct indirect. the direct impact agribusiness visible form food inflation. with demand arise increase population prosperity outstrip growth agricultural output, food inflation likely persist global level next several years. oecd-fao predict grim global food inflation outlook could continue next ten years. the oecd-fao agricultural outlook 2011–20 indicate food price may high real term five year 2015–20. for example, price oil seed project high 36 per cent relative level prevail five year period 1998–2003.2 high price global level limit use import tool domestic inflation management. even global price low, import option limit mere news entry large consumer like india enter global market spike prices. further, high import would add pressure already high current account deficit. the indirect impact agribusiness inflation reflect rise cost live arise high food inflation lead high wages, which, turn, contribute generalise inflation high cost production. this may trigger wage-price spiral. hence, though food inflation least spike food inflation normally supply side phenomenon, monitor closely remain one difficult challenge central banks. the reserve bank presently grapple challenge high food inflation often monetary policy act first line defence, even persistent supply side issue. however, manage food inflation medium-term perspective would include measure increase production, improve productivity enhance efficiency supply chain management. on growth front, service sector drive growth past several years, acceleration growth economy sustenance high level critically hinge performance agriculture sector term supply food food products, employment large section population provide large grow demand base segment economy, viz., industry services. give strong backward forward linkage agribusiness industrial service sector, sector directly contribute growth also facilitate growth rest economy. also, growth agribusiness potential generate gainful employment within farm sector, could help reduce incidence underemployment disguise unemployment agriculture. the role agribusiness become even important context challenge global economy face enhance food production cater increase demand food, fuel feed. oecd-fao estimates3 suggest world population touch 9 billion 2050, agricultural production need increase 60 per cent next 40 year meet rise demand food. additional one billion tonne cereal 200 million tonne meat year produce year 2050 compare 2005–07 levels. the demand bio-fuel production also expect double. increase 2 oecd-fao agricultural price outlook: http://www.oecd.org/site/oecd-faoagriculturaloutlook/ 3 oecd fao food agricultural outlook: 2012–2021 bi central bankers’ speech 3 demand meat meat product also require additional agricultural feedstocks. give limit scope expand farmland area around world problem soil degradation water scarcity, apart exploitation fish stocks, augment agricultural production become major challenge. global warming, climate change extreme weather condition add uncertainties. increase food price across globe become major issue recent years. the spike global food price witness period 2004–08 significant welfare consequence term million people push poverty hunger. the increase price witness almost major commodity edible oil exception. though price volatile recent period, forecast suggest price could continue secular upward trend, could put pressure inflation (chart 1). this critical issue country like india major importer edible oils. also, observe india, domestic price significantly impact trend global price edible oils. incidentally, current year far, inflation retail level oil fat high wholesale level (chart 2). while phenomenon attribute number factors, improvement supply change management certainly help narrow gap. also, price trend retail level indicate price pay final consumer edible oil differ significantly across major city within country (chart 3). while part divergence could attribute factor like transportation cost state specific tax well quality product, difference magnitude also point towards issue relate supply chain critical country like india large domestic market. 4 bi central bankers’ speech hence, i shall turn supply chain farm product move reach final consumer need upgrade view grow challenge mention earlier. supply chain management agribusiness it observe wide divergence farm gate price retail price various food items. the usual reference 1-2-3-4 supply chain quite well known, producer sell one rupee, time reach final bi central bankers’ speech 5 consumer fetch four rupee due presence intermediaries. the recently appoint inter-ministerial group4 inflation emphasise need cut margin farm gate price retail price. improve supply chain beneficial producer final consumer producer would get remunerative price produce consumer would benefit low price. therefore, increase efficiency supply chain could help bring food inflation increase efficiency food market make agriculture sector sustainable viable. a well-known feature current structure food inflation sharp rise price protein food items. these comprise perishable item milk, eggs, meat, fish, vegetable fruit – require advance effective supply chain management. different aspect agribusiness supply chain undergo transformation likely continue future. emphasis processing, trade market go increase time. demand protein rich high value food like fruits, vegetables, edible oil livestock product increasing. demand high quality, safe convenient (frozen, pre-cut, pre-cooked ready-to-eat) food rising. meet demand emanate within country grow indian diaspora efficient supply chain management expect facilitate growth moderate inflation. supply chain management agricultural business integral part agricultural market system. efficient supply chain business model necessary create efficient agricultural market deliver agricultural produce farmer consumer efficient way. while output productivity supply side factors, market provide intermediate link producer final demand consumers. efficiently function market add welfare producer well consumers. efficient agricultural market also potent tool poverty reduction. agricultural market india, particular supply chain management business models, inefficient. in india, farmers’ produce generally dispose village, rural/primary market secondary agricultural market. the challenge face supply-chain management agribusiness india broadly classify three, namely, 1) lack accessibility regulate markets, 2) lack competitition agricultural produce market committee (apmc) act, 3) absence nationwide common agriculture market. these challenge run across various channel supply-chain agribusiness model operate. these channel (i) producer-consumer, (ii) producer-retailer-consumer, (iii) producer-wholesaler-retailer-consumer, (iv) producer-commission agent-wholesaler-retailer-consumer (v) producer-village merchant-wholesaler-retailer-consumer. agriculture market india regulate model apmc acts. the number regulate (secondary) agricultural market stand 7,157 march 2010 compare 286 1950. there also 22,221 rural periodical markets, 15 per cent function ambit apmc regulation.5 the model apmc act allow state collect market fee buyers/traders sale notify agricultural produce generally high. the high incidence commission charge agricultural/horticultural produce render market cost high. there charge like entry tax/octroi tax vary across state well across commodities. these charge prevent emergence nationwide common market agricultural produce. moreover, restriction movement good essential commodity act remain place various states. 4 position paper no.1 img inflation http://finmin.nic.in/workingpaper/img%20on%20inflation.pdf 5 average area serve market 115 sq. km average area serve regulate market 454 sq km. accord recommendation national farmer commission, availability market within 5 km radius (approx. 80 sq km). 6 bi central bankers’ speech these inhibit free access agriculture markets. most agricultural market also characterise dominance cash base transaction issue cash management also become important. also, issue weight measurement well presence broke commission agents. there reason believe regulatory barrier constrain investment development storage process facilities, hamper development effective institutions, low capacity agricultural producer internationally competitive. india, example, world’s large producer fruit vegetable estimate inadequate post-harvest storage transportation cause loss around 30–40 per cent, 7 per cent value addition take place, 2 per cent production process commercially. road connectivity, development horticulture, dairying & animal husbandry activity expansion cash crops, provide necessary wherewithal great access farm sector market orient agriculture still lack country. this particularly important segment “high value” agriculture, demand pressure go intense come years, major investment need development efficient value chain save high wastage intermediation costs. the inadequate facility storage product also result considerable seasonal fluctuation price products. the country need single point market fee system facilitate free movement produce, bring price stabilization, reduce price difference producer consumer market segments. use information & communication technology (ict) solution (for example, pre-paid card base payment octroi posts) would facilitate easy movement agricultural produce. besides boost productivity sustain basis, cleaning, grade package agricultural produce, would popularize great market penetration. the current fragment market system lack infrastructure serious constraint efficient function competitiveness supply chain india. an efficient supply chain would need integrate supply chain value chain wherein stage within chain, significant value addition take place. it essential link farmer market state-of-art infrastructure. effective linkage help remove constraint logistics, quality maintenance thus, help efficient access, delivery, price discovery compete global products. link small primary producer market help improve livelihood million poor india. bank bank finance also play critical role entire agribusiness chain. a result broad consensus emerge need reform agricultural market policy important reform measure implement recent years, part ongoing policy reform process india, as, amendment apmc act also recent initiative allow foreign direct investment (fdi) retail sector. at specific level, introduction negotiable warehouse receipt system, scheme bank finance receipts, establishment warehouse development & regulatory authority (wdra) guarantee support scheme ten year construction warehouses/storage facility would provide much need fillip efficient market management price risk reduction producers. further, disbursement rural infrastructure development fund (ridf) administer national bank agriculture rural development (nabard) special earmark ₹50 billion year 2012–13 develop cold storage warehouse facility rural area would also provide boost infrastructure development market efficiency. external commercial borrow (ecb) infrastructure cover cold storage also allowed. consider need boost supply value chain certain critical agricultural product significant implication producer consumers, nabard initiate pilot programme supply chain development potato west bengal uttar pradesh, onion maharashtra tomato punjab haryana. these projects, would involve banks, state government research institutes, comprehensive nature expect help farmer good bi central bankers’ speech 7 sorting/packaging, warehouse market apart help production stage adopt good agricultural practices, involve quality input r&d support. measure improve supply chain the suggestion various policy document strengthen supply chain classify into: 1) enhance capability farmers, 2) strengthen infrastructure, 3) legislative interventions. by encourage farmer organise group – growers’ groups, co-operatives, self-help groups, joint liability groups, producer company give preponderance small marginal farmer country – supply chain streamline well make egalitarian. recently, nabard set producer organization development fund (podf), could play catalytic role regard. also, investment across entire agro-value chain spectrum, creation cold chains, rural godowns, new agricultural market

ppp efficiency effectiveness. finally, context role public distribution system cereal also need undergo transformation. there two oppose view desirable strategy pd system. accord some, pd play stabilise role release stock food price high, particularly period characterise supply chain manipulation. however, others opine pd dilute competitive market force government instead focus removal supply chain rigidities. give rise demand due urbanisation migration, high per caput incomes, change dietary habits, one hand, huge cost leakage associate pds, other, consider desirable imperative competitive market force play increasingly great role time. the propose alternative pd like cash transfers/food coupon would also effective presence well integrate supply chain. otherwise, supply chain manipulation could lead exploitation cash transfer beneficiary could implication food inflation. conclude remark i would like conclude say world destine struggle shortage supply agricultural commodity vis-à-vis grow demand several years. the pressure would reflected, among others, rise prices. apart raise agricultural productivity, improvement management supply chain would critical sustenance overall economic growth prevention runaway rise prices. diversification non-traditional area like biofuels, polymers, pharmaceutical/health product fee poultry diary meet grow demand protein food major implication supply chain. increase complexity decentralisation agribusiness organization would guide future change supply chains. it would also entail need development new concept techniques. i hope would deliberate issue suggest way ahead. 6 report “working group on agricultural market infrastructure, secondary agriculture policy require for internal and external trade for the

distinguish participants. bi central bankers’ speech 1 hirohide yamaguchi: economic slowdown monetary ease speech mr hirohide yamaguchi, deputy governor bank japan, asian affair research council, tokyo, 24 september 2012. * * * introduction thank give opportunity speak asian affair research council special lecture front distinguish member active wide range areas. for half century since 1964, council been, various kind research study asia pacific region, contribute deepen mutual understand harmonious development region. the year 1964 tokyo olympics hold japan join organisation economic co-operation development. japan’s trade balance turn clear surplus year continue surplus 47 year 2010. the year 1964 could say milestone japan’s economy. in september 1964, annual meet international monetary fund (imf) world bank group hold tokyo. half century since then, japan’s economy grow significantly and, amid globalization, linkage japan rest world closely interrelated. in week next, tuesday, october 9, annual meet imf world bank group hold tokyo second time. the bank japan, together ministry finance, prepare meet host country. about 20 thousand participant concern party world expect join, many conference seminar global economy, financial system various issue held. in order let people know japan’s economy, best way let actually see japan. i believe many already plan participate, hope seize opportunity lively exchange views. today i talk theme “economic slowdown monetary easing.” in first half, i present overview current state outlook global economy japan’s economy. in second half, base thing economy home abroad, i explain bank japan’s conduct monetary policy. to summarize thrust speech advance, five points. first, look overseas economies, due effect european debt problem, business sentiment become cautious many country regions, mainly manufacture sector, economy move somewhat deep deceleration phase. future uncertainty remain high. second, consider background slowdown overseas economies, might good focus effect european debt problem, view broad perspective. namely, need follow big picture mind. during period mid-2000s so-called great moderation, bubble generate advance country still suffer balance-sheet adjustment burst bubble. in emerge economies, excess supply capacity low cost labor force, factor support great moderation, become low, become difficult simultaneously achieve economic growth price stability. third, japan’s economy register relatively high growth first half 2012, pick-up economic activity come pause, reflect weak development overseas economies. economic activity expect level le time being. fourth, response weak outlook economic activity, bank japan enhance monetary ease monetary policy meet hold last week future economy deviate orbit “returning sustainable growth path price stability.” fifth, order japan’s economy 2 bi central bankers’ speech overcome deflation, addition support financial side, important make effort strengthen growth potential take advantage accommodative financial conditions. after explain issues, i answer question raise time’s monetary easing. i. current state outlook overseas economy let start current state global economy. overseas economy move somewhat deep deceleration phase. while global economy deceleration phase, seem extent deceleration recently increase mainly manufacturer many country regions. current state european economy the european economy currently deceleration phase. three year already pass since concern government debt recognize international financial capital markets, and, present, problem limit greece, portugal, ireland, already receive support european union (eu) imf also spread major southern european countries, include spain italy. in countries, due rise government bond yields, namely, decline government bond prices, financial institutions’ asset deteriorated, lead rise fund cost instability financial positions. a result, financial condition surround firm household worsened, pose pressure suppress economic activity. such deterioration real economy concern financial system feed back fiscal problem decline revenue increase support financial institutions. in way, europe, vicious cycle public finance, financial system, real economy work, mainly peripheral countries. therefore, stagnation european economy protracted, recently spread core countries, include germany, mainly term business sentiment. the growth rate euro area economy negative three consecutive quarters. in meantime, european authority take various policy measures. in july, financial support measure inject public fund spanish financial institution compiled, begin september, european central bank (ecb) introduce new program purchase government bond maturity one three years, ex ante quantitative limit size purchases. however, start purchase government bonds, ecb go make conditions. for example, issuer country bond purchase accept monitor eu imf progress fiscal consolidation. thank various policy responses, stability maintain interbank fund markets, investors’ risk aversion abate somewhat international financial capital market whole. the policy response ecb policy authority indispensable contain vicious cycle public finance, financial system, real economy. however, order resolve european debt problem fundamentally, necessary country whose fiscal sustainability cause concern make progress meet challenge fiscal consolidation, strengthen medium- long-term growth potential, reinforce stability financial system. in addition, europe whole, integrate fiscal policy bank supervision nation unavoidable challenge. none challenge easy meet thus likely high uncertainty continue surround future progress. speak risk associate european debt problem, risk stagnation real economy might become protract vicious cycle public finance, financial system, real economy, risk financial crisis might occur due concern financial system. put simply recent development bi central bankers’ speech 3 europe, summarize risk stagnation real economy, include spillover core countries, might become protract still large, risk financial crisis might occur subside due various policy responses. current state u.s. economy let turn unite states. the u.s. economy modest recovery trend moderate increase private consumption, include automobile sales, sign pick-up house market. however, weak developments. improvement employment slow and, amid economic adjustment europe protracted, business sentiment, mainly manufacturer operate globally, recently become cautious increase business fix investment slowing. against backdrop, federal reserve recently decide keep target range federal fund rate 0 1/4 percent change outlook duration exceptionally low level federal fund rate likely warranted, “at least late 2014” “at least mid-2015.” in addition, decide purchase mortgage-backed security (mbs) issue governmental financial institutions, call agency mbs, pace 40 billion dollar per month outlook labor market improve substantially context price stability. in unite states, balance-sheet adjustment due burst house bubble progress certain degree, steadfastly remained. in situation, addition effect european debt problem, prospect solution so-called fiscal cliff problem increase awareness uncertainty fiscal consolidation time. those factor likely continue constrain economic activity time grow cautiousness household business sentiment. while u.s. economy expect continue recover partly support accommodative financial conditions, pace recovery time likely moderate. current state chinese economy next china. while chinese economy grow relatively high rate, state slowdown become protracted. it point that, background, slowdown export europe deceleration private real estate investment due effect past monetary tighten policy measure control real estate transactions. with final demand home abroad declining, pressure inventory adjustment raw material industry wide range area recently increasing, spread production manufacture industry. in china, authority take policy responses, include monetary ease advancement infrastructure investment, economy consider gradually accelerate pace growth effect would manifest themselves. while i believe scenario still maintained, slowdown linger long expect certain time economic activity get state slowdown deferred. while due mainly greater-than-expected stagnation european economy, large trade partner, might structural problem. one policy authority seem hesitant step gas pedal toward economic growth. that might due bitter experience large-scale fiscal spend monetary ease lehman shock lead rise price surge real estate prices. a simultaneous achievement economic growth price stability common challenge many emerge commodity-exporting economies, i talk detail later. another reason might that, china, result continue growth long period lead largely public investment business fix investment, industries, mainly raw material industry, carry structural problem excessive investment, balance supply demand prone lost. in process china’s transition high growth sustainable growth, 4 bi central bankers’ speech answer question change balance investment consumption, domestic external demand, urban rural areas, coastal inland area yet found, might increase uncertainty future economic activity. overall picture global economy while i explain europe, unite states, china, respectively, suffice see overall picture global economy. there elements, include challenge advance country commonly face challenge emerge economy face with, understand overall picture global economy. in order consider challenge common advance countries, let u go back period mid-2000s, call “great moderation.” at time, various favorable factor include rise emerge economy technological innovation finance overlapped, extremely favorable economic condition high growth, low inflation, low interest rate continue long period. against backdrop, optimistic view economic outlook spread globally investment boom boost demand consumer durables surface unite state europe. on financial front, financial institutions’ risk-taking attitude become aggressive, rapid bloat credit rapid increase leverage take place. in short, excess generate real economy financial front, excess finally correct lehman shock. subsequently, experience unite states, europe, advance country that, large-scale bubble burst financial crisis occurs, economic adjustment become protract and, meantime, economy force grow low rate – phenomenon repeat history. in unite states, substantial impairment households’ balance sheet due mainly subprime mortgage problem make recovery u.s. economy sluggish one. in europe, amid optimistic mood call “europhoria,” word coin combine “euro” “euphoria,” loose fiscal management greece excessive real estate investment southern europe take place, leave severe problem balance sheet government financial institutions. in process balance-sheet adjustments, economic activity recover wished. an economy unlikely accelerate remain vulnerable downside continue long period. without recognize fact, frustration “why growth rate increase despite policy responses” “why unemployment rate decline” prone surface. it seem unite state europe yet identify “a normal pace economic growth” balance-sheet adjustment process. that seem induce difficult problem heighten expectation economic policy social unrest dissatisfaction. while might somewhat much say, viewpoint, sense commonality among dissatisfaction among young people spain high unemployment rate, demonstration fiscal austerity greece, repeat conflict fiscal management unite states. at least, result increase reliance central bank unite state europe obvious tendency. in meantime, china emerge economy affect plunge advance economy immediately lehman shock, subsequently restore growth early stage back buoyant domestic demand grow somewhat high rates. the continue capital inflow emerge economies, advance country continue monetary ease provide ample funds, seem also boost domestic demand emerge economies. recently, contribution global economic growth advance country decline markedly emerge economy increasing. accord imf, proportion bi central bankers’ speech 5 advance country emerge economy world gdp shift substantially “7 3” “5 5” past 30 years. while emerge economy lead global economy, face new challenge lehman shock. that simultaneous achievement high growth price stability. one important element support “great moderation” dramatic increase world’s supply capacity due emerge economies’ industrialization back ample inexpensive labor force. however, demand emerge economy increase accordingly result put constant upward pressure commodity price food prices. in addition, example china, development inland area progressed, mechanism, increase labor force cover population inflow rural urban areas, recently changing. a labor population whole expect decline future, labor supply become prone fall short past, inflationary pressure might also stem aspect. at present, response pressure economic slowdown europe advance countries, emerge economy take policy responses, include monetary easing, difficult take drastic measure economy susceptible inflationary pressure. there uncertainty policy effect surface emerge economy pace growth accelerate. a crop price recently surging, simultaneous achievement economic growth price stability likely continue challenge emerge economies. in way, global economy move somewhat deep deceleration phase, effect european debt problem combine unique factor various country region involve – namely, great challenge balance-sheet adjustment advance country search sustainable growth path emerge economies. a mention earlier, u.s. economy continue recover moderately policy effect gradually surface chinese economy, global economy likely get deceleration phase, exit deferred. ii. current state challenge japan’s economy let move japan’s economy. a i explained, overseas economy move somewhat deep deceleration phase. a result, export industrial production relatively weak. the month-on-month rate change real export negative four consecutive month since may due weakness export europe china, and, backdrop, industrial production decline july relative april-june quarter, follow decline april-june quarter relative previous one. on hand, domestic demand resilient mainly support reconstruction-related demand. public investment clearly increase business fix investment moderate increase trend improvement corporate profits. private consumption resilient improve employment house investment generally pick up. however, recently somewhat weak indicator private consumption. while partly due weather factor, sluggish pace growth overtime wage mainly manufacture industry due weak production decline summer bonus might contribute constrain consumption income side. while application receive subsidy eco-friendly car end end last week, last minute demand observed. that partly effort car seller end application, include rebate place subsidy release popular fuel-efficient new-models, anticipated, perhaps interpret sign pre-consumption future demand reach limit. a business fix investment, likely continue increase trend, attention pay whether effect global deterioration business sentiment. while domestic demand whole likely maintain firmness, might difficult expect domestic demand 6 bi central bankers’ speech power offset weakness external demand elevate economic activity. a explained, japan’s economy register relatively high growth first half 2012, support firmness domestic demand, pick-up economic activity come pause, reflect development overseas economies. economic activity expect level le time being. on price front, year-on-year rate change consumer price exclude volatile food around 0 percent minus 0.3 percent july early fall crude oil price exert downward pressure. the year-on-year rate change consumer price expect remain around 0 percent time being. regard risks, remain high degree uncertainty global economy, include european debt problem, momentum toward recovery u.s. economy, simultaneous achievement price stability economic growth emerge commodity-exporting economies. furthermore, attention pay effect financial foreign exchange market development economic activity prices. iii. the bank’s conduct monetary policy comprehensive monetary ease base state economy home abroad, let turn bank’s conduct monetary policy. the bank recognize japan’s economy face critical challenge overcome deflation return sustainable growth path price stability, pursue powerful monetary easing. a powerful monetary ease pursue within framework comprehensive monetary easing, let first briefly explain framework. it october 2010 comprehensive monetary ease introduce two year pass since then. the basic reason introduction was, amid policy rate virtually become 0 percent, generate ease effects. the specific framework follows. first, bank encourage policy rate overnight rate uncollateralized call market, namely, interest rate quite short-term one-day borrowing, move around 0 0.1 percent, say virtually 0 percent. second, bank introduce financial asset purchase program name asset purchase program (hereafter refer “the program”) program purchase short-term long-term government security well wide range risk assets, commercial paper (cp), corporate bonds, exchange-traded fund (etfs), japan real estate investment trust (j-reits). that measure, influence longer-term interest rate risk premiums, urge effect monetary ease spread steadily firms’ fund costs. third, bank aim 1 percent term year-on-year growth rate consumer price time make commitment continue powerful monetary ease pursuit virtually zero interest rate policy purchase financial asset judge 1 percent goal sight. by central bank make commitment continue monetary ease long period, momentum push entire yield curve, include long term yields. background enhancement monetary ease at monetary policy meet hold last week, bank enhance monetary easing. specifically, first, bank decide increase total size program 10 trillion yen, 70 trillion yen 80 trillion yen. the completion purchase program extend six month purchase continue around end 2013. second, bank decide remove minimum bid bi central bankers’ speech 7 yield, use set 0.1 percent per annum, outright purchase order ensure smooth purchase japanese government bond (jgbs). look development economic activity price lead decisions, explain earlier, overseas economy move somewhat deep deceleration phase, pick-up economic activity come pause expect level le time being. the year-on-year rate change cpi exclude volatile food hover around 0 percent time being. in meantime, attention pay effect financial foreign exchange market development economic activity prices. until recently, bank judge that, long term perspective, japan’s economy would return moderate recovery path domestic demand remain firm overseas economy gradually emerge deceleration phase. and, year-on-year rate change cpi exclude volatile food would start gradually increase likely reach 1 percent distant future fiscal 2014 onward. however, take account current development economic activity prices, time “overseas economy gradually emerge deceleration phase” time “japan’s economy return moderate recovery path” likely delayed. while extent delay clear amid continue high uncertainty concern china overseas economies, roughly speaking, likely six months. if thing remain were, japan’s economy would verge deviate assume orbit “return moderate growth path price stability.” to avoid that, bank judge necessary strengthen monetary ease time. the aim measure time is, pursue powerful monetary easing, inclusive measure time, bring back outlook economic activity price long run orbit return sustainable growth path price stability. specific enhancement monetary ease a mention earlier, bank decide time increase total size program substantially 10 trillion yen. base recognition current state economic activity prices, bank consider large amount fund would necessary order prevent outlook economic activity price long term deviate orbit return sustainable growth path price stability. while choice increase additional purchase risk assets, current financial condition japan situation risk premium increase due investors’ anxiety risk aversion, bank opt increase purchase short-term long-term government securities. by increase purchase 5 trillion yen each, bank aim influence entire yield curve. japanese firms’ fund structure, unlike unite state proportion long-term corporate bond mortgage loan high, characteristic high proportion bank loan three year less. in particular, bank loan one year le account one-third new loans, also long-term loan variable rates. take account structure corporate finance, effect entire yield curve, financial institutions’ sense security funding, bank consider purchase government security remain maturity three year le balance manner effective spread monetary ease effects. while increase outstanding amount program complete end june 2013, extend complete end december 2013. give economic situation, bank judge necessary beef aforementioned “commitment continue monetary ease long period” extend accumulation period program. 8 bi central bankers’ speech in addition, minimum bid yield purchase jgbs corporate bond set 0.1 percent, bank decide remove it. with bank pursue monetary easing, bid yield jgb issuance well actual market transaction rate three year often fall 0.1 percent. to end, purchase jgbs, aggregate bid fall short bank’s offers, so-called undersubscription, take place. while phenomenon indication monetary ease spread powerfully, order ensure purchase financial assets, bank decide remove minimum bid yield. by combine increase total size program removal minimum bid yield, bank belief effect monetary ease occur powerfully. a current amount outstanding program 60 trillion yen, hereafter, toward schedule amount 80 trillion yen end 2013, bank accelerate purchase schedule accumulate 20 trillion yen financial assets. the bank continue proceed monetary ease continuous manner steadily increase amount outstanding program. accommodative financial condition then transmission channel time’s measure influence economic activity price “ensure return japan’s economy sustainable growth path”? first all, since measure increase amount purchase program enable bank purchase jgbs yield level 0.1 percent lower, add downward pressure market interest rates. that encourage decline financial institutions’ lend rate influence interest rate formation various financial markets, thereby make financial condition surround firm household accommodative. that effect could clearly confirm two years’ experience comprehensive monetary easing. under bank’s powerful monetary easing, japan’s financial condition accommodative. since introduction program, long term market interest rate steadily declining. look yield government securities, manner spread short-term long-term, yield three year already hover extremely low level 0.1 percent. a 5-year yield also decline 0.2 percent. such decline market interest rate encourage decline firms’ fund cost increase sense security funding. accord survey firm cash management financial institutions’ lend stance, diffusion index clearly improve level good average since 2000. issue condition cp corporate bond generally favorable banks’ average contract interest rate new loan discount 1 percent short long terms, historically low level even low period quantitative ease policy first half 2000s. against backdrop, average interest payment firms’ interest bear debt decline around 1.5 percent. that extremely low level compare firms’ return asset (roa) around 3.0–3.5 percent. consequently, firm borrow sufficient amount fund much low interest rate profitability. in way, effect monetary policy exert real economy, say effect monetary ease thoroughly spread term first stage transmission monetary policy financial conditions. what important japan’s economy firm household take advantage accommodative financial condition increase investment spend aggressively. by that, second stage transmission financial condition real economy strengthened. bi central bankers’ speech 9 effort take advantage accommodative financial condition in regard, currently, firm confident future profit environment, necessarily able take full advantage accommodative financial conditions. what become important effort strengthen growth potential. if strengthen growth potential actually proceed growth expectation japan’s economy pick up, outlook firms’ profit increase expect rate return investment increase, lead positive development like firms’ investment. if happens, accommodative financial condition exert effects. once virtuous cycle starts, inflation likely rise improvement aggregate supply demand balance. in effort strengthen growth potential, go without say private economic entity play important role. recently, see increase consumption elderly renewable energy-related investment, move convert challenge japan’s economy face opportunity tap new demand gradually take place. it important grow bud growth nurture large market. in so, role financial institution provide fund necessary firms’ activity, include startups, role government prepare environment facilitate firms’ activity, include promotion deregulation, also important. also bank, viewpoint make utmost contribution central bank do, implant extraordinary “fund-provisioning measure support strengthen foundation economic growth” since june 2010. the measure bank provide long-term fund low interest rate financial institution carry lend investment contribute japan’s economic growth, total amount line credit reach 5.5 trillion yen, inclusive u.s. dollars. while measure extraordinary one, give intrinsic role central bank, reason bank dare bank expect measure play role “catalyst” strengthen growth potential. in addition impact actually provide funds, significance share recognition strengthen growth potential important small all. in fact, since introduction measure, example promote voluntary initiative toward strengthen foundation economic growth, financial institution set dedicate fund regions’ promise businesses. if effort develop and, move take advantage current accommodative financial condition increase, effect monetary ease exerted. while accommodative monetary condition reach state saturation i explain earlier, viewpoint take advantage accommodative financial conditions, strong possibility still remain monetary ease exert great effects. assessment economy time monetary ease a time’s measures, i explain grand view assessment underlie economic activity price aim, specific measures, assume transmission channels, importance strengthen growth potential utilize them. in following, i answer question raise relate measure take time. first, question “why bank decide monetary ease time’s monetary policy meeting.” that originate view “the past assessment economy might optimistic” view “the bank could wait check result tankan survey release begin october conduct full examination outlook report schedule end october.” a assessment economy, recent months, say deceleration phase overseas economy continue occasion 10 bi central bankers’ speech governor’s press conferences, speeches, interviews. against backdrop, confirm extent deceleration recently increase many country regions, mainly manufacture industry, phenomenon clearly spread japan’s export industrial production. the weaker-than-expected development global economy meantime were, show deterioration business sentiment indicators, beyond many people’s expectations, include us. a question case bank make policy response in, i mention various opportunity “when outlook turn weak expect risk associate intensifies, bank hesitate implement additional monetary easing.” the bank, monetary policy meet publish outlook report also every meet decide conduct monetary policy examine baseline scenario outlook economic activity price well risk factor surround base available information. a result examination late meeting, bank judge scenario assume delay weak expected. a long judgment, reason procrastinate policy response. in way, decision time quite orthodox one line basic concept express various opportunities. the enhancement monetary ease decide time, together cumulative effect past measures, ensure return japan’s economy sustainable growth path price stability. then, outlook report schedule release end october, base new indicator development add then, outlook economic activity price well risk factor examine comprehensively. a bank’s decision enhancement monetary ease timing, comments, example, market participant “the bank follow central bank unite state europe.” each country’s central bank strive pursue optimal policy accord country’s economic financial situation, consider take policy action follow another country’s central bank. a long economy interrelate globally, good chance economy country region simultaneously become weak expect and, result, country’s region’s central bank take kind response period. a time’s policy actions, amid sense slowdown global economy become strong widely predicted, appear case major central bank examine situation country region respectively choose response deem appropriate. a policy stance go forward, bank clarify view “[t]he bank continue conduct monetary policy appropriate manner. the bank also utmost ensure stability japan’s financial system, give particular attention development global financial markets.” a case, bank examine outlook economic activity price well risk factors, and, judge necessary, respond decisively flexibly. comparison overseas central bank in relation monetary ease overseas central banks, sometimes receive opinion “the bank pursue bold monetary easing, like federal reserve, purchase asset without set ceiling time limit clarify duration zero interest rate.” in regard, say before, central bank strive choose effective policy measure policy framework base policy challenge financial economic situation country region. while various difference policy conduct bank japan federal reserve, share view utmost central bank achieve respective goal. it might desirable argue central bank bolder, base difference specific monetary ease measures. bi central bankers’ speech 11 to somewhat specific, let point three things. first, relationship policy challenges. the bank, recognition japan’s economy face critical challenge overcome deflation return sustainable growth path price stability, purchase various assets, include risk assets, and, time, venture take extraordinary measure, central bank, support strengthen foundation economic growth. central bank major country choose policy response line challenge central bank face with. second, ceiling time limit. while bank set ceiling time limit program, increase extend time time. what start initially 35 trillion yen total amount complete end 2011 become much large much long ease measure initially planned, total amount 80 trillion yen complete end 2013. regardless whether predefined ceiling time limit, idea strengthen monetary ease judge insufficient achieve policy objective every central bank. third, show duration maintain virtual zero interest rate. the bank, present outlook economic activity price two two half year ahead, clearly make commitment pursue powerful monetary ease measures, include virtually zero interest rate policy purchase financial assets, judge “the price stability goal medium long term” time 1 percent term year-on-year rate change cpi sight. from perspective practical effects, recognize great difference approach federal reserve’s approach, specifically show duration maintain zero interest rate basis outlook economic activity price certain point change duration accordance subsequent change outlook. therefore, seem significant difference basic idea effect policy conduct major central banks, albeit difference specific way conduct. purchase government bond confidence currency finally, relation bank’s decision increase purchase jgbs, sometimes receive concern “the bank’s massive purchase government bond fiscal monetization central bank eventually confidence currency maintained.” let touch point. at present, bank purchase jgbs accord two different objectives. one purchase jgbs correspond trend increase demand banknote associate economic growth. in case, long purchase correspond trend increase demand banknotes, rational hold short-term asset long-term government bonds. and light thrust purchase, outstanding amount banknote issue set ceiling jgb purchases. the purchase jgbs program, i repeatedly mention today. a purchase decide base monetary policy judgment influence longer-term interest rate rates, condition total size purchase keep within amount banknote issued. the outstanding amount jgbs hold bank increase 66 trillion yen end 2011 84 trillion yen present, come exceed outstanding amount banknote issued. that due increase jgb purchase program pursue powerful monetary easing. a expect outstanding amount jgbs hold bank increase 92 trillion yen end 2012, increase 26 trillion yen one year. give year’s issuance special deficit-financing bond 38 trillion yen, say that, bank’s purchase jgbs already reach substantial size. 12 bi central bankers’ speech if chance massive purchase jgbs interpreted, apart necessity monetary policy conduct, aim fiscal monetization, confidence bank could erode considerably long-term interest rate could rise substantially. that affect significantly government issue jgbs financial institution hold jgbs, thereby could impair stability financial system real economy. in order avoid things, bank consider important firmly convey idea market bank carry fiscal monetization. in addition, market always check bank’s actions, bank continue disclose state purchase program transparent manner. conclude remark i spend quite time talk current state outlook global economy japan’s economy, bank’s conduct monetary policy base them. in conclusion, let briefly touch prospect asian economy japan’s economy. japan’s economy face structural challenge decline growth potential due rapid age long struggle overcome it. a mention earlier, recently increase move seize opportunity tap new demand. such move factor underpin relatively resilient domestic demand. if move continue japan, significant mean asian economy whole future. that age problem asian country also face distant future. a income level asian emerge economy rise, potential market size business elderly chance expand dramatically. to utilize fruit effort tap demand elderly accumulate japan result face challenge ahead countries, namely, utilize wisdom maintain improve vitality economy even age asian market raise growth potential japan also enhance economic social sustainability asian country lead benefit asian economy whole. those limit problem aging. i recognize become increasingly important perspective japan’s effort overcome various challenge lead global benefits. bi central bankers’ speech 1 jens weidmann: money creation responsibility speech dr jens weidmann, president deutsche bundesbank, 18th colloquium institute bank-historical research (ibf), frankfurt, 18 september 2012. * * * 1. welcome dear dr reckers prof hüttl prof binswanger lady gentleman i delight able welcome today deutsche bundesbank’s regional office hessen. the high number participant show institute bank-historical research find attractive topic colloquium. the caption today’s event “paper money – public finance – inflation. do goethe hit upon core problem monetary policy?” i could answer question pose title clear yes. indeed, goethe already analyse core problem today’s monetary policy base paper money around 180 year ago, record literature inimitable fashion. i would like keep thing short, order justice occasion topic i want leave simple yes, elaborate issue today’s colloquium. 2. money money creation i wish begin question appear trivial first glance which, experience shown, particularly difficult. what money exactly? a succinct response economist would be: money money does. a money define functions, various instrument fundamentally capable act money, long use medium exchange, medium payment store value. shell previously use money countries, example, furs, salt pearls. livestock could also serve money – latin word cattle “pecus” word “pecunia”, mean money, derived. concrete object serve money human history; may therefore speak commodity money. a great deal trust place particular precious rare metal – gold first foremost – due assume intrinsic value. in function medium exchange, medium payment store value, gold thus, sense, timeless classic.” to gold tend, gold depend, things!”, say margaret first part goethe’s faust. however, money carry around form banknote coin long anything commodity money. money long link gold reserve since u dollar remove gold standard 1971. 2 bi central bankers’ speech in short: today’s money long back real assets. banknote print paper – expert amongst know euro print paper make cotton – coin mint metal. that banknote coin accept medium payment daily life also fact legal tender. however, ultimately acceptance banknote base public confidence use paper money make purchases. in sense, money social convention – intrinsic value come use; instead, value create constant exchange use money. by way, recognition trust central, even constitutive, property money old; already discuss 4th century bc aristotle politics nicomachean ethics. in recent times, particular, many citizen ask origin money: central bank actually acquire huge amount money need give billion loan bank system part monetary policy operation make purchases? why often repeat context central bank virtually unlimited firepower? central bank create money grant commercial bank credit collateral buy asset bonds. the financial power central bank unlimited principle; acquire beforehand money lend us payments, basically create thin air. the print money appropriate image here; economic perspective, print press necessary, creation money primarily show central bank’s balance sheet, accounts. how johann wolfgang von goethe enter equation talk creation money. why i widen discussion further? 3. money creation, goethe, faust alchemy let remind briefly “money creation” scene act one second part faust. mephistopheles, disguise fool, talk emperor, severe financial distress, say “in world, isn’t lacking, somewhere, though? sometimes it’s this, that: here’s what’s missing’s gold”the emperor finally respond mephistopheles’ subtle attempt persuade him, “i’m tire eternal ‘if when’: we’re short gold, well fine, fetch then” to mephistopheles reply “i’ll fetch wish, i’ll fetch more” in commotion nocturnal masquerade ball, persuade emperor sign document – document mephistopheles reproduce night distribute paper money. those involve quite take initial success measure. the chancellor delight announce “see hear scroll, heavy destiny, – (referring paper money created) – that’s change happiness misery” he reads, “to concerns, may know, this paper’s worth thousand crown so” bi central bankers’ speech 3 a little later, mephistopheles stir general elation even say “such paper’s convenient, rather lot of gold silver, know you’ve got. you’ve need barter exchanging, just drown need wine love-making.” those concern overjoy apparent bless even suspect thing could get hand. in second part faust, state get rid debt begin with. at time, private consumer demand rise sharply, fuel upswing. in due course, however, activity degenerate inflation, destroy monetary system money rapidly lose value. it strike goethe throw light way potentially hazardous connection paper money creation, public finance inflation – thus one core problem uncover monetary systems. this remarkable give faust goethe generally immediately associate economics, especially central area conflict monetary policy priorities. the fact faust indeed interpret economic term demonstrated, least, professor adolf hüttl, use vice-president former land central bank hesse. i delight attendance today. back 1965, write insightful article bundesbank’s staff magazine “money second part goethe’s faust”. in mid-1980s, teach sankt gallen, professor han christoph binswanger – i please say also today – take similar line bring book entitle “money magic: critique modern economy light goethe’s faust”. binswanger’s thesis goethe portray modern economy creation paper money continuation alchemy means. while traditional alchemist attempt turn lead gold, modern economy, paper make money. indeed, fact central bank create money thin air, speak, something many observer likely find surprise strange, perhaps mystical dreamlike, – even nightmarish. 4. the responsibility independent central bank if central bank potentially create unlimited amount money thin air, ensure money remain sufficiently scarce preserve value? doe ability create money le create temptation take advantage instrument create additional leeway short term, even risk highly probable long-term damage? yes, temptation certainly exist, many monetary history succumb it. take look back time, often reason establish central bank: provide power free access seemingly unlimited financial resources. however, government interference central banking, combine government’s large demand funding, often lead strong expansion volume money circulation, cause lose value inflation. in light experience, central bank subsequently establish independent institutions, mandate safeguard value money, order explicitly keep government co-opting monetary policy. 4 bi central bankers’ speech the independence central bank extraordinary privilege – is, however, end itself. instead, primary purpose use credibility ensure monetary policy focus unhindered preserve value money. independent monetary policy combine policymakers well-functioning, stability-oriented compass necessary – sufficient – condition preserve purchase power money well public confidence it. of course, important central bankers, charge public good – case, stable money – bolster public confidence explain policies. the best protection temptation monetary policy enlighten stability-oriented society. 5. conclusion i end overview goethe, faust paper money here. you probably notice build reflects, many respects, connection frankfurt, goethe, money faust, particular sculpture paintings. this type architectural art primarily idea initiative professor hüttl. on note, i would like turn speakers, speak topic today’s colloquium detail. i sure combination goethe money many additional interest insight store afternoon. thank attention, i hope find event enjoyable stimulating. bi central bankers’ speech 1 øystein olsen: monetary policy turbulent time address mr øystein olsen, governor norge bank (central bank norway), centre monetary economics (cme)/bi norwegian school management, oslo, 20 september 2012. * * * please note text may differ slightly actual presentation. central bank world conduct monetary policy must undoubtedly call turbulent times. my address today focus new tool monetary policy deploy internationally response development norway. the economic situation norway quite different surround country able operate within establish monetary policy framework. chart: gdp growth growth global economy weak since 2008 financial crisis affect country severely others. country large imbalance crisis begin face formidable challenges. the imbalance self-reinforcing. high price risk result increase yield government bond country high level debt. fragile government finance become even weaker. a decrease value government bond also generate uncertainty concern position banks. bank consolidate balance sheet curtail lend firm households, amplify decrease economic activity. heavily indebted country work make bank robust strengthen government finances. cost competitiveness must restored. the road doubt long arduous. chart: yield 10-year government bond but situation across country differ considerably reflect wide yield spreads. investor demand substantial premium invest le safe assets. capital seek safe havens, even though real return presumably risk-free investment low negative. wide yield spread may persist period – take time country restore competitiveness build strong balances, particularly growth also weak regions. substantial economic imbalance japan u also need redressed. turbulence bad time europe dampen activity country emerge economies. this situation lead emergence new form monetary policy many part world. interest rate low – close zero – long period. the federal reserve indicate federal fund rate likely exceptionally low least mid-2015. in event, u key rate close zero almost seven years. a key rate cannot low further, several central bank decide apply methods. the method fall two main types: the first method relate communication. statement concern future central bank key rate employ new monetary policy tool. here norge bank, application method new – interest rate forecast publish bank since 2005. the aim influence interest rate expectation thereby contribute achieve objective monetary policy.1 the federal reserve publish board 1 see speech janet l. yellen, 25 february 2011: “unconventional monetary policy central bank communications”, http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/yellen20110225a.htm. 2 bi central bankers’ speech members’ expectation first key rate increase take place since january 2012.2 the second method know quantitative easing, balance sheet policy, consist measure change composition size central bank balance sheets. this use balance sheet differ usual monetary policy operation instrument key rate use influence market rate economic activity. traditional monetary policy operate commercial bank system: influence economy bank let interest rate condition central bank pas customers. moreover, liquidity management use keep short-term rate close key rate. in country key rate close zero, instrument exhausted. at time, effect key rate may weak normal many bank consolidate reluctant engage lending. use balance sheet policy, central bank seek influence longer-term interest rate thereby fund cost direct manner.3 purchase government private sector bond intend depress yield push security price – so-called portfolio effect.4 study past three four year indicate portfolio effect operation u uk market – bond price increase long-term yield fall result quantitative easing.5 the aim achieve low long-term yield order boost lend investment. in addition portfolio effect, new use balance sheet signal effect: central bank engage large-scale purchase security pull long-term yield send signal key rate may keep low long period. in sense, balance sheet policy also contribute anchor expectation support monetary policy communication. it easy say situation would without measures. however, likely central bank bond purchase curb decline output uk us. chart: central bank balance sheets, stylise these measures, nature, impact central bank balance sheet – term size composition. 2 see federal reserve’s “monetary policy report congress”, february 2012, http://

expansion balance sheet. the chart show wide swing central bank balance sheet since 2008 financial crisis. expansion central bank balance sheet particularly rapid uk, u switzerland somewhat moderate euro area. a i mention earlier, purpose balance sheet policy stimulate economy low interest rate fund cost situation key rate close zero. central bank emphasise positive effect balance sheet policy uncertain – effect must weigh possible problems.6 there four factor highlight here: first, may difficult central bank exit market build large bond holdings, would require considerable portfolio adjustment households, firm banks. postpone reversal measure could generate expectation interest rate remain low long period economy recovered. this could turn generate expectation high inflation ahead. indeed, connection inflation money supply constitute second challenge. when central bank purchase security provide longer-term loan banks, monetary base, i.e. banks’ deposit central bank, increases. there direct relationship monetary base inflation. the risk inflation arise growth monetary base coincide increase broad monetary aggregate high customer deposit banks. for broad monetary aggregate 6 see example speech federal reserve chairman ben bernanke: “monetary policy since onset crisis”, federal reserve bank kansa city economic symposium, jackson hole, wyoming, 31 august 2012.

bank must increase lend purchase security enterprise outside bank sector. since crisis 2008, monetary base europe u grow considerably rapidly broad monetary aggregates. the risk high inflation situation view context central bank exit strategies. in future, central bank want reverse extraordinary measure result substantial growth monetary base. this normally do crisis economy recovering. third, large sum money involve may also affect exchange rates. even central bank intervene exchange market directly, measure may short term reduce value currency issue central bank. this will, isolation, strengthen exchange rate country initially le severely hit crisis. small, open economy vulnerable large capital movement powerful instrument deploy large countries. a possible side-effect balance sheet policy private sector also take long strengthen equity capital reduce risk would otherwise done. with low price capital, cost little postpone restructure put debt repayment. finally, confidence economic policy may affected. the divide line monetary fiscal policy seem blurred. balance sheet policy may dampen effect market volatility interest rate give heavily indebted country breathe space time adjust. on hand, measure may also reduce incentive carry necessary fiscal tightening. in euro area, different consideration balance new “outright monetary transactions” (omt) programme. under programme, european central bank (ecb) may purchase bond country enter loan agreement european financial stability facility (efsf) european stability mechanism (esm) – turn conditional commitment fiscal tightening. chart: corporate borrow rate one reason ecb’s decision establish omt programme partial breakdown monetary policy transmission mechanism euro area economy. there wide difference interest rate face bank firm across europe. although key rate apply euro area countries, average corporate borrow rate differ widely country country. some variation due difference credit risk across country owe different economic situations. additional risk premium may reflect fear one country might point replace euro new local currency. ecb president mario draghi refer convertibility risk premiums. one objective omt programme reduce premium restore proper transmission monetary policy. the omt programme regard answer sign financial market fragmentation euro area. difference financial condition across country become considerable willingness provide loan across national border declined. the picture reflect so-called target2 balances. target2 central interbank settlement system euro area. in countries, interbank payment settlement carry national central bank. one bank’s payment another settle adjust two banks’ deposit central bank. central bank reserve mean interbank payment. in euro area, interbank payment settlement take place two stages: bank settlement account national central bank, country’s central bank has, turn, account ecb. if, example, deposit transfer greek bank german bank, greek bank’s deposit greek central bank reduced, german bank’s deposit bundesbank increase amount. the greek central bank’s debt ecb increase turn, bundesbank’s claim ecb bi central bankers’ speech 5 increase accordingly. such change claim liability express target2 balances. chart: target2 balance in well function market, bank drain central bank reserve would borrow replace interbank market, balance transfer describe above. imbalance target2 symptom interbank market function efficiently country euro area. if bank north long will lend bank south, southern bank must meet need reserve borrow directly central bank. the northern bank increase reserve central bank accordingly. in addition increase claim target2 system, inflate eurosystem balance sheet. the central bank hub system require receive deposit area bank surplus reserve extend loan area bank whole need funding. imbalance country target2 system give indication bear loss bank default value collateral post sufficient. any loss allocate among participate national central bank accord relative share ecb’s paid-up capital. to sum international picture: past year, growth prospect low large advance regions. in europe, activity likely decline year owe debt problem fiscal tightening. unemployment rise. fiscal monetary policy space limited, virtually exhausted. many country must tighten fiscal policy reduce debt sustainable level. central bank respond communicate interest rate hold low extend period. and stretch limit monetary policy counteract deep persistent downturn. chart: gdp growth the economic situation external surround environment stand contrast norway. domestic activity particularly high oil industry construction sector, employment supply labour increase. unemployment remain low stable. public finance healthy. norway’s term trade favourable, high export price low import prices. at time, house price household debt still rising. nonetheless, norwegian economy unaffected turbulence abroad. development europe strong krone exchange rate adversely affect norwegian export industries, paper, metal, furniture industries. while country use nontraditional instruments, manage come use main instrument – key policy rate – 1.5 per cent. it low inflation low adverse condition abroad curb growth number industry sector norway. very low interest rate abroad high risk premium money capital market underpin picture. norge bank’s conduct monetary policy gear towards low stable inflation. the operational target monetary policy consumer price inflation close 2.5 per cent time. at time, monetary policy shall contribute stabilise output employment. we also give weight risk low interest rate may time lead excessive risk-taking debt accumulation household business sector. such imbalance give rise negative ripple effect ahead, considerable impact output employment. chart: criterion appropriate interest rate path loss function in norge bank’s march 2012 monetary policy report, bank clarify various consideration express norge bank’s response pattern. adjustment make criterion appropriate interest rate path. in bank’s system analysis, criterion express loss function monetary policy. 6 bi central bankers’ speech criterion 1, state inflation target reached, cover first segment, loss high actual inflation πt deviate target π*. criterion 2, state give inflation developments, loss lt increase fluctuation economic activity, cover first second segments. criterion 3, state monetary policy shall robust, cover second, third fourth segments. the adjustment make march express slightly increase weight give output gap, , financial imbalance often build period high capacity utilisation. at time, weight give avoid substantial deviation interest rate normal level. this consideration express final segment loss function. this help mitigate risk buildup financial imbalances, even period capacity utilisation particularly high. chart: key policy rate normally, key policy rate cannot achieve several objective simultaneously. in case conflict objectives, choice interest rate path involve trade-off different considerations. if monetary policy take account low level inflation, key policy rate would rapidly reduce keep close zero good while. inflation might pick faster, partly result weak krone. in light trade-off considerations, however, bank want accelerate pace inflation. the result would pronounce impact output employment. a prolong period even low interest rate would increase risk debt asset price drive level unsustainable time. we thus obtain smooth interest rate path also give weight two criteria. the criterion loss function reflect bank’s reaction pattern period follow financial crisis. we respond new insight lesson learned. the loss function mathematical illustration must regard simplify representation extensive assessment underlie interest rate decisions. interest rate set base executive board’s assessment, model calculation. mathematics model can, however, clarify alternatives. there considerable uncertainty effect low interest rate extend period risk-taking behaviour buildup financial imbalances.7 in regard, quite uncharted waters. how financial imbalance build explicitly consider analytical apparatus. work progress norway internationally develop economic model use monetary policy analysis. a gain new insight gather experience, assessment economic relationship may change. this also influence formulation models. 7 monetary policy report 1/12, box page 15–16,

interest burden in norway, house price household debt reach historically high levels. the rapid growth income primary drive force. the high household debt burden norway represent risk financial instability long term. household source direct indirect loss banks. banks’ loan loss depend households’ capacity pay interest principal, value underlie collateral, primarily form dwell norway. bank also expose economic repercussion effect may occur event fall household consumption. in short run, risk disturbance probably small interest rate low vast majority household job income security. chart: household financial wealth debt burden household save high recent years, household high debt low financial wealth. in 2009, ten percent financial asset hold household high debt burden – say debt five

amplify high population growth. despite rise house construction, number house completion remain low relation population growth. the house deficit grow several year push house prices. the house shortage require measure real economy – case, increase house construction. monetary policy cannot aim redress real economic imbalances. low interest rate time increase risk drive debt level asset prices, bring level unsustainable time. this important lesson financial crisis. we take account set key policy rate, make clear recent formulation loss function. at time, – one instrument available u – key policy rate – limit many task assign monetary policy. in order counter financial imbalances, instrument addition available monetary policy must come play. macroprudential regulation financial industry play great role year ahead. the overall risk financial system great sum risk represent individual bank. which macroprudential instrument would suitable currently discuss detail various international forum central banks. one instrument introduce countercyclical capital buff banks. the purpose buff reduce procyclicality bank lending. when bank require hold capital period high credit growth, robust large loan losses. in addition, increase capital requirement could restrain credit growth. the ministry finance override responsibility regulate financial industry, norge bank give primary responsibility elaborate basis establishment countercyclical capital buffer. with buff ceiling 2.5 percent banks’ risk-weighted assets, buff probably limit downward impact banks’ lend enthusiasm good times. but bank solid capital reserve take large loss limit lend creditworthy customers. the countercyclical buff come top new, comprehensive regulatory framework. equity capital requirement tightened. bank face strict maturity requirement funding, limit share short-term funding. they require hold liquid assets. all all, new regulatory regime contribute robust financial system reduce fluctuation credit growth. 8 bi central bankers’ speech the turbulence europe, start problem greece, prevail close two half years. financial market sentiment banks’ access fund vary widely

bank, institut d’études politiques, paris, 20 september 2012. * * * lady gentlemen,1 it great pleasure speak today science po paris. 9 august year fifth anniversary start financial crisis. the past year time hardship, financial turbulence risks. at time, crisis expose weakness framework economic monetary union provide impetus strengthen foundation begin process bring euro area country back sustainable fiscal macroeconomic path. the crisis also bring challenge opportunity monetary policy, go focus remark today. let elaborate two them. the first challenge i describe lehman’s collapse central bank combat exceptional threat price stability arise financial instability recessionary forces. at time standard tool monetary policy – change short-term interest rate – lose traction due dislocation financial system. central bank quickly learn situation require switch normal operate mode, base simply set short-term interest rates, crisis mode, aim sidestep obstacle standard channel monetary policy transmission. this experience give u opportunity deepen understand monetary policy and, particular, reject textbook dichotomy either central bank able rely “interest rate channel” transmission intentions, else economy condemn last instability. it clear additional channel conduit available. the second challenge i want discus sovereign debt crisis associate fragmentation credit market across national borders. start 2010, financial crisis begin unfold euro area turn debt crisis sovereign issuers. this quickly spill across market countries. and recently, exacerbate investors’ fear reversibility euro. the challenge face monetary policy environment enormous test ability ecb act central bank single monetary area 17 fiscal jurisdictions. it increasingly challenge preserve singleness monetary policy ensure proper transmission policy stance real economy throughout currency area. to address situation, ecb take number non-standard measures, two week ago announce modality undertake outright monetary transaction secondary market sovereign bond euro area. i describe rationale decision argue key element ensure last “monetary dominance” euro area, compliant treaties. channel monetary policy normal time crisis time in normal times, monetary policy work primarily inter-temporal financial arbitrage. in eurosystem, arbitrage cover two different time dimensions. there weekly arbitrage cycle, volume central bank liquidity reallocate across 1 i would like thank roberto motto, stefano nardelli, massimo rostagno contribution speech. i remain solely responsible opinion express herein. 2 bi central bankers’ speech bank trade money market period two consecutive weekly eurosystem main refinance operation (mros). the reason reallocation – matter routine, least – eurosystem provide reserve weekly intervals. while bank sector’s need reserve aggregate may change significantly within week, cash need individual bank fluctuate high frequencies, probably daily.2 so bank liquidity deficit infra-weekly period need borrow bank liquidity surpluses. the price trade liquid reserve bank occur, i.e. overnight interest rate (of euro area average, eonia, compute publish every day ecb), influence expectation cost eurosystem credit – so-called mro rate – next weekly monetary policy operation. a short-term inter-temporal arbitrage calculus anchor overnight interest rate apply credit transaction bank need liquidity bank liquidity surplus.3 the second dimension inter-temporal calculus long horizon wide scope application across asset classes. bank borrow short money market eurosystem decide engage term lend bank customers. bank customers, turn, use bank liquidity finance consumption acquisition capital. it important note money transaction broad economy involve trader weigh cost borrow return opportunity asset acquisition different point time, horizon typically long week. but, again, bank borrow eurosystem source liquidity propagation pattern, banks’ financial calculus base anticipation interest rate set eurosystem future, anticipation anchor price credit broad economy. we call “the interest rate channel” monetary policy decisions. in normal times, risk factor contain diversify away, interest rate channel, work inter-temporal arbitrage, prime conduit monetary policy (see slide 2). it set floor term borrow costs. parse longer-term yield two component – average level short-term policy interest rate expect term maturity asset, risk premia – expectation monetary policy pin first component. the mechanism occur inter-temporal financial arbitrage i described. term liquidity premia additional return investor demand compensation reluctance bear interest rate risk long-duration assets, decision forgo liquidity service – i abstract credit risk, i return later. when market properly functioning, non-depository institution – dealers, hedge funds, investment bank – provide immediacy offer lender borrower capacity take position side market. their ready availability take position lender borrower support market liquidity, namely ease lender liquidate position maturity. when market liquidity secure, lender will engage finance, trade long-duration asset active liquidity premia contained. and, importantly, steady. with steady premium, expectation 2 there two reason idiosyncratic fluctuation reserve demand individual banks. the first reason associate cash withdrawal cash deposit customer bank transfer payment intermediate eurosystem – function clear institution important interbank payment system euro area. the reason bank participate eurosystem liquidity-providing operations, prefer cover need reserve primarily interbank market. for example, normal times, 1,700 bank eligible eurosystem monetary policy operations, le 500 use participate liquidity allotments. 3 in eurosystem environment, short-term inter-temporal calculus find another anchor: need bank fulfil reserve requirement monthly maintenance period. in normal times, accomplish smoothly throughout monthly period, via inter-temporal substitution liquidity balance individual bank. bi central bankers’ speech 3 short-term rate become drive factor price long-dated securities, monetary policy acquire potent handle economy. in august 2007, sudden re-pricing u sub-prime mortgage market change world. the close predictable relationship expect path policy rate market rate break liquidity premia widen become volatile. the elevation market premia especially pronounce spread three-month euribor expect three-month path overnight rate (see slide 3). bank recognise substantial counterparty risk lend other, give interbank lend generally unsecured. but, even collateral taken, ability liquidate reasonable price severely impair environment widespread fear uncertainty. bank position interbank market highly persistent. large diversify bank tend borrower smaller, regional bank lenders. when financial turmoil erupted, persistent borrower endure sharp sustain jump fund cost many access market all. when lehman brother finally file bankruptcy mid-september 2008, widespread financial panic break out. the paralysis transaction spread beyond money markets, le confine year. outside money market, dealer play critical role guarantee market liquidity. but order able take position side market, need finance security position via collateralised funding. for that, need capital, use pay margin require lend securities. when confidence evaporates, margin increase dealers’ capital eroded, ability trade buyer restricted. market lose critical actor, asset become le liquid, value asset decline further. have taste forbid fruit excess risk-taking, financial institution cast paradise seamless financial markets. in financial crisis proportions, “outside money” – asset liability anybody else central bank – become sole trustworthy store value.4 only central bank, monopoly provider outside money, respond scramble liquidity. the ecb inject fund capacity market vacuum leave wide open bank retrenchment, dealer default investor panic. in conditions, inter-temporal financial arbitrage – type i describe – become impaired. the power bank dealer engage finance inter-temporal trade liquidity balance degraded. so main conduit monetary policy – depend trade – lost. the ecb open new channel, “liquidity channel”, get round roadblock face interest rate channel (see slide 4). more precisely, ecb act two dimensions. it seek alleviate difficulty experience bank get liquidity interbank market, put pressure asset side banks’ balance sheet increase risk hind credit supply. at time, seek restore normal pass-through short-term money market (lending) rate market bank interest rates. a far impairment banks’ fund concerned, ecb address banks’ fund uncertainty fully accommodate liquidity need fix interest rate (the ecb main refinance rate), simultaneously lengthen maturity refinance operations: three six month twelve months, recently two operation three-year maturity. this allow alleviation fund constraint bank system. in way, substantial change term structure liquidity take place. while crisis three-quarters outstanding liquidity maturity one 4 see holmström, b. tirole, j., (2011), inside outside liquidity, mit press. 4 bi central bankers’ speech week rest three month (i.e. average maturity 15–20 days), current average maturity 28 month (see slide 5). the expansion ecb collateralised monetary policy operations, together widespread collateralisation financial transactions, raise fear encumbrance bank assets. this risk materialise list eligible collateral expand enable bank take full advantage ecb full-allotment policy, rigorously apply risk control measure mitigate liquidity, market credit risk. but high haircut erode refinance power encumber assets, must asymptotic limit ability central bank provide outside money without endanger creditworthiness, confidence currency rests. the notion central bank unlimited capacity create money illusion thus cannot use excuse reform economy. overall, policy measure take several front able stem risk credit flow fallout relate adverse implication price stability. in particular, role bank credit finance private sector preserved, support increase recourse debt market especially large firm (see slide 6). the sovereign debt crisis fragmentation credit market across national border my discussion far focus term liquidity premia, take centre stage since begin financial crisis. start may 2010, crisis mark new phenomenon, little know euro area: emergence large variable credit risk premia price supposedly risk-free security issue euro area governments. this lead question creditworthiness sovereign issuer fully-fledged sovereign debt crisis. this new phase crisis take several dimensions. the first noticeable one large sell-off government debt issue sovereign precarious fiscal position (see slide 7). market increase scrutiny fiscal structural condition member state (the “fundamentals”) assess increase degree risk aversion. at times, market also overreact national news political debate euro area level, yield subsequently display little mean reversion. fragmentation credit market across national border the second dimension debt crisis fragmentation credit market across national borders, affect bank private non-financial sector – addition fragmentation experience government debt markets. the tight link sovereign bank creditworthiness clearly visible high degree correlation sovereign cd premia bank cd premia within jurisdiction (see slide 8). causality run ways: banks’ rise fund cost reflect risk associate banks’ hold bond issue sovereign; sovereign risk exacerbate contingent liability come perception government intervene rescue domestic financial system. this create self-reinforcing loop bank sovereign risks, doubt solvency sovereign feed doubt solvency banks, vice versa. such dynamic much weak euro area country consider market financially solid. in u – example well-integrated fiscal financial union, shock-absorbing capacity federal level, credible discipline state level centralise mechanism supervise resolve bank – correlation bank sovereign cd premia. with hindsight, “original sins” economic monetary union, otherwise carefully thought-through consistent project, weak fiscal institutions, tolerance economic imbalance lack integrate mechanism supervise resolve banks. a matter fact, financial fragmentation lead “two-gear” monetary union, marginal cost borrow bank vary accord jurisdiction. bi central bankers’ speech 5 1. bank belong jurisdiction consider market financially sound generally access interbank money market get overnight finance eonia rate, currently low 0.10%. 2. bank jurisdiction risk uncertainty elevate generally limit access interbank money market rely large extent central bank liquidity, charge mro rate, currently 0.75%. the distress fund condition face bank part euro area, compound expectation worsen macroeconomic outlook, turn result fragment credit condition household firms, along national borders. for one thing, credit supply standard apply bank lend real economy diverge across euro area countries. a similar message come cross-country comparison bank lend rates. the 75 basis point cut ecb main policy rate implement late 2011 accompany little reaction even increase lend rate country stress, whereas complete pass-through euro area country consider market financially solid (see slide 9). self-fulfilling equilibrium drive break-up fear the third, recent, dimension debt crisis take form investor fear break-up currency union. whereas exchange rate risk across euro area country disappear permanently creation single currency 1999, signs, especially summer, investor start price redenomination risk. investor require compensation risk euro might remain irreversible currency euro area – least current composition. although difficult disentangle redenomination premia source risk – require econometric analysis – inversion slope term structure sovereign bond spreads5 observe early summer 2012, instance, spain italy consistent expectation imminent break-up risks. market fear high probability pay back full, equivalently repay different, lower-valued currency, command high spreads. if probability event concentrate short horizon, cumulative default probability long horizon (bounded overall 100%) cannot rise much further, inversion spread curve necessarily follows. redenomination premia share similarity exchange rate premia drive control early 1990s speculative attack legacy currencies. the early symptom – invert sovereign yield curves, least contries – same. and potential attack know generate self-fulfilling prophecies. in early summer 2012 situation two main implications. one fiscal policy: need deliver sound fundamental way lastingly overcome crisis; but, time, viable fiscal adjustment ensure sustainability interest rate face fiscal authority keep rise severe distortion government bond markets. the second implication monetary policy: central bank cannot fulfil mandate maintain price stability policy intention transmit correctly real economy chain form basis monetary policy transmission; but, time, central bank cannot fulfil mandate maintain price stability fiscal authority fully honour obligation pay back liability circumstances. 5 to remove influence market expectation future policy rates, useful focus term structure term spread sovereign bond yield give euro area country benchmark yield – represent ois curve term structure german bunds. 6 bi central bankers’ speech how make apparently conflict instance compatible? and overcome deadlock? the ecb policy response: outright monetary transaction guidance answer question derive maastricht treaty conceptual apparatus develop context economic literature monetary vs. fiscal dominance. these insight make clear that, institutional design perspective, central bank independence clear focus price stability6 necessary sufficient ensure central bank provide regime low stable inflation circumstance – economic jargon, ensure “monetary dominance”. maintain price stability also require appropriate fiscal policy. to borrow leeper’s terminology,7 mean “active” monetary policy – namely monetary policy actively engage set policy interest rate instrument independently exclusive pursuit objective price stability – must accompany “passive” fiscal policy. a passive fiscal policy mean fiscal authority must ready will adjust policy stance (revenues primary spending) way stabilise debt level interest rate central bank may choose. or, put another way, borrow woodford’s terminology,8 fiscal policy need “ricardian”.9 although treaty show awareness need consistency monetary fiscal policy, sense describe above, ensure last stability, foresee fiscal policy could go track extent require dedicate institution policy able provide financial assistance, conditionality, order restore sustainability preserve financial stability euro area. the creation efsf/esm charge provide support euro area member state difficulty enforce appropriate conditionality fill gap. it provide euro area mean restore “ricardianess”, thereby minimise risk “fiscal dominance”. against background, easy understand ecb’s decision 6 september undertake outright monetary transaction (omts) secondary market sovereign bond euro area, understand specific framework within implemented. the aim omts preserve singleness monetary policy ensure proper transmission monetary policy stance real economy throughout euro area. omts intend provide ecb tool address severe distortion government bond market originate from, particular, unfounded fear part investor reversibility euro. effectively, omts represent mean rule destructive self-fulfilling prophecy would force economy sub-optimal equilibrium (with elevate interest rates, adjustment make impossible, ultimately lead default currency redenomination).10 meanwhile, omts preserve incentive government enforce economic fiscal adjustment prove 6 on importance central bank independence credibility mean address possible inconsistency monetary fiscal policy, see, t. sargent n. wallace (1981), “some unpleasant monetarist arithmetic”, quarterly review, federal reserve bank minneapolis, fall. 7 see, e. leeper (1991), “equilibria ‘active’ ‘passive’ monetary fiscal policies”, journal monetary economics 27, 129–147. 8 see, m. woodford (2001), “fiscal requirement price stability”, nber work paper no. 8072. 9 “ricardian equivalence” imply forward-looking agent internalise fact government budget always adjust neutralise fiscal disturbances. however, “ricardian” fiscal policy property. 10 o. jeanne show elevate yield could make inflation more, rather le likely, due lack fiscal adjustment. see o. jeanne, (2012), “fiscal challenge monetary dominance euro area: a theoretical perspective”, banque de france financial stability review, no. 16, pp. 143–150. bi central bankers’ speech 7 necessary steer economy towards “good” equilibrium. a consequence, omts succeed action take governments, national euro area level, restore long-term growth bridge fiscal economic imbalances. the framework omts base six main element (see slide 10). first, strict effective conditionality. a necessary condition initiate omts member state activate appropriate efsf/esm programme, envisage strict effective conditionality span fiscal, macroeconomic, structural financial spheres. and design conditionality monitor programme largely benefit involvement imf. this however sufficient. the country also need maintain (at least some) market access. and signal reference ecb make need efsf/esm programme include possibility primary market purchases. in addition, importantly, govern council maintain full discretion initiate omts, focus assessment exclusively monetary policy considerations. the second main element framework omts base built-in exit strategy. omts terminate one follow condition materialises. omts long warrant due threat price stability; aim omts achieved; non-compliance conditionality establish efsf/esm programme. this announce rules-based approach represent way address time inconsistency. third, omts focus short part yield curve, particular sovereign bond maturity one three years. this underscore monetary policy nature outright transactions, principle foresee ecb statute. and buttress omts’ aim address reversibility premia which, i argue above, tend manifest short end term structure, address fact credit risk embed longer-term yield reflect credibility countries’ economic financial adjustment programmes. fourth, ex ante quantitative limit size omts. this make clear ecb commit whatever takes, within mandate, preserve solidity irreversibility currency. fifth, ecb accept (pari passu) treatment private creditor respect bond purchase context omts. finally, liquidity create omts fully sterilised. this reflect role omts counteract destructive self-fulfilling equilibrium rather alter aggregate liquidity stance. the main feature framework omts outline address design also three concern question sometimes voice relation outright purchase government bond central bank. the first concern sum two questions: omts form monetary finance government inflation unleashed? the answer question is: no. in fact, quite opposite. omts conducive monetary authority restore power control credit condition euro area and, channel, inflation medium term. it thus create condition transition regime undisciplined fiscal policy – “non-ricardian” “active” fiscal policy, use terminology economic literature refer – regime fiscal policy respect inter-temporal obligation – become “ricardian”, “passive”. this mean monetary policy regain pre-eminence determine credit condition inflation. this renew assignment task push back fiscal dominance affirm monetary dominance. the second concern formulate term question: omts bring large risk central bank’s balance sheet? the answer is: no. omts establish second type interaction: central bank, real money investor household firms, 8 bi central bankers’ speech save borrow finance real economic activity. to extent break-up reversibility premia squeeze bond pricing, real money investor return euro area security market, price security good reflect fundamentals. household firm benefit restore credit conditions. and associate widespread reassessment risk make market portfolio central bank portfolio grow value. ultimately, strict effective conditionality could see act credit enhancement euro area portfolios. the third question whether omts form quantitative ease (qe). the answer is: no. first all, qe mean ease general credit condition consider central bank become tight situation short-term interest rate cannot reduce further. omts mean instead restore homogeneous credit condition throughout euro area, necessarily ease credit condition aggregate. in euro area region, currently clear sign deflation fear (see slide 11) would justify qe. in addition, channel transmission different. qe expect act risk premia (primarily term premia) subtract long-duration security market replace base money, short duration. this would reduce term premia bid price long-dated securities. the aim omts however create excess demand duration market, counteract redenomination risk squeeze redenomination premia bond prices. in fact, omts focus relatively short maturities, premia associate break-up risk evident. finally, qe would need tailor specificity euro area, two-thirds external finance non-financial corporation extend bank access actively trade credit markets. conclusion let conclude. the effectiveness monetary policy rely control monetary credit conditions. this ability severely test crisis. some challenge face ecb common central banks. the threat viability interest rate channel, consequent need devise alternative (“non-standard”) measure exploit channel transmission, prominent example. the crisis teach u liquidity channel exploit monetary policy euro area powerful. it allow ecb maintain flow credit real economy ensure price stability even face soar liquidity fund risk experience bank crisis. other challenge face ecb take specific form euro area thus somewhat different experience central bank elsewhere. the obvious one sovereign debt crisis, associate fragmentation credit market across national border recently break-up fears. the destructive potential development enormous. this lead ecb recently announce outright monetary transaction secondary market sovereign bond mean safeguard monetary policy transmission mechanism country euro area counteract self-fulfilling prophecies. the design omts inspire desire affirm last manner “monetary dominance”, compliance principle enshrine maastricht treaty. go forward, ecb remain commit whatever take comply mandate maintain price stability

drastically, undertake structural reform continue reduce government deficits. this case france. even effort appear moderate compare countries, necessary market credibility. brussels present proposal european bank supervisory mechanism; line expectations? yes, are. the development financial crisis bring light one euro area’s fragilities: link bank sovereign risk. follow collapse lehman brothers, government bail bank system and, so, establish nexus sovereign debt local bank systems, interfere monetary policy transmission. when euro area sovereign debt crisis erupted, bank refinance condition become correlate sovereign risk, consequence witness ail countries. the large amount liquidity provide eurosystem reduce impact, fund cost remain high countries. it therefore essential decouple sovereign risk bank risk. the bank union ensure sound monetary union. germany express doubt propose set-up, particular respect number bank cover ecb. could prove threat go forward? the propose union imply transfer sovereignty state ecb, germany always wish for. a regard scope supervision ecb, doubt bank covered. the problem often stem small- medium-sized banks, saw ireland spain. to ensure credibly vis-à-vis markets, across-the-board coverage necessary. 2 bi central bankers’ speech in practice, task divide national supervisor ecb? the legal responsibility supervision would transfer ecb, concrete terms, national supervisor would continue supervise bank day-to-day basis. in fact, mechanism similar eurosystem: authority govern council, supervision committee, bring together ecb head national supervisory authorities, coordinate supervisory action allocation task national supervisors. in practice, ecb would responsible major decision regard prudential supervision: assess capital adequacy relation risk, compliance regulations, etc. i would also like ecb decision-making power deal case distress banks. question remain division power ecb european bank authority (eba) the distribution task seem clear me: eba european body responsible bank supervision. it set prudential rule standard ensure applied; ecb euro area bank supervisor. the eba’s governance arrangement change slightly, commission proposes, take account bank union. the uk nothing fear creation single euro area supervisor. what would change european supervision system place, example crédit immobilier de france (cif)? technically, lot. instead french autorité de contrôle prudentiel, ecb would ask cif increase capital. but make mistake, bank supervision catch-all insurance. in case cif, aware fragility stem increase refinance difficulty know longer-term liquidity risks. the cif textbook case downgrade rat agency expedite disclosure fund problems. would say moody’s responsible situation? no, primary responsibility lie management, unable find merger solution possible ask so. do lack coercive power case? yes, definitely. we great power institution comply regulations, power enable u prevent crisis. a thing stand, appoint temporary administrator need revoke authorisation, power resolution allow u impose restructure bank group transfer assets. we work draft regulation european project start discussed, underestimate length time need arrive european proposal. i regret somewhat would useful us. be french bank system still sufficiently robust? in fact, french bank increasingly robust reduce risk increase capital. the reduction risk result selling-off business lines, often abroad, scaling-back market activities; increase capital reflect set aside profit remain substantial thanks, particular, resilience retail bank face economic slowdown. their core tier 1 capital grow 0.5 percentage point second quarter exceed target set eba. in term liquidity, manage well withdrawal u money market fund last year adjust assets, well rebalancing sovereign bond portfolios. this go show that, base sound internal model, universal bank model work well. bi central bankers’ speech 3 do remain oppose separation investment retail activities? i really understand benefit principle separate activities. the thing i wish see outright prohibition speculative activity strong internal control risk associate market activities. otherwise, bank able serve customers, whether private individuals, company institutions, operation – bond markets, forex hedge operations, create save products. for reasons, i fully understand concept separation, whereas i understand stop speculation. at time bank failure continuing, bank obtain ease liquidity constraint basel iii. isn’t paradox? that's it’s about. we always believe liquidity ratio necessary – and, incidentally, apply national rule many years, case everywhere. but draft agreement finalise quickly rework it. we need strike right balance strict regulation support finance economy. but timetable put back? yes, i favour put back bit, necessary, order make major trade-off give bank time implementation phase adapt new standards. should bank carry le sovereign debt? bank facilitate finance economy; point view, hold huge quantity sovereign bonds, even constitute liquid asset precious asset liability management. but excessive concentration liquid asset sovereign debt calculation liquidity ratio run difficulty – either sovereign rat substantially downgrade or, contrary, country low level debt, australia switzerland. will long-term liquidity constraint, nsfr, eventually abandoned? we work next year. should solvency ii standard insurer also delayed? we particular problem concern long-term business line (i.e. life insurance, civil liability, construction). design crisis, system standards, adjust portfolio asset accord market value, suit highly volatile environment like one see past five years. we need therefore ask fundamental question: basic assumption underlie solvency ii correct? and need seek reduce volatility get close economic reality. here again, set rule quickly impact may great fully assess time crisis. i think would fruitful try several different technical solution number year lay final rules. in event, i recommend french insurer continue preparation order ready technically 2014 standard go enter force scheduled. be programme job cut announce banque de france sufficient compare staff level central banks? i find accusation supposedly excessive staff level banque de france exasperating. they base spurious international comparison since central bank – bank england – print banknotes, (yet) incorporate bank supervisor perform task management 4 bi central bankers’ speech indebtedness, entrust banque de france law. more 200,000 household debt application process every year mean feat! we already make great effort past year staff level cut nearly 20% ten years. and continue effect; base detail analysis activity require substantial investment order increase productivity. our programme ambitious keep reality task perform respectful employees. bi central bankers’ speech 1 prasarn trairatvorakul: post-crisis recovery – asian lesson europe speech dr prasarn trairatvorakul, governor bank thailand, omfif golden series lecture, london, 12 september 2012. * * * distinguish guests, lady gentlemen, i honor delight part golden series lecture would like thank omfif kind invitation. event provide opportunity u exchange view topical issue center international finance i keen learn perspective audience. fifteen year ago asian crisis force u go painful adjustment far reach economic financial reforms. we embrace legal, regulatory governance reforms, business sector deleverage banker become much prudent risk conscious. today, world witness another crisis dissimilar i ask share lesson asian financial crisis. this somewhat ironic asia look europe role model benchmark integration efforts. individually small state find difficult compete foreign investment without attraction size economy scale. so talk today modest contribution current debate challenge post crisis recovery. i start brief recap asian crisis, draw lesson comparison european debt crisis. i would briefly discus economic set policy reform bring asia crisis end think reflection post crisis recovery period. lady gentlemen, a well-known american author, mark twain put it, “history doesn’t repeat itself, rhyme”. so despite difference context detail asian european crises, underlie root cause dissimilar. first, crises, like others recent economic history world, often associate mispricing risk distort incentive structures. in case asia, problem currency bank crisis. we abandon peg exchange rate system lead massive devaluation currency. with corporate sector largely overleveraged load foreign debt, sharp depreciation currency technically bankrupt firm overnight. bank npls shoot bring bank crisis. it clear region’s “original sin” well beyond redemption. we borrow foreign currency use finance project generate foreign exchange earn service debt. in case thailand, amount private external debt three time level international reserves. give healthy public finance thailand (with 9 year fiscal surplus prior 1997), expand foreign private sector debt interpret sign euphoria confidence emergence new tiger asia. in europe, similar story mispricing occur peripheral nation able access finance much cheap rate country’s underlie credit rat would allow - make possible sheer membership euro zone. a single currency convergence risk rating, like 2 bi central bankers’ speech fix exchange rate, give market false sense security encourage borrow beyond mean without proper risk management. second, crisis occur result failure fulfill necessary “pre-conditions”. in asia, precondition liberalization, europe precondition integration. a number asian country embark ambitious liberalization program insufficient safeguards, appropriate infrastructure policy tools. liberalize capital flow still maintain fix exchange rate system eventually run impossible trinity. the country must give control monetary policy. recourse macroprudential policy stem excessive bank credit expansion asset price inflation, well-known then. along line, currency union proceed without necessary precondition integration. country enter union large diversity term economic development competitiveness, absence fiscal, bank union. on whole, country victim success. the “reckless optimism” prior episode crisis ultimately lead country face similar consequence severe market stress capital flight, albeit different symptoms: asia, loss incur private sector’s balance sheet, europe, public sector balance sheet impaired. lady gentlemen, let’s look asia get crisis whether condition available europe. at onset asian crisis, indonesia, korea, thailand build large private short term external debt high private credit growth fuel bubble stock property markets. once crisis hit, country face sharp capital reversal 10% 12.5%1 gdp 1998 korea thailand respectively massive devaluation currency soon followed. some u force seek international assistance (imf) or, case malaysia2, undertake rigorous self-reform eventual unorthodox measure exchange capital flows. notwithstanding different approaches, step painful yet critical economic recovery. by 1998, current account balance four country become positive, help improve national account restore consumer confidence. gdp growth subsequently return positive territory second quarter 1999. two difference stand asia europe. the first policy flexibility. the devaluation exchange rate help restore export competitiveness asian economies. however, freedom flexibility might practical europe give single currency set political complexities. the second supportive global economy, provide necessary market asia allow asia export way crisis. global gdp register 4.7% growth 2000 advance economies, world’s large consumer, grow 4.1%. in contrast, global set current european sovereign debt crisis 1 bot’s staff computation ceic data. 2 malaysia’s policy mix start initial fiscal monetary tightening, conventional imf-like measure, follow reverse loosen macroeconomic policies. the insufficiency policy restore confidence lead country resort exchange capital control yield positive result. bi central bankers’ speech 3 favorable. global advance economy growth turn negative territory 0.6% 3.4% respectively 2009. emerge develop economies, increasingly feel pinch global slowdown, witness continue slowdown gdp growth 8.7% 2007 2.8% 2009. i believe may success factor european story. but, bear mind success factor without cost remain addressed. in case asia, sharp devaluation swift recovery export lead asian economy become addict large volume export low prices. and, case thailand, little incentive invest research development raise products’ value enhance human capital, average growth labor productivity3 trend 1990s 2000s. lady gentlemen, this bring third part lesson asian financial crisis. i would like offer three reflection may necessarily pertain europe may provide food think policymakers. first, conventional policy prescription may appropriate unusual circumstance one-size-fits-all solution. asia case point ill-timed austerity measures. public sector debt thailand le 15% gdp; yet policy prescription thailand tighten fiscal policy maintain tight monetary policy, result (interbank) interest rate rise 10% begin 1997 20% end 1997. with large private external debt beyond ability country service, way debt restructure international creditor give country breathe space avoid painful shock sharp reversal capital. this make possible case korea help country recover crisis able bring interest rate much fast crisis countries. the case indonesia lead imf reform towards careful focus policy prescription. the abrupt close-down indonesian commercial bank imf program add sense panic, lead broad-based bank run. moreover, conditionality focus critical macroeconomic adjustment directly relate problem crisis also include unrelated change requirement abolish import restriction new use ships. secondly, policymakers must ready take away punch bowl. in past use talk monetary policy alert take away punch bowl. this crisis prove public policy general need observe principle well. fiscal policy must guard fall populist trap. financial supervisor also need vigilant watch sign excessive credit creation, act pre-emptively cost clean crisis far outweigh brief euphoria exuberance moment. central bank must maintain independence credibility order voice conduct appropriate policy may favor politically. go forward, i view need international institution oversee finance-related conduct ensure strict compliance rule, implementation ethical code avoid double standard across nations. lastly, continuous collective reform vital. crisis recur phenomenon lesson previous crisis ever fully prevent next one. but process reform crisis, market grow become efficient. crisis provide window “political feasibility” undertake need structural change 3 international labor organization (ilo). 4 bi central bankers’ speech may hard sell public normal circumstances, one waste good crisis. i please see numerous improvement key area finance supervision use macroprudential measure complement traditional monetary policy tools. it also acceptable require bank provision good time loss bad times, bad loan make good times. in addition structural reforms, change “mindset” probably important. in order keep dynamic global environment, may need challenge correct old beliefs. let name – 1) sovereign long risk-free, 2) teach value economy scale confront too-big-to-exist problem 3) bank long international life also death crisis systemic give grow interconnectedness. spillover contagion witness 1997 turbulence spread thailand south east asia russia, china brazil, decade late 2007 crisis widen u eu rest world. imagine pace spread crisis next 10 year 2017 – crisis would grow size speed beyond management capacity single nation, real collective action call for. most importantly, forward-looking well prepared. a crisis prone occur frequently large spillover, reform must continue normal times. it imperative public board support reform effort raise competitiveness country, minimize vulnerability imbalance may trigger external factor fault own. lady gentlemen, let conclude offer observation 2002, five year 1997 crisis, asian economy fully recovered, particular, thailand able repay imf package two year ahead schedule. today, four year lehman crisis, work remain ahead us. at critical juncture, might come policy action, entail clarity, commitment credibility, progress onwards. indeed, always benefit look back do’s don’ts rear mirror great importance look forward windshield. a such, asia non- crisis country, era grow uncertainties, complacency luxury ill afford. thank you. bi central bankers’ speech 1 fernando restoy: remark bank union remark mr fernando restoy, deputy governor bank spain, round table “systemic risk security markets”, ii international conference security markets, hold comisión nacional del mercado de valores (cnmv), madrid, 14 september 2012. * * * let first thank organiser kind invitation participate event hold cnmv, i vice-chairman 2008 recent appointment banco de españa. i also privilege participate highly successful conference organise 2011. a glance quality paper speaker programme conference sufficient confirm organiser succeed maintain high standard achieve last year. our chairman today, oscar arce, deserve much credit that. i sure cnmv’s new top management – take week – continue support event, president julio segura first two editions. the current financial crisis show numerous deficiency function global economic financial system. many deficiency consequence imperfect rules, policy mistake inappropriate conduct private agents. some deficiency subject on-going policy debate regulatory reform which, vary degree ambition, take place different jurisdictions. however, addition imperfect rule policy actions, crisis reveal series institutional deficiency need eliminate order restore economic financial stability. the clear example regard probably european institutional framework. over last three year witness perception country risk climb high level consequence sovereign credit risk well so-called redenomination risk. this development impede adequate function monetary union lead sizeable difference finance condition agent locate different state within monetary union instigate renationalisation financial markets. there doubt much happen directly link significant macroeconomic financial imbalance accumulate several euro area countries, well emergence vulnerability within financial sector. it also clear main remedy destabilise development lie effective adjustment domestic policies, currently implement country suffer significant stress. but, time, elimination perception redenomination risk fully accomplish – addition require domestic policy action – central bank fully credibly commit intervene sovereign market far necessary avoid price sovereign risk become self-fulfilling. in regard, recent announcement european central bank determination conduct unlimited intervention sovereign secondary markets, provide effective conditionality fulfilled, constitute significant step towards normalisation market condition euro area. yet, return smoothly operate monetary union cannot completely achieve simply rely ad-hoc reaction policy-makers. institutional arrangement must review order restore adequate incentive domestic authority prevent reemergence destabilise imbalance ensure residual risk arise specific jurisdiction could affect area whole would address integrate mechanism operate euro area level. the recent change introduce european union strengthen requirement mechanism surveillance domestic fiscal policy structural reforms, together creation efsf esm – know soon launch – good example require institutional reforms. 2 bi central bankers’ speech at time, specific source risk smooth function monetary union need address directly financial instability experience specific jurisdictions. a see last years, deterioration perceive solvency financial institution locate specific country within monetary union spill-over effect across financial sector whole, contribute disorderly function wholesale market put great stress public finance country affected. consequently, soundness financial institution systemic importance within monetary union therefore preserve appropriate integrate crisis prevention resolution mechanism. against background, consensus emerge unprecedented strength need take step create bank union. the first step would adoption single supervisory mechanism. a regulatory proposal mechanism release week european commission. the proposal three main features. first, assignment ecb supervisory responsibility bank euro area, possibly also bank country outside euro zone will enter cooperation arrangement ecb. second, adoption mechanism ensure ecb’s supervisory task strictly separate conduct monetary policy. third, involvement national supervisor preparation implementation decisions. the proposal view well founded. in particular, make sense subject financial institution euro area single supervisory mechanism. recent experience show instability medium-sized small institution limit link european institution may sometimes generate disruption national euro area level. moreover, coexistence different supervisory regime institution share market place may generate competitive distortions, avoided. similarly, important establish institutional mechanism mitigate potential conflict objective pursue supervisory monetary policy functions. i believe crisis already help allay concern extent conflict could actually arise practice. indeed, central bank understand financial stability consideration take account design monetary policy measure without challenge priority give price stability objective. in case, procedural point view seem reasonable govern council ecb – interest-rate set body – make relatively extensive delegation supervisory board envisage draft regulation operational body ecb exercise new supervisory functions. finally, involvement national supervisory authorities, draft regulation envisage model ecb ultimate responsibility task confer new regulation. in perform new functions, ecb however take full advantage expertise national authorities. the principle national central bank supervisory authority help prepare implement decision essential ingredient new supervisory mechanism. at time, probably reasonable develop model way principle delegation flexibly use take account different nature supervise financial institution specific supervisory function performed. although involvement national authority always required, ecb normally participate directly institution systemic importance action strategic nature involved. the draft regulation foresee ecb start perform function national supervisor already january next year new system fully operational 2014. that quite demand timetable. i well understand need speed thing much possible new system already use help solve problem euro area face now. that include possibility open direct recapitalisation financial institution require public aid european stability mechanism, thereby help mitigate destabilise association sovereign financial risk. bi central bankers’ speech 3 it probably reasonable expect overall supervisory framework evolve time beyond january 2014. in particular distribution responsibility centre national authority could naturally change result accumulation expertise ecb progress make develop two pillar bank union: namely, integrate resolution regime common deposit guarantee scheme. indeed, idea fully effective bank union require also establishment two additional component quite compel view. moreover, could argue combination centralise supervisory mechanism decentralise resolution scheme may generate dysfunctionalities incentive compatibility issues. more importantly, mitigation destabilise financial risk impact sovereign risk require strong crisis prevention scheme, also effective common crisis resolution regime. even bank supervise common system, episode financial distress may still deteriorate perceive cohesion eurozone purely domestic mechanism use restructure resolve weak bank protect depositors. that conceptually contradictory goal bank union. in context, communication commission shortly make legislative proposal area beyond directive currently discussion obviously welcomed. in event, lot work do short term put place new unify supervisory mechanism. at present, important difference remain characteristic national supervisory model affect powers, means, practice procedures. the use permanent on-site supervision, link off-site supervision on-site inspection power supervisory authority (if any) relation account regulations, simply examples. difference national supervisor also exist regard availability data. to give example, central credit register – experience highly valuable source information prudential supervision purpose – yet available jurisdictions. the eba play important role improve cooperation national supervisor promote supervisory convergence. but improvement fall short need effectively unify supervisory system. substantial swift progress field therefore needed. let finish make general comment. it obvious creation bank union pose enormous challenge europe require strong political support effective cooperation among authority involved. the good news look process european integration historical perspective, realise first time way forward highly complex. and, past experience regularly show response always deepen integration increase transfer national power union best – possibly – way preserve achievement make far. bi central bankers’ speech 1 michael gondwe:

inspiration. swami vivekananda great thinker reformer india envision new educational model society. his valuable think education relevant viable even today. accord him, “education manifestation perfection already man”. he say “mere book-learning won’t do. we want education character formed, strength mind increased, intellect expanded, one stand one’s feet”. he teach education upliftment mass possible. however, swami vivekananda’s scheme education, want build strong nation lead world towards peace harmony, still far cry. it high time give serious think philosophy education remember 2 bi central bankers’ speech call every-body – “arise, awake, stop till goal reached.” i hope society pursue vision swami vivekananda. swamiji’s unique contribution creation new india open mind indian duty downtrodden masses. he first religious leader india understand openly declare real cause india’s deep root problem neglect masses. long idea karl marx know india, swamiji speak role labour class production country’s wealth. have say this, let come back realm financial sector reform india. a many aware, indian financial sector see wide range reform last two decades. however, reform broad focus macro level internal reform institutional level yet take place. thus, need hour go second generation reforms. nonetheless, reform financial sector alone bring perpetual prosperity. it real sector need reforms. the financial sector grow keep pace development real sector. why financial sector regulation? on intuitive basis, business finance bank different businesses. this account fact business operate funds, bank highly leverage institution operate public money hence, require closely regulate supervised. besides, unlike business where, due absence entry barriers, free market competition expect ensure efficiency fair treatment customers, bank business, high entry barrier imply bank operation cannot carry without license. this restrict free play competitive force hence, make imperative sound regulatory framework, particularly protection customers. in business bank finance, inherent inequity provider service consumer this, again, present need framework rule procedures, call regulation. the health financial sector matter public policy concern view critical contribution economic performance. financial regulation supervision assume importance ensure financial system operate along sound lines. the primary justification financial regulation authority prevent systemic risk, avoid financial crises, protect depositors’ interest reduce asymmetry information depositor banks. a cost financial crisis perceive high, authority realise avoid costs. a result, bank come regulate everywhere. besides, financial regulation attempt enhance efficiency financial system achieve broad range social objectives. go experience several countries, effective regulation interest concerned, though cannot base “one-size-fits-all” approach. however, important bear mind financial institution benefit appropriate regulatory regime, much evidence existence regulatory jurisdiction make institution strong le prone shocks. there neither unique theoretical model, one practical approach regulation supervision financial system. the existence different type regulatory model financial system make ideal choice difficult exercise. the regulation supervision financial system india carry different regulatory authorities. the reserve bank regulate supervise major part financial system. in past five decades, indian bank system traverse difficult path endeavor balance several compete conflict demand large, medium, small tiny borrower organise unorganised sectors. the bank system’s activity initially tightly regulate freedom restricted. it also confront several domestic stress external shocks. however, regulation change time ensure bank system step restrictive bi central bankers’ speech 3 operational environment function atmosphere provide freedom innovate. in recent years, innovation instrument processes, advance technology increase volume capital intermediate financial system necessitate proactive strengthen regulatory supervisory framework. emergence several player diversify significant presence financial sector make imperative supervision regulation spread across various segment financial system. in recent years, shift emphasis microregulation macro-management, support tighten prudential norm improvement function financial system. since global crisis, decisive shift trend towards assign increase responsibility central bank “systemic oversight” “macro-prudential regulation”. this great responsibility drive capability central bank among regulator public institution perform intend task. central bank robust framework macroeconomic analysis, india, reserve bank responsibility micro-prudential supervision bank non-banking financial companies. a result, macroeconomic analysis help strengthen microprudential supervision, supervisory information aggregate financial system whole also help conduct appropriate macroeconomic policies. the reserve bank deeply involve development markets, monitor analysis impact market trend economy financial institutions. another important reason central bank systemic risk regulator mandate lender last resort (lolr). go forward, give complex nature challenge, significant strengthen capacity systemic risk assessment macro-prudential regulation would critical reserve bank. macroeconomic financial sector reform in response macroeconomic crisis, programme stabilisation structural adjustment initiate july 1991, wide range reform measure encompass area trade, exchange rate management, industry, public finance financial sector. fiscal correction, exchange rate adjustment, monetary target inflation control constitute immediate measure macroeconomic stability. these measure support structural reform form industrial deregulation, liberalisation foreign direct investment, trade liberalisation, overhaul public enterprise financial sector reforms. apart aim restore economic stability domestic external fronts, economic reform programme strive towards achieve high growth trajectory increase level investment improvement productivity, efficiency competitiveness. structural reform aim reorientation economy centrally direct command control economy market orient one foster great efficiency growth. this do introduce great competition economy progressive internal deregulation accompany external competition promote foreign direct investment trade liberalisation. the reform measure sectoral dimension well. begin industrial policy 1991, reform industrial sector undertake view remove distortion resource allocation improve competitiveness indian industry. the reform measure include removal industrial licensing, reduction number industry reserve public sector, abolition restriction investment expansion monopoly restrictive trade practice (mrtp)act, 1969, automatic approval foreign investment, elimination quantitative import restriction intermediate capital good steady reduction protective custom tariffs. these measure create favourable environment industry upgrade technology build-up capacity order cater grow domestic external demand. a series policy initiative undertake 4 bi central bankers’ speech agricultural sector well. these included, inter alia, replacement quantitative control tariffs, partial decontrol fertilizer prices, removal bottleneck agricultural marketing, relaxation restriction essential commodity act, 1955, replacement revamp public distribution system (rpds) target public distribution system (tpds), establishment rural infrastructure development fund (ridf). moreover, price reform improve term trade agriculture. also, exchange rate international trade reform improve incentive structure face agriculture. several initiative undertake development reform financial markets, particularly since 1990s. the reform various segment financial market money, government security foreign exchange market introduce calibrated, sequence careful manner, step market real economy. the sequence also inform need develop market infrastructure, technology capability market participant financial institution consistent manner. in india, initiation structural reform early 1990s encompass process phase coordinate deregulation liberalisation financial markets. financial market india, period early 1990s, mark administer interest rates, quantitative ceilings, statutory pre-emptions, captive market government securities, excessive reliance central bank financing, peg exchange rate, current capital account restrictions. a result various reforms, financial market transit regime characterise market-determined interest exchange rates, price-based instrument monetary policy, current account convertibility, phase capital account liberalisation auction-based system government security market. enhance efficiency, time avoid instability system, challenge regulator india. this approach development regulation financial market impart great resilience. india’s reform programme definite positive significant impact economy compare past. who stakeholders? in whole process reforms, key stakeholder customer themselves. the regulator critical role ensure fair treatment customer cannot leave market force alone. the key prompt, effective courteous customer service emanate right attitude. a radical transformation attitude right top management grind level employee first step towards improve customer service. communication root effective customer care service industry, especially like banking, documents, term conditions, practice precedent heavily load customer. in many field different countries, regulator determine price. but, financial sector regulator india so. therefore, whatever charge levied, expect reasonable price fair, transparent non-discriminatory. globally, regulator expect usher much strict regulation area fair treatment customers. bank need price product service fairly competitively ensure high transparency product pricing. lack transparency design price product service sell inappropriate customer could expose bank litigation reputational risks, besides make liable supervisory action. there unreasonable post sale barrier customer wish change product bank. customer education also critical provide appropriate need base product service indian banks’ association may critical role play regard. the bank business would, thus, turn customer centric true dimensions. financial sector reform – next? the indian approach financial sector reforms, far, drive predominant objective enhance role finance promote growth economic development, bi central bankers’ speech 5 preserve financial stability, equally critical sustain economic progress. while balance goal efficiency stability introduce reforms, reserve bank move towards deregulation interest rates, promote development markets, strengthen legal infrastructure facilitate good enforcement financial contracts. go forward, three area continue important policy debates, i.e., development long-term corporate bond markets, derivative market facilitate good price discovery risk transfers, competition allow great foreign participation. the regulatory supervisory framework financial system across world undergo paradigm shift follow problem experience global financial crisis. in regard, multilateral standard set body like g-20, imf, bi fsb forefront design advance regulatory framework prevent recurrence crisis. address regulatory gap base lesson global financial crisis advance economy major challenge regulator around world. much challenge domain financial stability regulation would arise complexity surround assessment systemic risk, interconnectedness, common exposures, risk concentration complex innovative product use model manage price risk which, times, mask information. while india’s financial sector remain resilient face global shocks, number area reform would need promote stability generate growth impulse real economy. in wake turbulent global financial environment, bank financial entity grapple grow complexity risk associate businesses. against backdrop, policy initiative adoption tight capital liquidity standards, improve risk management practice sound compensation practice require place indian bank system strong foot enhance bank sector’s ability absorb shock arise financial economic stress encourage prudent risk taking. moreover, india, broad institutional reform take place macro level, internal reform among bank financial institution yet take place. thus, need go second generation reforms, particularly focus bring cost bank services, strengthen credit delivery mechanism, improve customer service, reform human resource management system enhance financial outreach hitherto unbanked areas. second generation reform let talk element second generation reforms. (i) adopt improve risk management practice one fundamental principal finance i would like emphasize direct relationship risk return. any investment offer great returns, invariably involve risk. similarly, avoid take risk, return could even negative. banks, instance, business take risk hence, cannot expect shun risk entirety. four basic requirement bank professional field need develop to: • understand risk • define risk • measure risk • manage risk my advice student enter finance field would never take risk cannot meet four requirements. 6 bi central bankers’ speech globally, increase move towards advance approach risk management. bank india make progress move towards advance risk management approaches. banks, however, need traverse long distance regard. a capital always come cost, bank need place fair differentiate risk price product services. this involve costing, quantitative assessment revenue stream product service efficient transfer price mechanism, would determine capital allocation. each business unit enterprise would aim profit centre within overall risk–return framework. in essence, would mean accountability profit, temper discipline risk–return within deeply embed culture good governance. our past experience poor saver subsidise rich borrowers. also, incidence rampant mis-pricing risks. from business perspective, price asset non-discriminatory line risk rat customer. a low rat customer get good price high rat customer. once basic issue addressed, issue migration advance approaches, etc. would gain importance. while indian bank adopt standardise approach basel ii framework 2009, pace migration advance approach has, naturally, slow. though reserve bank set indicative time schedule implementation advance approaches, banks’ response le encourage far. migration advance approach important large bank involve adoption sophisticate risk management systems. moreover, reputational issue also large bank continue standardise approaches. apart fundamental issues, much sluggishness could attribute issue relate development human resource skills, technology upgradation, branch interconnectivity, availability management historical data, robustness risk management systems, etc. within banks. even within reserve bank, supervisor would make rapid stride able appreciate nuance associate quantitative technique models. the objective basle iii reform package improve bank sector’s ability absorb shock arise financial economic stress, whatever source, thus reduce risk spillover financial sector real economy. an assessment indian banks’ capital requirement basel iii reveal that, notwithstanding issue individual banks, system whole, well capitalise transition revise capital norm overall capital adequacy, tier i component equity component would smooth. the implementation period basel iii capital requirements, include capital conservation buff regulatory deductions, begin january 1, 2013 fully implement march 31, 2018, timeline (january 1, 2019) indicate basel iii rules. (ii) reform human resource management there imperative need improve productivity efficiency human resources. an organisation good people. they force behind innovation, business process re-engineering make difference success failure. a commit highly motivate work force make difference win retain customer bank people orient business. bank knowledge organisations, able attract retain talent. hr policy look right size, right fit career growth market relate compensation. increasingly, go intense competition right kind talent likely short supply. the demand efficient manpower stem domestic institution also foreign institutions/ countries; bank industry financial/non-financial sectors. the challenge indian bank is, therefore, revitalise hire right talent, invest train bring vibrant transformation dna. bi central bankers’ speech 7 (iii) technology customer focus most bank already core bank system (cbs) cover bank operation pertain deposits, withdrawals, credit delivery, back-office operations, etc. bank need look beyond core bank harness benefit technology. cbs could provide input develop customise product base customer database. it would help plan product delivery service selected/ multiple delivery points, good customer relationship management build last customer relationship translate high revenues. technology need customer focus employee vendor focused. in case glitches, rectification must swift instill faith confidence system. it agile innovative player stay ahead game. along it solution arise ally issue it security, governance audits. gap it security could make bank vulnerable data piracy, fraud operational risk lead reputation risk erosion customer confidence. (iv) focus mi information literacy mi inseparable part bank’s decision make process. the integrity timeliness data critical formulate bank’s capital planning, business strategies, review achievement vis-a-vis targets, formulate course correction exercise required, feed data stress test importantly, take action outcomes. this bring u technology support decision making. bank make huge investment technology, translate good mi decision support system yield return investment provide economical, affordable customise customer centric bank solutions. the use technology see end mean end. (v) business strategy vision the role banks’ board would become increasingly crucial next decade view loom competition. the board would need clear vision bank, strategy achieve objectives, medium long-term, well lay long-term plan. bank would need look beyond exist customer base large corporates reach rope vast number small, retail sme client presently deprive bank credit. alongside extend reach bank services, would need improve product offer customer quality services. they need proper business model delivery model. (vi) reach unbanked / under-banked area in india, growth equity central objective right inception plan process. the objective financial inclusion provide financial service affordable cost exclude formal financial system. this vital sustain long term equitable development, since large proportion households/areas access basic bank facilities, notwithstanding existence vast institutional framework country. an important challenge channelise save financial system, particularly rural area urban informal sector. this would need penetration bank system. the reserve bank’s emphasis financial inclusion important attain objective time. there also enormous potential extend finance semi-urban rural area productive activities, may require strengthen bank correspondent relationship, simultaneously enhance risk assessment risk management capacity order maintain credit quality sustain credit growth sectors. besides benefit unbanked masses, also ensure viability scalability banks’ financial inclusion initiatives. 8 bi central bankers’ speech (vii) bring cost bank service further reduction cost bank service may require great competition among product lines, improve delivery mechanism increase use information technology. the cost bank transaction need dramatically reduce happen many field telecom, advent technology. however, observe that, banking, transaction cost continue high, particularly agriculture sector, include cost incur appraisal borrowers, processing, documentation disbursement charges, loan monitoring/supervision collection. it essential bring transaction cost make available credit affordable price farmers. balance real financial sector reform financial sector reform alone bring continue prosperity. in recent years, see, grow evidence growth deceleration indian economy. for sustain high growth path, improve investment climate enhance absorptive capacity bring real sector reform would critical. the fact well-developed financial sector necessary act intermediary entrepreneurs/ investor saver hardly overstated. an efficient financial sector reduce cost risk produce trade good service and, thus, make important contribution raise standard living. the recent crisis, however, show financial sector apparently take quasi-autonomous existence without close connection finance requirement real economy. the financial industry, indeed, grow oversized precede years, reflect rapid credit creation, asset price bubble high level indebtedness, particularly advance financial systems. the disproportionate growth global financial sector largely due aggressive search yield, engender easy liquidity global system trigger wave financial innovation. complex financial product create structure hedging, originate distributing, belief real value could create sheer financial engineering. there hardly sign grow capital formation due grow increasingly complex financial sector. the financial sector grow rapidly good services. in way, make growth finance end mean meet human need food, fuel, health education. give bust oversized financial sector devastate impact real sector, become important (i) examine optimal size financial sector relative growth development need (ii) make financial sector innovation meaningful cater need real sector. for sustain high growth path, imperative bring reform agriculture, industry, infrastructure service sectors. i would like touch upon element reforms. improve agricultural governance productivity in order step agriculture growth, judicious use technology require along institutional reforms, include relate land, incentive supply response good input use. give dependence vast majority workforce agriculture, enhance agricultural output, drive high yield diversification crops, assume importance. high investment, back sustain research extension activities, could critical augment yield. the policy focus, far, use high msp generate supply response public investment expand irrigation potential. however, need improve market structure agricultural commodities, ensure competitive pricing, enhance warehouse facility improve rural road enhance good connectivity urban markets. good water management, emphasis water harvesting, would important enhance farm productivity output. bi central bankers’ speech 9 improve performance manufacture sector the manufacture sector’s performance competitive environment face risk rise protectionism could encounter several challenges. despite advantage large domestic market, abundant availability skilled labour force, proximity fast grow asian markets, productivity growth need catch asian economies, include china. this require great emphasis quality, good adoption technology, flexible labour laws, significantly improve infrastructure policy environment supportive smes sector. the industry-education linkage must strengthen vigorously. persistent problem like frequent disruption availability power lack stable demand also affect performance manufacture sector. harness potential service sector notwithstanding high growth resilience service sector recent past, sector face multiple challenge sustain growth years. a number services, india enjoy comparative advantage, experience lack clear policy thrust. for instance, despite high quality healthcare services, attract number regulations. similarly, education, multiple regulation point lack credible accreditation system hamper growth potential. give medium long-term contribution investment education health growth productivity, availability service affordable cost, enhance global competitiveness, must form part priority india’s development process. a number service india either predominantly associate government liberalise enough ensure growth organise private initiatives. service like professional, legal, postal, accountancy insurance need liberalisation harness potential. facilitate infrastructure finance a per assessment plan commission, twelfth plan (2012–17) india may need infrastructure investment us$ 1trillion. this pose mammoth finance task. the infrastructure gap india, relation major country grow demand, key factor affect overall productivity investments. the requirement high initial capital outlay, take long terms, necessitate measure address finance constraint capacity expansion infrastructure. the finance issue relate possible resource gap, also ensure commercially viable fund remain business cycles. infrastructure investment twelfth plan need fund both, public private sectors. despite increase participation private sector bridge infrastructure gap, public investment still play significant role. fiscal consolidation reorientation expenditure towards capital expenditure require meet target. the bank system, despite risk asset-liability mismatch lend long-term infrastructure projects, see high growth credit sector recent years. to sum the first round financial sector reform result strengthen financial system make vibrant resilient. however, time, pace reform growth slow need second generation reform strongly felt. these reform would focus individual corporates work towards improvement productivity efficiency economy whole. financial sector reforms, isolation, significant impact unless improvement absorption capacity economy. real sector reform precede financial sector reform bring inclusive sustainable development country. even financial sector, imperative need internal institutional reforms, particularly focus improve risk management practices, reduce cost transactions, borrow lending, improve overall customer service. i hope 10 bi central bankers’ speech concern stakeholder work towards implementation second generation reforms, essential move economy back high growth trajectory. i would, again, like congratulate vivekananda education society completion 50 glorious year hope society continue effort produce student fully equip shoulder responsibility take nation forward come years. i would also urge management, faculty student rededicate towards broaden activity reach society provide avenue deprive segment attain social economic prosperity education. this would line message swami

mortgage lend address mr norman t l chan, chief executive hong kong monetary authority, media, hong kong, 14 september 2012. * * * 1. i go announce new round countercyclical prudential measure property mortgage lending. 2. since introduction fourth round tighten measure property mortgage loan hong kong monetary authority (hkma) june 2011, local property market quiet somewhat – seven months. the property market begin heat february 2012, significant increase transaction volume prices. cumulative growth property price much 13% compare begin year. 3. the evolution property market cycle hong kong affect many factors, include external environment. with third round quantitative ease announce u federal reserve last night, capital inflow u bank system emerge markets. moreover, europe earn respite debt crisis follow announcement european central bank bond-buying programme relate judgment germany’s constitutional court. so sentiment financial market likely stay calm while. against background, risk bring continue heat hong kong property market bank sector rise again. to enhance risk management banks, hkma issue set guideline banks, require tighten underwrite criterion mortgage borrower already one property mortgage. 4. under new measures, handle new application mortgage loan residential, industrial commercial property borrower already one property mortgage, bank must adopt follow three requirements: first: mortgage loan assess base debt service ability mortgage applicant, maximum debt service ratio (dsr) shall low current 50% 10 percentage point 40%. accordingly, maximum stress dsr shall also low correspondingly current 60% 10 percentage point 50%. however, applicant one property outstanding mortgage loan affect new measure new mortgage loan self-occupied purpose, replacement exist property. second: mortgage loan assess base net worth mortgage applicant, maximum loan-to-value (ltv) ratio shall low current 40% 10 percentage point 30%. third: mortgage applicant whose principal income derive outside hong kong, applicable maximum ltv ratio shall low 20 percentage points, instead current 10 percentage points. 5. base experience hong kong, borrower multiple outstanding mortgage loan high level indebtedness leverage. during property market economic downturns, chance default group borrower significantly high one property mortgage. in view this, hkma consider necessary require bank tighten underwrite criterion mortgage loan borrower multiple property mortgage reduce risk banks. 2 bi central bankers’ speech 6. besides, hkma notice recent trend lengthen average tenor new mortgage loans. the average tenor new mortgage loan 25 years, three year long 22 year 2009. some bank extend maximum tenor even 40 years. prolong loan tenor increase credit risk banks, may also weaken ability borrower withstand interest rate risk. in particular, mortgage rate return normal levels, borrower loan already stretch 30 even 40 year simply cannot seek reduce monthly instalment payment burden extend tenor, may therefore face financial difficulty. therefore hkma require bank set ceiling maximum loan tenor new mortgage loan 30 years. 7. the measure take effect immediately. however, loan application respect property transaction provisional sale purchase agreement sign today early affected. 8. mr arthur yuen, deputy chief executive, explain detail measure later. 9. when introduce measure tighten underwrite criterion mortgage loans, hkma always strive strike balance minimise impact end-users, particularly first-time homebuyers. although already introduce five round prudential measure mortgage lending, seek ensure purchaser residential property value hk$6 million self-occupied purpose would still eligible maximum ltv ratio 70%. in addition, purchaser meet eligibility requirement able apply mortgage loan 90% ltv ratio mortgage insurance arrangements. accord figure provide hong kong mortgage corporation limited, value property involve mortgage loan 90% ltv ratio average around hk$3.2 million. therefore, i believe measure hkma minimal impact first-time homebuyers. 10. change property market cycle affect host internal external factors, include land supply, interest rate movements, change household income well economic financial market development europe us. in view highly uncertain internal external environments, hkma continue monitor market situation closely introduce appropriate measure response change property market cycle safeguard bank stability. bi central bankers’ speech 1 barry whiteside: development credit

central bankers’ speech 1 sebastián claro: chinese challenge face chile latin america speech mr sebastián claro, board member central bank chile, 2012 latin american city conference “chile path development”, organize america society/council americas, santiago, 30 august 2012. * * * i would like thank consuelo edward yan carrière-swallow help translate speech original spanish. thank invite event several year gradually position – chile rest latin america – seminar deal key issue region’s economic development. on occasion, organizers’ suggestion, i would like share think economic development china implication latin america. rather focus aspect chinese economy – i come back end presentation –, i would like focus dimension china’s spectacular growth affect region directly. let begin recall widespread debate region early 2000s. while europe boastfully launch new single currency, latin america struggle leave behind havoc successive crisis hit region, start mexico 1994. the meager growth late 1990s early 2000s, plus accumulation large current account deficit 1990s, cause region begin new century relatively high level debt-to-gdp. for example, end 2002 brazil’s government debt reach 80% gdp external debt close 55% gdp. in every country latin america – exception chile –, debt general government exceed 40% gdp. moreover, large current account deficit persist throughout region. take year 2002, mexico peru – well bolivia costa rica – accumulate 5 year current account deficit 2% gdp.1 doubt sustainability national debt across region fuel academic debate identify high level debt could tolerated. in 2003 paper carmen reinhart, miguel savastano kenneth rogoff – part successful research program history debt crisis –, author examine history default around world, conclude relatively low level debt-to-gdp enough trigger credit restructure events.2 in particular, paper find several country region debt level limit could deem “tolerable”. the author also provide evidence country – latin america elsewhere – historically use deleveraging regain sustainable path external debt. their conclusion clear: “for debt-intolerant countries, sustain access capital market problematic unless debt ratio quickly bring safe levels. to ass ‘deleveraging’ might accomplished, examine how, historically, emerge market economy substantial external debt manage work down. to knowledge, phenomenon previously receive little, any, attention. we analyze episode large debt reversals, countries’ external debt fell 25 percentage point gnp three-year period. of twenty-two reversal identify broad group middle-income country since 1970, two-thirds involve form default restructuring. only one case – swaziland 1985 – country 1 sources: world bank, moody’s imf (weo, april 2012). 2 reinhart, c., m. savastano k. rogoff, (2003), “debt intolerance”, brook paper economic activity 1. 2 bi central bankers’ speech able bring high ratio external debt gnp solely result rapid output growth.” thus, early 2000s, widespread expectation default would occur. overall, history latin america 2000s go expected. during first decade twenty-first century, latin american country succeed low level external debt nearly 20 percent gdp. the current-account balance, exhibit secular deficit 1980s 1990s, post surplus nearly 2% gdp 2000s. a review fiscal ledger yield similar numbers. what happened? what miracle? in word: china. china’s strong growth begin permeate international commodity market early decade, lead enormous increase region’s term trade begin around 2004. this major increase income enable economy deleverage without make large adjustment expenditure output. also, real exchange rate appreciate almost 20% respect trade partner 2000s, contrast great stability 1990s. of course, good macroeconomic policy contribute markedly success. whereas previous income boom accompany strongly pro-cyclical economic policy incubate problems, time great effort fiscal saving, exchange rate flexibility good bank supervision help country take advantage high commodity prices. but large part region, seed success 2000s sow china. today objective look ahead, dwell think region past decade. the strength chinese economy lead one think phenomenon high term trade go time, pose number challenge economic development region. at risk oversimplify challenges, let group three categories: (i) challenge macroeconomic management, (ii) structural challenges, (iii) cyclical challenges. the first two depend essentially us, third refer short-term trajectory chinese economy possible impact develop countries. macroeconomic challenge a first issue worth note commodity price experience successive cycle throughout history, permanent risk mistake temporary phenomenon permanent one. this time different. there valid argument chinese economy sustain recent dynamism many year come. while reason believe chinese economy converge growth rate around 7% within next years, 9% growth rate difficult sustain, imply substantial deterioration chinese demand commodities.3 in case chile, expert survey ministry finance raise estimate long-term copper price repeat occasion grind supply- demand-side considerations.4 however, economic cycle exist response supply – fully perceive far – tend drive price trend values, current levels. clarity point fundamental determine fiscal policy consistent medium-term income, also guide private spend investment decision basis sustainable future earnings. for macroeconomic policies, important 3 claro, sebastián. present v chile-china entrepreneurial meeting, centro cultural de carabineros, santiago, 10 june 2011. for transcript, see central bank chile website: www.bcentral.cl. 4 see ministry finance chile website: www.hacienda.gov.cl. bi central bankers’ speech 3 challenge face period temporarily high term trade, improve external finance condition become available result. the experience many country show best policy mix sound fiscal discipline, prudent financial regulation, monetary policy framework combine price stability flexible exchange rates. a sound fiscal policy smooth business cycle help minimize foreign exchange fluctuations, also avoid commitment spend outlay depend uncertain future income. fiscal policy chile move direction decades, importance cannot overemphasized. sound bank supervision key several reasons, among others intermediation large capital inflow – context upward pressure asset price – may lead excessive risk taking. the reversal condition hit particularly hard previous financial crises, risk- take financial institution prompt aggressive deleveraging, strong implication credit output. for reason, circumstance like extremely important closely monitor price key asset risk-taking pattern financial system. finally, regard monetary policy two issue worth noting. on one hand, monetary policy favor sound domestic price stability consistent macro stability medium term. this much sought-after objective many economy region must protected. on hand, flexible exchange rate policy best framework deal situation face. the reason twofold: first, context high commodity price good external finance conditions, float exchange rate help prevent incubation macroeconomic imbalances,5 chile attest past experience. there many example country face favorable external conditions, foreign exchange rigidity result high inflation also large current account deficits, cause major imbalance external accounts. second, foreign exchange adjustment allow economy adjust fluctuation external conditions, prevalent past several years. volatility term trade external credit condition generate constant need adjust relative prices, easily accomplish flexible exchange rates.6 current development europe provide evidence view. the benefit flexible exchange rate accompany costs, primarily due possibility increase exchange rate volatility. this introduce difficulty make business investment decisions. the trade-off present academic economic policy debate many decade and, although opinion differ term acknowledge difficulty cause exchange rate volatility, benefit float exchange rate safeguard macroeconomic stability perceive trump difficulties. for one thing, past decade credible chilean policy flexible exchange rate bring nearly total elimination currency mismatch corporate sector hind monetary policy make many years. structural challenge in context good commodity price favorable access credit, phenomenon real exchange rate appreciation pose structural challenge economy region. i would like focus three issue widely discuss business, political, academic circles. 5 dornbusch, r., (1983), “real interest rates, home goods, optimal external borrowing”, journal political economy 91(1). 6 calvo, g., a. izquierdo e. talvi, (2003), “sudden stops, real exchange rate fiscal sustainability: argentina’s lessons,” nber work paper 9828. 4 bi central bankers’ speech first, worth emphasize part appreciation real exchange rate reflect proceed high price main exports. the result increase expenditure investment push price service wages, counterpart exchange rate appreciation. the impulse demand condition depend essentially monetary policy, primarily affect trade-off fluctuation nominal exchange rate domestic inflation. although monetary policy toolkit smooth short-term exchange rate fluctuation without jeopardize price stability – circumstance could justify intervene foreign exchange market –, underlie trend real exchange rate cannot deal use monetary policy. the second issue recognize phenomenon impact competitiveness certain export-oriented industry whose price increase dollar whose domestic cost rise due pressure wages. here need distinguish couple elements. for one thing, essentially phenomenon hold copper price long-term level cause high price commodities, foodstuffs. this chinese growth offer enormous opportunity country agricultural agribusiness potential, chile. in turn, chile’s capacity diversify export avoid specialize handful raw material require substantial effort promote competitiveness, critical tool foster growth diversification. support train human capital, increase market competition flexible labor market stand important measure improve competitiveness. all dimension point fundamental source productivity gains, creation development new enterprises. international experience show countries’ export growth drive mainly new firm – exist product category exist destination – strong capacity growth exist exporters.7 a author point out, take advantage growth potential require foster factor mobility across firm different productivity levels. this process generate major portion gain economic openness, policy hind worker cross firm raise cost adjust scale production weaken capacity innovation.8 finally, token, clear opportunity china’s strong growth generate region must well used. for take place, great save required, also productive investment. in words, one significant challenge face economy region – chile particular – take advantage momentary boom term trade promote save investment, thus make sure simply translate unsustainable spend spree. to end, fiscal policy play key role set well evaluate investment programs, maintain incentive promote accumulation scarce physical human capital among private agents. policy distort incentive inevitable end low rate save investment. 7 see eaton, j., m. eslava, m. kugler j. tybout (2008), “the margin entry export markets: evidence colombia,” e.

26(2). bi central bankers’ speech 5 challenge face china i would like end refer china’s challenge short run, impact current development may economy region. already mid-2000s chinese economy transition become le dependent external sector investment demand, thus try promote domestic consumption. there obvious sign investment exhaustion sectors, together doubt capacity sustain high rate export growth. the reform adopt middle past decade enhance operation financial system thus attain efficient allocation credit – offset natural fall save rate – come halt crisis 2008–2009 due great boost government expenditure public credit. this boost, allow chinese economy deal quite successfully global financial crisis, bring significant indebtedness local governments, high exposure financial system project dubious quality, substantial over-investment. the need put stop impulse order safeguard macroeconomic stability define china’s economic policy decision since 2010. accordingly, contraction investment project credit availability main stabilization tool use china. however, process coincide aggravation problem europe, result sharp reduction external demand chinese economy, among things. the fall exports, together need withdraw stimulus give investment past years, put significant pressure china’s growth. it capacity offset drop demand increase domestic consumption limit short run, especially since necessary condition promote low save rates, change social security health-care plans, deepen household credit market, change relative price – real exchange rate appreciation –, often slow implement. until chinese economy continue decelerate, somewhat rapidly foresee quarter ago. in view, china necessary tool deal deceleration, deal possible worsen problem europe. but time, program implement 2008–2009 lose efficacy, authority take cautionary stance. today, china need rearrange economy, although event europe catch china flatfooted respect economic reforms, part adjustment slow short-term growth necessary partly inevitable. a significant impulse public expenditure investment observe significant deterioration external conditions. overall, chinese economy face important challenge short run. these could introduce fluctuation commodity price threaten expose weakness country region whose recent growth come almost exclusively increase expenditure finance chinese boom. in particular, especially important point region work hard maintain health fiscal external accounts. thank you. bi central bankers’ speech 1 zeti akhtar aziz: finance real economy – foster sustainability speech dr zeti akhtar aziz, governor central bank malaysia, islamic development bank (idb) regional lecture series islamic economics, finance banking: “finance real economy – foster sustainability”, jakarta, 19 december 2012. * * * i honour invite deliver inaugural lecture islamic development bank regional lecture series. i also delight back jakarta. i would like thank islamic development bank invitation, bank indonesia kindly host event. for three decade now, islamic development bank important role promote economic growth development many part world, associate this, role foster development islamic finance. it support build key international financial infrastructure important orderly global development islamic finance safeguard financial stability. the islamic development bank also support research education effort area, strategic interest financial institution different jurisdiction important catalyst establishment expansion. in current uncertain environment, aftermath recent global financial crisis, role islamic development bank continue important, give goal sustainable growth development world economy become even challenging. a conventional financial system currently confront perhaps define period, several important lesson draw collective effort build resilient financial systems. important consideration need accord issue emerged, policy direction affect growth stability. my address today discus several issues, discus islamic finance, give nature inherent features, contribute process enhance discipline contribute ensure growth financial stability. at core, financial system need serve real economy. the purpose financial system intermediation – is, match save investment purpose generate economic growth. yet, recent decades, number factor contribute weaken link financial intermediation productive economic activity. deregulation open new opportunity financial institution enhance performance expand scope activities. great competition, reinforce significant advance technology, intensify pace innovation. and, extend period low inflation low interest rate incentivised great risk-taking. cumulatively, development contribute dangerous build-up financial imbalances. this prompt rethink issue relate financial business models, wide-ranging regulatory reform international community. relate issue question “appropriate” size financial sector. a economy develop, size financial sector asset and, correspondingly, value-added contribution financial sector, expect increase. however, fundamental relationship growth financial sector real economy, relationship well-understood capture current macroeconomic models. this create potential challenge policymakers determine point growth financial sector may outstrip demand potential real economy. this issue become even pronounce great regional global financial integration, country also international financial centres. to extent corporate personal income growth drive financial transaction rather increase production 2 bi central bankers’ speech employment growth, economy become potentially vulnerable consequence financial system stress. the recent global financial crisis provide distinct example excessive leverage exponential growth financial activity detach growth trajectory real economy become source instability. leverage increase sharply year lead crisis, buoy year strong economic growth. in advance economies, bank balance sheet exploded, grow multiple annual gdp. for example, case iceland, three large bank nationalise early october 2008 see total asset expand 100 percent gdp 2004, 900 percent gdp end-2007. similarly ireland, asset financial institution substantial domestic business 400 percent gdp 2008, unite kingdom, bank asset 500 percent gdp prior global financial crisis. the sheer size, complexity leverage bank system increase fragility financial institution limit ability absorb even small losses, thereby result widespread deep economic dislocations. this expansion financial activity also part due activity shadow bank system, unite states, grow even large traditional bank sector gross terms. at height crisis, size gross amount outstanding over-the-counter (otc) derivative globally estimate 614 trillion u dollars1, ten time global gdp. despite size, over-the-counter market opaque inadequately regulated, make difficult quantify risk assume financial institutions. a issue relate financial innovation policy intervention stifle innovation beneficial society, rein harmful. the current debate international financial reform continue reveal challenge task. while wide support return basic banking, also acknowledge financial innovation instrumental improve financial access levels, enable financial institution manage risk way allow higher-risk economic activity undertaken. contrary evidence, however, also exists. in run-up crisis, derivative extensively use arbitrage regulatory requirement extract excessive profit opaque complex transaction result fundamental mispricing risk. current reform effort therefore confront need strike balance constrain harmful practices, without restrict innovation key progressive financial system. another issue relate prospect align expectation capital provider imperative sustainable banking. in year precede crisis, growth financial system substantially exceed overall economy. publish data2 indicate balance sheet world’s large 1000 bank increase 150 percent 2001 2009. at peak, scale asset financial sector far exceed sectors, record profit report year year. in current environment, bank continue remain considerable pressure support activity generate kind rate return capital provider come expect industry. this run counter expectation bank return fundamental role support real economic

activities, prohibit subsidiary undertake business risks. solution challenge far straightforward. while reform basel committee financial stability board expect far reach implication landscape financial system know today, yet provide answer many key question policymakers financial industry need address pursuit effective function sound financial system progress forward future. since global financial crisis, significant attention direct evolve effective macro-prudential policy framework, serve rein excess strengthen nexus finance real economy. the concept macro-prudential policy hardly new trace back early late 1970s, reference macroeconomic financial stability implication rapid pace lend develop economies3. some emerge markets, include asia, have, since 1990s, deploy macro-prudential policy instrument manage imbalance financial system capital flows. follow recent global financial crisis, great attention focus role, scope, instrument governance arrangement macro-prudential policy preserve financial stability. new strengthen mandate macro-prudential policy establish grow number jurisdictions, support wide-ranging change legislative framework institutional structures. use effectively combination policy tools, include micro-prudential measure monetary fiscal policy tools, macro-prudential policy demonstrate significantly improve financial stability outcomes. effectively operationalising macro-prudential policy frameworks, however, remain key challenge. by design, macro-prudential policy intend reduce probability severity future crisis. while research deepen understand lead indicator transmission channels, judgment continue key role. history show political economic consideration have, times, effect willingness policymakers act. despite high cost crisis financial system economy society, still inherent bias towards inaction. this underscore need strong focus create environment policymakers confidence act. this require strong mandate, sufficient policy instruments, clear accountability structures. while macro-prudential policy clear important role contribute towards financial stability move forward, however diminish important role micro-prudential supervision. indeed, notion develop macro-prudential policy framework can, time, provide credible alternative close supervision systemic financial institution – example, development good predictive macro indicators, reliance recovery resolution plan alone – misplaced. there substitute effective ongoing supervision financial institutions, rely supervisory assessment judgments, enhance understand firm behaviour manner model plans, matter sophisticated, never able fully achieve. effort therefore also accord towards strengthen 3 base article entitle “the term ‘macro-prudential’: origin evolution” publish bi quarterly review march 2010, contain excerpt unpublished minute meet cooke committee (the precursor present basel committee bank supervision) 4 bi central bankers’ speech conduct micro-prudential supervision promote complementarity micro- macro-prudential policies. let turn remark grow role relevance islamic finance contribute global agenda foster sustainable growth firmly anchor real economy. the core proposition islamic finance draw inherent feature value bring economy, tremendous potential offer support sustainable economic growth safeguard financial stability. these core proposition derive shariah, dictate islamic financial transaction must support underlie productive activities. this shariah rule ensure close link financial transaction real economy. innovation intermediation islamic finance thus align generate productive economic activities. there also strong discouragement excessive risk undertake prohibition speculative elements. these rule also serve insulate islamic financial system excessive leverage, turn contribute towards promote financial stability long-term sustainability. these fundamental element resonate call bank focus core function provide financial service add value real economy. this recent decade also witness dramatic transformation islamic financial landscape. it mark sustain rapid growth widen geographical reach, result diverse islamic financial institution generation wide spectrum innovative products, particularly high-growth segment sukuk market. in decade, islamic finance also evolve domestic-centric become increasingly internationalised. in dynamic environment, scope islamic finance business expand simple retail trade finance include private equity, project finance, sukuk origination issuance, well fund wealth management products. today, total global size islamic financial asset surpass 1 trillion u dollars. there 600 islamic financial institution operate 75 countries. the vision islamic financial system malaysia articulate first financial sector masterplan launch year 2001, plan build foundation islamic financial system outlined. this include strengthen diversify financial intermediary financial system, build develop financial markets, enhance regulatory supervisory, shariah legal framework. ten year later, 2011, new financial sector blueprint launched, chart path islamic finance transition become increasingly internationalised, thus become integrate mainstream global financial system. whilst islamic finance ingredient potential meet need global economy, channel fund productive activity islamic finance today still largely carry non-participatory contracts, include mark-up sale (murabahah) lease-based (ijarah) structures, continue remain essential cater finance trade purchase assets. such contract similar lend instrument expose islamic financial institution mostly credit risk elements. whilst non-risk-sharing contract continue contribute future growth islamic finance, wide use risk-sharing transaction undertake participatory finance model significant scope evolve broad representation islamic financial product spur next phase industry growth development. this include participatory equity-based contract mudarabah musharakah support venture involve entrepreneurship endeavours. great use equity-based model islamic financial solution observe recent period. this evident sukuk segment, shariah structure evolve predominantly ijarah murabahah structure musharakah partnership well convertible exchangeable trusts. bi central bankers’ speech 5 the development participatory islamic finance contract broad scale offer particular potential effort reinforce link finance real economy. several element risk- profit-sharing participatory contract support this. a profit-sharing loss-bearing clearly identify agree base contractual agreement financier entrepreneur, strong emphasis place value creation economic viability productive effort create new wealth. in equity-based contracts, financial intermediation thus also direct towards promote entrepreneurship, clearly define risk- profit-sharing characteristic islamic financial transaction provide strong incentive party contribute success investment. this also provide foundation long-term trust-based relationship, clear interest financial institution undertake appropriate due diligence ensure return commensurate risk assumed. aspect governance risk management thus strongly underpin contracts. in particular, contract demand high standard disclosure transparency observed, turn act strengthen market discipline. the legal, regulatory supervisory framework need adjust accord great clarity appropriate legal regulatory treatment order foster sound orderly growth risk-sharing structure activities, term fund assets-side islamic banks. in malaysia, step currently take provide conducive enable environment next phase development spur risk-sharing transaction though formulation new legislation islamic bank takaful. this legislation final stage process enactment. this new law industry aim promote certainty legal regulatory treatment islamic financial transaction provide legal recognition contractual requirement accordance shariah. this provide comprehensive legal environment effective risk profit share activity take place, encompass aspect islamic financial transactions, prudential business conduct requirement legal treatment islamic bank asset upon resolution, fully consistent distinctive element respective shariah contract employ transactions. this legal framework also enhance capacity regulatory supervisory framework malaysian islamic finance industry evolve great alignment international regulatory supervisory standard best practice issue islamic financial service board (ifsb) govern specificity islamic financial transactions. to complement effort strengthen regulatory law islamic finance, malaysia also establish law harmonisation committee 2010 undertake objective review relevant law recommend legislative change ensure law country would allow islamic financial transaction take place effectively efficiently. another important dimension foster development risk profit share instrument need ensure institutional soundness islamic financial institution enhance ability ass risk real sector. this underscore imperative robust risk management capability manage new risk peculiar risk profit share contract adoption strong governance, transparency disclosure practice within islamic financial institution meet due diligence requirement determine viability business investment proposals. business risk equity position ownership risk underlie asset are, example, embed arrangement arise contractual relationship investor entrepreneur well islamic bank institution intermediary funds. further in-depth apply research also need develop innovative financial product use risk profit share structure correspond development risk management techniques. this also need reinforce enhance consumer protection education initiative deepen understand awareness consumer 6 bi central bankers’ speech associate risk reward islamic financial contracts, particular equity-based instruments. equally important ensure institutional soundness islamic financial institution need robust liquidity management. today, islamic financial institution operate different jurisdiction still confront challenge manage liquidity position effectively, give limit supply high quality shariah-compliant liquid instrument reason commonly cited. the lack high quality liquidity instrument islamic finance constrain effective liquidity management, also affect efficient cross-border diversification financial flows. it therefore hope mandate international islamic liquidity management corporation (iilm) issue high-quality liquid sukuks, contribute promote efficient cross-border liquidity management islamic financial institution whilst facilitate islamic financial institution meet international requirement liquidity. let conclude remarks. whilst evolution global financial landscape currently shape need return finance basic function serve real economy, several critical question remain, answer continue important bear global agenda build sound resilient financial system promote sustainable growth. in particular, determine appropriate size financial sector relative economy become risk overall financial system economic stability; promote condition ensure financial innovation beneficial economy; enhance prospect align expectation capital provider sustainable bank strategy present significant policy challenge continue occupy attention policymakers go forward. the global community make important strides, work remain achieve appropriate balance preserve safety soundness financial system allow financial institution market perform intend functions. we without policy options. the role macro-prudential policy development islamic finance gain great prominence term potential improve financial stability outcomes, notably vital contribution make towards restore foundation finance support sustainable economic growth, bring immense benefit real economy well-being society. bi central bankers’ speech 1 deepak mohanty: money market monetary operation india speech mr deepak mohanty, executive director reserve bank india, seminar “issues financial markets”, mumbai, 15 december 2012. * * * the assistance provide sitikantha pattanaik, jeevan khundrakpam, binod bhoi rajeev jain acknowledged. i thank mr. g. mahalingam opportunity share think distinguish panel money market. this forum bring together reserve bank practitioner financial market, important perspective market development also foster good understand monetary operations. money market heart monetary operations. over last decade, substantial development indian money market term depth, variety instrument efficiency. this enable reserve bank change monetary operation direct quantity base instrument indirect interest rate base instrument enhance efficiency monetary transmission consistent international best practice. against background, i briefly capture development money market discus experience recently modify operate procedure monetary policy conclude think way forward. role money market money market define market short-term fund maturity range overnight one year include financial instrument consider close substitute money. it provide equilibrate mechanism demand supply short-term fund process provide avenue central bank intervention influence quantum cost liquidity financial system, consistent overall stance monetary policy. in process, money market play central role monetary policy transmission mechanism provide key link operation monetary policy financial market ultimately, real economy. in fact, money market first important stage chain monetary policy transmission. typically, monetary policy instrument, effectively price central bank liquidity, directly set central bank. in view limit control long-term interest rates, central bank adopt strategy exert direct influence short-term interest rates. change short-term policy rate provide signal financial markets, whereby different segment financial system respond adjust rate return various instruments, depend sensitivity efficacy transmission mechanism. how quickly effectively monetary policy action influence spectrum market interest rate depend upon level development various segment financial markets, particularly money market. cross-country study suggest domestic financial market grow, transmission monetary policy various channel become better. a crucial initial link chain monetary policy aim achieve ultimate goal relate inflation growth, money market development closely monitor influence central banks. besides expect money market rate respond policy rate change well anchor manner, central bank aim ensure appropriate liquidity condition discretionary liquidity management operation money market function normally. money market also important fund market bank financial institutions, times, even corporates. stress condition money market could increase moral hazard bank expect central bank function lender first resort. follow recent global financial crisis, money market fund financial system effectively get replace central bank fund advance countries. money 2 bi central bankers’ speech market rate (like libor euribor) standard benchmark price bonds, loan financial products. market manipulation key benchmark – reportedly happen libor recently – though undermine faith money market. a sound money market would ensure condition bank conduct business safely. money market transaction could secure unsecured, i.e., without collaterals. what one expect secure unsecured markets? the unsecured market primarily promote market discipline. loan uncollateralised market, lender directly expose risk non-repayment. this work incentive address information asymmetry collect information borrowers. it constant peer monitor promote market discipline. in secure segment money market, lender may address credit risk concern ask sound collateral also apply haircuts, peer monitor could potentially le emphasised. condition market stress lead collateral scarcity fall value collateral could stifle even secure money market. illiquidity spiral financial markets, i.e., financial instrument hold asset turn illiquid, may lead situation central bank would require dilute collateral standard liquidity injection, even exchange good quality security security face illiquidity risks. this become necessary unfreeze market general. after global crisis, asset quality, particularly liquidity, receive great policy focus. money market rate also reflect market expectation policy rate could evolve near term. a per standard expectation hypothesis, money market rate different time duration equal expect future short-term rates, plus term premium risk premium. bernanke (2004)1 examine expectation likely future course federal fund rate respond fed’s policy action statement note “...our find support view fomc statement prove powerful tool affect market expectation future course federal fund rate”. empirical research suggest short end money market, influence policy rate, stable, le volatile, may help keep term premium lower, compare period volatile short rate get transmit entire money market simultaneously term premium rises. with sophistication financial market render money, output price relationship unstable, early 1980s, major central bank begin emphasise price channel, i.e., policy interest rate monetary policy transmission. a result, role money market become important signal transmission monetary policy. thus, development money market across country term instrument participant vary risk profile necessitate change operate procedure monetary policy. in case india, ultimate goal monetary policy, i.e., price stability growth, remain unchanged years. in recent years, financial stability consider additional objective monetary policy. however, operational intermediate objective monetary policy undergo periodic change response change economic financial environment. the development money market year relative stability call money market enable reserve bank move away quantity-based instrument price-based instrument multiple indicator approach adopt since 1998. accordingly, overnight call rate, use implicitly operate target since institution liquidity adjustment facility (laf) 2000, become explicit adoption new operate procedure may 2011. 1 bernanke, ben s. (2004), “central bank talk monetary policy”, at japan society corporate luncheon, new york, october 7. bi central bankers’ speech 3 money market india financial reform india begin early 1990s. however, various segment domestic financial markets, viz., money market, debt market forex market undergo significant shift mainly 1990s. earlier, indian money market characterise paucity instruments, lack depth distortion market micro-structure. it mainly consist uncollateralised call market, treasury bills, commercial bill participation certificates. follow recommendation chakravarty committee (1985), reserve bank adopt monetary target framework. at time, effort make develop money market follow recommendation vaghul committee (1987). in regard, important development were: (i) set discount finance house india (dfhi) 1988 impart liquidity money market instrument help development secondary market instruments; (ii) introduction instrument certificate deposit (cds) 1989 commercial paper 1990 inter-bank participation certificate without risk 1988 increase range instruments; (iii) free call money rate may 1989 enable price discovery. however, function market continue hind number structural rigidity skew distribution liquidity prevalence administer deposit lend rate banks. recognise rigidities, pace reform money market accelerated. follow recommendation internal work group (1997) narasimham committee (1998), comprehensive set measure undertake reserve bank develop money market. these included: (i) withdrawal interest rate ceiling money market; (ii) introduction auction treasury bills; (iii) gradual move away cash credit system loan-based system. maturity exist instrument cp cd also gradually shorten encourage wide participation. most importantly, ad hoc treasury bill abolish 1997 thereby put stop automatic monetisation fiscal deficit. this enhance instrument independence reserve bank (table 1). table 1 major development money market since 1990s 1. abolition

nds-call november 2012. 10. repo corporate bond allow march 2010. 11. operationalisation report platform secondary market transaction cps cd july 2010. 4 bi central bankers’ speech more importantly, effort make transform call money market primarily inter-bank market, encourage market participant migrate towards collateralised segment market, thereby increase overall market stability diversification. in order facilitate phase corporate non-banks call money market, new instrument market repos collateralised borrow lend obligation (cblo) introduce provide avenue manage short-term liquidity. non-bank entity completely exit call money market august 2005. in order minimise default risk ensure balance development various market segments, reserve bank institute prudential limit exposure bank primary dealer (pds) call/notice money market. in april 2005, limit link capital fund (sum tier i tier ii capital) schedule commercial banks. in order improve transparency efficiency money market, report call/notice money market transaction negotiate deal system (nds) within 15 minute conclusion transaction make mandatory. furthermore, screen-based negotiate quote-driven system deal call/notice term money market (nds-call), develop clear corporation india limit (ccil), operationalised september 2006 ensure good price discovery. begin june 2000, reserve bank introduce full-fledged liquidity adjustment facility (laf) operate overnight fix rate repo reverse repo november 2004. this help develop interest rate important instrument monetary transmission. it also provide great flexibility reserve bank determine quantum liquidity well rate respond need system daily basis (chart 1). bi central bankers’ speech 5 in development various constituent money market, significant aspect growth collateralised market vis-à-vis uncollateralised market. over last decade, daily turnover call money market either stagnate declined, collateralised segment, market repo plus cblo, increase manifold (chart 2). since 2007–08, cp cd volume also increase significantly (chart 3). furthermore, issuance 91-treasury bill also increase sharply (chart 4). the overall money market much large relative gdp decade ago. 6 bi central bankers’ speech alongside, rate return various instrument money market show great co-movement, especially since introduction laf (table 2 & chart 5). table 2 interest rate money market (percent per annum: annual averages) bi central bankers’ speech 7 monetary operate procedure the development money market well grow inter-linkages segment financial market enable reserve bank alter operate procedure monetary policy consistent objective monetary policy. base recommendation chakravarty committee (1985), monetary target framework feedback introduce mid-1980s, reserve money use operate target broad money (m3) intermediate target. by mid-1990s, framework render increasingly inadequate due several developments. structural reform financial liberalisation lead paradigm shift finance government commercial sector increasingly market-determined interest rate exchange rate. development various segment financial market lead deepen financial sector. this provide reserve bank effectively transmit policy signal indirect instrument interest rates. on hand, increase liquidity emanate capital inflow raise ratio net foreign asset reserve money render control monetary aggregate difficult. with financial innovations, stability demand function money also come question. recognise challenge grow complexity monetary management, reserve bank switch multiple indicator approach 1998–99. under approach, host macroeconomic indicator include interest rate different segment financial markets, along indicator currency, lend bank financial institutions, fiscal position, trade, capital flows, inflation rate, exchange rate, refinance transaction foreign exchange available high frequency basis juxtapose output data draw implication monetary policy formulation. however, approach continue evolve augment forward-looking indicator draw reserve bank’s various survey panel parsimonious time series model (mohanty, 2011).2 along multiple indicator approach, operate procedure also undergo change follow recommendation narasimham committee ii (1998). the rbi introduce 2 mohanty, deepak (2010), “monetary policy framework india: experience multiple-indicators approach”, rbi bulletin, march 2010. 8 bi central bankers’ speech interim liquidity adjustment facility (ilaf) april 1999, liquidity injection do bank rate liquidity absorption fix reverse repo rate. the ilaf gradually transit full-fledged liquidity adjustment facility (laf) periodic modification base experience development financial market payment system. the laf operate overnight fix rate repo reverse repo november 2004, provide informal corridor call money rate. though laf help develop interest rate instrument monetary transmission, two major weakness come fore. first lack single policy rate, operate policy rate alternate repo deficit liquidity situation reverse repo rate surplus liquidity condition. second lack firm corridor, effective overnight interest rate dip (rose) (above) reverse repo (repo) rate extreme surplus (deficit) conditions. recognise shortcomings, new operate procedure put place may 2011. let elaborate key feature new operate procedure. first, weight average overnight call money rate explicitly recognise operate target monetary policy.3 second, repo rate make one independently vary policy rate. third, new marginal stand facility (msf) institute schedule commercial bank (scbs) could borrow overnight 100 basis point repo rate one per cent respective net demand time liability (ndtl). this limit subsequently raise two per cent ndtl addition, scbs allow borrow fund msf overnight basis excess slr hold well. moreover, bank rate discount rate align msf rate. fourth, revise corridor define fix width 200 basis points. the repo rate place middle corridor, reverse repo rate 100 basis point msf rate well bank rate 100 basis point (chart 6). thus, new operate procedure, three rate announce reserve bank, i.e., reverse repo rate, msf rate bank rate, link single policy repo rate. the new operate procedure expect improve implementation transmission monetary policy follow reasons. first, explicit announcement operate target make market participant clear desire policy impact. second, single policy rate remove confusion arise policy rate alternate repo reverse repo rates, make signal monetary policy stance accurate. third, msf provide safety valve unanticipated liquidity shocks. fourth, fix interest rate corridor set msf rate reverse repo rate, reduce uncertainty communication difficulty help keep overnight average call money rate close repo rate. let turn brief evaluation experience new operate procedure. in implementation new procedure, reserve bank prefer keep systemic liquidity deficit mode monetary transmission find effective situation (rbi, 2011).4 the reserve bank also announce indicative liquidity comfort zone (+)/(–) 1.0 per cent net demand time liability (ndtl) banks. 3 even though share call money market overnight money market low collateralised segment, weight overnight call rate use operate target. this partly account high correlation overnight call money rate collaterallised money market rate 0.9. the issue examine detail work group operate procedure monetary policy observe transmission policy rate overnight call money rate strong overnight money market rate. in addition, call money market pure inter-bank market and, hence, good reflect net liquidity situation. 4 reserve bank india (2011), report work group operate procedure monetary policy (chairman: deepak mohanty), march. bi central bankers’ speech 9 since may 2011, liquidity condition broadly divide three distinct phases. after generally remain within reserve bank’s comfort zone first phase may–october 2011, liquidity deficit cross one per cent ndtl level november 2011 june 2012. this large liquidity deficit mainly cause forex intervention increase divergence credit deposit growth. the deficit condition aggravate frictional factor like build-up government cash balance reserve bank persist long anticipate increase currency circulation. accordingly, reserve bank actively manage liquidity injection liquidity way open market operation (omos) cut cash reserve ratio (crr) banks. this support decline currency circulation reduction government cash balance reserve bank. a result, significant ease liquidity condition since july 2012 extent deficit broadly return reserve bank’s comfort level one per cent ndtl (chart 7). 10 bi central bankers’ speech since implementation, systemic liquidity deficit mode, help good transmission policy rate various segment money markets. first, overnight interest rate stable since implementation (chart 8). second, repo rate weight call rate far closely align new operate procedure earlier; imply improve transmission monetary policy term movement call money market interest rate (chart 9). bi central bankers’ speech 11 third, call money rate turn observe good align money market interest rate implementation new operate procedure (chart 10). conclusion let conclude. our experience show development money market refinement operate procedure monetary policy move tandem. financial sector reform along reserve bank’s emphasis development various segment financial market enable shift operate procedure base direct quantity-based instrument indirect interest rate-based instruments. the reserve bank able good transmit monetary policy signal money market single policy repo rate. 12 bi central bankers’ speech evidence far suggest significant improvement monetary policy transmission new operate framework. in order reinforce process, i make three suggestions. first, swift transmission policy rate short-end money market, partly due prevalence market liquidity deficit mode. however, ensure market liquidity deficit mode desire level sustain basis contingent reserve bank’s ability effectively conduct omos market appetite operations. hence, need develop market micro-structure enhance secondary market transaction government security facilitate smooth conduct omos. second, laf appropriate instrument manage liquidity endure nature. a system expect deficit, need develop term repo minimise daily requirement liquidity. third, notwithstanding significant advance develop market, term structure money market incomplete. it is, therefore, desirable extend yield curve beyond overnight rate develop term-money market. thank you. bi central bankers’ speech 1 mario draghi: hear committee economic monetary affair european parliament introductory statement mr mario draghi, president european central bank, hear committee economic monetary affair european parliament, brussels, 17 december 2012. * * * madam chair, honourable member committee economic monetary affairs, it pleasure back parliament front committee last exchange view 2012. this year easy one. it year tie bind member state euro area tested. but also year longer-term vision economic monetary union (emu) formulated. and year vision begin translate actions, include vital reform european governance. we end year positive note re-launching longer-term vision, proactive step take government european institution towards genuine emu and, recently, unanimous agreement ecofin establish single supervisory mechanism (ssm). let congratulate committee swift adoption position ssm ambitious european approach. this clear demonstration european institution determine act timely decisive way complete emu. and clear demonstration euro area member state ready agree substantial share sovereignty circumstance require. recent agreement mark major qualitative step towards stable emu. the establishment ssm expect key turn point resolution current challenges. the ssm contribute restore confidence bank sector across euro area. it help revive inter-bank lend cross-border credit flows, tangible effect real economy. and combine possible direct recapitalisation bank european stability mechanism envisage single resolution mechanism, ssm go long way towards break vicious feedback loop sovereign banks. i hope legislative process conclude swiftly. after adoption relevant legal acts, european central bank (ecb) launch preparation ssm establish within timeline foresee legislators. in introductory remark today, i first briefly summarise economic monetary situation. i address relationship monetary policy financial supervision. and i close outline view priority 2013 implement share longer-term vision emu. 1. economic monetary development since last meeting, ecb leave key interest rate unchanged: main refinance rate stand 0.75%; rate deposit facility 0%; rate marginal lend facility 1.50%. 2 bi central bankers’ speech on non-standard monetary policy measures, govern council decide december continue conduct refinance operation fix rate tender procedure full allotment, least july 2013. the medium-term outlook economic activity remain challenging. economic activity contract second consecutive quarter third quarter 2012, indicator fourth quarter signal weakness, although recent survey indicator stabilise low level financial market sentiment improve further. domestic demand dampen still weak consumer investor sentiment ongoing balance sheet adjustment bank business sectors, continue weigh investment decisions. we expect economic weakness extend next year gradual recovery second half year. the recovery expect support strengthen global demand, highly accommodative monetary policy stance significantly improve confidence financial markets, work way spend investment decisions. annual inflation euro area continue moderate, fall 2.5% october 2.2% november. look ahead, inflation expect decline further. this support real disposable incomes. risk outlook price development broadly balanced. inflation expectation euro area remain firmly line govern council’s aim maintain annual inflation rate below, close to, 2%. our monetary analysis paint picture consistent price stability. look development several months, underlie pace monetary expansion, account special factors, remain subdued. loan dynamic also subdue many part euro area, credit contracting. this result balance sheet adjustment bank business well current economic weakness. 2. monetary policy financial supervision let turn first topic choose exchange views, namely relationship monetary policy financial supervision. the discussion lead recent decision establish ssm raise question monetary policy responsibility supervisory responsibility appropriately separated. in recent years, many central bank have, good reasons, assume supervisory roles. fourteen 17 national central bank euro area role supervision several major central bank elsewhere world. indeed, global financial crisis generally lead close tie central bank financial supervision. the bank england, example, soon assume supervisory responsibility previously assign financial service authority. in us, role feed financial supervision strengthened. this suggest relationship monetary policy financial supervision particularly important time crisis. it chance historically first central bank supervisor commercial banks. the ecb establish clear guide principle internal operate practice ensure effective separation monetary policy financial supervision. let briefly elaborate. first, ecb’s involvement financial supervision bear whatsoever primary objective price stability. it bear neither objective itself, statutory, quantify expression inflation rate below, close to, 2%. bi central bankers’ speech 3 second, supervisory board form centre gravity conduct financial supervision. it may encompass geographical entity somewhat wide euro area if, hope, several country currently euro area member state decide join ssm. third, separation monetary policy financial supervision particular take form independent analysis prescription use policy tool two functions. this rely strong governance. we establish appropriate internal procedure ensure clear functional separation. here follow international best practice. while separation two function essential, establish fact strong supervision facilitate conduct monetary policy. let give two examples. first, absence financial stability, standard monetary policy tool – namely, change short-term interest rate – lose potency. effective supervision contribute stable financial system benefit smooth transmission monetary policy. second, effective financial supervision counteract excessive leverage exuberant credit expansions, generate inflationary pressure long term. thus, mitigate build-up macroeconomic imbalances, effective supervision foster stable macroeconomic environment stable prices. monetary policy stay credibly orient towards price stability. in doing, secure trust market public stable purchase power currency. this stabilise market expectations, low volatility create environment stable financial markets. we begin internal reflection issues, together national central banks, stand ready launch formal preparation soon legal framework adopted. 3. a genuine economic monetary union let turn second topic choose exchange views, namely genuine economic monetary union. in spring year, three year severe economic financial challenges, become clear euro area need coherent longer-term vision emu. at april hearing, discuss vision, follow early discussion committee fiscal compact growth compact. the vision lay great detail head state government. since time, remarkable progress made. the june european council important milestone. institutional change conceivable le year ago put eu political agenda finalised. the ssm prime example political momentum. last week, european council set step towards completion emu. the in-depth discussion structural reform challenge competitiveness particularly important – reflect council’s conclusions. from ecb perspective, i see two main priority 2013. first, improve function economic union. excessive imbalance within euro area destabilise emu. this must allow happen again. it encourage adjustment visibly underway. for example, export good service increase 27% volume spain since 2009 – 14% ireland, 4 bi central bankers’ speech 22% portugal 21% italy. these four country also experience gain relative unit labour costs. economic reform bear fruit, even if, short term, cost individual citizen considerable. but reform right path. government persevere. what do european level provide even support process? the propose “reform contracts” euro area member state eu institution promise avenue. combine carefully design framework target temporary financial support, contribute foster structural reform thereby strengthen competitiveness. ideally, reform contract focus country large competitiveness challenges. they identify structural bottleneck improve competitiveness target reform way remove bottlenecks. this would establish clear link reform restore competitiveness, essential growth job creation. smooth function product labour market prerequisite growth job creation emu. i therefore welcome announcement next year european commission undertake systematic review product labour markets. for euro area country review allow ass whether market fully compatible participation emu. here, product labour market must provide enhance adjustment capacity adapt change global economic environment ensure sustain high level employment. the second priority 2013 ecb’s perspective completion financial union establishment single resolution mechanism. the aim resolution deal non-viable bank measure include orderly wind closure preserve financial stability. such mechanism make possible bank fail orderly manner. improve economic union restore competitiveness function product labour market one hand, set single resolution framework hand key priority 2013. this committee always push ambitious european solution field financial economic governance. i confident play instrumental role move agenda forward adopt relevant legislative proposals. thank attention. i disposal questions. bi

communication technology play vital role across many industry sectors, result positive impact economic development cut across geographical barriers. it important note financial sector particularly bank industry one first utilize information technology way back 1960s, thus record influence development process technology. the bank sector example information technology infrastructure implication economic development many nation across jurisdictions. study show information technology couple knowledge management hold much potential propel development process (okpaku, 2003). since 1990s, bank sector india see great emphasis place technology innovation. bank begin use technology initially view take care internal requirement pertain book keeping, balance transaction processing; all-pervasive face information technology soon enable bank provide good quality service great speed. internet bank mobile bank make possible customer access bank service literally virtually anywhere anytime. the big barriers, time distance, access bank service cross leverage technology. the sector also move rapidly towards universal bank electronic transactions, change way bank done, last decade so. take case

slew product – card payments, neft transfer, rtgs transfer, ecs/necs payments, mobile payment etc. further, use payment methods, first instrument turn mobile phone confirmatory messages, feature

i address group cios, i would like 5 cio anniversary issue – november 2012. bi central bankers’ speech 7 leave think transform super cio use technology differently: use big data bank would need think big data. collect analyse transactional data give bank insight customer’s preferences. it use create new product service allow bank remedy emerge problem efficient manner. however one word caution, may need skilled personnel work tool analyse data. lead what cio need independent thought, open-mindedness, flexibility ability learn continuously. technology expect student life. you also need ‘‘fire

publish 14 december 2012. * * * the follow edit transcript interview. ft do think historian look back, say year euro rescued? md this year view remember year long-term vision euro euro area re-launched. the june summit, especially, key event. it’s also year euro area government achieve substantial progress adjust economies. and it’s year ecb step remove tail risks. ft why june summit important? md the june summit important because, first time many years, lay medium-term vision genuine economic monetary union, make four pillars: fiscal union, so-called bank union, economic union political union, endorse leaders. that important milestone. ft this extension maastricht framework prove inadequate? md exactly. the leader build maastricht strong fiscal discipline. in euro area country cannot pursue economic policy completely independent way, ignore implication member states. this one main conclusion summit. sovereignty something need shared. ft wa june summit precondition omt? md no, decision omt mean pursue, within mandate, objective deliver price stability. the removal tail risk relate unfounded fear regard euro essential fight fragmentation euro area markets. and important fragmentation – i’ve stress many time – position deliver price stability euro area whole. ft when become clear take step central bank? md clear visible sign fragmentation u since second half last year, gradually lead euro area-wide credit crunch year-end. then ecb conduct two ltro operations, remove another type risk, namely possibility bank crisis cause lack liquidity. they powerful effect calm financial market time. but then, end april year, saw type spread widen again, amount short position euro pick up. these sign make clear fragmentation reach point beyond would able deliver price stability. ft i’m go explore crucial approach, adopt omt clearly said, one, would conditional. and, two, act within ecb mandate. but i that, i want turn reel back start ask strategy, seem strategy. you may convince could save euro, or, least, re-launch euro, strategy. be right, improvised? md there certainly deep reflection go month before, ecb govern council, cope fragmentation. the objective still restore financially integrate monetary area. the omt result 2 bi central bankers’ speech reflection. the first element acknowledgment economist call “bad equilibrium”, namely, situation self-reinforcing expectation that, leave own, produce disruptive outcomes. it’s vicious circle break, never forget find “bad equilibrium” begin with, previous ten year several government euro area pursue economic policy either plainly wrong, simply missing, world change fast. ft but crucial point different quality intervention approach early year ecb. you say conditional unlimited, whereas early limit unconditional. md that’s difference omt smp. ft but say, look, understand, historically politically, it’s limit unconditional, isn’t working. we move beyond that. wa argue that, think within ecb, everybody understand it? md there sense among u smp run steam term effectiveness. ft all top financier say they’ve get unlimited ecb capacity. of course, conditionality crucial win support within govern council, even important berlin. md the decision take total full independence. certainly, conditionality, set-up like ours, essential two reasons. one it’s form credit enhancement bond issue country apply omt comply conditions, creditworthy bonds. the second reason type intervention, moral hazard avoid fiscal discipline, particular, ensured. that’s conditionality crucial, necessary condition event govern council ass independently state monetary fragmentation. let’s forget objective fight financial fragmentation deliver price stability. ft let go back political element. i respect you’re say ecb’s paramount independence, but, time, you’re monk cells. you don’t sort deliberate within monastery come something. md today central bank independent, head non-elected officials, quite powerful. this set-up acceptable independence limit mandate. that’s framework legislator give u – independence limit mandate. that’s keen respect mandate, that’s true guarantee independence, especially euro area set-up crucial credibility. and credibility essential deliver price stability. ft surely it’s also important you, though, politically you’re see within mandate. md certainly that’s ecb transparent accountable. ft return question conditionally, important critics, particularly germany, say remove incentive government act. how counter that? md quite contrary. conditionality make sure government make necessary reform maintain fiscal discipline. ft let rephrase question. how restore endure confidence high level conditionality? i’m talk kind resolution crisis, conditionality tight, severe, government don’t act and, therefore, nothing happens. bi central bankers’ speech 3 md the assessment conditionality primarily hand european commission, esm, imf. but also forget ultimate assessment whether act entirely hand govern council. ft you announce programme; immediately favourable reaction markets, remarkable. many people assume government would apply, haven’t. what conclusion see? md the purpose omt remove tail risks. it’s government decide upon programme. we never take stance proactive sense encourage government discourage government apply. let’s forget esm tax-payers’ money, decision take government national parliaments. and true potential applicants’ reform budget consolidation. the role ecb, stage, back stage, front line. it’s government decide. ft again, let’s step back minute. it’s tumultuous, extraordinary year. you lead player drama. there others, obviously. chancellor merkel, mario monti. what moment stick mind? let’s look say risk really high need act, think blur events. md the speech london 26 july moment. if look verbatim, doesn’t say anything that’s outside mandate. but indeed it’s especially strong speech make firm statement preservation euro. ft it very, firm statement. how come wording? “whatever takes... and, believe me, enough,” – dramatic pause before. md again, sense overcome limitation smp, make sure signal market would proportionate gravity situation. that’s actually behind statement. ft do rehearse pause? md no, i’m really theatrical. but situation moment clearly show tail risk increasing. so intervention make important critical situation evolving. ft you intend reaction market. wa intention? md what i think market know stance was. this objective speech. it mean absolutely clear determination. i also make point determination also leaders’ determination carry june summit conclusions. i say market underestimate leaders’ determination amount political capital invest euro. this i say first add it’s intention firm whatever take within mandate. ft and, really clear, clear speech, remark anybody outside capitals? md no, absolutely not. ft so seminal moment. what moment 2012 felt perhaps sense relief? without over-confidence, maybe mood shifted. md wa moment? ft i hop you’d say that. md that’s i feel like. ft i want come back question public opinion, important. when decide decide go bundestag? 4 bi central bankers’ speech md in interview süddeutsche zeitung journalist ask whether i would speak bundestag i invited, explain good germany intention are. i respond i invited, i would ready go. a day interview i receive invitation president lammert. there genuine interest bundestag know great detail policy decision, time controversial germany, applaud rest world. ft there’s serious point german public opinion. do think it’s become euro-sceptical year, difficult economic circumstances? md the difficult economic circumstance everywhere euro area might cause different sense perception euro. these serious moments. when i’m ask whether i persuade german public opinion, i say i don’t know. but i know duty explain, really work very, hard front. hopefully result follow. and hold true euro area public opinion. ft you see britain it’s move towards question membership european union. can perhaps turn question come next – economic growth adjustment process? so, true current account deficit shrink government doing, many ways, courageous things, they’re pass reforms, there’s still question economic growth. what prognosis next 12 months? md last week publish new staff projections, show begin slow recovery second part next year. we serious situation front us. at time, encourage signs. the spread tight four month ago. liquidity condition better, bank corporates fund themselves. bond issuance restarted. and public sector, distress country basically complete sovereign fund plans. furthermore think accommodative monetary policy stance find way economy come months. that’s we’re say may see recovery second part year. also, point, one see benefit fiscal consolidation structural reforms. so far we’ve see contractionary effect fiscal consolidation. we haven’t see yet positive effect structural reform because, obviously, take effect certain lag. and third, see buoyant world growth, help sustain export euro area. ft be bullish america get fiscal cliff? md i’m confident find agreement. ft and even beyond shale gas revolution, re-shoring, property market recovered. they’ve fix banks. md i think well poise positive outcome. it’s interest though two month ago people ask major source uncertainty risk world, answer euro crisis. and it’s fiscal cliff. ft just go back forecast talk about. those actually pretty dramatic downward revision. and good mood financial market pretty fragile, mario monti’s resignation shows. it sound like you’re paint picture glass half full might bite optimistic side. md indeed it’s significant revision downward. at time, medium term outlook price stability hasn’t change dramatic way. and see positive sign soft data come out. ft there many critic fiscal consolidation know. i know you’ve talk before. but problematic ecb push case hard, particularly country like spain greece cause real human misery, given, say before, you’re unelected stick closely mandate. if risk bi central bankers’ speech 5 medium term price stability, maybe case say there’s much austerity right now. md we’re fully aware economic situation several countries, spain greece, serious, underestimate difficulty situation all. let’s forget reason fiscal consolidation become central policy advice ecb one can’t system build debt deficit financial crisis show unsustainable. and progress. to give now, suggest, would tantamount waste great sacrifice make citizen europe. ft yes, martin wolf critique adjustment two-way process austerity pursue rigorously peripheral countries, creditor country must also adjust. they must also bit, which, effect, mean somewhat expansionary policy counteract… md first one must stress inflation policy tool. one doesn’t toy inflation. especially area make several sovereign states. the second point – institutional set-up – choose one policy objective would increase competitiveness. the country successful adjust reform mitigate short-term contractionary effect fiscal policies. country actually manage policy combination chance reduce difficulty come fiscal consolidation. ft be think italy? md no, i’m think ireland. ft a couple questions, one bank union because, addition question we’ve discussed, huge challenge eurozone ecb, you’re go take extra responsibility supervision least large bank eurozone. be institution ready this? be ready this? md we ready. after council regulation enter force, it’d take year set organisation ssm. there many discussion fast move broad scope. one remember passive actor. we hand legislators. it’s clear want move timely fashion, it’s important move well. and intend take time that’s need that. ft would one thing right need sort european-wide bank resolution scheme place take supervision, otherwise you’re situation you’re nominally charge supervise banks. if one need wind up, whatever reason, you’re completely mercy local supervisor local arrangements. you don’t actually power anything. md a european resolution authority important complement ssm, likely place time ssm take responsibilities. but even absence, single supervisor’s assessment possible non-viability bank would strong statement would likely trigger national government’s policy response. ft a personal question, it’s human question, incredible pressure you. if think people world, you’re definitely top five who’ve get pressure places, try hold together. how cope that, number one? and, number two anything surprise place one year? md the way cope pressure never forget part set responsibility one carry job, responsibility deliver price stability; take policy decision affect welfare million people. 6 bi central bankers’ speech i really can’t answer second question say something surprise you, able look back say, oh, thing actually surprise me. and way i function. i look forward, naturally incline focus future. at least i think. but ask colleague too. ft anything add? md i’d like give quote professor zygmunt bauman, polish sociologist become best know analysis postmodernity consumerism. it fact don’t lose sovereignty share it, actually regain it. country high debt deficit understand lose sovereignty long time ago economic policy globalise world. work together stability-oriented union actually mean regain sovereignty high level. ft they’ve lose markets? md yes. and share common rule actually mean regain sovereignty share way rather pretend sovereignty they’ve lose long time ago. that’s point. bi central bankers’ speech 1 eddie yue: evolution financial consumer protection education asia speech mr eddie yue, deputy chief executive hong

distinguish company, important topic. on behalf hong kong monetary authority (hkma), thank join u i look forward discussion today. in discuss consumer education protection, focus must course benefit consumer. that said, element enlighten self-interest rest us. for pathway profit divert around consumer interest. it run right it. indeed, best company – long-term sustainable model growth – operate basis natural synergy good customer good business. this old lesson – it’s one relearn aftermath global financial crisis. one grip aftershock crisis mis-selling complaint financial institutions. such case are, course, deeply damage individual institutions. yet also impact u all. when dust settle successive scandal, last impression threaten reputation individual firms, whole sectors. in case hong kong, financial industry critical economy, obviously carry even importance. now, survey found, fortunate hong kong one high level consumer trust bank financial service compare places.3 but we’ve see financial crisis fragile trust be. so need guard complacency, work towards ensure hong kong remain beacon rest global financial service industry. whether one financial institution, financial regulator consumer, interests. so, get there? in short, argument morning recognise interdependence three groups. each role play, also need help others. and, i would argue, heart interdependence lie effective consumer protection education. i would like discus briefly group turn – first, role financial institutions. “the role financial institutions” a i allude now, financial-services institution direct interest uphold reputation industry whole. i believe success regard rest two pillars. first, nurture culture honesty among practitioners. second, absolute commitment 1 mr andré laboul, head financial affair division, oecd chairman international network financial education. 2 mr ashley alder, chief executive officer, security future commission. 3 see edelman trust barometer 2012, hong kong (hk

(http://www.slideshare.net/davidrbrain/2012-edelman-trust-barometer-hong-kong-deck-1232012checkedfinal#btnnext) 2 bi central bankers’ speech prioritise customer, profit maximisation. or, combine pillars, could summarise single, rather old-fashioned word: integrity. in theory, that’s standard happy sign to. and yet, temptation put product service, profit client, real. i sure see sufficient example different places. i believe number action financial institution take guard dangerous practices. i mention three briefly. first, great transparency disclosure benefit risk investment products. second, responsibility place financial institution respect assess suitability product customer give his/her risk appetite. third, simple procedure free access consumer complaint redress mechanisms. these thing many financial institution embed corporate culture i encourage others same. “the role financial regulator (the hkma)” this bring second group, financial regulators. give role, i focus specifically example hkma. in response change landscape follow collapse lehman brothers, hkma expand effort protect educate consumers, change result creation april 2010 bank conduct department. i focus first work strengthen consumer protection go say something work consumer education. hkma & consumer protection in term consumer protection, first, hkma introduce new requirement bank issue guideline sell investment products. these include (a) require audio-recording customer risk profile assessment sale process provide audit trail review bank regulators; (b) implement pre-investment cooling-off period sale unlisted structure product le sophisticate customer (such elderly first-time buyer); (c) require bank carry continuous review product risk inform investor upward change risk rat product purchased. these requirement addition exist measure introduce hong kong security future commission (sfc) supervision security companies’ sell activities. second, hkma active monitor banks’ compliance regulatory requirement thematic on-site examinations. bank expect control process procedure place ensure adherence conduct regulations. in addition, monitor compliance level among bank staff, hkma conduct mystery shop trips. third, hkma strengthen consumer protection work partners. one example work hong kong association bank carry comprehensive review credit card practice hong kong, draw reform undertake uk us. a result, roll stage 31 measure aim promote fair responsible business practice credit card issuers, become effective 2013. a second example partnership financial service treasury bureau security future commission establish financial dispute resolution centre. the objective help consumer settle monetary dispute quickly mean mediation arbitration. the centre come operation june year. bi central bankers’ speech 3 the hkma & consumer education on consumer education hkma also active. from time time, publish articles, call “insight articles”, increase consumers’ awareness right obligation relation particular consumer product like accumulators, octopus card instalment payment plans. we also highlight key feature risk certain investment products, remind consumer invest understand product. we launch early week “consumer corner” hkma website provide important information local bank consumer issues, include set “frequently ask questions” base public enquiry topical issues. a protection, education, also work partners. among initiatives, join consumer council consumer awareness campaigns. another important initiative i’d like highlight, work security future commission establish investor education centre (iec). the hkma supplement additional consumer education independent iec, focus area bank product services, well investment product may cover iec. “the role consumer” so, well good practice among financial institutions, financial authority also important role play enhance consumer protection education. but focus two group leaf possibly important group – consumer themselves, i devote remain remarks. one thing global financial crisis cast cold light implicit cost household – indeed society financial market – low level financial literacy. financial literacy increasingly recognise important individual life skill people need thrive modern economy like hong kong. without it, consumer risk mis-buying bank employee high risk mis-selling. for example, one hallmark financial sector city universal bank regime allow bank offer basic service well wide range financial products. this great strength industry highly beneficial bank consumers. however, also acknowledge expose customer high risk arise investment complex financial products. i mind especially consumer may le sophisticate may nonetheless high level trust banks. in sense, surprise follow financial crisis, great demand consumer consumer group good understand risk investment product offer banks. this demand amplify number trends, namely: great complexity financial products; rapid pace change financial standard regulations; rise number high net worth individual asia-pacific actively look investment opportunities; recognition regulation alone insufficient protect consumers. financial education thus become important complement market conduct prudential regulation. raise financial competency individual become long-term policy priority financial industry. this particularly crucial hong kong where, know, regulatory framework base disclosure complementary customer suitability assessments. in context, especially important consumer understand product’s feature risk thoroughly consider investments. they decide whether investment suit objectives, whether ability assume associate risks. thus, key component effort enhance financial education protection must improve individuals’ ability ask right question increase awareness ultimately responsible investment decisions. 4 bi central bankers’ speech “conclusion” so, we’ve discuss important consumer protection education are. and we’ve cover role three group bring good protection education. let try bring strand together. something become clear wake financial crisis apparently low-probability risk margin industry profound impact – rules-based system alone inadequate guard them. after crisis, increase recognition u fact operate financial eco-system – respects, fragile system – well-being whole rest health action part. through suasion regulation, financial regulator like hkma lot support consumers. but always one step remote point transaction. that’s look bank financial institution follow rules, show leadership really engage area. institution lot, individually together, self- peer-regulate and, all, ensure integrity throughout organisations, particularly consumer-facing levels. in end, though, financial eco-system other, much depend beat heart – consumer. that’s i believe one best thing room bend effort towards great financial literacy. through initiative good inform empower consumers, judge best interests. that way, benefit accrue individual consumers, sector society widely. education require long term commitment effort u all, prize also great. lady gentlemen, next day so, opportunity make real substantial contribution agenda. for reason, i grateful join us, i much look forward discussion exchange views. together, i sure learn develop many good measures. measure help consumers, also improve health strength financial sector economy widely. thank you. bi central bankers’ speech 1 jean-pierre danthine: financial stability development

considerable general economic financial condition swiss bank sector remain difficult. on one hand, situation financial market ease since june 2012. this largely due various decision measure take government central bank worldwide. on hand, ease tension financial market interpret caution. should measure already take effective progress make restructure government budget slow, cannot rule renew turbulence financial markets. the european bank industry also fragile state. although cd premia european bank go last months, level still considerably previous year well swiss u banks. finally, colleague thomas jordan explained, global economic outlook remain modest. for europe, particular, revise short-term forecast downwards slightly. for switzerland, national bank expect moderate growth. economic condition remain comparatively good, – conjunction low level interest rate – boost continue strong momentum mortgage real estate markets. i speak development market detail late on. to sum up, risk bank environment remain considerable. first, risk escalation european debt crisis insignificant. second, imbalance build swiss real estate market. this go hand hand increase risk significant price correction medium term. great resilience big bank the situation big bank improve since last news conference, institution increase resilience. this increase particularly pronounce credit suisse. accord bank’s recently publish data, increase hold loss-absorbing capital roughly three-quarters second half 2012. in addition retain profits, increase mainly attributable capital measure announce july, already implement large extent. in addition, part strategic reorientation, big bank announce measure enhance resilience. for instance, institution plan expand loss-absorbing capital, reduce risk and, particular, trim balance sheet well pursue policy dividend restraint. the national bank welcome increase big banks’ resilience achieve thus far, well announce measure improve capital situation. the consistent 2 bi central bankers’ speech implementation measure important two reasons: first, leverage remain high despite improvement capital situation. second, risk environment – thus associate potential loss big bank event escalation european debt crisis – remain considerable. situation domestically focus bank i would like turn situation domestically focus banks. the risk associate environment bank operate increase past six months. indeed, isolate sign slowdown growth mortgage real estate market observe second quarter materialise third quarter. in particular, price different segment residential real estate market continue rise sustain pace. at time, growth mortgage loan volume still considerably high gdp growth. imbalance therefore grown. a far risk appetite capitalisation concerned, situation domestically focus bank change significantly last six months. on one hand, banks’ risk appetite diminish overall. this substantiate following: first, case new mortgage loans, loan-to-value ratio loan-to-income ratio remain high level. second, interest rate risk decline remain high. third, already low margin interest income continue decrease. there nevertheless considerable difference one bank another, particular risk appetite evolved. certain bank reduce risk-taking significantly last quarters, others increase exposure risk. on hand, average capitalisation domestically focus bank relative regulatory requirement still historically high level. however, snb already emphasise late financial stability report, resilience banks, measure regulatory capital indicators, overestimated. therefore, six month announced, strict capital requirement mortgage revision self-regulation rule mortgage lend not, yet, lead significant trend reversal mortgage real estate markets, although anecdotal evidence point direction. it cannot rule impact measure fully materialise simply yet reflect data available. in particular, due still exceptionally low interest rates, is, however, considerable risk imbalance continue build up, risk abrupt correction medium term keep increasing. under circumstances, snb carefully monitor development mortgage real estate markets. it periodically ass necessity activate countercyclical capital buffer. issuance new banknote series 2015 early in february 2012, national bank inform public new banknote series would postponed. today, i would like provide background information decision. the national bank commit put banknote circulation state art term design technological aspects. in order meet standard, project must launch early stage. integrate combine security feature involve new technology previously use banknote present special challenge. since development phase new security feature long, launch new series likely take several year technical feasibility assessment alone. certain insight gain actual serial production. bi central bankers’ speech 3 the development new banknote series begin 2005 design competition. in plan phase technical feasibility initial production test 2010, become evident complexity new security feature necessitate postponement issue date autumn 2012. in autumn 2011, early phase serial production, technical difficulty arise discernible test phase, whose result positive. for reason, snb year decide conduct comprehensive re-assessment entire project together industrial partner produce new banknote behalf. a result, several mostly technical measure define case already implemented. these measure ensure series go long-term industrial production. owe complexity scope necessary work, first denomination series, chf 50 note, may expect 2015 earliest. the snb announce issue date soon production first banknote denomination completed. since national bank want continue meet high quality standards, accept postponement new issue, decision render easy banknote currently circulation continue offer high standard security. bi central bankers’ speech 1 dimitar bogov: when pressure price relieved, stimulate economic growth interview mr dimitar bogov, governor national bank republic macedonia, “kapital” weekly magazine, publish 8 november 2012. * * * bank affair always possible in country region bank affair erupted, connection criminal activity bank conjunction politicians. what situation macedonia? be everything control bank sector? nbrm control bank term compliance regulations, quality corporate governance, ass risk bank undertake operations. bank supervision strong prevention criminal operation. but mean anywhere world, bank affair could take place also bank sector macedonia. spasijka jovanova the national bank republic macedonia low forecast economic growth year 1 percent raise concern inflation. the condition growth registered, i.e. downturn, high inflation, call stagflation, bad stage economic crisis. be macedonian economy stage? i would agree macedonian economy enter stagflation. however, unusual movement world economy. on one hand, european economy recession, u economy struggle return path growth, recently, fast-growing economy brazil, india, china, turkey also slow down. in circumstances, would logical price commodity exchange worldwide fall. but happening. price oil basic agricultural product falling, maintain previously achieve high level even continue rise. in part, due overly relax monetary policy fed, ecb bank england, well debt crisis euro area, “urge” investor invest real good commodity exchanges. the rest consequence so-called supply shocks, i.e. political tension arab world middle east, well drought country large producer grain. in conditions, despite slowdown economic growth, macedonia face high import inflation. in condition emphasize economic crisis, monetary policy put operation encourage economic growth? you claim nbrm contribute keep price stability, obviously undermined. price stability neither undermine be. in august september, high usual monthly price increase time year registered, due one-off factor i already explained. their effect soon exhaust increase stop pressure demand side completely absent. temporarily high inflation mean price stability undermined. over last two years, inflation euro area continuously well ecb’s target, one get upset it, clear consequence overheat domestic demand. monetary policy cannot prevent initial impact price supply shocks, prevent transmission effect prices. nbrm allow price stability undermined. 2 bi central bankers’ speech you recently admit monetary policy face several challenges, call contrast reactions. can explain think specifically would solve problem monetary sphere? if price shock global commodity exchanges, nbrm would room ease monetary policy. however, due pressure international price must give clear signal allow undermine price stability, simultaneously adjust monetary policy slow economic growth. it great challenge, difficult task, impossible. now time many central bank apply unconventional monetary policy measure respond unusual economic trends. at moment sure risk price stability undermine eliminated, apply monetary measure appropriate slow economic growth. маy pressure come fiscal policy? so far, not, i hope remain way. the best confirmation balance economy. after all, exactly that, room far relax monetary policy without jeopardize stability prices, denar exchange rate bank system. banks’ non-performing loan decrease this year, liquidity big problem companies. the figure show indebtedness real sector huge, euro 5 billion, country’s debt company euro 220 million. in circumstances, bank reduce lend firm minimum struggle growth bad loans. can expect situation improve? in statistic know i find figures. however, economic growth export slow budgetary payment late, usually liquidity company deteriorates. therefore late settlement obligation banks. despite that, non-performing loan macedonian bank amount 10 percent, low share region slovenia greece. announce debt repayment budget contribute reduction debt among companies, finally debt toward banks. so logical expect stabilization, perhaps reduction level banks’ bad loans. bank huge excess liquidity, reservation regard lend companies, locate reason emphasize risks. be placement fund treasury bill central bank bill solution, even cost decline economy? the monetary policy try trigger certain behavior bank consider appropriate particular time. but bank independently manage excess liquidity decision whether place form loan risk-free securities. at begin second quarter, several measure release substantial excess liquidity place cb bill level consider necessary maintained. it fact bank place small part surplus loans. one reason certainly perception bank increase risk domestic global economy. but important, even important reason corporate strategy bank group euro area owner macedonian banks. some bank group serious problem home countries. although bank macedonia excellent capitalization record liquidity, must implement strategy foreign parent banks, due insufficient capital, refrain lend country present. nbrm cannot require bank increase lending, undertake everything prevent reduction loan bi central bankers’ speech 3 portfolios. obviously, another area spillover negative development euro area economy. what credit growth year, expect next year? the estimate year 7 percent, next year somewhat higher. in direction interest rate loan deposit move next year? the downward trend likely continue, although slow pace. the european central bank reduce basic interest rate 0.75 percent order stimulate economic growth. the national bank republic macedonia maintain 3.75 percent. why reduce 1 percent country, too, reduce interest rate loan well? in highly euroized economy macedonian, necessary motivate economic agent demand denars, euros. therefore, interest rate parity denars euro must keep appropriate level stimulate demand denars. in last three year reduce parity 8 percent 3 percent. further reduction process depend resilience economy. macedonia save what expectation macedonian economy 2013, expect perhaps difficult turbulent year? what, accord you, big economic challenge problem next year? it another year full uncertainty world especially european economy. thus, export demand macedonian product unlikely improve. so, cannot expect boost economic growth. however, expectation economic growth macedonia much good year, drive diversification production new export-oriented facility start work year, start work next year, well infrastructural facility fund already secure foreign sources. both politician economist globally divide opinion term economic policy conduct order emerge crisis. some advocate austerity, others encourage spend stimulate growth. which policy prefer think right macedonia? accord me, “false” discussions. if country room increase spending, certainly time stimulate economy. but unfortunately, many country worldwide. develop economy spend could afford years, room fiscal stimulus left. it easy say encourage consumption greece, spain, italy, portugal, usa, etc. who finance consumption? just bank refuse provide new loan overindebted customers, investor will finance increase spend budgets. in economics say “there free lunch.” in end someone pay bill. the time come develop economy pay bill choice austerity. this time painful structural reforms, revision generosity social care accordance possibility economy. a macedonia, result many year prudent fiscal policies, room stimulus years. but room medium term exhaust save more. 4 bi central bankers’ speech macedonian company lend parent company euro area what expectation deposit 2013? can expect growth, especially denar deposits? households’ save likely continue usual growth rate least 10 percent per year, mostly denars. it hard predict trend companies. this year significant capital outflow form dividend loan foreign-owned company parent company abroad. obviously, macedonian company still profitable financially help parent company trouble euro area countries. it negatively influence deposit potential companies. it uncertain whether trend continue next year. why always connect issue exchange rate policy devaluation? be possible open debate country, economic model, effect provide exchange rate regime efficiency vis-a-vis economy? currently, real exchange rate denar. demand supply balanced. nbrm rarely intervene foreign exchange market. a result credibility denar national bank create past 15 years, completely eliminate speculative demand foreign exchange. but experience show immediately change exchange rate mentioned, speculative demand foreign exchange appear disturb balance foreign exchange market. this would cause pressure exchange rate, high inflation ultimately much high interest rate current ones. who would benefit that? you take select sample country flexible exchange rate high economic growth macedonia offer evidence policy give good results. i find another sample country flexible exchange rate low growth macedonia. it economic analysis, manipulation. i still wait someone offer plausible analysis change exchange rate regime boost economic growth. except naive statement media, far one offer analysis. in economic literature, long conclude exchange rate regime affect economic growth. do think macedonia efficient economic model exchange rate regime record economic growth rate exceed 3–4 percent, everybody agree necessary growth 8 percent? it naive link economic growth exchange rate regime. economic growth complex phenomenon depend hundred factors. competitiveness economy depend exchange rate. take global competitiveness index world economic forum. it take account one hundred indicator measure competitiveness countries. if someone belief macedonia realize 8 percent growth rate exchange rate regime changed, i leave speechless. the change exchange rate use instrument improve competitiveness country fail improve factor choice. but short term solution quickly exhaust effects, devaluation bring high inflation end nominal exchange rate changed, real exchange rate remain same. and demand new devaluation. look history european monetary union. what exchange rate policy greece, italy, spain, introduction ecu (the predecessor euro). instead structural reforms, constantly correct weakness devaluation exchange rate. when enter euro area long possible lead see today. they require internal devaluation 30 percent restore lose competitiveness. by contrast, country austria, netherlands (denmark, still currency) always lead policy fix exchange rate peg german mark. to competitive, increase bi central bankers’ speech 5 efficiency structural measures. therefore country problem competitiveness today. in recent interview give bank business recommend competitiveness macedonian economy must improve complex reform dedicate work include everybody. do see progress? yes, i see progress. the rank do business, world economic forum, benchmark do area ??improving condition high economic growth. it way create high economic growth. it process never stop. good rank list mean immediately high economic growth. it take time, continuously improve condition business. bi central bankers’ speech 1 k c chakrabarty: transit path indian economy – six step transform elephant tiger address dr k c chakrabarty, deputy governor reserve bank india, interaction member delhi chapter young president organization, new delhi, 7 december 2012. * * * assistance provide dr. mridul saggar preparation address gratefully acknowledged. shri prabhat jain member delhi chapter young president organisation! it pleasure amidst young captain indian industry, who, i believe, would continue guide respective enterprise foreseeable future make immense contribution shape indian economy go forward. i ask speak today “transforming elephant tiger” regard, i would suggest six step i think essential transformation. however, outset, i thank delhi chapter young president organisation (ypo) invite share think important topic. ypo really establish extra-ordinary network young global business leader think tank issue critical economy, business society. i tell network host illustrious speaker past therefore, i live high expectations. i believe decade experience commercial bank central bank provide insight enterprise, governance, growth society impact nation-building, which, i would share today hope find interest worth emulating. let u focus topic evening. transform elephant tiger mean different thing different people. in reality, state art genetic engineer still cannot contemplate modification. an ang lee steven spielberg can, course, use computer generate special effect bring transformation. but time get real – give metaphor elephant use denote indian economy deal life future children. in 2007, dr. shashi tharoor write enchant book, “the elephant, the tiger the cellphone: reflection india: – the emerge 21st century power”. the book, ingrain history, culture socio-economic change, criss-crosses indian life ajanta-ellora cricket cellphone call centre make simple point indian growth effect change daily life impart confidence indian people. in december 2008, economist london publish special report india elephant, tiger. it note chaos, bureaucracy occasional violence, india remarkably successful past years. but, wonder cope economic downturn general election follow. it add democracy tax rise storm-clouds gathering. the prognosis, however, prove beam event followed. the election remove uncertainty indian economy stag v-shaped recovery clock 8.4 per cent growth 2009–10 2010–11. yet, lose steam chink tiger skin try wearing, get exposed. in july 2011, shri swaminathan anklesaria aiyar, journalist friend profound observer political economy india, write paper cato institute, “the elephant become tiger”. in paper persuasively argue 20 year economic reform india transform indian economy tiger. late year, reserve bank governor dr. subbarao, deliver haksar memorial lecture, argue india may elephant, even elephant dance. the elephant dance disrupt zoo party form global financial crisis. he suggest ten step get back course re-jigging elephant dance. 2 bi central bankers’ speech growth india clearly slow since 6.5 per cent 2011–12 likely 5.8 per cent 2012–13, significant downside risks. the twin deficit – fiscal balance payment – compound problems. this may set u think whether elephant tiger goat, devour global force domestic inaction? so pursue tiger dream? if yes, need earn tiger tag? the elephant tiger: one prefer? before i touch upon need do, first step understand metaphor mean. so let upfront visit key attribute elephant & tigers. there four key attribute elephant – size, herbivore nature, perceive moderate pace anatomy include large ears, trunk tusks. tiger, hand, large elephant, large cat species. it carnivore, know speed agility. it anatomy include stripes, powerful jaw razor sharp teeth, sharp claw flexible backbone. but, conclusively differentiate two tiger’s killer instinct. i think, term size, indian economy is, course, elephant. it also herbivore habit give democratic structure, unlike carnivore habit tiger dragons. in term speed, many people misconception elephant can’t run walk fast. the fact elephant walk fast 25 mile per hour (mph), tiger run shade faster. bengal tiger run 35 mph, short spurt can’t keep pace long. so, view, axiomatic one try transform elephant tiger. yes, could add bite speed really aim develop tiger’s killer instinct. these, together good use anatomy resources, human capital, would help u achieve dragon tiger achieved, perhaps, small downside. for happen, view, need take follow six steps: 1. preserve demographic dividend invest human capital india’s demographic dividend present country great opportunity enhance growth seek convergence per caput income develop world. india’s birth rate fall 45.6 per 1000 1951 estimate 21 currently, still remain highly drive slowly fall infant mortality rate remain high 46 per 1000. the death rate fall dramatically 37.2 per 1000 birth 1951 estimate 7 currently, still cause population ageing. median age india’s population 27 year compare 40 oecd economies. it add significantly labor pool and, even median age bucket rises, still relatively young 30–34 age bracket 2026. india’s age-dependency ratio (ratio dependents-people young 15 old 64-to working-age population) currently 54. this already low japan france. most develop country would see rapid age population next 2–3 decade put severe pressure social security system rise dependency ratio. the overall median age country rise 29.0 1950 37.3 2000, forecast rise 45.5 2050. many develop country like china, brazil thailand face issue age population pass demographic transition. over last 60 years, china experience demographic change historic pace profound impact population structure. baby boom begin mid-1960s period “great leap forward” saw famine sharp rise death rate fall birth rate. china “post-transitional” society, life expectancy reach new heights, fertility bi central bankers’ speech 3 decline below-replacement level, rapid population age expect next decades. china’s population start shrink reach peak 1.4 billion 2025 a.d. the median age population could touch 50 year then. india’s population would overtake china point. it population expect peak 1.7 billion 2060 a.d. clearly, india potential advantage demographic dividend emerge market peers. but, demographic dividend could boon curse depend upon exploit it, for, time reap gain finite. by turn century, india would face demographic discount rather dividend india’s population would age develop countries’ population would much younger. so need reap demographic dividend exist? the first thing invest resource expect give u advantage. india invest much le human capital. the combine spend central state government education, 3.3 per cent gdp, health another 1.3 per cent gdp. in contrast, european union (eu) country spend general government account, 5.5 per cent gdp education 7.5 per cent gdp health – i.e. nearly three time gdp. canada’s public spend health alone 11 per cent gdp education nearly 5 per cent. india need step public spend education health considerably next five years. however, spend alone guarantee high quality human capital. we also need focus quality spend think whether achieve good outcome le spending. the second step need take right skilling work force. there shortage train manpower industry, bottom pyramid high ladder. india often consider source skilled labour supply rest world, give sheer size manpower. it often recognize four-fifths rural population half urban population remain unskilled. woman participation rate labour market remain poor. the big problem lack focus technical education could absorb large chunk unskilled labour, back great push primary education. le 11 per cent job-seeking population age group 15–29 receive form vocational train india one every three get vocational train receive specialize train institutes. furthermore, even value add segment, large pool skilled manpower i.e. area information technology, real wage rise pace may impact competitiveness. the big challenge ensure job additional supply labour come join workforce. on rough basis, 10 million people would need job every year next 15 years. though disguise unemployment agriculture sector reduce years, may possible sector provide additional job give rise rural wage need shift corporate, mechanize capital intensive model farming. while service sector lead india’s growth employment story time now, india’s growth pace may sustain unless manufacture sector also become competitive create lot jobs. this pose significant challenge employment generation skilling work force. 2. improve productivity efficiency productivity important driver growth. productivity depend efficiency scarce resource allocate – time, work effort, natural resources, capital inputs. a great deal growth country explain productivity growth, especially total factor productivity growth (tfpg). factor accumulation (such increase labour capital) explain small part growth. give experience, india become tiger, would need focus technological 4 bi central bankers’ speech development improve rate tfpg. capital deepen may also help, key lie overall productivity enhancements. in india, output per worker increase impressive rate service sector reform initiate early 90s. in period, tfpg growth also impressive sector, though i eschew quote precise number growth account research generally give vary quantitative estimates. tfpg growth also improve manufacture sector since 1980s. so, progress made. however, rate technical change, still, low east asian economy period earn tag east asian tigers. i would rather focus issue large policy initiative would necessary quest transform india tiger. in context, i would make four suggestions. first, improve agriculture productivity necessary as, clearly, increase area cultivation practical and, therefore, increase demand cereals, pulses, fruit vegetable would need meet improve yields. substantial productivity enhancement possible farm adoption precision farm techniques, good cultivar optimal water management. good adoption modern technology area biotechnology, genomic tools, cost-effective eco-friendly integrate pest management technologies, seed-supply chain systems, regionally adapt variety hybrids, would help. second, need focus issue confront small medium enterprise (sme). sme sector account third industrial output contribute equal share total merchandise exports. in current downturn, smes face adverse business climate rise receivables, inadequate credit high cost credit. sme sector enjoy economy scale scope large corporation enjoys. it also cannot fully reap benefit information technology high sink cost high rate obsolescence. though strong link large firms, institutional mechanism transfer technology smes lacking. if smes effectively integrate supply chains, need ensure link finance technology large firm work times. third, i mention little earlier, india’s next growth push come manufacture sector. we miss century opportunities. india cannot boast one big “home grown” global brand much small nation like south korea, taiwan, etc. plenty them. our abundant human capital effectively channelize support manufacture growth. but i would really blame lack “r & d” culture suffer from. globally, india figure near bottom term r&d intensity. it spend le one percentage gdp r&d expenditure, country like israel, finland, sweden, korea, japan, u germany r&d intensity high three time more. fourth, key issue relate productivity attitude work. it strange india, epitomise dignity labour early vedic period, imbibe culture respect workers. we forget swami vivekananda’s contribution equate work worship. no form work, whether manual intellectual le inferior other. a nation, steadily neglect respect dignity labour. since manual labour receive respect intellectual work india, work effort lost. this result low gdp low welfare. individual idle away take manual job. what else would explain fact labourer poor state like bihar, orissa, up, etc. migrate work hard agricultural farm punjab haryana, refuse locality land fertile amount labour would much productive. we must emulate western society regard form labour discriminate against. if president cleveland could accept dignity labour 1894, century line time give respect casual labour operate around u – maids, driver workman bi central bankers’ speech 5 factory – due recognition respect. if so, woman men would join workforce. unemployment would reduce indian industry would become competitive globally. 3. revive infrastructure investment harness natural resource good much say india’s infrastructure deficit rightly so. india sufficient roads, sufficient power. when i grow up, i teach india land poor, rich resources. today make giant leap low poverty still remain abundant natural resources. yet, learn optimally utilise them. take example coal, account india’s 55 per cent energy needs. we hard coal reserve around 246 billion tonnes, 92 billion tonne proven. yet, able produce 530 million tonne coal, leave supply shortage 150 million tonnes. coal shortage constrain power generation though 55 gw new capacity create 11th five year plan (fyp), large part remain unutilised due coal shortages. private sector fail develop new coal block allot them. we end inadequate plan poor execution area. we plan create even thermal power capacity 12th fyp, remain unsure coal supplies. at time, bank heavily extend lend power sector generation distribution side. on distribution side, state distribution company (discoms) sit huge loss bank debt threaten go bad. the end result loss business confidence bring investment boom premature halt. what important context revive confidence invest lend infrastructure sector. the government, recent period, take several step facilitate this. the broad contour new fuel supply agreement (fsas) work out, though thorny issue price pool import domestic coal still resolved. these pending issue must solve quickly. similarly, debt restructure package discoms work out. the private sector must seize initiative rekindle schumpeterian spirit juncture. bank also need perform core bank business balance risk assessment functional need support growth. we also need harness natural resource much better. take simple example water. we country bless water resource network perennial river abundant rainfall. the rainfall provide four time water use annually. yet, water scarce resource india. we haven’t harness resource enough haven’t plan storage distribution water efficiently. india’s per caput storage capacity significantly low countries. for example, quantum water store proportion average river runoff india 50 day average runoff wide variation – 220 day krishna two day brahmaputra/barak basin. the comparable figure colorado river basin australia’s murray-darling basin 900 day south africa’s orange river basin 350 days. good water management could radically alter agriculture situation india. india also need utilize mining, spectrum air resource better. the importance clean air often recognized. we need strike right balance development need environmental commitment ensure long-run growth sustainability. we among world’s top polluters. it need recognize average per square kilometre carbon dioxide (co2) pollution japan 7.5 time india. similarly, per caput co2 emission india amongst least globally. nevertheless, also need note air pollution serious health cost india rank fourth list large co2 pollutant china, u russia. a such, want ensure fast growth also good quality growth sustainable fairly long period time, must continue make effort exploit natural resource environmentally friendly way. 6 bi central bankers’ speech 4. improve governance every level the world bank’s worldwide governance indicator 2006–11 place india average key parameter governance. it score 15 per cent political stability absence violence, 40 per cent control corruption well regulatory quality, 55 per cent rule law well government effectiveness, 60 per cent vice accountability. clearly, lot scope improvement parameters. both, overall governance corporate governance need improvement. in fact, need good governance every level – hospital school polity, firms, non-profit institutions, sports, bank finance, regulation, land record even daily lives. our governance deficit, form, reflect rank ease business. accord ifc-world bank report 2013 release year, india rank 132nd index measure “ease business” amongst 185 economies. singapore hong kong get top second spot overall. in sub-components, india stand impressive 23rd criterion ease get credit 49th term protect investors. however, figure 173rd term start business, 182nd term deal construction permit 184th contract enforcement. accord report, average, india require 173 day start business, 196 day obtain construction permit 67 day get electricity. in singapore one need 3 day start business, 26 day construction permit 36 day get electricity. all east asian tiger also far superior record india parameters. if aspire become tiger must become business friendly, domestic foreign firms, trader tourists. we, course, enviable record democratic system, responsive government, active medium independent judiciary. however, risk deal india must come further. we reach east asian tiger reached. it reason advocate adoption singapore model last rbi annual report. in limit way, attempt form national investment board (nib). a well-functioning nib go long way cut project delays. however, federal structure, nib would still limitations. it jurisdiction project clearance require sub-national levels. the singapore model step further. it require concern agency sit together time bind manner clear reject projects, fail clearance deem automatic. we must make business easy, unleash entrepreneurship venture capitalism india. we also need improve record corporate governance financial non-financial firms. barrier entry must collapse competitive environment need generated. however, must develop framework inculcate practice arm length relationship permit connect lend business relationship may promote “looting” behaviour describe akerlof (awarded nobel prize 2001) romer. they argue economic underground come life firm incentive go break profit society’s expense (to loot) instead go break (to gamble success). bankruptcy profit occur poor accounting, lax regulation, low penalty abuse give owner incentive pay firm worth default debt obligations. there still large gap arise nominal compliance good corporate governance accordance regulatory provision real compliance practice law spirit. we need bridge gap. 5. enforce accountability walk life all five step i talk address, include real compliance good governance cannot achieve unless enforce accountability. just need good governance every level, also need enforce accountability walk life. our accountability structures, especially public sector, weak. in administration, civil bi central bankers’ speech 7 servant insufficiently incentivized risk take, seldom reward successful completion goal are, best, merely transfer poor implementation. manger public sector enterprise face similar problem addition bureaucratic intervention delay decision require move away policy may best interest public sector unit. it difficult enforce accountability climate. on corporate accountability, principal-agent relationship management wrest ownership control shareholder actual owner rather weak. we see asset strip bankruptcy weak environment. this especially true complex web company within business group prevail. there strong case simplify structure often develop evade taxes, indulge regulatory arbitrage strip asset firm personal use. in recent period, come across instance corporate debt restructure seek ownership commitment control rather leave weak. we must enforce accountability case force business entity bring capital. there are, sometimes, grave case businessmen launch new firms, rename firm indulge m&as garner fresh public money misuse fund first instance. the concept modern firm base limit liability principle require care prevent practices. our political process ensure fair deal accountability democratic institutions. yet, debate whether right recall exist. a fragment polity existence coalition minority governments, sometimes, make matter worse. accountability municipal level also lacking. this, turn, impact upkeep infrastructure get built. road seldom last year. drainage system choke. what is, therefore, necessary climate four things. first, stakeholder engagement must intensify institution – public private. furthermore, principle inclusivity stakeholder engagement sort regulatory capture interest group avoided. second, individuals, rather committee groups, make accountable even collegiate approach adopted. such accountability time bar transfer job retirements. third, financial accountability must enforce all. for enhance fiscal transparency, budgetary process make tight slippage eliminated. similarly, financial accountability need promote firm non-profit institutions. fourth, accountability codify degree do periodic evaluation must do ass achievement, failure correctives. 6. make finance responsive real sector promote inclusive growth let me, last, cover role finance india’s transformation elephant tiger. i keep end finance belong to. in recent period, finance become big rather respond real sector needs, lead real sector. too-big fail syndrome, firm depend income shore accounts, market herd behaviour drive noise rather fundamentals, example finance sector become big boots. yet, finance support real activity still inadequate. firm business still get crowd information asymmetry. financial friction financial constraint come way investment growth economy. for want collaterals, poor cannot access even elementary bank services, result potential save get lose leave society unequal polarize insufficient support pareto superior outcome gainer can’t compensate losers. finance must regulate tightly. this require regulation perhaps le new regulation great effectiveness. at time, engage finance must obligation towards promote financial inclusion, without 8 bi central bankers’ speech inclusive growth cannot achieved. bank human face household provide base bank activities. they one financial surplus intermediate corporate public sector run financial deficits. it endeavour push policy bank lend view encourage credit flow vulnerable section population would otherwise get financially excluded. over years, ethos reserve bank. the branch license policy direct lend route two pillar effort financial inclusion rest long time. the bank license policy, mandate certain ratio rural bank branch license urban branch, often criticise bank come way business interests. however, strong research evidence suggest social bank experiment india successful improve credit flow rural population even low poverty result. the priority sector lend (psl) stipulation also improve flow credit certain productive sector economy would otherwise crowd bank credit market due information asymmetries. there reason believe proper plan use technology-enabled efficient delivery channels, bank pursue financial inclusion profitable way. our approach see interventionist. in practice, reserve bank deftly balance objective equity efficiency financial inclusion furthered, banks’ financial health impaired. in recent period i associated, redouble effort financial inclusion. for instance, prescription psl respect foreign bank raise 32 per cent 40 per cent case bank 20 branches. we also impart human touch basic bank bank accounts. conclusion let end talk something need learn east asian tiger quest become one. growth acceleration tiger support liberalization, export-led growth, high investment education, large share educate workforce, high public private save rate macroeconomic discipline governance. we pursue policy pursue them. however, tiger also fail maintain spurt mistake committed. some maintain high interest rate attract foreign investments, others peg currency arrangement many develop vulnerable financial system. an unanticipated shock bank currency side, therefore, result growth collapse east asian crisis. corporate failure add financial sector woe country (especially chaebols korea). while transform indian economy tiger, need calibrate policy take account lesson learn east asian crisis. thank patient hearing. downturn come go away business cycle run

bank pre-dinner statement mr andrás simor, governor magyar nemzeti bank (the central bank hungary), ecb-mnb joint conference “cost efficiency retail payment – evidence, policy action role central banks”, budapest, 15 november 2012. * * * distinguish guests, lady gentlemen, it great pleasure welcome budapest. we honour ecb accept magyar nemzeti bank (mnb) co-organiser retail payment conference hold 2012. we attribute privilege mostly fact mnb complete publish first national cost payment study base harmonise pan-european methodology. a i heard, afternoon listen open remark mr. benoît coeuré already two sessions. you also busy, tight schedule tomorrow, kind rest let invite play game. how many bring per diem cash cheques? please raise hand did! ... not many you, i see. i quite sure 15 year ago i would get quite different result! this game tell u great deal innovation. innovation important, lead new, viable products, contribute great competition payment service providers, change payment habit thus enhancement overall efficiency. nonetheless, i somewhat interest big picture, let speak briefly priority relation retail payments. a mandate central bank act, mnb promote smooth execution payment reliable efficient operation hungary’s clear security settlement systems. i personally convince must go beyond task facilitate continue improvement efficiency domestic payment use tool available us. let give hungarian example i refer to. one major recent achievement introduction intraday clear retail payment five daily cycle july year. the mnb participate project catalyst regulator overcome network coordination failure. i quite sure share view network coordination failure emerge quite often field payments. therefore, particular case, conflict interest individual bank reluctance bank community make decision actual start implementation, mnb decide use regulatory power. the mnb timely implementation project interest society whole good achievement public good. public good serve several ways; first, eliminate float banks’ side; second, facilitate finely tune liquidity management customers; third, generally improve quality service provide customers. another achievement publication hungarian national cost study entitle “nothing free”, help foster public dialogue role cash society. our staff find cash heavily use hungarian retail payments: 85% number retail payment transaction connect use cash. accord best estimates, every year 0.4% gdp (in hungarian context currently correspond 370 million euros) could save hungary national payment pattern change way use cash paper-based payment instrument declined, use electronic payment increased. 2 bi central bankers’ speech our analysis reveal main bottleneck hind much wide usage cashless payment instrument mostly acquirers’ side. consequently, propose public policy measure mostly aim good attraction merchants. some idea incorporate current economic policy programme hungarian government, implementation still underway. one key contemplate measure extension network po terminals, underdevelop comparison european countries. in addition possibly subsidise set-up po terminals, also think regulate level interchange fees. despite declines, interchange fee remain high hungary. therefore, intention somehow reduce fee level, either follow u australian example react recent european developments. moreover, also advocate gradual introduction mandatory acceptance card payment merchant outlet. our analysis make clear cash heavily use consumer-to-merchant relationship, also business-to-business (b2b) payment payment public administration. in case b2b payments, one step forward introduction ceiling amount pay cash compensation purchase contract. the current ceiling monthly amount around 18 thousand euros, reduce (to 5–6 thousand euros), endorse parliament. we expect robust fast change field payment government. an upcoming mnb study show one-third payment field public administration (in total 100 million transactions) occur cash. let give background information. the first item one-half outgo cash-based payment relate pension payment disbursement various social transfer benefits. the second item – within public administration – local government sector extensive cash user. a low cost, basic payment account could also function important vehicle curtail cash usage. provide access payment account reasonable price precondition aspect government. if kind low cost, basic payment account facility available, government could launch massive programme increase electronic disbursement pensions, social transfer benefit unbanked people could also require labour income remuneration transfer payment accounts. our intention gear raise awareness cost involved, also provoke changes. payment habit change quickly field public administration provide supportive political will. a country like ours, country relatively low per-capita gdp insignificant hide economy, cannot afford delay reduce use cash. it encourage current economic policy programme government declare necessary curtail cash payment intend apply appropriate policy measures. however, seem implementation complete soon. for time i speak hungarian case challenge facing, measure either take still considering, order efficiently tackle waste resources. i sure phenomenon similar one occur country well. this entire conference dinner reception ahead u provide excellent opportunity learn other, discuss, example, experiences, successes, failures, force behind change overall efficiency retail payments, particular role central bank future evolution retail payment market. let u keep mind chinese proverb say “a single conversation wise man good ten year study”. bi central bankers’ speech 3 it long day, particular depart early morning still suffer jet lag. therefore, i go hold anymore. bon appétit! bi central bankers’ speech 1 glenn stevens: challenge central bank address mr glenn stevens, governor reserve bank

conference exactly topic, number distinguish speakers. my remark draw insights. see challenge central bank era new globalisation, bank thailand international symposium 2010, available <http://www.bot.or.th/thai/ economicconditions/semina/pages/inter_symposium.aspx> 2 bi central bankers’ speech monetary policy financial stability it two decade since framework inflation target (it) pioneer new zealand canada. the unite kingdom enthusiastic early adopter 1992. australia adopt it 1993. among early adopters, move it drive mixture principle pragmatism. the key principle monetary policy was, end, anchor value money – is, price stability. the pragmatism arise one previous approach design achieve – monetary targeting, exchange-rate targeting, unconstrained discretion – prove best ineffective, bad destabilising, country concerned. hence many adopter share desire strengthen credibility policy frameworks. a initial adopter come measure success combine reasonable growth low inflation, country attract model. accord imf, 30 country profess follow form it.4 the euro area could also count among group though also profess adherence “second pillar” “monetary analysis”. even unite state can, i think, count (fairly recent) it adopter, since federal open market committee day quite explicit desire inflation performance.5 the bank thailand one number emerge economy adopt it around turn century. twelve year on, thailand boast impressive record price stability framework. a high level transparency ensure financial market participant understand framework, view credible. moreover, price stability come cost subdue economic growth, output expand brisk pace 2000s. while inflation target everyone, thai experience illustrate that, do well, enhance economic outcomes. i endorse favourable verdict offer thai experience deliver grenville ito (2010).6 so i think adoption it, include thailand, see success term straightforward objective set it. to make claim not, however, claim control inflation is, alone, sufficient underwrite stability broad sense. if think control inflation two three year horizon “enough”, well truly disabuse experience past half decade. price stability guarantee financial stability. indeed could argue “great moderation” – undoubted success inflation/output metric – fostered, least allowed, leverage build-up ultimately inimical financial stability hence macroeconomic stability. the success lessen volatility economic activity, inflation interest rate quite lengthy period make feasible firm individual think degree increase leverage safe.7 but 4 imf (2012), annual report, appendix ii, pp 14–16, available <http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ ft/ar/2012/eng/pdf/a2.pdf>. 5 the feed point out, quite properly, dual mandate – “full employment” component. i don’t think preclude exponent it: reserve bank australia always insist quite compatible combine objective medium-term inflation performance notion give due weight path economic activity. 6 grenville s t ito (2010), “an independent evaluation bank thailand’s monetary policy inflation target framework, 2000–2010”, available <http://www.bot.or.th/thai/monetarypolicy/

speech 3 high leverage expose people distress large negative shock eventually come along. this explanation still leaves, course, big role cause crisis – major role fact – poor lend standards, even fraud cases, feed distort incentive compound supervisory weakness inability see complexity various financial instruments. that price stability was, itself, enough guarantee overall stability, hardly surprising, actually. it understand time difficult model financial sector, many standard macroeconomic model use, include many central banks, area under-developed. mainstream macroeconomics perhaps bite slow see financial sector seen: is, dynamic innovation risk taking; amplification mechanism shock possible source shock right, rather passively accommodate sector economy.8 notwithstanding evident analytical difficulties, critique offer quarter central bank pay little attention 2000s build-up credit leverage role easy monetary policy play that. it hard disagree, though i would observe somewhat ironical, give it model central bank attract shortcoming target money credit quantity 1980s. it could note well ecb always 2nd pillar, euro area still experience crisis – part credit grant peripheral countries, part exposure bank core country excessive leverage us. the upshot relationship monetary policy financial stability re-evaluated. a occurs, seem move earlier, unhelpful, frame issue term question whether monetary policy “prick bubbles” whether bubble even identified. the issue whether something is, not, bubble; always subjective assessment anyway real time. the issue potential damage financial instability economic expansion accompany cocktail rise asset values, rise leverage decline lend standards. one remain agnostic bubble/non-bubble question still concern potential reversal cause problems. perhaps fundamentally, although connection monetary policy financial excess complex, end central bank set price short-term borrowing. it cannot deny affect risk-taking behaviour. indeed one intend effect low interest rate globally present (which say wrong environment extreme risk aversion). it follow broad financial stability consideration give due weight monetary policy decisions. this become fairly widely accepted. the challenge central banks, though, incorporate framework learn recent experience financial stability, without throw away good frameworks. we learn lot importance price stability, achieve it, 1970s, 80 90s. we learn importance institutional design. we discard lesson desire assure financial stability. we make error ignore old lesson desire heed new ones. 8 some central bank give lot think question manage financial stability concern within standard it-type framework, though definitive answer hard come by. see example bean c (2003), “asset prices, financial imbalance monetary policy: be inflation target enough?”, a richards t robinson (eds), asset price monetary policy, proceed conference, reserve bank australia, sydney, pp 48–76; svensson l (2012), “differing view monetary policy”, speech deliver sns/sifr finanspanel, stockholm, 8 june, available <http://www.bis.org/ review/r120612c.pdf>. a significant problem financial cycle may much low frequency normal business cycle incorporate usual two three year horizon policymaking difficult. 4 bi central bankers’ speech rather, keep set objective mind. we accept occasional need make judgement short-term trade-offs, nature policymaking. and event, long run price stability financial stability surely cannot conflict. to extent manage coexist properly within framework use, been, judgement, small measure policy time horizon short, perhaps also people become ambitious fine-tuning. we also must, course, heed lesson that, whatever framework, practice financial supervision matter great deal. speak supervisory tools, day is, course, consider correct mention mean “leaning wind” financial cycles, form grandly-labelled “macroprudential tools”. such measure use plainly label “regulation”. they may useful instance apply complementary way monetary policy, interest rate seem appropriate overall macroeconomic circumstance nonetheless associate excessive borrow sector other. in case may sensible implement sector-specific measure – use loan value ratio constraint capital requirement. (this entirely separate case high capital lend institution general). we need, however, approach measure eye open. macroprudential tool place. but problem fundamentally one interest rate low protract period, history suggest effort regulator constrain balance-sheet growth ultimately work. if incentive borrow powerful persistent enough, people find way it, even mean associate activity migrate beyond regulatory perimeter. so new-found, perhaps re-learned, enthusiasm tools, let u realists. the limit central bank that policy measure kind limitation theme broad applications, especially central banks. the central bank major country certainly quite innovative response unfold crisis.9 numerous program provide fund private institutions, vastly wide class collateral, key feature central bank response situation. in essence, private financial sector suddenly pressure shrink balance sheet, central bank find oblige facilitate slow balance-sheet adjustment change size balance sheets. this appropriate response, dictate long tradition central bank stretch back bagehot. conceptually, least initially, balance-sheet operation could see distinct overall monetary policy stance central bank. but crisis go distinction inevitably become much le clear “conventional” monetary policy reach limits. it fortuitous some, perhaps, zero-lower bind nominal interest rate – modern parlance learn “liquidity trap” – go text book curiosum real world problem japan 1990s. japan subsequently pioneer use “quantitative easing” modern era. this provide experiential base central bank recession unfold late 2008 deep insufficient scope cut interest rate response. so addition program provide fund intermediary order prevent collapse financial system 9 i note parenthetically several important cross-border initiative manage liquidity pressure put place quickly key central banks. this kind cooperation technical level something central bank actually quite good. bi central bankers’ speech 5 market fund dry up, program “unconventional monetary policy” several major country recent years. these varyingly think operate one of: • reduce longer-term interest rate sovereign quasi-sovereign debt “taking duration market” overnight rate effectively zero • reduce credit spread apply private sector security (“credit easing”, operate via “risk taking” channel) • add stock monetary asset hold private sector (the “money” channel, appeal quantity theory notion transmission monetary policy) • euro area particular, commitment low spread apply certain sovereign borrower currency union (described reduce “re-denomination risk”). a result policy innovation, balance sheet central bank major country expand significantly, case approach even surpass war-time peak (graph 1). further expansion may yet occur. graph 1 it criticism action – take press circumstance – observe raise important difficult question central banks. there discomfort quarter central bank appear exercise unprecedented degree discretion, introduce new policy yield uncertain benefits, possible costs. one obvious consideration central banks, manage balance sheets, need ass manage risk across wide much large pool assets. go comfortable day hold modest portfolio bond issue home government see undoubted credit quality. central bank portfolio today risk. to date major countries, work well sense long-term yield core portfolio come low level half century more. large profit remit governments. but point, yield surely rise. 6 bi central bankers’ speech of course large central bank balance sheet carry sizeable risk hardly news around asia. once again, bank thailand make excellent contribution international discussion here, recently hold joint conference bi central bank balance sheet challenge ahead.10 the difference asia risk arise hold foreign-currency asset accumulate result exchange-rate management. there obviously valuation risk holdings. there also often negative carry asset since yield asian domestic obligation effectively fund foreign hold typically high major countries. in effect citizen asia continue provide, official reserves, large loan major country government yield could earn deploy capital home

hold central banks, sufficiently large conclude central bank purchase materially alleviate market constraint government borrowing. at least low debt service costs, may also condition quickly fiscal deficit need reduced. there nothing necessarily wrong circumstance deficient private demand low inflation threat deflation. in fact could argue fiscal monetary policy might actually jointly effective raise short long-term growth country central bank fund could make lead directly actual public final spend – say direct towards infrastructure positive long-lasting social return – oppose rely indirect effect private spending. the problem exit policies, restoration distinction fiscal monetary policy appropriate disciplines. the problem technical one: central bank able design appropriate technical modality reverse quantitative ease needed. the real issue likely end lengthy period guarantee cheap fund government may prove politically difficult. there history suggest so. it surprise worry head way back towards world 1920s 1960s central bank “captured” government day.11, 12 most fundamentally, question whether people fully understand limit central banks' abilities. it is, repeat, critical action date wonder whether private market participants, perhaps importantly governments, recognise central bank cannot do. central bank provide liquidity shore financial stability buy time borrower

(2012). 3 imf (2012b). 2 bi central bankers’ speech consequently, time shock external region like global financial crisis, real sector show relatively high resilience thank high regional dependence, financial sector even become innocent bystander due heavy extra-regional dependence. more specifically, global financial crisis break out, financial institution u euro area embark massive deleveraging. hence asia pacific experience large scale capital outflows, unrelated pull factors, consequent financial market unrest. in regard, one step toward enhance resilience asia-pacific financial system strengthen regional financial integration way relieve asymmetry degree financial real integration. the initial target level strengthen financial integration take regional trade integration. if so, risk share offshore region include u.s. euro area decrease, risk share asia-pacific financial system increase.4 besides risk diversification effect moderate offshore shocks, close regional financial integration lead consumption smooth regional economies, typical effect financial integration, also contribute ease global imbalance development regional financial markets. in course euro area crisis, asia-pacific actually enjoy certain positive effect ― financial system become stable along rise regional financial transaction. this appear attributable fact that, european bank deleveraged asian emerge market economies, regional banks, japan australia, step lend regional emerge market economies, help ease shocks.5 meanwhile, asia-pacific seem well place double harvest term positive effect progress regional financial integration. first, since regional economy show large differences, example term economic development status, population age degree financial market development, wide diversity within region make possible complementary financial transaction within region. for instance, age country high degree capital accumulation low growth rate invest country young demographic structure show relatively strong growth, benefit accrue parties,6 improve profitability raise require funds. we need set method appropriate degree financial integration asia-pacific, bear mind lesson global financial crisis late one euro area. the global financial crisis highlight danger excessive financial integration advance economies, include u.s. european countries,7 euro area crisis attributable serious internal imbalance accumulate financial integration8 blind difference industrial competitiveness within region. the degree regional financial integration therefore set within level positive effects, risk diversification sharing, offset negative effect spillovers. furthermore, variety specie help reduce possibility collapse ecosystem,9 financial integration asia-pacific 4 rungcharoenkitkul (2011). 5 mcguire rixtel (2012). 6 jin jokish (2011). 7 aizenman et al.

would indeed low need emerge economy accumulate foreign currency reserve due original sin hang around neck local currency use international settlement. thus due course would lead global re-balancing. meanwhile, asia-pacific account 55% world foreign currency reserves, provide environment conducive strengthen crisis response capacity within region bilateral currency swap regional liquidity

invariably case major crisis, ongoing global financial economic crisis, include lately, course, eurozone crisis, unleash passionate debate design new architecture finance, capitalism globalization. however, trouble much inter-temporally evolve architecture finance, capitalism globalization really actually work practice. the apocalyptic denouement, almost border veritable global financial economic nuclear winter, happen exist system best practice fail responsible implementing, enforcing, fail them! after all, risk regulator regulate alike, human resource risk far serious source risk confirm ongoing financial economic cataclysm. effective credible system right architecture right people right people make wrong architecture work wrong people can’t make even right architecture work! this “right people-wrong people” trade-off substantively, effectively, “ethics-expediency” trade-off, overwhelm anecdotal evidence “expediency” prevail “ethics”! the crux matter need more, less, regulation, good regulation, governance. this undo regulators/supervisors financial firms/banks alike. but unfortunately broad-spectrum generic failure inertial regulatory supervisory system

entirely sake almost complete exclusion need real sector, create massive “financial sector – real sector imbalance” which, being, intrinsically unsustainable, culminate eventually now-all-too-familiar apocalyptic denouement. 3. significantly, pre-2007 story massive unprecedented current account imbalance almost replicate current on-going eurozone crisis large persistent current account imbalance core, proxied germany, netherlands, crisis-hit periphery, surplus core almost mirror image current account deficit periphery. indeed, noteworthy current account surplus core increase dramatically launch single currency significant depreciation real exchange rate core appreciation real exchange rate periphery. such large, persistent, current account imbalance core periphery would possible

incidentally, significantly, current account imbalance “core” “periphery” are, extent, result post-1999 fiscal convergence fiscal divergence story eurozone for, unless, net private save offset it, fiscal deficit typically tend spill current account deficit and, therefore, post-euro launch, ought credible, effective function institutional enforcement mechanism ensure ongoing compliance

magyar nemzeti bank (the central bank hungary), anchor 2013 conference, budapest, 7 december 2012. * * * lady gentlemen, two statements, three proposals: main point speech today. let begin first statement. first statement: predictability stability require growth let u try imagine hungary successful country again. admittedly, easy feat enter fifth year crisis. still, let u toy idea. what success mean economic terms? it mean least three things. if want work, find job. your income increases. and last least, need worry inflation, save lose value. in words, success also require price stability. every country consider model price stability. even inflation target present, monetary policy manage create persistently low inflationary environment, ensure expectation economic agent well anchored. price stability luxury rich countries, prerequisite growth. price stability indispensable component predictable economic environment worth invest create jobs. when price stable, high rate economic growth reach long term, develop country also emerge ones. however, addition price stability, growth also require predictability term laws, regulations, taxes, is, predictability stability entire regulatory environment businesses. second statement: hungary severe growth problem, cannot remedied fiscal monetary stimulus. what more, recovery debt trap hind adverse international environment, also complex crisis confidence. hungary’s potential growth already slow crisis, process catching-up euro area halt close decade ago. before crisis, analyst mostly blame problem long-term unsustainability budget disincentive prevalent labour market. the tax wedge, excessively high compare country region, welfare benefit system, generous level development, tax evasion due high tax rate contribute undermine hungary’s growth potential. we make significant progress towards sustainable growth path since outbreak crisis. the previous government already start remedy country’s structural problems. the government currently office also priority remove obstacle improve economic performance, focus improve labour market incentives. we make considerable achievements. the fiscal deficit fall around 3% despite crisis; bank stop lend foreign currency; country’s current account surplus years. and external debt also decline gradually, albeit slowly. although adjustment require huge sacrifices, reach end road. we able place economy balance growth path, become attractive target investments, decline international competitiveness ranks, credit rat bad ever since political transition remain bottom regional league term growth. 2 bi central bankers’ speech it difficult escape situation, unpredictability future economic development render rational calculation nearly impossible. if consider future uncertain, postpone major decision long-term effect fog lifts. this response, rational individual, lead subdue consumption, postpone investment job create macroeconomic level. without growth, debt reduction become uphill struggle. today, international domestic uncertainty reinforce other; live highly complex crisis confidence. in respect global economy, prove recipe stimulate recovery develop country run ammunition fiscal monetary stabilisation struggle high debt. in past, recovery country hit debt crisis typically occur along export-driven growth path, support favourable international economic climate. in current crisis, give forward escape route, due adverse external environment. consequently, time require debt reduction even uncertain, along growth rate hungarian economy produce time. our future therefore highly dependent factor beyond control. but realise small, open economy option. at time, external market condition regularly turn bad expected, continuously increase extent adjustment expect us. it hardly surprise weariness struggle create intense demand for, let u say, novel economic policy proposal promise painlessly set economy growth path. however, idea pas test economic rationality help. indeed, may actually make thing bad add confusion. i convince way overcome crisis utmost reduce uncertainty, least area control create predictable institutional environment. in word jam madison, 4th president unite states: “it little avail people, law make men choice, law voluminous cannot read, incoherent cannot understood; repeal revise promulgated, undergo incessant change man, know law to-day, guess to-morrow.” what potential build block confidence predictability?  fiscal consolidation must make credible, public debt must set sustainably decline path. at time, predictability legal regulatory environment must ensured.  the operation financial intermediation system, ensure smooth operation economy, must restored.  price stability must achieved. there chronological preference order implementation three tasks. if create predictable economic environment, need perform simultaneously combination other, rather one another’s expense. first task: stabilisation fiscal outlook the crisis put end excessive fiscal spend characterise hungarian economic policy first half 2000s. the narrow cheap fund opportunity necessitate stabilisation long-term fiscal prospects. bi central bankers’ speech 3 a result adjustment measure adopt since 2006, deficit reduce substantially, several sub-systems general government undergo major structural changes. the system education, health care, welfare benefit local government changed. these change lead improvement balance short term, effect fiscal sustainability manifest long term. since onset crisis, fiscal tighten face strong headwinds. the fiscal room manoeuvre hungarian government continuously diminishing, easy-to-play card become scarce. after initial programme base expenditure cut significant immediate debt-reducing effects, revenue-increasing measure come fore. so, overall, tax centralisation reduced, happen pay le tax others pay more. furthermore, improvement budget balance accompany great long-term sustainability stabilisation economic policy outlook. a result pressure short-term deficit target excessive government optimism relate future, number temporary measure severely distort economic activity implemented, postpone reinforcement sustainable fiscal structure late date. another equally important problem frequent change regulatory environment windfall tax render commercial calculation concern future uncertain, lead predictability chaos. it hardly surprise fiscal ease finance nationalisation pension fund yield result hop for. the deterioration business prospect and, consequently, postponement investment plan aggravate particularly measure affect bank system, severely undermine competitiveness hungarian financial institution chance bank compete regional peer fund parent institutions. in turn, postpone investment plan unemployment rate stick persistently high level impair growth potential economy, debt service become ever great burden weak economy. thus today, despite numerous painful measure structural reform actually implemented, cannot claim anchor expectation relate long-term fiscal developments. this also support fact far manage reduce debt-to-gdp ratio nationalise private pension fund assets, rather improve economic performance. fiscal consolidation cannot successful unless create predictable environment thereby promote long-term growth. instead improvise temporary measures, government decision focus gradual consolidation set longer-term path. improve potential growth hinge abolishment tax regime distort investment save decisions, well creation regulatory environment strengthen competition, create level play field competitors, restore legal certainty assure legal guarantees. second task: stop decline lend the smooth operation financial intermediary system indispensable economic growth. through efficient allocation save lending, bank system maintain circulatory system economy good health. currently, hungarian bank system fulfil role severe limitations. lend contract continuously since start crisis, rear guard region respect well. in addition obvious decline demand credit, sign indicate bank also reluctant lend high price premium clients. primarily, due tight liquidity insufficient capital levels. the problem ability borrower repay debt worsen dramatically due deteriorate 4 bi central bankers’ speech economic outlook. the marketability value collateral behind default portfolio uncertain; series regulation tax introduce unexpectedly without consultation undermine best business plans, government unpredictably systematically take away part income earn bank bank levy, financial transaction tax means. unfortunately, give impossibility business plan highly uncertain profitability, natural reaction foreign shareholder decide gradually downsize operation hungary. the retreat parent bank may last years. make mistake: owner may implement substantial capital increase necessary, enhance lend capacity subsidiaries. in period, withdrawal deposit parent bank several time high amount capital injections, indicate owner consider operation hungary profitable business. in words, additional capital need maintain stability system downscaling potential winding-down operation conduct organise manner, without major disturbances. furthermore, reduce credit supply deepen recession, turn increase probability corporate bankruptcies. the recession also erode public revenues, therefore government seek new revenue source find bank system already hit deteriorate loan portfolio. thus, government’s policy exacerbate recession cause even deep decline lend investment. however, price economic policy eventually pay u all, unrealised job opportunity fall income levels. the behaviour expectation government, banks, business household influence one another. still, one participant sufficiently large coordination potential break negative spiral: government itself. individual bank unable this; even start lending, would noticeable effect macroeconomic level. the government, hand, might able provide incentive bank sector boost lend reduce stabilise burden bank system make regulatory environment predictable, could eventually place system onto equilibrium path. consequently, “compromise” call government banks, else cannot expect last growth emerge. and first move must make strong player restore climate trust. and finally, third task: central bank must achieve price stability similarly public entities, pro-growth monetary policy also need play part create predictable environment low possible risk level economic agents. the central bank contribute efficiently achieve price stability. this also precondition reduce long-term interest rate avoid excessive exchange rate volatility. what central bank need create price stability? over past two decades, price stability achieve almost develop country number le develop ones. the experience country show important element success transparent systematic operation central bank. inflation expectation become anchored, is, last price stability monetary policy become credible, central bank clearly state inflation target, economic agent see central bank act curb development threaten result persistent deviation target. this conduct greatly facilitate supportive fiscal policy. expectation exchange rate devaluation due increase fiscal imbalance expect adjustment measures, bi central bankers’ speech 5 unknown yet every detail, unsettle inflation expectation despite best effort central bank, thus offset inflationary shock may cause output loss. it accident country adoption inflation target coincide strengthen fiscal discipline compliant nature fiscal policy. in hungary, ever since introduction inflation target 2001, central bank unfortunately work headwind effort achieve statutory objective price stability, backdrop fiscal policy fuel inflation various measures, government, without exception. this grave effect effectiveness work. globally, inflation target pass test crisis fly colour positive experience contribute decision several country adopt inflation target crisis, bank japan u federal reserve also decide introduce explicit inflation targets. thus, operation central bank develop country come close practice inflation target countries. the lesson learn crisis underline importance anchor inflation expectation create price stability. on hand, crisis refine expand think mandate monetary policy. in addition traditional tools, central bank contribute economic stability macroprudential regulation affect systemic behaviour bank period expansion, provide liquidity support inadequately function market segment use unconventional instrument time economic downturn. the macroprudential monetary policy function coexist peacefully. macroprudential instrument assist promote monetary policy restrain credit booms, real estate exchange rate bubble overheating, monetary policy keep price stability focus. the central bank’s work, supplement new instruments, may become efficient stabilise economic fluctuation well. and hungary? since 2001, central bank act require mnb achieve maintain price stability. that element inflation target start appear monetary policy. however, deliver price stability mandate hind obstacle throughout ensue period. prior spring 2008, central bank follow dual objective inflation rate nominal exchange rate, able react inflation development within constraint exchange rate band. the dual objective central bank frequent conflict target compromise efficiency monetary policy. the dual objective abandon 2008; since then, mnb work within framework inflation target regime. it strive stabilise inflation expectation level consistent 3% target. 2008 year crisis began, since central bank face exceptional challenges. in period extremely volatile capital flows, monetary policy give priority safeguard finance economy. along interest rate policy, mnb employ number unconventional instrument restore efficient operation money market soon possible. after acute stage risk abated, even though high level debt volatile risk environment continue demand great care implementation monetary policy. on hand, decision central bank may gradually return normal, inflation growth prospect come focus again. what current dilemma monetary policy? at begin crisis, saw protract recession upset price wage-setting routine lead stubborn inflation previous years. disregard 6 bi central bankers’ speech effect tax increase commodity prices, hungary low rate inflation neighbours. price stability, however, merely question level inflation today; rather, depend economic agent think future inflation. even though demand continue subdued, think discipline price wage-setting behaviour private sector exhibit past two three year begin loosen up, analysts’ longer-term inflation expectation also risen. it fear – result repeat additional price rise due sequence tax measures, rise commodity price soar food price – economic agent consider inflation rate considerably target normal. in situation, difficult ass level inflation settle extra price increase generate government long effect. the various answer question also contribute division monetary council. in opinion, inflation expectations, i.e. longer-term inflation outlook, become uncertain, central bank act much firmly keep price wage-setting behaviour disciplined. why price stability important now? some think – regardless answer question whether high inflation “fall stick” – central bank must abandon rigid stance give priority growth. this peculiar idea country economic policy past two decade always see solution inflate away macroeconomic problems, without tangible improvement growth, i might add. indeed, learn hard way even though leniency inflation may appear attractive short term, never produce welfare gain. by contrast, neighbour – create price stability consistent tight monetary policy supportive fiscal policy – leave u behind one other. despite bitter experiences, school economic think still stubbornly insist trade-off inflation growth. unfortunately, true one direction: overcome inflation inertia may indeed demand substantial real economic sacrifice country accustom inflation, country manage produce last growth surplus let inflation loose. otherwise country europe north america maintain price stability would wealthy world develop country low inflation environment would fast catch up. because soon become clear central bank want achieve high growth let inflation loose, incorporate exchange rate, price wage decisions, turn lead high interest rate market. thus, monetary condition effectively relaxed: end situation much le predictable much bad growth. consequently, monetary policy stimulate growth long certain jeopardise price stability. international experience show inflation target appropriate framework – opinion appropriate one case hungary – anchor inflation expectation achieve price stability. i hope many dead end blind alleys, hungarian economic policy strengthen commitment macroeconomic stability. if fiscal policy place predictable foundations, inflation target efficient hungary well. the institutional framework there. the hungarian economy still characterise deficit. unlike previous period, today primary problem fiscal deficit, rather lack confidence. the solution easy, possible find. if lack confidence address economy, fast, spectacular result would follow. to end, need consult course book economics, adapt experience successful country circumstance hungary, bring common sense back economic policy, achieve sustain reduction government debt, boost incentive bank lend and, ceterum censeo, deliver price stability. bi central bankers’ speech 7 stability, predictability confidence: best tool available stimulate growth. 8 bi central bankers’ speech bi central bankers’ speech 9 10 bi central bankers’ speech bi central bankers’ speech 11 12 bi central bankers’ speech bi central bankers’ speech 1 benoît cœuré: central banking, insurance incentive speech mr benoît cœuré, member executive board european central bank, ecb conference: “debt, growth macroeconomic policies”, frankfurt, 6 december 2012. * * * i wish thank florian heider oreste tristani contribution speech. i remain solely responsible opinion contain herein. lady gentlemen, it pleasure tonight. the underlie theme conference aftermath financial crisis. paper implication debt overhang, interaction private public indebtedness sovereign debt crisis feature prominently conference programme. the aftermath financial crisis, i focus tonight, however, change nature monetary policy operations. central bank liquidity increase dramatically past years. “unconventional” “non-standard” measure deploy main industrial countries. at ecb, measure always aim improve transmission standard policy decisions, assume different form time. in first phase crisis, mainly aim bank objective prevent collapse interbank market. a financial crisis evolve sovereign debt crisis, step size operation banks, also aim remove redenomination risk government bond market decision outright monetary transaction (omts). a monetary policy-maker, i convince measure necessary prevent financial crisis adverse consequence financial system macro economy therefore, ultimately, medium term price stability. a freezing-up interbank market could cause credit crunch downward spiral asset prices. the money supply would shrunk. the ensue collapse aggregate demand would put downward pressure prices. a great depression scenario could occurred. the scenario could materialise local level case fear country could leave euro, severely hamper ability deliver price-stability. thank non-standard measures, central bank liquidity prove effective insurance mechanism risk economic disaster. provide insurance can, however, generate perverse incentives. knowledge existence safety net encourage imprudent behaviour. concern express connection new omt programme, could purchase potentially unlimited amount sovereign bonds. by ease market pressure governments, argued, ecb intervention could lead weaken fiscal consolidation reform efforts. the focus remark tonight trade-off insurance incentives. i go start general principle commit provide partial insurance, arise literature microeconomics. i illustrate omt programme also parallel plan bank union interpret light principle. 1. the basic principle: commit partial insurance? the trade-off insurance incentives, equivalently, ex post efficiency ex ante efficiency recurrent theme microeconomics.1 i argue trade-off useful framework think challenge face euro area. it widely study topic, able draw adapt exist insight address challenges. why trade-off? why ex post efficiency ex ante efficiency? the reason react circumstance operate. if circumstance change, behaviour. thus, policy ensure ex post efficiency necessarily efficient ex ante, people react policy alter behaviour. ex post ex ante efficiency generally overlap. 1 a often economics, theme trace back way adam smith’s “the wealth nations” 1776. he describe tenant underinvest land own. around time, 1740, version free-rider problem (a closely relate incentive problem) appear david hume’s “treatise human nature” (see j.-j. laffont d. martimort, “the theory incentives”, princeton university press, 2002). 2 bi central bankers’ speech allow moment somewhat schoolmasterly use example car insurance illustrate basic trade-off.2 car insurance obviously desirable ex post, since optimal people bear consequence car accident themselves. we le risk averse feel much good car insurance. without it, u would stop drive altogether fully pay consequence accident. insurance improve ex post efficiency. mark twain credit say that: “a banker fellow lend umbrella sun shining, want back minute begin rain”. he describe world ex-post efficient. let’s take ex ante perspective. carry umbrella encourage rain, drive carefully never bear negative consequence careless driving? insurance may well encourage imprudent driving. in words, insurance hurt incentives, is, reduce ex ante efficiency. the way manage trade-off ex ante ex post efficiency partial insurance. we usually fully insure car accidents. there deductible, sum pay pocket file insurance claim – finance speak: bear “first loss”. moreover, insurance depend car drive, past record insurance claim also whether show negligent not. in words, insurance company worry behaviour insurance induces. the trade-off ex ante ex post efficiency apparent fact deductible high, may discourage insurance therefore drive altogether. if, hand, deductible low, driver may become imprudent again. the trade-off find policy domain – say, example health care co-payments –, and, i argue next, relationship outside investor inside user funds. 2. the case sovereign debt: insurance incentive to extent, borrower’s income hence ability repay debt subject force outside control. a bank, example, cannot perfectly control cash flow, depend competitor general economic conditions, among factors. similarly, country cannot perfectly control business cycle; income also depend worldwide condition matter import exports. at moment time, mismatch borrower’s income expenditures. without access capital markets, without ability borrow, bank would cut lend country would limit provision service income dropped. the ability borrow therefore insure shock income ensure smooth function economy. access capital market improve ex post efficiency. but like car insurers, investor capital market worry perverse incentives. not much imprudent driving, form imprudence. a borrower’s income subject exogenous shocks. it also outcome decisions. investor therefore worry provide full insurance risk income fluctuation lead irresponsible – example, short-term-oriented – investment policy decisions.3 when finance sovereigns, additional somewhat fundamental problem arises: so-called willingness pay. government cannot force contractually oblige repay debt. investor rely willingness government make repayments, else stop lending.4] it precisely threat loss access capital market analogous deductible car insurance. it form partial insurance provide incentive government undertake good policy repay. while loss access mean le insurance income shock hence le ex post efficiency, improve ex ante efficiency. the trade-off ex ante ex post efficiency automatically lead commitment problem. let go back example car insurance. provide partial insurance, insurance company expect driver imprudent accident indeed result bad luck. but accident occurred, insurance company could conceivably ignore original contract fully reimburse claim. after all, 2 indeed, trade-off ex-ante ex-post efficiency first appear modern economics context “moral hazard” insurance market (see example m. spence r. zeckhauser, “insurance information, individual action,” american economic review, 1971). 3 the incentive problem start appear (corporate) finance m. jensen w. meckling, “the theory firm, managerial behavior, agency cost ownership structure,” journal financial economics, 1976; s. myers, “determinants corporate borrowing,” journal financial economics, 1977; j. stiglitz a. weiss, “credit ration market imperfect information,” american economic review, 1981. 4 the “contract-theoretic” approach sovereign debt pioneer j. bulow k. rogoff, “a constant recontracting model sovereign debt,” journal political economy, 1989; j. bulow k. rogoff, “sovereign debt: be forgive forget?,” american economic review, 1989. bi central bankers’ speech 3 accident clearly due bad luck. anticipate “renegotiation” expect full insurance all, driver incentive become imprudent again.5 in practice, real problem car insurance since insurance company credibly commit stick original contract but sovereign debt? would investor gain nevertheless refinance government low probability repay? or stick shut country market since know improve incentives? past experience show sovereign debt often renegotiate government investor find difficult commit give course future actions. a hurt ex ante efficiency thus lead high cost borrow governments, number development make sovereign debt “renegotiation-proof.” just give couple examples: bond start replace loan market sovereign debt. bonds, widely hold easily tradable, make sovereign debt difficult renegotiate number investor involve increases. another development shorten maturity credit order exercise control right (of refinancing) often. while trend provide good incentives, hurt insurance – maybe even excessively so. it may become excessively difficult re-organise sovereign debt adapt new circumstances. one possibility counter trend collective action clause (cacs). they offer possibility easy renegotiation low threshold number bond-holders agree debt restructuring. indeed, january 1st 2013, new bond issue euro area government contain clauses.6 private market various self-interest may, however, find difficult achieve trade-off incentive insurance optimal everyone. in fact, market worry much incentive stop provide insurance altogether – case market freeze-up. and indeed, experience numerous quasi-market freeze-ups various segment interbank, credit sovereign debt markets. when happens, time public sector step in.7 but strike right balance insurance incentive also problem public authorities. full insurance produce perverse incentive irrespective whether provide private public institution. one prominent example case sovereign debt crisis involvement imf. in return insurance provide lend country difficulty, imf usually receive far-reaching control right maintain re-establish country’s incentive solid public finances. without far-reaching rights, intervention must take form provide partial insurance. financial assistance european financial stability facility (efsf) sovereign bond crisis euro area also draw experience imf – partly thank involvement imf itself. at ecb insurance-versus-incentives trade-off mind design new omt programme support bank union. before move omt bank union topical recent example trade-off ex-ante ex-post efficiency, let point trade-off particularly stark crisis times, much heart central bank general. after all, trade-off inherent liquidity provision. banking, make long-term loan finance deposit short-term debt, inherently fragile. maturity transformation expose bank liquidity risk.8 the classic postulate bagehot, central bank lender 5 there vast literation issue whether circumstance contract renegotiate (for early contribution

central bankers’ speech last resort, perform function penalty rate, illustrate need (liquidity) insurance need safeguard incentives. in word bagehot: “if bank bad, certainly continue bad probably become bad government sustain encourage them.”9 the art central bank art balance ex-ante ex-post efficiency. 3. omts commit partial insurance the purpose omts establish backstop event negative self-fulfilling market dynamics. we design new programme feature line efficient trade-off insurance incentives. the first feature provide effective insurance redenomination risk. under certain conditions, ecb stand ready intervene amount commensurate objective. in words, scope omt intervention government bond market ex ante unlimited. this feature correctly interpret commitment. after three months, say highlight value commitment. in many countries, sovereign yield spread edge programme announced. currently, yield stand low level since begin crisis. the second feature omts insurance partial. the objective programme clearly delimited. the ecb buy bond short remain maturities. the ecb aim eliminate spread sovereign bond issuers, sovereign yield don’t identical monetary union, market discipline role play. nor ecb will purchase amount sovereign bond necessary balance governments’ inter temporal budget constraints. omts remain consistent regime “monetary dominance”,10 government retain responsibility balance budget medium term ecb remain free set interest rate ensure maintenance price stability medium term. the final feature omts set right incentive governments. to qualify interventions, country must negotiate euro area government precautionary european stability mechanism (esm) programme strict effective conditionality. conditionality serf ensure government continue correct exist economic fiscal weakness omts activated. at time, omt purchase take place country programme review. the ecb’s action complement, replace, economic fiscal reform. incentive also help explain intervention focus shorter-term debt. purchase sovereign bond suspended, country fail comply conditionality requirements. rely short-term debt strengthen discipline power right stop intervention point time. in short, omts strike right balance ex-ante ex-post efficiency, fully compliant ecb mandate. 4. a bank union commit partial insurance the omts can, however, part large package solve european debt crisis, sovereign also bank come stress. in fact, bank sovereign catch negative feedback loop, problem one feed other. to break loop, element bank union currently discussed. these element need consider together see light trade-off insurance incentives. the first element bank reform creation single supervisory mechanism involve ecb. besides obvious coordination information benefit supervise bank financially integrate area, give risk regulatory capture supervisor supervise close other, partially transfer supervisory authority one level see commitment renegotiate. it limit regulatory forbearance (a form insurance) serf incentive sound risk management bank sector. it also ensure singleness banks’ liability euro area, congruent single monetary policy. within ecb, strict separation single supervisory mechanism monetary policy, way safeguard incentive liquidity extended. to quote bagehot again: “any aid present bad bank sure mode prevent establishment future good bank.”11 1991; d. diamond r. rajan, “liquidity risk, liquidity creation, financial fragility: a theory banking,” journal political economy, 2001. 9 see w. bagehot (1873), lombard street: a description money market, henry s. king co. 10 see t. sargent n. wallace, “some unpleasant monetarist arithmetic”, federal reserve bank minneapolis quarterly review, fall 1981, pp. 1–17. 11 see w. bagehot (1873), op. cit. bi central bankers’ speech 5 once incentive upheld, possible desirable provide insurance. incentive-compatible insurance must, however, partial. and important add element complement single supervisory mechanism. one element european resolution mechanism. since bank’s debt insure full, should, fact will, possible bank fail. since begin financial crisis august 2007, federal deposit insurance corporation (fdic) list 466 case bank unite state failed.12 give special role bank intermediaries, failure one bank adverse effect rest financial system. hence, must possible organise orderly failure. otherwise, failure long credible incentive solid risk management undermined. to achieve orderly resolution financial institutions, especially systemic ones, need common resolution regime. the exist legislative proposal recovery resolution directive aim orderly bank resolution, include early interventions, bailing-in bridge financing. a important element credible efficient resolution mechanism would common european resolution fund. the recovery resolution directive, together european resolution fund finance contribution industry, would ensure incentive-compatibility. similarly, possibility allow direct bank recapitalisations trough esm illustration incentive-compatible insurance, provide implement single supervisory mechanism established, recapitalisation precede burden-sharing exercise shareholder national taxpayer bear first losses. let conclude. the euro area go serious crisis. for european policy-makers, crisis formidable challenge, also opportunity learn past mistake improve emu architecture. i believe number decisive step take recent months. in design steps, interplay many different factor must bear mind. i emphasise tonight cannot design insurance forget impact incentives. when deal complex issues, unquenchable thirst guidance economic research. many academic community write extensively potential consequence policy decisions. rest assured: closely follow work. we may sometimes disagree conclusions, always help u focus thoughts. i wish productive day conference tomorrow. 12 see:

role create national tradition memory, strengthen turn sense belong albanian nation share common destiny. all contribute strengthen national sovereignty, particularly currency manage stable way. william camden, british historian late 16th century, consider money fifth element air, fire, earth water. the universal character money capture interest numerous generation philosopher stimulate human imagination different kind ways. money economic act also political one. it establish boundaries, contribute consolidate country’s identity may lead conflict wars. but despite all, good will, money may precede peace stability one countries. a also state helmut kohl, former chancellor germany, “the real flag federal republic germany deutsch mark”. 2 bi central bankers’ speech if live albania period independence declared, money would mainly consist french gold franc – still refer “napoleons” day – austrian silver coronas. be citizen coastal city, would probably use italian lira copper coin small

nil bernstein: challenge ahead danish economy speech mr nil bernstein, governor national bank denmark, annual meet danish banker association, copenhagen, 3 december 2012. * * * the sovereign debt crisis still leave mark world economy, especially euro area. while u economy seem moderate upswing, euro area economy shrinking. gdp growth negative last two quarter outlook 4th quarter bright. even german economy, recently le severely affect problem southern europe, seem slow down. the swedish economy hold ground, also see low growth. the international organisation predict world economy pick gradually 2013, growth estimate generally adjust downwards, particularly euro area. although usa seem fare little better, unsustainable budget deficit present serious challenges. so far, political disagreement president congress stand way find effective solution problem. the risk financial market point begin respond, see highly indebted countries. the usa unique number respects, size economy, same, economic fundamental still apply. the development usa knock-on effect rest world. in summer 2011, u debt ceiling raised, compromise reach democrat republicans, mean number summary budget reduction introduce turn year, time number tax cut expire. the potential tighten account 4 per cent gdp and, effected, plunge u economy recession. negotiation avoid “fiscal cliff” underway. it scarcely possible find solution without address long-term problem link mainly demographic change. the financial market constantly reflect change prospect reach compromise. in heavily indebted countries, unemployment reach alarm levels. public opinion often ascribe consolidation public finances. but actually, real alternative consolidation. sustainable public finance condition reduce rate interest government debt acceptable level. sovereign default attractive alternative. and certainly low unemployment – contrary. the solution “long haul”, coin phrase. the problem cause imprudent economic policy pursue country 10–15 year lead crisis. they cannot solve overnight. ireland example resolute action address budget competitiveness problem shorten path back tolerable conditions. the ecb continue effort contain crisis. the outright monetary transaction programme announce september entail ecb may buy short-term government bond debt-ridden eu member state secondary market certain condition – example eu member state accept programme seriously address structural problems. follow announcement, 2-year yield immediately fell e.g. spain italy, rise germany. activation programme require official request member state question. spain mention candidate. turn greece, hope last week’s agreement euro area finance minister restore calm while. but greek debt recur theme many year come. 2 bi central bankers’ speech the danish economy well-balanced, growth slow track. the current-account surplus large, hold considerable external assets. inflation moderate, unemployment. in fact, disregard recent period overheating, culminate 2008, go back first half 1970s, thing also go wrong, find low number unemployed people today. experience period overheat extent distort concept normality. but level unemployment period normal, cannot use yardstick. if that, thing go wrong again. *** the private sector consolidate wake financial crisis. that understandable, obviously curb consumption investment. this trend cease save reach desire level – time show – economy begin pick up. the shift could come suddenly – promise – especially signal rest europe become positive. the recent national account figure denmark point negative growth year. we estimate economy grow 1–1½ per cent next year compare year. export buoy growth denmark. the reason large export markets, germany sweden, severely affect crisis now. in short term somewhat cushion impact deterioration around 20 per cent denmark’s competitiveness last decade, measure relative unit labour costs. we lose still lose manufacture job competitive sectors. if want boost employment areas, must improve competitiveness – options. *** there – tentative – sign house market recovering. price fall slow curve flatten somewhat year, owner-occupied flat single-family houses. in copenhagen area, typically feel wind change first, turnover price risen. the low level interest rate support market. moreover, number home sale drop sharply last year, help stabilise prices. a regard mortgages, see shift short-term variable-rate loan variable-rate loan long rate fixation periods, well shift lend bank lend mortgage banks. *** the agree finance bill 2013 keep 2020 plan public finances, allow public spend grow 0.8 per cent gdp. but year consumption growth considerably lower, presumably 1/4 per cent. however, essential set narrow limit growth public spending, also observe limits. in respect see change recent year – unlike previously, local regional government overspending. when new budget act tough sanction regime come force, start budget 2014 2017, great chance also case future. prudent management public finance precondition danish government maintain high credit rat able borrow low interest rates. this year government deficit expect 4 per cent gdp. this large extent attributable extraordinary disbursement early retirement contributions; many people say yes option offered. disbursement total kr. 25 billion, correspond 1½ per cent gdp. the estimate next year’s deficit subject much uncertainty due new rule taxation capital pensions. the option pay pension tax advance reduce rate bi central bankers’ speech 3 provide considerable one-off revenue government. how large revenue i cannot say. but use reduce government debt. the government yet introduce reform – envisage 2020 plan – require ensure sustainability public finances. so keep path reform main priority near term. *** bank lend rate banks’ willingness grant loan relatively high public agenda since financial crisis. since 2008, danmark nationalbank reduce interest rate number occasions. but individual bank customer have, perhaps, experience different reality. the bank reduce lend rate nearly much danmark nationalbank has, within last six month many announce high interest rates, monetary-policy rate continue fall. there several reason this. the unusually low level interest rate make difficult – say impossible – bank reduce deposit rate further. to avoid undermine earnings, bank compel keep lend rate unchanged. at time, bank meet tough earn requirements. while high earn must compensate high credit risk le favourable business conditions, new stringent capital-adequacy rule mean increase capital requirements. irrespective whether bank choose build capital buff retain profit raise capital investors, require sound earnings. many bank take major step reduce costs, sometimes expense employees. credit policy generally tighten since 2008. this reflect lend rates, also perception access borrow. overall, firm save up, ask generally say see finance impediment production. with view increase fund option small medium-sized enterprises, opportunity expand use corporate bond currently explored. danmark nationalbank welcome initiative, provide take place market terms. *** it attract considerable international attention, recently european commission, danish household far gross debt relative income household countries. the low rate interest variable-rate mortgage loan often identify reason finance household are, nevertheless, generally sound. this raise question robust household finance rise interest rates, whether increase could jeopardise financial stability. today able provide fairly detail answer questions. the main conclusion extensive study household finance threat financial stability household debt composition limited. the assessment base share debt hold family particularly tight budgets. most family robust finance resilient negative event strong increase interest rate protract period unemployment reduce consumption savings, although may entail considerable lifestyle changes. and assessment even take account continuous rise interest rate likely go hand hand economic recovery hence good employment opportunities. obviously assessment risk financial stability rule possibility high interest rate could rather unpleasant implication family tight finances. *** 4 bi central bankers’ speech before i step down, might appropriate reflect experience i gain seven year governor danmark nationalbank. naturally, brief summary. without doubt, financial crisis single event strong impact financial sector tenure. how prepare we? how tackle crisis itself? which follow-up step take? these important questions. regardless actions, denmark small, open economy would hit international financial crisis autumn 2008 cause international trade contract 20 per cent late lead european debt crisis descend like fog uncertainty european economies. the key question whether denmark make vulnerable severe shock hit u abroad. the answer unqualified “yes”. even without financial crisis, danish economy would pressure. in country, precede international boom ample liquidity low interest rate allow develop unusual overheat economy, already slow shock hit us. the tax freeze, tax cuts, growth public spend new mortgage type domestic factor behind overheating. the banks’ lend growth, skyrocket property price unsustainably low unemployment manifestation overheating. cause effect work ways. it discuss whether danmark nationalbank issue sufficient warn overheating. the truth danish government autumn 2006 ignore clear encouragement tighten fiscal policy kr. 8 billion; fact, even ease fiscal policy 2007. and opposition want spend even more. admittedly, tighten measure preferably introduce early stage, even autumn 2006 danmark nationalbank could find support view. this go show difficult conduct countercyclical economic policy. often lack ability willingness acknowledge problem time take action. so stabilisation policy first foremost achieve introduce automatic stabiliser economy, observe sustainable medium-term spend target aim structurally balance government budgets. labour market structure design promote growth employment. when crisis really hit financial sector september 2008, large majority danish parliament – folketing – implement first series bank rescue package soften bad blow financial sector. it great strength initiative receive broad political support. the bank rescue package introduce crisis measures. an actual revision rule bank activities, base lesson learn financial crisis, underway large extent take place international level. for denmark, initially result eu regulation, subsequently danish rule fill eu framework. a large financial legislation package currently submit folketing. i draft here. it weigh 1.37 kg. (although i add weight halve print side paper.) and see much come years. it understandable rule tighten excess financial crisis, denmark little scope independent action. all same, worth consider whether grow volume legislation increase complexity rule provide good assurance future crises. bi central bankers’ speech 5 professor doctor law linda nielsen, work bank law investment, recently make noteworthy contribution debate daily politiken. everyone work issue read it. her main point number rule aim regulate financial sector’s activity overwhelm – come – often content detail complex read even person doctorate law find difficult understand. there multitude different rule different structures, exemption level detail. it completely overwhelming. what mean banks, board customers, legislators? be construct vehicle person driver’s seat firm grip steer wheel belief steer it, car fact follow path considerable backlash? there simple answer question, unique financial regulation. a i already said, individual country little room manoeuvre activity take place international level. however, important make rule clear simple possible. that make easy observe control. keep simple. let try illustrate this. since 2004, danmark nationalbank prepare so-called outlier memos, i.e. identify outlier banks. on basis – mainly – publish financial statement large group banks, able point achieve low score select key ratios, excess capital adequacy, high lend growth, large exposure earn capacity. use simple method, seek identify potentially vulnerable banks. subsequently, conclude virtually bank within group actually become distress identify beforehand use relatively simple method. the danish financial supervisory authority aware include supervisory activities. with “supervisory diamond”, danish financial supervisory authority take step right direction, focus observe key ratio – sanction non-observance. and others also monitor key ratios. another interest observation among 10 bank identify crisis high exposure property sector, 8–9 subsequently become distressed. so conclusion relatively simple key ratio use identify bank could risk. aggressive lend growth combine property speculation single factor great impact bank folded. *** see broad perspective, denmark navigate financial crisis fairly well far. the weed unsound bank almost completed, le 6 per cent bank become distress – measure balance-sheet total. despite large house price falls, number enforce sale limit – especially compare house crisis early 1990s. if disregard period unsustainable overheat subsequent adjustment, unemployment low last 40 years. denmark sound economic ratio internationally among country high credit ratings. the reason severely hit necessary buffers. all all, bad point departure meet challenge come years. *** in seven year governor danmark nationalbank, 1/3 denmark’s bank disappear – numeric terms. the decline steady period keep trend go far back – crisis crisis. danmark nationalbank gladly assist calculate able hold annual meet decent-sized din table – trend continues. a i see it, significant factor increase 6 bi central bankers’ speech complexity banking. so i may offer piece sound advice director danish banker association (chief lobbyist) wish continue large number pay members, i suggest give priority clear simple rule – especially small banks. regardless path take, i would like thank danish banker association, members, employee director good constructive cooperation seven years. thank attention. bi central bankers’ speech 1 jörg asmussen: agenda 2013 – next step complete emu speech mr jörg asmussen, member executive board european central bank, “internationaler club frankfurter wirtschaftsjournalisten”, frankfurt main, 19 december 2012. * * * 1. introduction lady gentlemen, thank much invite speak evening. it almost one year since i start term ecb executive board, interest reflect europe change time. when i join ecb january, situation look bleak. the first 3 year ltro temporarily calm markets, many inform commentator predict difficult year ahead. put probability euro break-up become cottage industry. today, grind cautiously optimistic. the fear catastrophic tail risk lessened. this part due action take ecb ensure monetary policy transmission, notably omt programme. but also due important change take place euro area governance. of these, significant recognition euro area member state emu incomplete project – urgently need completing. for reason, topic address process achieve genuine emu, focus particular conclusion european council last week. i say upfront outcome definitive vision emu. it necessarily balance view european policy makers, reflect realistic current political circumstances, – i hope – remain sufficiently ambitious give citizen investor sense direction euro area heading. accordingly, need think process complete emu two phases: element implement quickly make real difference euro area already 2013; element progress need make medium-term integration process evolves. let begin focus first phase: key element year ahead. 2. key element 2013 a) complete financial market union perhaps important element agree european council commitment construct real financial market union euro area. this critical 2013 three reasons. first, stable healthy bank system necessary restore normal monetary policy transmission across euro area, hence ensure ecb’s low rate duly pass part euro area. second, restore confidence financial sector – bank system bedrock – way re-integrate single financial market therefore disentangle bank sovereigns. third, put place le risky bank system fix credit channel key contribution restart growth across euro area 2013. 2 bi central bankers’ speech towards single resolution mechanism the agreement single supervisory mechanism (ssm) eu finance minister important first step towards real financial market union. but one component. a financial market union involve single supervisory mechanism single resolution mechanism (srm). this way ensure taxpayer end pay mistake private sector. let explain why. bank “too big” “too interconnected” fail national level – make bailout prefer strategy – would benefit status european level. the srm would legal financial capacity, well independence, ensure viable bank survive non-viable bank close down. moreover, bank “too complex” resolve via cross-border cooperation – make early action impossible – could deal effectively european level. the srm would create authority could concentrate decision resolution act pre-emptively quickly, help preserve value bank save money taxpayers. principle european public support however, strong resolution mechanism cannot remove risk taxpayer entirely. certainly, cost incur resolution first foremost cover private sector, establish european resolution fund raise levy bank sector. but real financial market union must also contain public sector dimension european level. in context, european council call operational framework direct bank recapitalisation esm ready first semester 2013. i aware prospect esm direct bank recapitalisation raise serious concerns: european taxpayer end pay bad asset accumulate past decade; mutualisation become standard practice deal bank sector problems. but let reassure concern contain i would see three key principle european support. first, european support accompany european control, mean public fund use ssm effectively assume duty basis strong conditionality. second, european support grant bank systemically relevant, pose serious threat european financial stability, therefore affect common good. third, european support must come end sequential process, involve follow steps: • one, beneficiary bank must undergo thorough independent economic evaluation asset ascertain real capital need reveal legacy problems; • two, bank must assess viable business model deserve additional capital, otherwise wind down; • three, bank keep going, private sector source exhaust first – mean bailing-in shareholder bondholders, needed, use bank-funded resolution financing; • four, still capital shortfalls, financial resource beneficiary member state draw on; • last step, would european public fund used. bi central bankers’ speech 3 this peck order underscore that, strong european resolution framework, low eventual cost european taxpayers. the financial sector bailed- in, le bailed- out. we see u work: fdic close 400 bank crisis, without cost taxpayers. this standard aim europe – real financial market union way achieve it. let make final point regard institutional set-up srm resolution fund, personal view: esm would well-suited perform task srm house european resolution fund raise bank sector. b. build economic union the second key outcome european council aim strengthen economic union – particularly ensure national economy remain competitive hence prosper within single currency area. the importance issue 2013 cannot overstated, critical ignite growth low unemployment. we see eye series case quick implementation target reform could strong impact, even near-term. for instance, despite recession italy, unit labour cost adjust 0.1% relative euro area average since 2008. this many sector economy shelter wage respond weak productivity. it need product market reform increase competition reinvigorate external competitiveness. in spain, employment struggle rebound, burden unemployment fall disproportionately young, two-tier labour market protect insiders. it need labour market reform bring outsider improve incentive hire. the conclusion propose kick-start much-needed process reform three avenues. first, renew effort complete single market, particular open service increase labour mobility. second, thorough assessment, carry euro area countries, compatibility labour product market membership emu. and third, issue identify assessment address new concept “reform contracts”. let elaborate last point. the idea behind “reform contracts” country would commit specific structural reform direct positive impact competitiveness, commitment formalise legally bind contract. the contract would multi-annual and, foster national ownership, initiate national government approve national parliament. if term contract met, financial support would provided, target transitional cost arise structural reform – instance, re-training programme displace workers. what benefit approach compare status quo? in view three, although depend much concept eventually implemented. first, contract could enter part concert national reform effort, rather see imposition “brussels” context eu procedure like european semester. second, reform commitment could potentially precise, measurable bind contract exist procedures. however, effect would quickly lose simply become another bureaucratic procedure. third, perhaps importantly, contract multi-annual could allow deep reform possible exist procedures. there series recent study suggest competitiveness flexibility, also strongly connect governance. we see clear correlation countries’ economic 4 bi central bankers’ speech performance rank governance index publish by, among others, world economic forum transparency international. the contract provide opportunity, use properly, “go deep” address fundamental barrier competitiveness. build strong economic union along line necessary correct might call “original sin” emu: fact convergence criterion include structural benchmark join euro, hence structural policy remain mainly within national remit. 3. area progress future what area outcome european council room progress future? the important great share sovereignty. the importance credible governance starkly demonstrate crisis. country without credible policy force market consolidate rapidly others downturn. this market trust run sufficient surplus good times, achieve sufficient growth, low debt level ensure long-term sustainability. paradoxically, lack strong external constraint fiscal economic policy lead country lose substantive sovereignty areas. by token, country need share sovereignty order regain sovereignty. by share decision-making european level, restore policy credibility investors, time voice heading. this mean go beyond maastricht logic national responsibility fiscal structural policies, commit governance arrangement actually enforceable – instance, allow intervention right center prevent unsound national budgets. share sovereignty imply number change euro area governance. first, strong institution order exercise sovereignty effectively. this require strong eurogroup. second, european institution properly democratically legitimated. this require change way citizen participate european political process, particular via european parliament. let stress: i would like outcome european council ambitious, idea intend criticism it. they orientation advance need properly flesh year ahead integration process evolves. this require treaty change medium-term order complete emu comprehensive way. 4. conclusion one year ago, euro area face uncertain future. but paint dark picture time prove wrong. one year later, europe prove ability act begin set euro area convince path. it critical that, next year, continue path provide emu institution need advance. put place genuine financial union strong economic union must key priority 2013. it essential appearance calm financial market distract urgent need address euro area’s fundamental challenges. moreover, also row back already achieved. implement fiscal compact adopt “two pack” legislation 2013 essential strengthen fiscal framework. we undermine re-opening discussion constitute “good” “bad” deficit argue exemption public investment. all bi central bankers’ speech 5 deficit finance financial market increase public debt stock – opposite need next year. however, focus 2013 mean lose sight big picture. it instructive notice little market react “fiscal cliff” debate us, jolt prospect early plan election italy. our long-term goal situation essential function euro area unaffected event individual countries, sovereignty share exercise strong common institution – institution long time horizon politics. this jean monnet understand said: “rien n’est possible sans le hommes, rien n’est durable sans le institutions”. “nothing possible without men, nothing last without institutions”. these word never true today. thank attention. bi central bankers’ speech 1 jens weidmann: sound public finance stable monetary union speech dr jens weidmann, president deutsche bundesbank, institute law finance, frankfurt main, 12 december 2012. * * * 1. introduction professor baum lady gentleman thank much invitation. i delight opportunity speak today institute law finance. there many transmission channel “house finance” bundesbank. the lively exchange idea two institution prove exceptionally fruitful, give great pleasure strengthen dialogue today. i will, however, resist temptation speak “regulatory fiscal policy aspect change course energy policy”. fascinate though subject may be, give qualify lecture topic might ask little much central banker stand you. and all, bundesbank regularly warn much ask central banks. these warn normally centre around central bankers’ traditional fear excessively close relationship monetary policy fiscal policy. mervyn king, governor bank england, sum concern slightly exaggerate term saying: “central bank often accuse obsess inflation. this untrue. if obsess anything, fiscal policy.” but “obsession” come from? why escalate government debt pose problem monetary policy? the reason immediately apparent. after all, monetary policy – industrial countries, least – usually independent equip clear mandate safeguard price stability. one could, therefore, incorrectly conclude unsound public finance relevant monetary policy. however, close look reveal monetary policy reliant fiscal policy regard safeguard price stability. escalate public debt inevitably drive price higher. but grow government debt still pose threat price stability even begin spiral control. furthermore, host empirical study suggest high level public debt dampen growth long term. see angle, prevail situation euro area – also industrial country unite state japan – might lead one assume broad consensus favour rapidly resolutely reduce budgetary deficits. yet critic raise number objection arguments. first, claim risk price stability current environment acute, inflation rate low inflation expectation still firmly anchored. second, warn rapid consolidation country would set cyclical downward spiral – would “save death”, were. bear mind, i would therefore like focus three topic little detail: first, importance sound public finance price stability; second, precondition sound public finance monetary union; third, cyclical effect fiscal consolidation. to begin with, let u consider monetary policy successful long run public finance sound. 2 bi central bankers’ speech 2. the importance sound public finance monetary policy high level government debt make difficult safeguard price stability way one. a i already indicated, excessive debt level cause growth impetus slacken long run increase public borrow requirement push interest rates, make investment expensive thus diminish growth. if central bank identify slowdown growth good time, monetary policy stance expansionary thus ultimately raise spectre inflation. but even central bank correctly identify deceleration growth, might come mount pressure adopt excessively expansionary monetary stance order stimulate economy thus maintain usual rate expansion. the long central bank try use monetary policy mean mask structural slowdown growth, le credible become term price stability objective. this send inflation expectation high ultimately fuel inflation. however, structural slowdown growth outlook problem excessive public debt hold store monetary policy. if government already rack high level debt economically good times, fiscal policy long fulfil role buff crisis occurs. under normal circumstances, fiscal policy measure stabilise aggregate demand cyclical downturn, example via unemployment benefit automatically fall tax burden. this path available fiscal policy measure call sovereign’s solvency question. this apply traditional countercyclical fiscal stimulus measure i mentioned, also case crisis hit bank system government support essential prevent credit institution collapsing. if fiscal policy cannot provide support, central bank may, last resort, force prop bank system. these measure considerably increase central bank’s balance sheet risk might thus impair credibility monetary policy. a high level public debt increase pressure monetary policy provide economic stimulus step breach event crisis, also generally ease finance condition government. the monetary policy measure deploy case range interest rate cut bond purchase direct monetary finance central bank. government interest expenditure depend least interest rate level thus monetary policy. if country grow slow pace already run high deficit debt levels, interest cost must keep certain threshold, else government debt ratio could explode. if sovereign – purpose maintain solvency – oblige central bank set low interest rate price stability would require, demand would rise quickly, thus lead sooner late inflation. among economists, state affair know regime “fiscal dominance”: interest rate long set basis need safeguard price stability gear instead government’s need low finance costs. provide economic stimulus, take fiscal policy task crisis, finance sovereign: pressure unsound public finance exert monetary policy come many different guises. to resist influences, legislator confer high degree independence central banks. this come response inter alia experience 1970s 1980s, period oil price shock pose major challenge monetary policy. it become evident country independent central bank significantly low inflation rate central bank follow politicians’ instruction – simultaneously achieve equal even high level growth. what learn back price stability run counter economic prosperity complement it. this prove one key economic policy lesson past thirty years. the decision make central bank independent government instruction resound success fight inflation. and level public debt bi central bankers’ speech 3 long appear influence inflation level past decades, least industrial countries. yet conclude independent monetary policy alone sufficient condition stable money would, view, premature, say naive. for sovereign run much debt burden soon become unsustainable, central bank come much great pressure. this raise concern whether central bank truly independent undermine credibility – even yet actually change monetary policy course. once first doubt emerge whether monetary policy assert independence, central bank run risk lose control inflation expectations, thus inflation itself. at point, sceptic like raise objection high inflation expectation necessarily imply rise inflation rates, claim expand demand fuel inflation. however, inflation rise soon inflation expectation increase, even demand go per se. the wage-setting process good illustration mechanism works. wage cannot normally change point time usually set give date give period. employee therefore take account anticipate price development negotiate wage order prevent earn deviate strongly suitable level subsequent period cannot renegotiate wages. if overestimate inflation, wage would high would competitive. if underestimate inflation, would lose real income purchase power would shrink result. inflation expectation thus factor today’s wage thus today’s price well. de-anchoring inflation expectation therefore lead directly high inflation. recent research findings1 suggest take time central bank credible track record forfeit credibility. indeed, process could well last several years. however, central bank lose credibility, inflation expectation may surge dramatically. bring back control time-consuming costly economy. 3. precondition sound public finance sound public finance thus remain necessary precondition price stability. and ensure sound public finance even crucial monetary union. this one fundamental problem monetary union feature decentralise fiscal policy member state great incentive incur debt. when government debt one country rises, consequence spread across entire monetary union thus effectively dilute – example, via rise interest rate member states. this make incur high deficit attractive individual country. to counteract moral hazard, european monetary union place start stability-oriented foundation. in addition prohibition monetary financing, foundation underpin strict deficit rule enshrine stability growth pact bail-out principle regard member states. so long bail-out principle maintain credibility, send important signal financial markets. if investor believe could face potential losses, assume would demand high interest rate return increase risk. the guide principle monetary union therefore base individual responsibility: 1 bianchi, francesco, leonardo melosi (2012), dormant shock fiscal virtue, duke university, mimeo. 4 bi central bankers’ speech part member states, assume individual responsibility consequence policies, part financial market agents, assume individual responsibility consequence investment decisions. despite rules, however, member states’ borrow effectively curb since introduction euro. in fact, quite opposite happened. with regard stability growth pact, rule circumvent also actively bent. a key shortcoming majority member state vote impose sanction country exceed deficit limit. a second problem financial market exert expect discipline effect. investor tolerate fiscal economic policy failure several member state far long, either overlook grow risk see bail-out policy credible. the fact matter that, case bail-out policy, key factor underestimated, namely contagion effect via member states’ financial systems. the introduction euro lead intensify integration financial markets. but crisis show always blessing, probability contagion effect increase significantly across closely interconnect financial markets. this mean crisis occurs, provide assistance prove expensive. financial assistance, least short run, seem less evil, especially bank already weaken account past failure financial economic crisis. in spite this, many consideration shape construction monetary union end 1990s essentially still remain valid. fiscal rule certainly play important role reduce incentive run debt – least government bind them. a number measure take since outbreak crisis improve rules. the reform stability growth pact make much hard undermine deficit rules. and fiscal compact additionally strengthen excessive deficit procedure anchor rule pursue sound budgetary policy national level. it remain see new rule put practice. for experience show well that, addition rules, stability-oriented policy approach also call fundamental consensus among politician general public uphold protect rules. there also reason fear crisis measure tend amplify aforementioned incentive incur debt. this attribute fact risk extensively mutualised wake combat crisis, control fiscal policy still remain hand country. this divergence liability control make even easy shift consequence unsound fiscal policy onto others. essentially, two conceivable approach realign liability control and, so, create stable monetary union. the one take quantum leap towards genuine fiscal union, feature extensive transfer budgetary policy sovereignty european level. the try reassert principle individual responsibility, basis maastricht treaties, practice. to overcome remain weakness monetary union, integration would require case, too, though would le extensive fully-fledged fiscal union. unfortunately, must say currently neither two approach pursue resolutely. take path fiscal union would require country surrender substantial amount sovereignty. however, significant increase integration lack majority support many member states. in fact, i notice precisely people vociferously call mutual liability one vehemently reject transfer national decision-making power european level. a crucial requirement second option – return system national fiscal responsibility – solvency risk extensively mutualised financial market bi central bankers’ speech 5 player bear risk investment decision themselves. this would lead financial market discipline play even great role. however, view future stable regulatory framework, helpful decision make weaken disciplinary effect. regardless path monetary union takes, must ensure that, future, budgetary imbalance one country automatically jeopardise financial stability. otherwise, country would feel compel use mean necessary prevent sovereign insolvency sake safeguard financial stability, discipline effect fiscal policy would unlikely outset. for reason, too, resilient financial system central stability-oriented monetary policy function monetary union. a well-structured bank union, sever problematic tie sovereign banks, make important contribution this. i could easily speak bank union another half hour, i leave now. instead, i would like sum issue follows. price stability require sound public finances, sound public finance call coherent framework monetary union. however, question design overall framework solve problem current deficits. 4. consolidation versus growth since outbreak sovereign debt crisis, number euro-area country introduce step consolidate budgets. critics, american economist paul krugman, caution consolidation cause harm good present circumstances. in order reduce deficit, argues, country either cut public spend increase taxes. but , adds, measure wrong remedy light current economic slowdown would dampen already weaken aggregate demand hence trigger downward economic spiral. this debate gather momentum follow study perform imf2 size fiscal multiplier crisis. this multiplier indicate strongly economic growth react change budgetary policy. the imf’s study arrive conclusion multiplier amount approximately 1.7 thus large originally assumed. this would imply growth loss would much great consolidation savings. in case, budgetary consolidation would actually trigger downward spiral. however, imf’s find dispute among economic researchers. the sceptic criticise, first, small number observation and, second, high dependency result choice country sample. furthermore, situation individual country likely vary greatly, variation sufficiently account imf’s cross-section analysis. there dispute austerity measure impede growth short term. but equally indisputable debt situation country concern simply unsustainable. i therefore believe alternative resolute consolidation. this logical consequence fact crisis essentially crisis confidence. in order restore confidence public finances, fiscal policymakers must show able will improve structural budgetary position. although fiscal consolidation hard, unavoidable debt crisis – constantly defer necessary measure increase uncertainty thus likewise dampen growth. and deliberately 2 international monetary fund, world economic outlook 2012. 6 bi central bankers’ speech protract consolidation public finance would also make hard maintain political support. incidentally, way consolidation carry also play important role determine quickly country return healthy growth rates. studies3 show country reduce deficit cut government expenditure sustain significantly small growth loss country increase taxes. the rationale behind many measure streamline administrative apparatus privatise state-owned enterprise yield potential save public sector could also improve macroeconomic productivity. 5. conclusion lady gentleman the high level public debt one of, the, great economic policy challenge time. this apply also, especially, monetary policy. sound public finance precondition stable currency, precondition monetary policy cannot create itself. in order ensure sound public finance euro area long term, architecture monetary union develop coherent manner. in so, particular attention must pay keep liability control harmony. and crucial culture stability actively embrace policymakers general public. consolidation growth conflict one another. instead, one precondition other. to say word american economist paul romer: “a crisis terrible thing waste”. that put nutshell. if europe resolutely execute necessary reforms, monetary union end stronger. of i certain. thank you. 3 alesina, alberto, carlo favero, francesco giavazzi (2012), “the output effect fiscal

“international macroeconomics finance”, co-organised european central bank, federal reserve board federal reserve bank new york, frankfurt main, 17 december 2012. * * * thank much. it’s pleasure part panel future financial globalization. i focus remark one important aspect issue – namely, grow use wholesale dollar fund global financial institutions. i’ll begin briefly discuss research i’ve doing, along coauthor victoria ivashina david scharfstein, examine consequence fund model time market stress.1 i’ll touch policy implication relate work. but first, usual disclaimer: the view follow necessarily reflect think colleague federal open market committee. by way background, dollar liability foreign bank grow rapidly past two decade stand $8 trillion, roughly par u.s. banks.2 a significant proportion foreign banks’ dollar liability raise via u.s. branches, legally preclude raise deposit insure federal deposit insurance corporation. the main source fund branches, therefore, come uninsured wholesale claim large time deposits, make cost availability dollar fund highly sensitive change perception banks’ creditworthiness. in work, ask shock ability foreign bank raise dollar fund might lead change lending. we begin simple conceptual model: imagine european bank lend euro european firm dollar u.s. firms. to finance euro-denominated lending, fund issue insure euro deposit local retail deposit base. by contrast, finance dollar-denominated lending, raise fund wholesale dollar market. because bank’s dollar liability uninsured, adverse shock bank’s perceive creditworthiness result spike dollar fund costs. at time, cost bank fund euro unchanged extent euro deposit insured. so might expect shock induce bank shift fund away u.s. wholesale market toward european deposit market. but consequence adjustment, geographic distribution lend function foreign exchange (fx) swap markets?3 note bank want maintain volume dollar-based lending, tap insure deposit base raise euro swap euro dollar use fx swap market. however, induce fund realignment big enough, arbitrageur limit capacity take side trade, large swap demand cause breakdown usual covered-interest-parity (cip) relationship – breakdown sort see time extreme market stress. in case, 1 see victoria ivashina, david s. scharfstein, jeremy c. stein (2012), “dollar fund lend behavior global bank (pdf),” finance economics discussion paper 2012-74 (washington: board governor federal reserve system, october). 2 for dollar asset liability foreign banks, see bank international settlement (2012), “locational bank statistic (pdf),” december. for asset liability domestically charter u.s. banks, see table h.8, board governor federal reserve system. 3 a foreign exchange swap simultaneous exchange one currency another spot market agreement reverse transaction late date pre-specified exchange rate. 2 bi central bankers’ speech direction deviation would cost synthetic dollar borrow – words, euro borrow combine fx swap – would go would approach now-elevated cost fund directly wholesale dollar market. and give method dollar fund – direct synthetic – become expensive relative euro funding, follow adverse shock global bank’s perceive creditworthiness lead decline dollar-denominated lend relative euro-denominated lending. so, two principal effect dollar fund shock intimately connected: widen so-called cip basis fx swap market, reduction credit supply firm borrow dollars.4 to test model’s implications, coauthor i focus event second half 2011, credit quality number large euro-area bank become concern u.s. prime money market fund sharply reduce lend banks. in span four months, exposure money fund euro-area bank fell half, $400 billion may $200 billion september.5 coincident contraction dollar funding, cip basis widen direction predict model, increase cost obtain synthetic dollar via fx swap market. we use data international syndicate loan market test model’s prediction reaction lend type fund stress. we find dollar-denominated lend euro-area bank fell relative euro-denominated lending, result hold u.s. banks. we also find that, even hold fix identity borrow firm, syndicate form make dollar-denominated loan period le likely include euro-area banks, true syndicate make euro-denominated loans. finally, euro-area bank rely fund u.s. money market fund also cut back sharply dollar-denominated lending.6 this last result similar one recent work feed colleague ricardo correa, horacio sapriza, andrei zlate.7 they document u.s. branch foreign bank experience shrinkage dollar-denominated large time deposit – fund mostly provide money market fund prior mid-2011 – cut u.s.-based commercial industrial lend bank fare good score. take together, find two type policy implications: one central bank response dollar fund pressure another measure regulate foreign bank firm rely heavily short-term wholesale funding. this analysis underscore federal reserve’s temporary dollar liquidity swap line european central bank central bank effective response stress dollar fund markets. last week, fomc approve extension swap line february 1, 2014. these line help avert fire sale dollar asset maintain flow credit u.s. household firms. although document cutback dollar lend latter half 2011 foreign bank reliant 4 the cip basis typically measure

sapriza andrei zlate (2012), “liquidity shocks, dollar fund cost bank lend channel during european sovereign crisis (pdf),” international finance discussion paper 2012-1059 (washington: board governor federal reserve system, november). bi central bankers’ speech 3 wholesale dollar funding, cutback likely would pronounce absence swap line i turn regulation. it useful bear mind current regulatory regime evolve period u.s. operation foreign bank largely net recipient fund parents. however, reliance le stable, short-term wholesale fund increase significantly decade lead financial crisis, u.s. branch foreign bank begin borrow large volume dollar send foreign parents. such activity increase vulnerability i describe earlier. and may pose risk cutback lending, could also threaten safety soundness foreign bank – u.s. entity expose banks. the regulation u.s. branch foreign bank change little past decade, even face significant change global bank landscape. however, last week, federal reserve board propose new rule foreign bank organization would address concern i’ve discuss thereby mitigate attendant risk u.s. financial stability. these propose rule apply enhance prudential standard foreign bank organization design increase resiliency. importantly, rule disadvantage foreign bank relative domestic u.s. bank firms, rather rule seek maintain level play field. to avoid mitigate potential disruption wholesale dollar fund markets, propose rule require foreign bank organization hold sufficient high-quality liquid asset meet expect near-term net outflow stress scenario. these rule reduce pressure foreign bank rely heavily short-term dollar fund either sell illiquid dollar asset cut back dollar lend time financial stress. by help alleviate disruption dollar fund market rule also reduce reliance swap line future stress episode. finally, central role play money market fund 2011 episode reminder fragility fund – risk create combination risky asset holdings, stable-value demandable liabilities, zero-capital buffers. the event follow lehman brother bankruptcy 2008 provide even stark evidence risk money market fund pose broad financial system. in light vulnerabilities, i welcome recent propose recommendation financial stability oversight council money market fund reforms.8 to conclude: financial globalization undoubtedly bring substantial benefits. at time, create important challenge financial stability appropriate design regulation. the research discuss conference one help u good understand respond challenges. thank you, i look forward questions. 8 see u.s department treasury (2012), “financial stability oversight council release propose recommendation money market mutual fund reform,” press release, november 13. bi central bankers’

useful start take stock general euro area situation make number relate remark domestic economy. retrospective euro area a well recognized, origin crisis trace back excessively high public sector debt, slippage competitiveness, inappropriate bank practice weak bank regulatory environment side atlantic. the crisis various intertwine dimensions, implication avoidance similar problem future. one observe several countries, fiscal problem lead sovereign debt downgrade turn damage banks’ balance sheets. the consequence lack fiscal discipline aggravate erosion competitiveness failure implement structural reforms. however, several instances, bank sector difficulty trigger fiscal problems. indeed, adherence stability growth pact sufficient condition keep country difficulties. for example, ireland spain, bank sector difficulty necessitate bail-outs government concerned. this lead sovereign downgrade turn increase government 2 bi central bankers’ speech borrow costs, case unsustainable levels. all problem compound instability financial market volatility sentiment. chart 1 show prior formation monetary union yield start converge – regardless fiscal position economic fundamental – stabilise within fairly narrow band first year euro crisis 2009. many country fail reduce debt gdp ratio period show chart 2. the market’s focus sentiment change drastically 2009, give full recognition importance fiscal sustainability, yield spread widen sharply. market complacency turn market volatility, lately somewhat mitigate announcement omt programme, subject i come back later. fiscal excess inappropriate bank practice cause crisis. there also erosion private sector competitiveness, show relative increase unit labour cost several weak economy (see chart 3). in many countries, deterioration competitiveness result wage increase match high productivity. fiscal excess several country camouflage erosion competitiveness, result wide deficit external trade accounts, show chart 4. inside monetary union alarm bell cause current account deficit loud country currency. before monetary union, problem countered, questionable effectiveness, currency depreciation. but inside monetary union current account deficit simply finance capital inflows, largely flow country north country periphery. chart 4 also highlight separation within euro area select country north, run generally current account surplus, select country periphery negative balance. the upper band depict maximum minimum data range germany, luxembourg netherlands. similarly, low range depict correspond

reverse direction; market discipline take form capital flight. there also doubt financial institution take excessive risk, include investment complex and, well known, mispriced financial instruments. crucially, heighten degree riskiness complement adequate capital buffers. in addition, cross-country debt hold linkage financial institution lead contagion spread systemic risk. move macroeconomic dimension, observe various countries, government large fiscal imbalance resort narrow imbalances, application inevitable fiscal consolidation measures. these correction often meet strong social dissatisfaction political resistance. and yet, budgetary restraint always view adequate point view financial market seem limit patience measure discernible impact fiscal imbalances. for many governments, bond spread remain wide. this fiscal restraint also slow economic growth turn aggravate budgetary deficit. chart 5 show deficit per cent gdp euro area whole, along correspond cyclically adjust ratio. the light blue line chart show deficit would without economic bi central bankers’ speech 3 slowdown cause part fiscal consolidation. the gap two line illustrate inevitable contribution economic slowdown deficit ratio. still, relatively small size gap post 2009 indicate strong structural element fiscal deficit. this explain structural adjustment necessary. in response, ecb take policy rate low time history (as see chart 6). it also provide ample liquidity bank system, show chart 7, red line represent rise monetary base (which consist mainly central bank provision bank reserves). however, i note previous occasions, large part liquidity deposit back ecb, reflect considerably slow growth loan (the blue lines). this indication hesitancy part bank buy securities, extend loans, whether bank non-financial sector. some concern express size build-up liquidity across various economy could mobilize bank eventual post-crisis expansion loans. however, must also note excess liquidity eventually reabsorb central banks. in case, also note provision additional liquidity ecb (as show red line chart 7) somewhat moderate true major central bank federal reserve, show chart. the ecb go step announce outright monetary transaction programme, design repair link policy rate cut ample liquidity provision, one hand, low borrow costs, other. it also mean counter so-called

already help stabilize financial market reduce sovereign spread (see chart 1). it really equivalent traditional open market operation central bank long resort order provide stability good function monetary transmission process get impair certain circumstances. the maltese situation the maltese economy encounter persistent headwinds. still, recession observe last quarter 2011 first quarter 2012 relatively short mild. since then, economy show modest recovery. during second third quarter year, real gdp 1.6% period 2011. the inflation rate malta recently exceed euro area average. the hicp measure year-on-year rate inflation stand 3.2% october 2012, compare rate 2.5% euro area whole. in recent months, malta’s hicp inflation may bias upwards methodological change relate measurement tourist accommodation. meanwhile rpi, unaffected accommodation prices, stand 2.9%. it rpi determine lag cola increase. the core rpi inflation rate, good gauge persistent inflation, stand 2.0%. 4 bi central bankers’ speech on hand, number labour market indicator remain positive. a see chart 8, recent lf unemployment rate 6.5%, average 2007, prior euro area crisis. in fact, malta’s unemployment rate low end national unemployment rate across euro area. meanwhile late register unemployment rate stand 4.2%, june. malta avoid two essential source euro area crisis: deficit ratio move right direction bank model follow core domestic bank remain prudent. in malta, core bank generally rely traditional, domestic source funds, specifically retail deposits. malta’s bank remain largely unaffected euro area crisis, avert need government assistance avoid country become major source fiscal overrun distress. malta must position way build strength economy minimise vulnerabilities. in so, would steer clear pitfall country fall maintain growth path. in respect, i focus number important considerations. on fiscal side, government spend increase sustainable basis government revenue increase back grow economy. furthermore, increase expenditure pension health service must finance sustainable way. a population age pay sufficient attention dynamic implies, option available, choose path would impinge economic growth. government policy must, all, enhance efficiency productive system, promote investment incentivise entrepreneurial initiative. labour market the local high level labour force skill qualifications, well adaptability, instrumental attract investment new area activity therefore reduce vulnerability domestic economy shock foreign demand. chart 9 show malta’s wage compare abroad. on basis purchase power standard measure wage take account cost living, average maltese wage rank towards middle broad range select country show chart. the issue arise increase live standard sustainable way, without lose competitiveness. one mindful relationship cost (including wages) productivity. a subject often come discussion cost live allowance cola. it recognize malta allowance determine basis basic social wage, cola flat euro amount, grant regardless level pay. this limit impact competitiveness. nevertheless, award cola disconnect productivity gain hence may constrain firms’ ability respond change market conditions. it also raise risk secondary cost increase initial price shock, may come example increase import prices. it may possible neutralise increase import price simply compensate wage without significantly lose competitiveness enterprise concerned, especially competitor absorb external shock internal devaluation. it relevant note world economy go unusual time country undergo internal devaluations. malta cannot afford oblivious impact reality exert competitiveness. the list euro area country pass significant correction impressive, namely: ireland, portugal, spain, italy, slovenia, cyprus greece. this apart non-euro area member state also go difficult corrective change economies. these development may place bi central bankers’ speech 5 competitor advantageous position recovery underway, raise bar must exceed competitiveness maintain improved. return cola issue, impose collective agreement legislation happen today, really form part negotiation process. indeed, already number collective agreement incorporate cola increase, i suggest norm. it whole wage support productivity, negotiation firm level best place ensure balance productivity growth wage increase lost. otherwise competiveness would erode job endangered. moreover, cola sole impediment adjustment relative wages. in particular one realize minimum wage constrain wage adjustments. it keep mind wage legally set minimum compensation employee limit skills, school-leavers unfortunately acquire particular skills. return minimum wage issue, one commonly use

furthermore, high deposit rate would require increase loan rate investment high yield assets. both carry risk which, current low interest rate environment, may lead great risk assume perhaps would

crucial component euro area economy. indeed, deliberation monetary policy systematically take account financial health of, growth prospect for, euro area smes. in particular, finance environment access finance euro area corporates important element policy-making process, standard non-standard monetary policy decisions. to illustrate importance small business euro area, consider follow facts: smes constitute 99% euro area firms, employ around three-quarters euro area’s employees, generate around 60% value added. at time, unlike large firm generally profitable access alternative source finance, bond equity finance, smes highly dependent bank loan credit lines. due asymmetric information high risk failure2, smes tend face high cost bank finance high rejection rate large firms. while find customer – potentially due weak aggregate demand – usually cite big problem smes access finance, still case particularly vulnerable adverse real-financial feedback loop supply disruption provision bank credit. nevertheless, year prior financial crisis period smooth transmission monetary policy, little evidence euro area smes constrain level expect context sound financial system. after mid-2007, however, cost finance start rise access finance start deteriorate relative pre-crisis period. in euro area jurisdictions, financial crisis first sovereign debt crisis late lead reduction supply credit household corporates. in particular, rejection rate rate grant loan increased, share firm cite access finance dominant concern. on average, loan extend non-financial corporation household decline previous crises, mainly bank fund shock large past (chart 1). the ecb strive alleviate fund stress reduce policy rates, well implement non-standard monetary policy measure provide

bonds, ecb’s non-standard measures, omts, contribute restore access finance private sector. let first talk financial situation euro area smes. before crisis, survey evidence indicate main source sme finance retain earn (around two-thirds). 10% form trade credit supplier customers, around 10% external non-bank sources. about 15% smes’ capital investment operate expense finance bank loan credit lines. this average dependence bank finance low 8% portugal high 22% ireland3, indicate small business rely substantially smooth function euro area’s bank sector. at time, strong increase credit growth euro area follow persistent ease bank lend standards. accord ecb’s bank lend survey, euro area bank steadily relax credit standard loan credit line enterprise two quarter q2 2004 q3 2007. while situation broadly similar respect house loan consumer credit, contribute build-up house bubble several euro area member states, corporate sector still substantial recipient overall euro area credit expansion. one adverse consequence credit expansion euro area corporate sector accumulated, eve global financial crisis, considerably high leverage early 2000s (chart 2). this effect largely drive micro small firms, financial leverage increase 0.14 2004 0.19 2007.4 after august 2007, sharp reversal process observed. credit standard loan enterprise tighten average 46% quarter q3 2007 q4 2008 (chart 3). this process accompany rapid deleveraging non-financial corporations. nevertheless, late financial crisis second half 2009, ecb’s financial stability report single euro area smes particularly vulnerable adverse credit market developments, account low profitability relatively high leverage levels. the euro area sovereign debt crisis start first half 2010 intensify 2011 contribute already restrict access bank finance euro area corporates. while weaken demand result deteriorate growth prospect number euro area jurisdiction certainly play role, tension sovereign market affect supply bank credit well. because potential loss sovereign debt security direct negative effect asset side banks’ balance sheet also affect ability pledge collateral secure wholesale funding, sovereign debt crisis effectively raise bank fund costs. to degree high bank fund cost force bank shrink rebalance loan portfolio, negative relationship riskiness sovereign debt hold bank credit supply. recent evidence support view sovereign debt crisis negative impact supply bank credit. for example, since early 2010, bank expose foreign sovereign debt stress lend substantially le syndicate loan market otherwise similar bank negligible exposure foreign sovereign debt stress (chart 4). this overall reduction lend drive change borrowers’ 3 see 2004 business environment enterprise performance survey world bank european bank reconstruction development. 4 financial leverage define ratio sum debt security bank loan total assets. bi central bankers’ speech 3 demand and/or quality type concurrent balance sheet shocks. part effect due fact investor update view capacity domestic sovereign support bank system (the bailout channel). in addition that, syndicate lend country experience high sovereign debt stress rebalanced away domestic lending, reflect deteriorate profit opportunity home. this markedly different “flight home” effect observe 2008–09 financial crisis.5 syndicate lending, however, target large non-financial corporation study base data easily lend conclusion effect sovereign debt crisis sme access finance. moreover, large public firm routinely substitute corporate debt bank loans, especially financial crises,6 shock-absorbing mechanism available smes. a simple comparison small loan (typically smes) large loan (typically large corporations) show substantial divergence across euro area jurisdiction worsen since begin sovereign debt crisis (chart 5). more detail information sme access finance also extract ecb’s biannual survey access finance smes euro area (safe). the survey suggest number firm cite access finance big problem face increase le 15% first half 2010 18% first half 2012 (chart 6). at time, firm report increase finance need (chart 7), imply loan supply factor dominate. while picture purely descriptive, safe also contain detail firm-level information allow u calculate component credit constraint independent agency problems. preliminary analysis suggest 2010 2011, firm country whose sovereign debt stress face average 20% high probability credit constrained7 identical german smes. when decompose country-level effect effect due aggregate demand, credit risk, fund cost business cycle, real interest rate firm pay credit stand factor explain large share cross-country variation credit constraints. such analysis base survey sme finance indeed suggest 100 basis point lend rate decline, access finance euro area smes improve 9%. emerge case study also support view that, weigh bank balance sheets, sovereign debt

important cross-country heterogeneity: example, period bank germany actually loosen lend standards. this combine evidence imply that, since begin sovereign debt crisis, credit supply euro area become segmented. in country whose bank sector insulate tension sovereign debt markets, access bank credit decrease much credit standard tighten typically observe phase business cycle. conversely, country bank sector experience large balance sheet shock relate deteriorate sovereign debt, access bank credit tighten substantially. elevate premia market segment turn repercussion access finance corporates general smes particular. while growth prospect deteriorate too, consequently weak aggregate demand may dominant problem face euro area smes right now, impair access finance corporate sector number euro area country clearly problem cannot neglect come forefront aggregate demand recovers. recognise sovereign debt crisis impair smooth transmission monetary policy, ecb respond vigorously. first, significantly ease monetary policy stance. in july year, ecb cut main policy rate 0.75%, low history, reduce interest rate deposit facility zero, attempt reduce general market interest rate stimulate interbank lending. the ultimate aim action restore smooth provision credit euro area corporates households. in addition that, ecb embark number non-standard measures: long-term liquidity provision three years, enlargement collateral set use refinance operations, direct intervention secondary market government bond smp programme, recently announcement omts. the objective measure help restore transmission monetary policy address emerge heterogeneity relax balance sheet constraint lender (banks) borrower (firms households). in context, eurosystem support euro area smes directly indirectly, allow bank pledge corporate loan collateral eurosystem. the goal ensure firms, especially smes, receive credit effectively possible current circumstances. at present, ecb hold balance sheet approximately €35 billion worth abs underlie sme assets, approximately €60 billion worth nfc credit claims. importantly, even though policy rate ea member states, non-standard monetary policy measure

unchanged. the swiss franc still high. an appreciation swiss franc would compromise price stability would serious consequence swiss economy. consequently, snb continue enforce minimum exchange rate utmost determination. it prepare buy foreign currency unlimited quantity purpose. in addition, snb leave target range three-month libor 0.0–0.25%. if necessary, stand ready take measure time. essentially, snb’s conditional inflation forecast unchanged september forecast. in short term, price movement subdue somewhat weak economy euro area. in addition, impact past appreciation swiss franc price level rather strong originally expected. from mid-2013 onwards, path new conditional inflation forecast almost identical september. the forecast base unchanged three-month libor 0.0% next three years. give assumption, swiss franc weaken forecast period. nevertheless, forecast inflation remain low next years. for 2012, inflation rate amount –0.7%. for 2013, expect inflation –0.1% 2014, 0.4%. in foreseeable future, therefore, risk inflation switzerland. the third quarter 2012 saw weak growth decline trade activity worldwide. although growth u economy emerge economy pick up, mild recession persist euro area. in switzerland, real gdp third quarter increase follow temporary downturn. for fourth quarter, however, expect significant weaken growth. consequently, economic growth switzerland year 2012 likely remain unchanged around 1.0%. for 2013, expect growth 1.0–1.5%. the downside risk swiss economy remain considerable. although measure announce european central bank (ecb) significantly reduce probability extreme development monetary union, still substantial uncertainty connection management debt crisis euro area. it also remain see far upcoming budget consolidation u hamper growth. this question weigh sentiment financial market real economy. moreover, momentum swiss residential mortgage real estate market remain strong, lead increase risk financial stability. global economic outlook i would like outline outlook global economy switzerland detail. then i look monetary financial condition snb’s monetary policy. in third quarter 2012, global economic growth remain weak, volume international foreign trade actually declined. a mild recession persist euro area, japan record strongly negative growth figures. in us, growth support private consumption well improvement residential construction investment. the situation vary emerge economies. in countries, scarcely improvement economic momentum, others – china – supportive economic policy lead consolidation. 2 bi central bankers’ speech we still expect global economy whole gradually recover. however, adjust forecast 2013 slightly last monetary policy assessment. this revision mainly affect short-term outlook euro area. we expect euro area emerge recession course 2013. in us, moderate recovery likely continue, partly result favourable development residential construction. in emerge economies, growth continue gain momentum. the downside risk global economy remain high. the crisis euro area continue weigh economic outlook. in september, ecb initiate new security purchase programme, outright monetary transactions. although announcement substantially reduce probability extreme event lead ease financial credit markets, economic situation monetary union remain vulnerable level uncertainty still considerable. a source uncertainty upcoming fiscal decision us. swiss economic outlook in switzerland, real gdp third quarter increase follow downturn, due temporary recovery exports. for fourth quarter, however, expect significant weaken growth. consequently, economic growth year likely come around 1.0%, forecast date. for 2013, expect growth 1.0–1.5%. while gradual revival global economy supportive effect, strength swiss franc hold back export momentum corporate investment expenditure. domestic demand also likely restrain next quarters. in view modest pace growth, production capacity switzerland probably remain underutilised 2013. the rate unemployment likely rise further. give fragility global conditions, downside risk also remain high switzerland. monetary financial condition i turn monetary financial conditions, almost unchanged compare situation summer 2012. interest rate swiss franc money market continue fluctuate around zero. since mid-june, three-month libor fall 9 basis point 1 basis point. interest rate repo market predominantly negative. in addition, yield ten-year confederation bond attain new historical low. this show demand safe investment remain high. over past months, before, movement swiss franc mainly reflect change risk assessment market participants. follow ecb’s announcement early september would purchase unlimited quantity bond crisis-hit euro area country certain conditions, upward pressure swiss franc lessened. the m1, m2 m3 monetary aggregates, measure amount money hold household companies, increase substantially past months. for reason, fear head high rate inflation. however, case. the inflation forecast switzerland continue low. at present, inflation rate still negative territory. inflationary pressure remain minimal strong swiss franc relatively unfavourable global growth outlook. moreover, underutilisation production capacity switzerland restrain inflation outlook. survey inflation expectation show household company continue assume price remain stable, also medium term. give current low interest environment worldwide, enforcement minimum exchange rate necessary ensure suitable monetary condition switzerland. global uncertainty persist foreseeable future drive demand secure investments. bi central bankers’ speech 3 a result exchange rate situation remain fragile, despite calm environment come result measure take ecb. however, low interest rate around world also associate risks. the long low interest rate phase persists, great potential danger speculative price development misallocations. investor search yield could place increase amount real estate, lead, particular, rise real estate price thus, distort pattern incentives. momentum domestic residential mortgage real estate market remain exceptionally strong. mortgage lend continue grow briskly compare economy whole. in addition, real estate prices, already high level, continue rise. a result, risk financial stability increase further. my colleague, jean-pierre danthine, give assessment situation financial sector point view snb. monetary investment policy the minimum exchange rate provide u new challenge monetary policy also investment policy. i would therefore like close word foreign currency investments. a know, month may august, particular, purchase large quantity foreign currency order enforce minimum exchange rate. consequently, snb’s foreign currency investment significantly increased. also, cannot exclude possibility intervene substantially again. from begin make clear enforcement minimum exchange rate associate risks. we endeavour reduce balance sheet risk suitable diversification foreign currency investment. however, exchange rate risk foreign exchange reserve base monetary policy consideration snb therefore oblige bear it. my colleague, fritz zurbrügg, talk management foreign exchange reserve remarks. through monetary policy, snb serf buff swiss economy cushion effect severe shocks. because long-term focus, position carry substantial risks. this mean react flexibly exceptional situation order fulfil mandate, ensure price stability take due account economic developments. bi central bankers’ speech 1 fritz zurbrügg: financial market developments, management foreign currency investment libor issue introductory remark mr fritz zurbrügg, member govern board swiss national bank, medium news conference swiss national bank, berne, 13 december 2012. * * * in remarks, i would like examine three topics. first, i expand what, view, important development financial market since news conference june. afterwards i address management foreign currency investments. finally, i explore issue surround libor rate, global discussion reference interest rate money market generally. development financial market a already mention colleagues, situation international financial market ease somewhat since last news conference. this stabilisation mainly due announcement late summer various central bank expansion unconventional measures. in europe, unequivocal declaration european central bank (ecb) safeguard unity euro area especially calm effect markets. under outright monetary transaction (omt) programme, ecb announce would purchase, certain conditions, unlimited quantity government bond maximum term three years. the bond peripheral euro area sovereigns, particular, benefit omt. yield spread german government bond declined, although remain high level. the euro recovered, trade-weighted basis, fall eight-year low july. it appreciate u dollar, japanese yen, pound sterling – less extent – swiss franc. in us, federal reserve embark third round asset purchases, intervene market buy agency mortgage-backed securities. equity market initially register distinct gains. the s&p 500 stock market index, example, climb 10% mid-june mid-september. this followed, however, consolidation phase october onwards, reflect high level uncertainty persist market environment. this uncertainty largely connect emergency policy measure greece spain, deterioration global economic outlook, loom ‘fiscal cliff’ us. government bond perceive safe benefit this, yield persist extremely low levels. against backdrop, notable volatility risky investment continue decline. the vix index, measure imply volatility u stock market, base option prices, virtually back level last see prior outbreak financial crisis 2007. a similar picture emerge imply volatility foreign currency bond markets. the low volatility due comparatively low demand option hedge price movements. this suggest market participants’ misgive prevail uncertainty dissipate somewhat, likely least consequence monetary policy measure major central banks. in addition, investor appear expect central bank continue pursue expansionary monetary policy foreseeable future, low interest rate ample supply liquidity. in switzerland, interest rate remain low level. the yield ten-year swiss confederation bond decline new low begin december, 0.39%. no government ever record nominal ten-year finance cost low level. 2 bi central bankers’ speech money market rate also continue low. interest rate repo market predominantly negative. at 1 basis point, three-month libor lie zero. base libor future contracts, interest rate expectation market participant low rate environment continue foreseeable future. management foreign currency investment our foreign currency purchase early summer enforce minimum exchange rate result high inflow snb’s foreign currency holdings. these hold increase chf 167 billion since begin year chf 425 billion end november. this direct consequence monetary policy. in event foreign currency purchase necessary implement minimum exchange rate, foreign currency reserve increase, balance sheet expands. monetary policy requirement also high priority come manage foreign currency reserves. this reflected, one hand, condition base investment decisions, namely security, liquidity performance. on hand, primacy monetary policy also evident way implement investment policy. we proceed great caution avoid cause distortion markets. we take account security liquidity requirement foreign currency investment ensure substantial part portfolio comprise high-quality government bonds. at end september, 83% foreign currency hold invest foreign government bond hold sight deposit central bank bank international settlement (bis). a 5% hold investments, mainly corporate bonds. approximately 96% fixed-income security rat aaa aa. around 12% foreign currency investment – exclusively foreign – equities. the snb thereby hold equity value chf 50 billion. i would like emphasise equity investment manage passively. we first decide market want invest, replicate appropriate share indices. the primacy monetary policy clearly differentiate snb investors. in contrast these, exchange rate risk foreign currency investment cannot hedged. this would directly conflict monetary policy, since hedge would equivalent purchase swiss franc foreign currencies, would intensify upward pressure swiss franc. therefore broad possible diversification foreign currency investment sole mean reduce exchange rate risk. at end september, 48% foreign currency hold invest euros, compare 60% mid-year, 28% invest u dollars, 24% currencies. we continuously evaluate new asset class currency advance emerge economies; year, snb begin invest south korean won. our goal diversify foreign currency investment thereby reduce risk concentration. to avoid undesirable third-market effects, entire investment activity invariably undertake high degree prudence caution respect potentially adverse effect markets. this apply equally inflow reallocation investments, well establishment new positions. if, example, see confront high foreign currency inflows, might place sight deposit account central banks, invest securities. the snb absolutely interest cause market distortion influence currency movement countries. issue surround libor reference interest rate i would like conclude explore issue connection libor rate, global discussion reference

central bankers’ speech 1 stanley fischer: recent development israeli economy – interview richard quest interview professor stanley fischer, governor bank israel, mr richard quest, globe israel business conference, tel aviv, 10 december 2012. * * * q: on israeli economy – know slowdown, know won’t necessarily bad people forecast. but optimistic. a: the economy well respects, we’re predict growth next year 3 percent, european economy start decline think might good that, we’re sure now. the thing go well, inflation rate middle target range, exchange rate reasonable level, balance payment pretty good shape. q: what’s go well? a: well, next government go large budgetary problem. the treasury announce last week deficit year 4.2 percent gdp. we’re full employment now, that’s large deficit situation. and it’s know cut ni 15 billion plan expenditure, possibly also raise tax bite far…that’s huge budgetary problem. one reason prime minister choose go election couldn’t get budget coalition – well, go do new coalition. q: a far growth rate israeli economy – growth rate 3 percent – satisfy level growth, bear mind seem non-inflationary therefore give room monetary activity? what future? a: well, market think interest rate go decline next twelve months. clearly room necessary cut interest rates, hope won’t get there. we keep watchful eye price homes, whenever start show sign go consider cut interest rate do, find macroprudential measures. q: be weakness israeli economy see primarily external reasons, something go within israel? a: a large part weakness undoubtedly come global economy fact export grow rapidly previous years. within economy, investment demand grow very, rapidly 2011 part 2012. that slow significantly – presumably mean people look ahead le impress 3 percent growth 5 percent growth 2011, time. so i think that’s potential source difficulty, rest, i think great deal uncertainty – geopolitical uncertainty, also governmental uncertainty, next government do- q: let’s talk that. what worry next government might might do? a: well, that’s major worry – go easy deal budgetary problem, light fact able pas budget month ago. the major challenge whether next government able do 2003, put 2 bi central bankers’ speech economy successful course growth, base plan get budget shape start liberalize economy. that seem major challenge. what’s concern? that instead that, political situation whatever, budget scrape by. that mean next year, 2014, we’ll find scramble get close budget target ambitious be. the deficit year, suppose 2 percent, around 4.2 percent. one guess next year they’ll aim 3 percent; say 3 percent target year, argue something little bite less. it’s difficult ambitious beginning; it’s much difficult ambitious later, road, you’ve already do twice. so that’s really major concern. the second issue one much difficult deal with, issue business climate, see outside within. the world bank issue report year call “doing business” rank country term easy is, difficult is, business. in last two years, decline number 32 list, great, 38 list, much le great. that reflect general feel business climate deteriorated. it relate bureaucracy, relate place stand problems, construction process, variety bureaucratic processes, register property, thing well. we go far behind pay taxes…these thing deal with, want get economy grow again. q: you basically saying, budget great shape could get worse, economic situation slow could get worse, business climate engine growth perform could get worse. be you’re saying? a: well, it’s always good someone translate i’m say english i greatly appreciate that. but i say things, i also say we’re grow 3 percent, don’t balance payment problem, don’t inflation problem, we’re grow fast almost economy west. q: if next government miss budgetary forecast, deficit continue target, mean you, successor, take action rebalance, maintain equilibrium. a: well depend reason miss budgetary targets. if reason miss budgetary target economy slow down, tax revenue go down, government stand expenditure plans, it’s obvious try reduce deficit point. if deficit rise spend go up, something like that, you’re look different situation. so wait see. one many thing government israel fight last 6–7 year move one high debt ratio western world one lowest. now move 100 percent 75 percent debt gdp ratio. the others move 75 100. so room run expansionary fiscal policy absolutely it, situation unemployment low growth. we don’t need now. q: where stand term tax rise spend cut help balance budget – make much difference central bank? a: most research show change expenditure – cut spend – effective raise tax way deal budget deficit. but we’ve cut tax lot bi central bankers’ speech 3 past years, bank israel argue cut little fast, fact rescind extent. you can’t thing independent ask spend on. if increase defense budget, increase education budget, we’ll finance things. q: do believe increase social spending, education? a: increase efficiency spend area would useful. we big educational problem economy, point go deal it. we deal it, probably need more. q: whichever government take office, won’t much time won’t much wiggle room get right…if don’t get budget deficit control, get control fast. a: if don’t get control first year, 2013, half year, little half year, much hard future. put problem rarely works. q: when go meetings, imf international forums, meet european colleagues, you’re enormously respected, you’re well known, view count – ever want say european ministers, get act together – you’re cause mayhem mischief? a:what european try do? they’re try build federation time enormous difficulty – enormous economic difficulty political difficulties. so they’re take year two it. that’s frustrating. on hand, get done, create different europe long term, that’s need do. q: you know well i build house badly start with, know build badly- a: richard, i must say i don’t put lot weight people tell knew, something happen time ago forget mention – everyone know get fiscal union right away. well, i didn’t hear 1994, i didn’t hear 1997. i think we’re much wise fact. so i’m little le tough guy didn’t see things. just economic crisis show always least 5 people saw coming, say, didn’t i pay attention them; another 50 saw something else come way thank goodness i didn’t pay attention them. so i blame myself. i didn’t see – i don’t think many people saw it. q: what tell people u say – let go “fiscal cliff”, way long term structural change take place – see pain? a: the short term argument tax reduction past decade, crisis, expire december 31 year. that mean tax rate go up, obama position, want cut tax rates, republican want cut tax rates, argue good position reach agreement…i don’t lot faith “we’ll cause lot pain politician they’ll right thing”. we’ve hear story time, i haven’t see anything happen yet. i think good rely try reach deal right now. 4 bi central bankers’ speech q: central banker often headline days. ha time recent crisis – major central banker world – meet said, we’re this, don’t know go work? a: first, “we” include “me” – yet member g7, g10, g20…there meet say something like, “this do, certain work out, best thing do”. q: what happen politician get hand budget? a: there’s natural tendency want spend money, everybody ask spend money, pressure always people come along want money that. that’s country need powerful treasury, israel. there spend tendency, government prefer run deficits. it’s interest two case culture change dramatically – canada 1990s australia 1980s – chronic-deficit country in australia it’s bad government run deficit, canada worry deficit much more. why? because cut deficit grow much fast cases, saw result run decent economic policy. can rely that? not really, depend country. q: what see responsibility house prices, property prices, get kilter? a: we prevent happening. the main problem central bank operate finance side, say demand side house market. we raise interest rate, impose regulation banks, we’ve done, moderate impact low interest rate demand housing. but…reducing price house demand side cause house built, cause le house built. the real place get action solve house problem supply side…if increase supply land country rapidly, able get house price down. if speed pace it’s possible get plan permission, place we’re bad do business study – if deal prices, we’ll get supply house go up, increase production reduce prices. we operate demand side, don’t control supply would enable israel solve house problems. one reason we’ve grow reasonably house activity strong. q: you term-limited 2015. if i could sign law give third term – would want it? would take it? a: i believe strongly term limits. i hardly see anybody get good ten year job. i believe strongly ten year term limit governors. i think i stop teach i stop sick stomach i go lectured. i lose fear students, i really don’t want lose fear people journalist among them, job long. it still extremely challenging, it’s great privilege job. q: will stay israel term up? a: i much want stay strongly connect israel, family state we’ll decide do. but i’m go disappear local scene, that’s sure. bi central bankers’ speech 5 q: i’m choose word carefully here…do desire play public role israel governor bank israel? a: there job i would prefer one i don’t think available, likely available. q: what bring israel? a: my wife i, family, involve israel since young. we visit pretty regularly…spent sabbatical here, know israel reasonably well. in 1983–85 i privilege work george shultz unite state israeli government cooperate stabilize israeli economy we’d always close israel, somebody give opportunity try contribute something israel, i say well, i’d always want that, i’ll never get another opportunity like the current prime minister influential persuasive, finance minister time. we extremely happy it; it’s wonderful experience. q: be fair say 2015 hear last you? a: i hope voice still heard. bi central bankers’ speech 1 matthew elderfield: effective enforcement – encourage compliance good practice open remark mr matthew elderfield, deputy governor central bank ireland, central bank enforcement conference, dublin, 11 december 2012. * * * i would like welcome first conference enforcement host central bank ireland. we glad host event able join u today. enforcement important element regulatory strategy central bank. our approach assertive, risk-based supervision underpin credible enforcement deterrent place. effective enforcement certainly corrective element design ensure accountability non-compliance regulatory requirements, firm – i would like talk briefly moment – ideally also individuals. but effective enforcement much powerful simply bring particular firm management account. the broad benefit, support supervision, deterrent effect enforcement. if firm think credible risk non-compliance regulatory standard would lead sanction central bank, provide powerful motivation board director senior management team ensure high standard conduct. the fact central bank sanction firm publish detail sanction make industry uncomfortable lead plea ease use enforcement tool. we apologise take enforcement action publicise them. there deterrence value unless firms, investors, consumer public aware respond enforcement action behaviour practice fall short. i firm belief necessary best practice element regulatory toolkit central bank. and, unless sanction publish enough detail occur sanction impose deterrent effect diluted. we purposefully make effort explicit detail publicity statement involve enforcement sanctions. the purpose provide great transparency industry, market public nature breach committed. the publication enforcement action reputational impact firm management concerned. a consequence approach impact enforcement effort great because, frankly, message clearly communicate industry public breach tolerated. consequently firm powerfully incentivised avoid enforcement action diligent respect regulatory compliance. this raise standard generally financial service sector. it show consequence non-compliance. and efficient use resources. rather try individually mark firm supervise, risk enforcement action multiplier effect across regulatory population term encourage compliance good practice. it is, example, particularly useful large population smaller, low impact, firm cannot routine supervisory interaction. the benefit enforcement therefore clear term raise standards. these benefit recognise ireland but, course, across many jurisdiction europe generally internationally elsewhere. enforcement action take supervisor ireland, uk us, also across european union include france, germany, sweden, malta luxembourg example. so, i think concern competitiveness impact take enforcement actions, point sometimes put me, somewhat overstated. 2 bi central bankers’ speech and clear, i don’t think make sense somehow ring fence international firm scope potential enforcement action. we see weakness governance, system control breach amongst international firms, domestic ones. protect ireland’s reputation international financial centre important mean firm central bank need vigilant standard sector. what argument it’s fair take enforcement action mistakes? or management team self-reports breach get exemption enforcement? these are, frankly, well-trodden somewhat hackneyed arguments. these certainly relevant factor consider enforcement process, typically would give consideration assess correct sanctions. but clear international practice enforcement still take place circumstances. it important deterrent effect still apply inadvertent breach self-reported one well. to otherwise, would effectively turn blind eye requirement require uphold would encourage culture slackness would sow seed significant detriment consumer damage financial stability. so, let clear, enforcement financial sector ireland stay. we aim transparent particular enforcement priority give year publicly state are. we clear certain type breach likely attract enforcement action others. additionally, allocate resource take case reactive basis respond appropriately serious breaches. enforcement automatic breach involve collaborative effort supervisory team enforcement directorate. we exercise judgement discretion use tool. i’m please progress make past three year enforcement strategy. we establish good track record take case financial service firm wide range breaches. in last three years, central bank conclude 30 administrative sanction case impose approximately €13.3 million fines. we see benefit term behaviour industry. for example, financial firms’ effort provide restitution overcharge case tend drag interminably prior set strict deadline back threat enforcement action – take couple cases. we target transaction report area concern see firm tighten procedure result. we send strong signal firm domestic international system control need strong robust. we also, part mandate protect consumers, focus firm handle complaint customers, emphasise firm importance consumer protection professional interaction. i would like thank staff enforcement directorate central bank also supervisor help prepare enforcement case good work make happen. but quickly deliver enforcement strategy term action firms, still way go conclude successful action individual involve management financial firms. generally speaking, firm tend settle individual tend fight corner bitter end. so it. that mean process protracted, financial regulator enforcement authorities. so, need considerable patience determination. the introduction fitness probity regime important step forward develop comprehensive effective regime. the ability remove person occupy important function within regulate firm fail meet require standard fitness probity, indeed prevent meet standard enter industry, ensure great confidence trust person occupy important function within regulate firms. all said, i think would useful find appropriate mechanism provide measure analysis reflection overall structure ireland take case bi central bankers’ speech 3 individual breach financial regulation indeed case white collar financial crime. this challenge area most, all, countries, i think many people ireland impression national track record could stronger. the central bank, predecessor financial regulator, apply financial sanction seven individual past 10 years. we substantial case individual pipeline, take lot time. similarly, criminal front, despite effort gardaí, dpp odce, still way start criminal proceedings, never mind successful conclusion, case arise financial crisis. look back, see take long time high profile case tribunal reach conclusions. take together, track record arguably undermine public confidence “enforcement system” broadly define weaken deterrent impact head next crisis scandal. surely, case step back ask rather fundamental questions. this question deliver speedy enforcement action individual – without cut corner – although part it. it examine whether current enforcement system able really deliver result come individual responsible financial failure impose cost society, breach financial regulatory standard financial white collar crime generally. this clearly difficult area frankly many country struggle well. but let briefly suggest possible area could explored. a coordinate strategic approach necessary effective enforcement. at high level, would first make sense examine respective role mission principal enforcement body involve financial white collar crime and, part this, ass capability resource deliver objectives. it would additionally make sense ass whether best practice enforcement technique adopt lead jurisdictions. it would also useful carefully review whether exist legal framework collect evidence pursue case appropriately calibrate ensure success. in november 2010 director corporate enforcement make commendable submission department justice white collar crime white paper, highlight problem current system, suggest possible reforms. he also raise concern rule govern question suspect and, credit, government act quickly matter. it seem proposal merit. more fundamentally, i would argue use opportunity examine underlie legal offence area financial white collar crime consider whether need amendment bolstering. for example, regard administrative sanction case take central bank, strict test responsibility apply director senior management – i.e. individual – firm breach regulation subject sanctions? should we, like fsa propose uk treasury committee considering, introduce degree presumptive liability sanction director bank fail require public support? should general offence – either civil criminal – reckless trade financial service company? what adjustment legislative framework might result effective enforcement action individual case financial white collar crime? these matter require close scrutiny careful debate, necessarily make statute book. but important issue examine systematically thoughtful consider way part broader, strategic initiative strengthen ireland enforcement capability effectiveness. these matter deserve public debate, well expert study. indeed approach see department justice’s white paper crime – currently 4 bi central bankers’ speech prepare – include section organise white collar crime, subject public consultation submissions, many matter refer raised. this may usefully lead package policy proposal enhance irish enforcement system. this change rule game prospect financial crisis case currently pipeline central bank shortly court (although lesson proceed also inform reform agenda) – strengthen system future. what best way go this? the law reform commission? a government green paper? a wise person report? some mechanism measure careful analysis issue round would seem make sense, alongside thoughtful public debate issues. perhaps lead academic body ireland might facilitate stimulate discussion area, example. but somehow take opportunity ask search question raise collective game ensure truly effective enforcement system deliver deterrence really counts: door individual break rules. only able take comfort create system help deter origin next financial crisis. just impetus internationally laud criminal asset bureau come tragic circumstance surround dublin’s gangland problem 1990s, recent financial crisis provide catalyst opportunity ireland create truly effective system assist fight white collar crime, bring individual responsibility action person hold senior position financial institutions. bi central bankers’ speech 1 mark carney: guidance remark mr mark carney, governor bank canada chairman financial stability board, cfa society toronto, toronto, ontario, 11 december 2012. * * * introduction it pleasure today discus guidance. guidance fundamentally manage expectations, let manage front. this speech primarily policy guidance; provide new policy guidance. we need guidance time time – look parents, teachers, partner peer help make life, career major financial decisions. ultimately, though, decision make, consequence bear. take responsibility become charter financial analysts: learn analyse information, make difficult valuation credit decisions, bear risk reap reward result. you rely accurate full disclosure company analyse. without it, could jobs; and, indeed, financial market could bring together saver investor allocate capital efficiently. with cfa charter holder per caput major jurisdiction, canada favour emphasis fundamental analysis core system. beyond disclosure, else usefully conveyed? doe communication companies’ expectation performance serve purpose? what central bank expectation future policy? in remarks, i discus guidance effective may warranted. my main message transparency critical well-functioning capital market effective monetary policy, forward guidance policy best use sparingly normal times. in extraordinary times, however, conditional guidance use resolve time inconsistency achieve good path economy. first, allow address private sector use guidance impact financial markets. company disclosure an ongoing focus regulator ensure company disclosure full, fair timely. the crisis demonstrate need good disclosure financial institutions. insufficient inconsistent disclosure financial institution contribute uncertainty erode market confidence. this lead withdrawal market liquidity, depress valuation increase fund pressures. regulator market participant address shortcomings. an enhance disclosure task force form last may initiative financial stability board. this private sector task force unique undertake bring together senior official bank sector, investors, analysts, rat agency audit firms, consultation international standard-setting body national regulators. in october report, task force outline principle recommendation improve risk disclosure good align banks’ risk management business strategies. together regulatory initiative capital increases, measure contribute improve market confidence financial institutions. 2 bi central bankers’ speech earn guidance that company communicate material fact businesses, everyone time, long controversial.1 there are, however, differ view whether company also provide expectation business perform. most research find little evidence earn guidance systematically improve company valuations, increase shareholder return reduce market volatility.2 some even argue forward earn guidance harmful, focus financial market company management attention short-term “numbers game” expense long-term business fundamentals.3 accordingly, number company stop provide earn guidance, research find company see subsequent increase analyst forecast dispersion decrease forecast accuracy – change actual market volatility.4 be central bank communication different? first foremost, central bank pursue transparency accountable democratic societies. moreover, research experience demonstrate clear open communication also enhance effectiveness monetary policy. in particular, successful monetary policy require transparency around two aspect policy approach – try achieve go achieve it. with respect former, canada benefit clear objective monetary policy since adoption explicit inflation target 1991. a canadian come understand bank’s policy objective gain confidence attainment time, inflation expectation become firmly anchor around 2 per cent target. this confidence allow household firm make longer-term plan great confidence, align savings, investment spend decision common inflation-control objective. these action collectively serve make inflation target self-reinforcing. they also give bank great latitude respond aggressively economic shock without fear dislodge longer-term inflation expectations. in short, common understand monetary policy objective make attainment easier. of course, would quite remarkable simply communicate monetary policy objective sufficient ensure achievement. the conduct policy obviously matter well. the bank canada implement policy change target overnight interest rate, limit direct impact saving, investment spend decisions. far important impact bank’s action broad spectrum market interest rates, domestic asset price exchange rate. what matter asset prices, however, much current set policy interest rate but, rather, expect path time. thus monetary policy affect 1 regulation fair disclosure adopt u.s. security exchange commission 2000 address problem selective disclosure information publicly trade company issuers.

objective achieved.6 the bank canada become significantly transparent. we explain decision eight time year provide rich supplemental detail quarterly monetary policy report.7 these communication design report bank’s view force work canadian economy help households, firm financial market participant understand bank respond force time. the goal is, effect, allow market public “think along us,” promote appropriate formation policy expectation give current information, also allow expectation evolve efficiently new information received. we would easy time communicate “reaction function” follow simple mechanical rule. life would indeed easy could rigid. but achieve target require take flexible policy approach, one inform consider analysis judgment. that one reason transparency – occasionally guidance – matters. guidance normal time help achieve monetary policy goal in perfect world, guidance would unnecessary. the inherent uncertainty economic outcome thus policy path would widely understood. with full information efficient markets, monetary policy expectation would effectively take care – know central bank’s inflation objective reaction function would sufficient market public form evolve expectations, without need direct guidance central bank. in real world, monetary policy guidance useful provide additional information. but assured. how get guidance right remain subject considerable debate. one approach provide advance signal markets, use stock phrase code words. not surprisingly, sort signal help market participant predict policy decision near term.8 but clear fulfil promise help market participant understand decision taken.9 without understanding, market participant may even le able form efficient expectation time, thus increase reliance explicit guidance

macroprudential regulation supervision, may appropriate circumstance monetary policy contribute financial stability directly complement macroprudential policy.13 more specifically, consequence financial excess may felt long horizon economic disturbances, potential may exist tension price financial stability consideration typical monetary policy horizon. in current circumstances, bank may want set interest rate high would otherwise warrant bring inflation back target within typical six- eight-quarter time frame. but flexibility exist vacuum, never use stealth. the recent financial system review elaborate risk relate household imbalance canada. their evolution may factor affect time degree withdrawal monetary stimulus. if bank lean imbalances, would clearly say so, indicate much long expect would take inflation return 2 per cent target. our current guidance “some modest withdrawal monetary policy stimulus likely required, consistent achieve 2 per cent inflation target. the time degree withdrawal weigh carefully global domestic developments, include evolution imbalance household sector.” our current guidance indicate policy action may necessary, encourage degree prudence household borrowing. the share new fix rate mortgage almost double 90 per cent year, reflect combination attractively price fixed-rate mortgage tighten bias bank canada. guidance unconventional policy tool while bank belief appropriate spar forward policy guidance ordinary circumstances, calculus change extraordinary ones. when conventional monetary policy exhaust zero low bind (zlb) nominal interest rates, additional stimulus likely call impossible achieve use conventional interest rate tool. extraordinary forward guidance one unconventional policy tool, along quantitative ease credit easing.14 the bank canada use extraordinary forward guidance april 2009, policy interest rate low possible level additional stimulus needed. at time, commit hold policy rate level second quarter 2010, conditional outlook inflation. in effect, substitute duration great certainty regard interest rate outlook negative interest rate set would warrant could achieved. the bank’s conditional commitment succeed change market expectation future path interest rates, provide desire stimulus thereby underpin rebound growth inflation canada (chart 3).15 when inflation outlook – explicit condition – changed, path interest rate change accordingly. 13 bank canada, renewal inflation-control target, november 2011. 14 bank canada, “framework conduct monetary policy low interest rates,” mpr, april 2009. 15 see z. he, “evaluating effect bank canada’s conditional commitment policy,” discussion paper no. 2010–11, bank canada, 2010; m. woodford “methods policy accommodation interest-rate low bound,” paper present jackson hole symposium, “the change policy landscape,” 31 august – 1 september 2012. 6 bi central bankers’ speech our conditional commitment work exceptional, explicit anchor highly credible inflation-targeting framework. it also work “put money mouth were” extend almost $30 billion exceptional liquidity program place duration conditional commitment. and work reach beyond central bank watcher make clear, simple statement directly canadians. obviously optimal policy path differ central banks, depend circumstance mandates. for example, federal reserve indicate september meet policy rate could expect remain exceptionally low level mid-2015, provide additional certainty respect reaction function link future unconventional monetary policy substantial improvement outlook u.s. labour market. further, indicate leave highly accommodative policy place “for considerable time economic recovery strengthens.” the feed also expand large-scale asset purchases, dub “qe3,” consistent enhance forward guidance.16 guidance time inconsistency do may require overcome familiar monetary policy challenge time inconsistency – conventionally understood.17 today, achieve good path economy time, central bank may need commit credibly maintain highly accommodative policy even economy and, potentially, inflation pick up. market participant may doubt willingness inflation-targeting central bank respect commitment inflation go temporarily target. these doubt reduce effective stimulus commitment delay recovery. to “tie hands,” central bank could publicly announce precise numerical threshold inflation unemployment must meet reduce stimulus.18 this could reinforce central bank’s commitment stimulative policy future thus enhance stimulative impact policy present, help economy escape liquidity trap. further enhance guidance may require change framework from perspective, threshold exhaust guidance option available central bank operate flexible inflation targeting. if yet stimulus required, policy framework would likely changed.19 for example, adopt nominal gdp (ngdp)-level target could many respect powerful employ threshold flexible inflation targeting. this would add “history dependence” monetary policy. under ngdp 16 u.s. federal reserve, federal open market committee press release, 13 september 2012. 17 in day independent central banks, government could credibly commit maintain low stable inflation, since subsequently incentive violate commitment engineer growth-boosting inflation surprise. this time inconsistency lead unfavourable stagflation equilibrium 1970s, ultimately result widespread operational independence central banks. see f. kydland e. prescott, “rules rather than discretion: the inconsistency optimal plans,” journal political economy 85 (3) (1977): 473–92. 18 see, instance, c. l. evans, “perspectives current economic issues,” speech deliver bank ann arbor breakfast, ann arbor, michigan, 18 september 2012. 19 in jurisdictions, include canada, change policy framework would require approval political authority. in others, would require change constitution. bi central bankers’ speech 7 targeting, bygone bygone central bank compel make past miss path nominal gdp (chart 4). bank canada research show that, normal circumstances, gain good exploit expectation channel history-dependent framework likely modest, may dilute key condition met. most notably, people must generally understand central bank – admittedly high bar.20 however, policy rate stick zero low bound, could favourable case ngdp targeting. the exceptional nature situation, magnitude gap involved, could make policy credible easy understand.21 of course, benefit regime change would weigh carefully effectiveness unconventional monetary policy measure proven, flexible inflation-targeting framework. conclusion company talk future performance, cannot guarantee delivery. central bank talk future path policy, can, least surface, deliver. however, ordinary times, achieve objective mean deliver path policy adjust economic circumstance evolve. therefore, path cannot predict certainty advance. in bank’s view, limit effectiveness policy guidance relatively special circumstances. in extraordinary times, policy guidance may appropriate, and, bank demonstrate conditional commitment, highly effective. but, extreme circumstances, even conditional commitment may prove insufficient. in order provide even great stimulus zlb, central bank “restrain” future policy path pre-commitment history-dependence. in cases, central bank must mindful impact financial stability amount “low long” interest rate environment. this put premium co-ordination among relevant authority provide active macroprudential management. our goal, always, ensure households, firm

euromoney-qatar conference “global finance re-designed”. i wish thank qatar central bank invitation speak event. in current global environment, unprecedented wide range global policy response yet produce financial stability sustainable recovery global economy. the intensification globalization finance decade result even connect interdependent world. while financial system economy part world felt effect recent global financial crisis, discourage pace internationalization financial systems, particular, emerge economies. my address morning financial stability internationalization financial system emerge economies. my remark cover benefit challenge internationalization, lesson draw recent global financial crisis, malaysian experience internationalization financial system. benefit challenge internationalisation financial system while significant benefit internationalization financial systems, result increase international financial integration bring new risk challenges. the case increase financial liberalization internationalization maintain would foster development efficient robust financial system. while result competitive financial system enhance efficiency financial intermediation process contribute towards reduce cost intermediation, supervisory oversight need ensure competition result mispricing risk adverse consequence financial stability. other benefit increase opportunity technology transfer, new expertise great innovation new product offerings. increase foreign participation domestic financial market would also contribute increase liquidity competitive price domestic financial market encourage efficient allocation capital within economy. it also maintain contribute expansion development domestic financial market particular, capital market, prove important access finance investment activity. with efficient function domestic financial markets, would also improve transmission mechanism monetary policy. meanwhile, increase capital inflow follow capital account liberalization represent another source finance would contribute towards increase investment growth. it allow jurisdiction surplus fund channel region productive investment opportunity thus contribute towards efficient allocation fund across international borders. the strong cross border financial linkage potential enhance international trade investment opportunities. it allow country leverage respective comparative advantage complementarity reinforce mutual growth. this would important current environment facilitate cross border economic activity. the liberalisation capital account form remove restriction foreign exchange transaction would also increase flexibility manage foreign exchange transactions. this would increase potential good manage associate risks, 2 bi central bankers’ speech increase efficiency gain would also reduce cost business. finally, also argue liberalise environment, would great market discipline would turn promote financial stability domestic financial system. this however, rely sufficient level disclosure transparency allow efficient function markets. the internationalization financial system however, without risk challenges. the risk contagion follow increase connectivity increase significantly, term extent speed. the contagion result external event development range failure large important international financial institution eruption war political incident regional global repercussions. meanwhile, global development include global policy spillover also result volatile capital flows. the increase openness financial system also increase vulnerability economic cycle part world. the increase interdependence financial system economy contagion effect expect among significant outcome financial internationalization. financial liberalization could example amplify implication financial stress part world domestic financial system. it could also accentuate amplify asset bubble boom bust cycles. other implication could contribute widen income disparity also marginalization domestic financial institution able perform competitive environment. finally, volatile capital flow may affect efficient function financial market could result misalign exchange rate reflect underlie fundamentals. these potential risk vulnerability continue challenge emerge economy also develop financial system economies. lesson financial crisis while benefit gain internationalization financial systems, risk financial stability also increase immensely. the risk generally emanate great prospect contagion follow great degree interdependence. these risk would even pronounce emerge economy financial system yet become develop matured. to good position reap benefit internationalization financial system emerge economies, crisis provide u several lessons. firstly, recognize different part domestic financial system highly interconnected. this also include part may regulatory capture. financial stress specific segment may long confine segment may rapidly transmit rest financial system. thus, piecemeal policy response would sufficient. it would require comprehensive response ensure stress condition evolve major financial crisis. secondly, build-up risk financial stability need identify early. pre-emptive action would reduce cost crisis financial system economy. third, regulatory authority need accord necessary power manage risk financial stability. fourth, optimal policy mix may include policy action address immediate term issue would also need simultaneously address underlie structural problems. fifth, give recognition importance enable condition render implement policy yield desire outcomes. finally, facilitate effective policy decision make need platform governance process policy coordination across agency within economy extend regional international collective action. follow recent global financial crisis, policy response national level extensive unprecedented scale. while wide range financial reform international level strengthen resilience financial sector, cross bi central bankers’ speech 3 border dimension policy-making extensive. this despite swift spread financial economic shock throughout global economy international financial system follow eruption financial crisis 2008. despite increase challenges, institutional arrangement policy cooperation coordination yet reach level commensurate degree global economic financial integration. while individual effort single economy vital, long guarantee global financial stability. emerge economy open integrate global economy international financial system affect developments. the crisis forcefully demonstrate importance international dimension policy. finally, consequence financial crisis deserve increase attention widen income disparity within economies. the recent crisis worsen trend give condition high unemployment many part world. at national level, development inclusive financial system development social safety net contribute contain trend. financial internationalisation malaysian experience in pursue financial sector liberalisation transition internationalise financial system, malaysia adopt gradual sequence approach. this ensure necessary precondition place benefit increase financial internationalisation would realised, ensure associate risk inherent open economy internationally integrate financial system could effectively managed. seven precondition identify important process. the first accord priority build capacity intermediary financial sector, strengthen resilience competitiveness. at time asian financial crisis, malaysia highly fragment bank sector seventy bank institutions, many small highly vulnerable. during financial crisis, major restructure exercise undertaken. this follow industry-wide merger exercise, prompt increase capitalisation requirements. the restructure strengthen balance sheet bank institutions, consolidation produce large strong financial groups. the second undertake financial reform focus transition market-oriented financial system. this involve interest rate reform would support efficient price financial product services. the competitive environment generate become important driver efficiency gain innovation financial system. equal attention also give development financial infrastructure, particular, payment settlement system modernization legal framework give great clarity legislation govern financial sector. this involve seven new legislation enact area central banking, payment system, money services, deposit insurance, regulation banking, insurance, islamic finance, development financial institution cooperatives. this give great certainty predictability function financial system. importance also give strengthen surveillance capability central bank effectiveness regulatory supervisory regime. this involve transition rule-based regulation enhance principle-based regulation regime focus governance practice risk management. this reinforce shift risk-based supervision. the supervisory oversight however continue remain intrusive, pre-emptive intervention framework ensure potential risk financial stability 4 bi central bankers’ speech would continue address include regionally internationally connect financial sector. in parallel effort development security market. from financial system over-reliance bank system financing, financial system become diversify great access finance bond sukuk market. the domestic security market evolve become vibrant part malaysian finance ecosystem, serve disperse concentration risk financial system thereby contribute towards preserve financial stability. the malaysian security market expand significantly become large asean region. malaysia also make significant investment talent development financial service sector. give significance define performance resilience financial sector, comprehensive institutional arrangement put place level industry; entry point, work specialist levels, professional level leadership level include board financial institutions. finally, financial system become regionally internationally integrated, regional financial stability arrangement also established. these include advance collective initiative area regional surveillance, development regional financial market payment infrastructure, cross-border supervision. forum assessment risk regional financial stability also initiated, work establish integrate crisis management resolution framework region progress. a part initiatives, regional support mechanism also established. with pre-conditions place, malaysia commence initiative internationalise financial system begin 2003. the internationalisation financial sector entail advancement two main areas; financial sector liberalisation capital account liberalisation. in pursue great regional international financial integration, aim enhance diversity financial system term product offerings, improve competitiveness financial system strengthen economic linkage region part world. the financial sector liberalisation involve increase foreign entry participation financial system. new licence issue foreign conventional islamic bank institutions, minimum foreign strategic stake insurance takaful industry increased. increase operational flexibility also accord exist foreign bank institution financial system account 30% bank system. at time, foreign participation security market liberalise 2007 allow foreign corporation raise finance either domestic foreign currency. the capital account liberalisation throughout first decade 2000s involve progressive removal restriction foreign exchange administration rules. this liberalisation intensify 2005, take account state readiness financial system economy manage consequential increase cross border financial flows. in july 2005, malaysia migrate fix exchange rate regime flexible exchange rate regime accord great flexibility adjust change structural condition region global economy. with progressive dismantle restrictions, business flexibility manage financial exchange exposures. this encourage two way capital flow contribute towards stabilise volatile capital flow economy. finally, addition accord necessary power new legislations, policy toolkit central bank also expand address potential build-up financial imbalance risk financial stability follow increase internationalisation. this include macro-prudential supervisory measure collectively address underlie cause financial stability. a platform also establish great bi central bankers’ speech 5 coordination among policy maker within country, among regulator public sector. conclusion let conclude remarks. while many lesson draw various episode financial crisis experience world economy, one approach liberalization internationalization financial systems. it success depend prevail circumstance state readiness financial system economy capacity manage associate risks. premature internationalization result highly destabilize conditions. the liberalization process also need pragmatic, take consideration different objective need achieved. with sufficient development financial infrastructure, safeguard buffers, emerge economy every potential participate internationally integrate financial system facilitate mutually reinforce global growth development. bi central bankers’ speech 1 deepak mohanty: perspective india’s balance payment speech mr deepak mohanty, executive director reserve bank india, school management, kiit university, bhubaneswar, 7 december 2012. * * * the assistance provide rajan goyal & rajeev jain acknowledged. i thank professor sar invite address young audience. in recent years, india’s integration global economy increase significantly. this reflect expand volume external trade financial transactions. while process several benefit arise wide access consumption investment, attendant cost periodic instability. over last two years, reserve bank draw attention widen current account deficit (cad) balance payment (bop). the risk bop increase global domestic context: first, follow global financial crisis trade volume slump capital flow become volatile; second, slow domestic growth couple large fiscal deficit alongside high cad pose twin deficit risks. in context, i propose capture evolution india’s bop historical context trace respond risk external stability time time? let start basics. what bop? it transaction account rest world. it good appreciate term national income account identity: gdp = c+g+i+x-m. in words, domestic output (gdp) equal private consumption (c), plus government consumption (g), plus domestic investment (i), plus net export (x-m). if net export good service (x-m) negative, domestic economy absorb produce. in words, absorption (c+g+i) domestic economy great domestic output (gdp). this reflect current account deficit (x-m) need finance external borrow and/or investments. in normal time external finance may problem. however, could challenge global domestic economic outlook favourable. against background, scheme presentation follows: identify key event shape india’s bop since independence; examine change composition capital inflows; conclusion highlight risk make suggestion reinforce india’s bop. india’s bop evolve reflect change development paradigm exogenous shock time time. in 60 year span, 1951–52 2011–12, six event last impact bop: (i) devaluation 1966; (ii) first second oil shock 1973 1980; (iii) external payment crisis 1991; (iv) east asian crisis 1997; (v) y2k event 2000; (vi) global financial crisis 2008. i analyse bop trend sequence. the first phase consider 1950s mid-1960s. in early 1950s, india reasonably open. for example, 1951–52, merchandise trade, export plus imports, account 16 per cent gdp. overall current receipt plus payment nearly 19 per cent gdp. subsequently, share external sector india’s gdp gradually decline inward look policy import substitution. moreover, indian export basket comprise mainly traditional item like tea, cotton textile jute manufactures. not scope world trade expansion commodity le additionally india face competition new emerge suppliers, pakistan jute manufacture ceylon east africa tea. during period, policy emphasis import save rather export promotion, priority give basic good capital good sector. it argue investment heavy industry would bring save foreign exchange, output industry would replace import long-run. import-substituting strategy expect 2 bi central bankers’ speech gradually increase export competitiveness efficiency-gains achieve domestic economy. but happen. hence, export remain modest. in fact external sector contract relation gdp level observe early 1950s. by 1965–66, merchandise trade 8 per cent gdp overall current receipt payment 10 per cent gdp (table 1). notwithstanding contract size external sector, import growth outstrip export growth, persistent current account deficit (cad). emphasis heavy industrialisation second five year plan lead sharp increase imports. on top this, strain indo-china conflict 1962, indo-pakistan war 1965 severe drought 1965–66 trigger major bop crisis. india’s international economic relation advance country come stress indo-pak conflict. withdrawal foreign aid country like u conditional resumption aid aid india consortium lead contraction capital inflows. give low level foreign exchange reserve burgeon trade deficit, india option devalue. rupee devalue 36.5 per cent june 1966.1 though india’s export basket limited, sharp devaluation clearly increase competitiveness india’s exports. concurrently, india undertake number trade liberalise measures. even though net impact devaluation contentious issue among lead economists,2 data show export growth, though modest, outpace import growth (chart 1). 1 official rate increase rs.4.76 per u dollar rs.7.50 per u dollar. 2 for example, bhagwati srinivasan (1975) argue effective devaluation import exports. “foreign trade regime economic development: india”, national bureau economic research, new york. bi central bankers’ speech 3 in fact, current account turn surplus 1973–74 export growth significant invisible3 receipt also show sharp turnaround deficit surplus mainly account official transfer largely represent grant agreement february 1974 u government disposition pl 480 rupee funds. since surplus current account balance (cab) use repay rupee loan agreement us, accretion reserve marginal. surplus india’s cab was, however, short-lived first oil shock occur october 1973. sharp rise international oil price evident high import growth 1973–74 1974–75. the share crude oil india’s import bill rise 11 per cent 1972–73 26 per cent 1974–75. a export improved, particularly oil produce middle-east countries, bop recover quickly first oil shock. by time, indian rupee, link multi-currency basket pound sterling intervention currency, depreciate u dollar (chart 2). 3 comprise services, transfer income. 4 bi central bankers’ speech depreciate rupee along policy incentive exporter act support factor india’s exports. at time, invisible receipt grow sharply stem workers’ remittance middle east. consequently, current account balance turn surplus 1976–77 1977–78 (chart 3). thus, private transfer add new positive dimension india’s bop first oil shock. further, official exchange rate nearly converge market exchange rate, much incentive rout remittance unofficial exchange brokers. the rapid growth private transfer reinforce trade account adjustment make current account situation much comfortable (chart 4). bi central bankers’ speech 5 during 1980s, bop come stress. the second oil shock lead rapid increase import early 1980s. oil import increase two-fifths india’s import 1980–83. at time, india’s external sector policy change towards great openness. various measure undertake promote export liberalise import exporter period. however, several factor weigh external stability. first, despite number export promotion measures, subdue growth condition world economy constrain export growth. second, surplus account invisibles also deteriorate due moderation private transfers. third, debt service increase great recourse debt create flow external commercial borrow (ecbs) non-resident indian (nri) deposits. fourth, deterioration fiscal position stem rise expenditure accentuate twin deficit risks. give already emerge vulnerability india’s bop 1980s, incipient sign stress discernible culminate bop crisis 1991 gulf war lead sharp increase oil prices. on top that, slowdown world trade follow recessionary condition industrialise country economic disruption eastern europe include erstwhile ussr begin affect india’s exports. a large number indian worker employ kuwait airlift india remittance stopped. foreign exchange reserve already dwindle due significant drawdown finance cad early years. during 1990–91, one point time, foreign currency asset dip us$ 1.0 billion, cover barely two week imports. with increase recourse borrow commercial term previous years, finance cad also become sensitive creditors’ confidence indian economy. short-term credit begin dry outflow nri deposit also substantial. downgrade india’s credit rat investment grade also constrain india’s access international market funds, especially ecbs trade credit. even though stress india’s bop unprecedented, government decide honour debt obligation without seek reschedule (reddy, 2006).4 in response bop crisis, combination standard unorthodox policy stabilisation structural change undertake ensure crisis translate generalise financial instability. such step include pledge gold reserves, discourage non-essential imports, access credit imf multilateral bilateral donors. while deal crisis imf programme, comprehensive programme structural reform undertake simultaneously special emphasis external sector. the broad approach reform external sector lay report high level committee balance payment (chairman: c. rangarajan, 1993). trade policies, exchange rate policy industrial policy recognise part integrate policy framework boost overall productivity, competitiveness efficiency economy. in addition, contain trade current account deficit enhance export competitiveness, exchange rate rupee adjust downwards two stage july 1 july 3, 1991 9 per cent 11 per cent, respectively. a dual exchange rate system introduce march 1992 unify march 1993. subsequently, india move current account convertibility august 1994 liberalise various transaction relate merchandise trade invisibles. the impact policy change reflect low cad comfortable finance subsequent years. india could manage external shock emanate east asian crisis 1997 subsequently, rise international oil price burst 4 reddy, y.v. (2006), “dynamics balance payment india”, speech first diamond jubilee lecture department commerce, osmania university december 16. 6 bi central bankers’ speech dotcom bubble 1999–2000. indeed, indian economy remain relatively insulate east asian crisis owe reform undertake previous year proactive timely policy measure initiate reserve bank minimise contagion effect. monetary tighten couple flexible exchange rate step bolster reserve issuance resurgent india bond (ribs) help stabilize bop. the bop come stress first half 2000–01 due sharp rise oil price increase interest rate advance countries. at time, india’s software export get boost follow demand address y2k challenges. this also encourage migration indian software engineer advance countries. a result, surplus service export remittance account bop increase sharply offset deficit trade account. software export rise 0.9 per cent gdp 1999–2000 peak 3.8 per cent gdp 2008–09. private remittance also rise 2.7 per cent gdp 3.8 per cent period. thus, 2000s software export private remittance emerge two main finance item current account mitigate large extent merchandise trade deficit (tables 2 & 3). owe combination factors, fact, current account record surplus 2001–04. subsequently, international oil price start rise domestic growth pick up, deficit current account re-emerge 2004–05 2007–08 albeit remain range bound. after period stability, india’s bop come stress 2008–09 reflect impact global financial crisis. a capital inflow plummeted, india draw foreign currency asset u $ 20 billion 2008–09. stress since collapse lehman brother largely emanate decline india’s merchandise export deceleration growth service exports. though improvement 2010–11 bi central bankers’ speech 7 back strong pick-up export mainly lead diversification trade term composition well direction, prove short-lived. bop come stress 2011–12 slowdown advance economy spill emerge develop economy (edes), sharp increase oil gold imports. let turn finance aspect current account. india’s openness, term trade flow capital flow increase 1990s accelerate 2000s (chart 5). this make possible due substantial liberalisation capital account great openness private capital. in first three decade independence, cad mainly finance external assistance drawdown forex reserves. since much india’s plan strategy conceive term close economy theoretical framework, private investment inflow economy encourage much. therefore, foreign resource come primarily form official transfers. the private investment come mainly technology transfer, play minuscule role. during period, development effort stress bop time time lead india tap diverse aid source specific projects. in 1980s, traditional source official concessional flow dry need access private capital. but, come form debt create flow though costly external commercial borrow (ecbs) nri deposits. the limitation finance cad debt create flow expose 1991 crisis. subsequent reform open capital account non-debt create flow foreign direct investment (fdi) portfolio equity flow completely transform source finance bop also result substantial addition reserve 2000s (table 4 & chart 6). 8 bi central bankers’ speech conclude remark with gradual external liberalisation indian economy, size bop increase manifold, pattern current capital account changed. even though reform process strengthen resilience india’s external sector, time vulnerability arise great exposure economy rest world liberalise trade investment environment. india’s current account particularly remain vulnerable development trade account. it evident size trade deficit grow 0.5 per cent gdp 1951–55 8.7 per cent 2007–12. in 2011–12, current account deficit widen record 4.2 per cent gdp (chart 7). over years, current account derive resilience surplus generate invisibles, particularly software export private transfers, trade deficit continue dictate overall trend current account. whenever trade account worsen reflect downswing global business cycle rise international oil prices, bi central bankers’ speech 9 current account also come stress evident present context. go forward, since india’s linkage world economy, term trade finance, likely grow further, important resilience trade account build mainly promote productivity base export competitiveness improve domestic fundamental supportive least costly non-debt create flows, particularly foreign direct investment (fdi). in context, i make suggestions. first, current level cad far level sustainable india. a per estimates, nominal growth rate 13 per cent, sustainable current account gdp ratio 2.3 per cent (rangarajan, 2012).5 reserve bank’s research show economy sustain cad 2.5 per cent gdp scenario slow growth (rbi, 2012).6 a slow global economy protract high level unemployment advance economy make difficult boost service export short run. if slowdown continues, could also adverse impact inward remittances. hence, need reduce import boost merchandise export bring cad sustainable levels. second, structural policy measure need reduce vulnerability emanate high oil gold imports. while oil major component india’s imports, sharp increase demand gold put additional pressure. during 2008–09 2011–12, average, net gold import stand 2 per cent gdp, almost double level record 2004–05 2007–08. thus, period, cad-gdp ratio,

high interest rates, pay back time. for individual borrowers, except handsome pay rise, hope pay early debt reduce consumption day ahead. well-run enterprise problem service debt business expansion finance loan indeed enhance productivity competitiveness. likewise, heavily indebted government able service debt sustain economic growth rise tax revenues. in words, ability repay debt hinge increase productivity improve income, otherwise, reduce future spend increase savings. but despite substantial gdp growth major industrialise country past 30 years, debt country pile concurrently even alarm rate. advance economy across europe u japan seek boost economic prosperity, standard live employment ever borrow increase consumption public spending. to me, seemingly euphoric approach growth fact drive country “debt abyss”. that clearly unsustainable. indeed present great risk global financial economic stability. for long time, “deep abyss” – danger mask financial innovation market failure – go largely unnoticed. in convolute twist logic, even commend debt-for-prosperity one modern finance’s great contribution well-being mankind. then crisis hit 2008. only millennia-old wisdom “don’t spend beyond your means” suddenly dawn folks. meanwhile, financial market act correct excessive tolerance over-borrowing households, business governments, market failure begin rectified. i explain last year excessive leverage become root cause global financial crisis turmoil followed, solution deleverage cut debt. deleveraging extremely difficult painful process, result job losses, pay cuts, bankruptcies, reduce public 2 bi central bankers’ speech service social welfare. the standard live stall declines. my view suffer pain necessitate process, way put global finance growth right track. there alternative cure, unfortunately. my theory excessive leverage main culprit financial crisis may share everyone. but make mistake – deleveraging cold hard fact reality many advance countries. let’s look closely sector involved: (1) households: take u example. we know american quite use spend credit. but note particular growth u household debts, double 2000 2007, drive mainly people look buy house mortgage. this trend turn cause house price double short period unseen before. look back, ratio average debt after-tax income u household remain 80% past 50 years. but shoot peak 130% end-2007 downward trend follow burst u property bubble, fall current level 109%. force cut debt rather subdue pay rises, many u household choice lessen spending. it still uncertain whether process deleveraging, i.e. increase save decrease spend combined, continue. but one thing certain major factor affect consumer demand us. over europe, many country similarly beset huge debts. despite prevail low interest rates, effort cut debt keep up, restrain consumption impede short-term growth. (2) corporates: corporates always seek increase profit use loan increase investment expand operations. when economy continue boom, rev demand, increase leverage look like enterprising approach increase profits. but circumstance shift, company build mirage prosperity year reliance loan suddenly find mire massive debts. this witness across major industrialise countries. though debt level business differ country country – spain, uk france among highest, obvious alternative reduce debt demand cease grow rapidly before. those healthy enough financially might even go bankrupt. (3) banks: when talk deleveraging cut debt, must also look role play bank process. of course, bank sole provider credit. capital market shadow bank sector indeed among source contribute rapid expansion credit past two decades. however, bank sector beyond doubt key player lead major industrialise country deep deep debt abyss. when global financial crisis finally hit 2008, many large international bank fell complete disarray, send government rescue huge amount public funds. after this, group twenty (g20) decide reform bank system. a series regulatory measure introduce financial stability board (fsb) basel committee bank supervision, aim strengthen quality quantity capital requirement banks. basel iii take effect january 2013, stringent liquidity coverage ratio leverage ratio put place. besides, fsb request additional capital requirement stringent regulatory oversight global systemically important banks. to address moral hazard bank consider “too big fail”, require establish so-called “living will” recovery resolution plan. i intend go detail measures. but i would like point bank require capital liquid asset financial intermediation activities, go reduce credit-creating ability. bi central bankers’ speech 3 this inevitably drive cost borrow individuals, company government alike, thereby add impetus process deleveraging debt reduction major industrialise countries. (4) government: it apparent many major industrialise country over-borrowed. the problem exacerbate global financial crisis 2008. follow prolong period incubation market failure, european debt crisis finally precipitate ireland greece. the crisis since remain unresolved, even spread core country like spain italy. other country european union, include uk france, fare much better, though market accommodative plight far. the whole europe fact mire “debt abyss”. for hard effort european central bank (ecb) minimise risk total euro collapse, president ecb, mr mario draghi, say merely attempt buy time, euro zone country could implement fiscal structural reforms. hopefully market would convince reform would help country reduce government debt regain competitiveness. a regard fiscal reforms, eu agree sign fiscal compact march 2012. if implemented, european country concern pursue rigorous deficit reduction plan low total sovereign debt gdp ratio 60% within years. take italy example. it keep reduce government debt amount equal 3% gdp annually next twenty year reduce current debt-to-gdp ratio 120% target 60%. this show formidable painful european country re-establish fiscal discipline. the short medium term economic outlook europe hardly optimistic. what i would like point implementation fiscal compact lead significant deleveraging various european governments. although u may fare good europe, economy head towards “fiscal cliff”. similar europe, also necessary u make significant cut expenditure medium long term order regain fiscal balance discipline. the situation japan even worrying. public debt japan exceed 200% gdp, exclude civil service pension contingent liabilities. currently, market concern japan’s repayment ability believe japanese government continue address ever-increasing deficit maintain exceptionally low interest rate environment. however, worth note market treat european country way recently. once market sentiment changes, situation take sharp turn would difficult arrest deteriorate trend. in addition pain bring deleveraging, i would also like talk different form “quantitative easing” implement various central banks. why economy implement “quantitative easing”? if agree root cause global financial crisis excessive leveraging, solution would deleveraging. however, reality, process deleveraging painful. “quantitative easing” able provide much desire relief everyone, household negative equity overstretch itself, over-expanded enterprise government face social unrest result stringent measure force implement. yet, quantitative ease exact opposite deleveraging. quantitative ease aim at: 1. reduce interest burden highly leverage individuals, enterprise governments, 2. prop asset prices, lessen negative wealth effect even try create positive wealth effect, enhance people’s confidence will spend, increase employment. however, quantitative ease panacea. in past three years, quantitative ease limit stimulate effect real economy. there several reasons. first, household deleveraging reduce households’ propensity consume, particularly 4 bi central bankers’ speech low income households. secondly, interest rate close zero us, cost current consumption already low relative future consumption, interest rate cut would little effect stimulate household bring forward future consumption. thirdly, regulatory reform economic uncertainty restrain banks’ ability incentive lend. and must forget price pay implement quantitative easing, interest income depositors, include investment fund retirees, greatly reduced. asset market support artificially low interest rate environment rather economic fundamental skew resource allocation society expand productive sector pursuit asset price appreciation. such shift easily lead investment mismatch, thereby erode medium long term productivity growth well growth potential economy. in addition, sizable prolong quantitative ease becomes, difficult risky exit plan. central bank realise much do. in order solve structural imbalance build past two decades, must get bottom problem. lady gentlemen, 2008, industrialise country various emerge economy enjoy golden period development last two three decades. income level live standard continue rise. some academic call period “great moderation”. however, one sure life period easy. some say due technological financial innovation modern society, so-called “paradigm shift”. we awaken reality golden period probably underpin little excessive debts, fact unsustainable. if major industrialise country undergo deleveraging foreseeable future, global economy evolve? i think highly probable follow situation emerge: (1) the country indebted, deleveraging undergo. it inevitable economic growth employment weak live standard place problem serious may even deteriorate. (2) some advance many emerge economy need bear pain deleveraging due low level debt. however, advance economy undergo deleveraging, possible go back “good old days” everybody enjoy prosperous economic development. country around world strive enhance productivity competitiveness capture big share international trade arena growth slow down. more importantly, major emerge economies, china, india, brazil russia, would try best expand domestic demand carry reform improve productivity, reduce reliance export advance economy achieve slower, yet balance sustainable economic growth. another question would like ask is: global asset market heading? i wish i crystal ball. all i make assumption analyse different possibilities. (1) the first possibility build assumption process global deleveraging affect quantitative easing. under circumstances, asset price inflation drive excessive leveraging, theory, asset price might drop first search new equilibrium, stabilise point. subsequently, asset price resume rise alongside economic recovery rebound people’s income. (2) the second possibility quantitative ease produce desire results. asset price go up, stimulate consumption, employment improve significantly result. this buy time relevant authority carry reform enhance productivity that, ultimately, asset price increase support economic bi central bankers’ speech 5 fundamentals. this is, course, desirable scenario global economy return normal growth path. i surely hope eventually happens. (3) what bother however third possibility, process deleveraging disrupt quantitative easing, lead sharp increase asset price first place. yet, since increase support economic fundamentals, increase wealth see transient. a result, household unwilling increase spend end, real economy fail rebound. if inflationary pressure build alongside asset price increases, central bank may consider exit market raise interest rates. when economic performance, inflation monetary policy fall short market expectation, asset price might drop sharply remain volatile. i sure three scenario happen whether fourth scenario emerge, current situation something never experience before. however, i certain since outlook macro economic financial environment uncertain, highly possible continue see large fund inflow outflow well sharp fluctuation financial markets. therefore, i would like take opportunity ask everyone stay alert risk ahead aware current environment highly abnormal uncertain. we take precautionary measure get bottom problem, learn others’ experience avoid overstretch ourselves. otherwise, may find trap debt aby way out. thank you. bi central bankers’ speech 1 mario draghi: a central banker’s perspective european economic convergence speech mr mario draghi, president european central bank, anchor 2013 conference, organise magyar nemzeti bank (the central bank hungary), budapest, 7 december 2012. * * * lady gentlemen, it great pleasure budapest participate annual anchor conference. i understand last anchor conference andrás simor position governor magyar nemzeti bank. so excellent opportunity pay sincere tribute work value member general council european central bank (ecb). in remark today, i would like focus process economic convergence europe. a experience recent year make clear, process end country’s adoption euro. nor participation single monetary policy provide automatic delivery convergence. i first talk challenge face euro area result shortcoming process convergence integration. i discus challenge convergence member european union (eu) yet adopt euro. 1. two challenge process european integration the institutional challenge over period many years, eu provide unprecedented framework successful regional integration. the process integration involve creation common market harmonisation coordination several economic policies, also conduct policy supranational level. a central pillar eu’s institutional architecture always principle subsidiarity. this rule action shall take supranational level objective pursue cannot sufficiently achieve eu members, either level central government regional local level. while continue preserve principle subsidiarity, recent challenge euro area provide u major institutional lesson: maximise benefit single currency require strong ecb; also require additional strong common institutions. we need strong institution guarantee competitiveness encourage sustainable growth; guide fiscal policy ensure fiscal sustainability; supervise stabilise single financial market. we also need strong institution engage citizen closely european project. in words, future prosperity europe hinge ability complement monetary union economic union, fiscal union financial union. this advance institutional architecture turn need embed form political union engage citizen deeply european decision-making. a result, join euro area future imply great share sovereignty deep european accountability ten year ago. 2 bi central bankers’ speech the institutional challenge first major challenge currently confronted. we already make much progress address challenge. but great deal work remain done. the economic challenge the second complementary challenge economic. the benefit adopt euro great consistent economic structure exist prospective member are. convergence broadly define process cross-country difference economic structure reduce time. the success convergence process ultimately depend sustainability underlie policies. shortcoming process convergence across euro area member root challenge face since 2010. but i please report progress address shortcoming made. external imbalance fiscal imbalance start unwound. effort regain price non-price competitiveness bear early fruit. deleveraging generally proceed orderly way, even though credit flow real economy seem negatively affect part euro area. debt reduce countries, others devise strategy make debt reduction sustainable time. and financial sector weakness address along link sovereign risk. a i said, progress make much still need done. the recent experience current euro area member also serve cautionary tale eu member bind treaty adopt euro future. i turn challenge face country process convergence. 2. the perspective eu country still adopt euro the framework convergence with two exceptions, eu member yet euro area expect adopt single currency meet certain convergence criteria. a know, treaty define criterion along three dimensions. the first dimension degree nominal convergence euro area. this imply achieve price stability; ensure sustainability government’s financial position; realise sustainable convergence long-term nominal interest rates; maintain stable exchange rate national currency euro. the treaty also require nominal convergence sustainable. this possible without underpin high degree real convergence. accord second dimension, adopt euro make sense economic structure prospective member converge sufficiently towards prevail structure euro area. the success real convergence process turn depend sustainability relevant policies. the challenge face since 2010 highlight danger large persistent macroeconomic imbalance pose, stability domestic economies, also smooth function euro area whole. we know dire implication prolong loss competitiveness, excessive indebtedness house market bubbles. recognise fact, eu member move towards strong surveillance domestic policies. let remind two examples. one new macroeconomic imbalance procedure, aim prevent build-up new macroeconomic imbalance enforce correction exist imbalances. the “fiscal compact”, sign eu member except uk czech republic march year strengthen sustainability credibility fiscal policies. bi central bankers’ speech 3 the third dimension convergence institutional. the relevant national legislation, include statute national central bank, need compatible eu treaty statute european system central bank (escb). more generally, lesson learn hard way strength institutional environment crucial sustainability economic integration convergence. improvement institutional environment entail, among things, good regulations, good governance, good quality statistic business-friendly environment. remove impediment efficient use factor production help enhance growth potential country. how achieve high degree sustainable convergence? so country best prepare economy reap benefit close european integration? there four build blocks: monetary policy, structural policy, fiscal policy financial policy. let reflect briefly these. monetary policy first, monetary policy, which, euro adopted, remain national responsibility. but number treaty obligation already apply stage. in particular, main objective monetary policy price stability, exchange rate policy treat matter common interest. monetary policy best contribute growth delivery price stability. overall price stability create predictable environment foster efficient adjustment relative price bolster investor consumer confidence. it also protect purchase power vulnerable member population. different monetary policy framework devise deliver price stability. some eu member outside euro area fix exchange rate domestic currency euro, good track record low inflation. a different approach – adopt hungary – combine exchange rate flexibility regime inflation targeting. i understand governor simor focus remark past future inflation target hungary. so i limit comment importance central bank credibility success inflation targeting. the ultimate success central bank maintain price stability depend credibility. credibility anchor inflation expectation line definition price stability adopt central bank. well-anchored inflation expectation turn align choice relevant wage price setting. a key prerequisite credible monetary policy independence central bank. this principle enshrine treaty statute escb. each central bank eu institutional, personal, functional, financial independence. institutional personal independence protect central bank member decision-making body direct indirect influence third party performance tasks. functional independence require central bank necessary mean instrument achieve objective independently authority. and financial independence guarantee central bank access control sufficient financial human resource fulfil mandate. credible inflation target small open economy also depend central banks’ recognition impact monetary policy decision exchange rate. for example, presence heavily indebted private public sector large open foreign exchange positions, central bank little space manoeuvre face flag economy. this especially true inflation already high yet 4 bi central bankers’ speech critical mass structural institutional reform capable reduce country risk premium sustainable levels. in circumstances, low policy rate stimulate economy may risk spark depreciation pressure domestic currency point time. depreciation currency may turn fuel inflation offset impact economic stimulus negative balance sheet effect consumption investment. structural policy the second build block structural policy. the sustainability nominal convergence large extent conditional sufficient degree structural, real, convergence. a broad indicator degree real convergence euro area catching-up per caput income price level new member euro area. convergence real per caput gdp level foster far-reaching structural institutional change aim enhance growth potential economy. such reform typically aim strengthen flexibility adjustment mechanism economy improve business environment. when good labour market rigid, inflation inflation expectation may remain high even presence monetary regime commit achievement price stability. both government social partner share responsibility ensure wage determination take sufficient account labour market condition jeopardise competitiveness employment. active labour market policy tackle persistent bottlenecks, skill mismatches. finally, protection vest interest product market lack mobility adaptability labour market undermine job creation, particular young le qualify workers, well face problem enter labour market. low barrier entry increase competition, particularly domestic service sector shelter international competition, thus support price stability. economic growth lead private sector need foster stable business-friendly policy environment. in respect, government strive transparency predictability policy regime, low compliance burden, effective governance apply rule law. fiscal policy it also crucial achievement price stability support sound fiscal positions, third build block convergence. irresponsible fiscal policy jeopardise credibility, high inflation become desirable reduce real value government debt. fiscal policy sustainable orient medium term. they aim mitigate undesirable trend growth differential “high quality” expenditure tax policies. in particular, high inefficient public expenditure put brake economic activity impose high tax burden economy channel resource unproductive uses. financial policy the fourth build block financial policy. a sound bank sector, liquid well-functioning capital market important sustainability nominal convergence. on one hand, well-functioning bank sector capital market ensure efficient finance capital accumulation economy, thus support potential output growth. on hand, sustain smooth function monetary policy transmission channels, interest rate bank lend channels. in regard, financial sector vulnerability pose great challenge conduct monetary policy. bi central bankers’ speech 5 conclusion let draw close. the experience past year show participation monetary union place important demand national economic policies. euro area government hard work respond demands. they correct macroeconomic imbalances. they establish strong framework governance keep country path sustainable convergence. and improve institutional set-up underpin monetary union. for eu member yet adopt euro, challenge achieve high degree sustainable convergence euro area. this require credible commitment part central bank achieve price stability treatment exchange rate policy matter common interest. for member euro area, challenge achieve full compatibility economy participation monetary union. product labour market must posse sufficient adjustment capacity buff shock maintain high output employment. it area progress needed. a i indicated, much work remain do – current prospective member euro area, individually eu member, jointly across europe. but i doubt opportunity continue progress seize together reap benefit sustainable economic convergence last regional integration. thank attention. bi central bankers’ speech 1 rundheersing bheenick: past

actively debate macroprudential policy. academic research provide necessary foundation, design implementation regulations. during year service central bank, also year treasury, i fair share deal bank financial crisis norway. in 1990s, norway hit severe bank crisis. three four large bank failed. require capital injection three half per cent gdp. this substantially percentage share euro area bank currently need recapitalise. ever since norwegian bank crisis early 1990s, bank industry regulate strictly bank comparable countries. for instance, bank capital definition tighter, package loan complex instrument practice permit 2007. financial supervision also rather strict. a result, norwegian financial system limit exposure subprime mortgage market – notwithstanding municipality northern part norway get involved, le full understand inherent risks. our bank therefore relatively unaffected recent crisis come credit risk. the downturn economy experience 2009 modest relation country – course also due composition production exports, oil account large share. more two decade ago, early stage norwegian bank crisis, norge bank provide large liquidity loan save bank. the bank, however, soon become insolvent. we learn fast illiquidity turn insolvency. at time, bank rescue partly norge bank write loan. this incident show important clarify division responsibility central bank fiscal authorities. the government bank insurance fund established, would able extend loan inject capital distress bank future. the aim make sure norge bank avoid intrude arena fiscal authorities. it independent central bank spend taxpayers’ money. when norwegian banks’ fund dry aftermath lehman brother collapse, government bond swap cover bond issue banks. that is, ministry finance become banks’ counterparty swap arrangement. we thereby avoid expansion central bank’s balance sheet improve liquidity fund situation banks. the recent global financial crisis teach u vital focus financial system

amplify financial crisis global repercussions. an international response management systemic risk introduce macroprudential regulation. 2 bi central bankers’ speech however, incorporate systemic oversight financial stability framework pose considerable analytical operational challenge countries. indeed, economist relatively limit understand design effectiveness macroprudential policies. but, even inflation target introduced, much know go implement it. practice research develop parallel, interacting. we hope see similar development regard macroprudential policies. to end, norge bank, like many national international monetary authorities, actively work develop conceptual analytical foundation macroprudential policy. several analytical approach identification factor contribute build systemic risk may use different policy tool may employ address them. one policy instrument introduce basel iii countercyclical capital buffer. in line past experience divide responsibilities, ministry finance implement countercyclical capital requirement 2013. norge bank make recommendation buff decisions. we therefore need strengthen understand macroprudential regulation develop relevant analytical tool recommendations. the financial crisis call renew attention fact development real economy financial sector closely linked. in response, norge bank decide provide monetary policy financial analysis joint report publish quarterly 2013. the report form basis monetary policy decision advice buffer. the primary objective monetary policy low stable inflation time. we operate flexible inflation target regime, also aim stabilise economic activity. furthermore, norge bank give weight risk prolong period low interest rate could lead elevate risk-taking excessive debt accumulation household business sectors. there always room improvement. we seek improve systemic risk indicator macro-stress test approaches, keep research frontier. we also work good incorporate financial sector macroeconomic models. economic research contribute significantly this, context, fundamental question need addressed. – first, macroeconomic impact financial regulations? a great

concentrate bank sector.2 there much ahead journey develop islamic capital market takaful (islamic insurance) industry. i believe next 10–15 year offer significant opportunity growth diversification islamic finance. let highlight reason optimistic prospects: 1 base survey islamic financial service board (ifsb)’s members. 2 the islamic finance mar 2012 report uk islamic finance secretariat, private sector industry body, estimate bank sector account 93% global islamic finance industry, capital market 5% takaful 2%. 2 bi central bankers’ speech • first, islamic financial institution main escape significant damage global financial crisis. they well-placed grow, time many global banks, especially european banks, deleveraging focus consolidate balance sheets. • second, islamic finance much potential diversify new growth area trade infrastructure finance asia emerge markets. - these new area allow islamic bank reduce exposure real estate sector, take advantage strong growth potential emerge market economies. there gap fill structure trade finance fund infrastructural project emerge market grow, global finance consolidates. • third, islamic finance also seek meet increase demand simple transparent product ‘back-to-basics’ finance. investor much circumspect complex product risks. the crisis teach investor worldwide damage face risk know unsurprising, risk ‘what know’. islamic finance, focus transparency, price certainty risk-sharing, ride wave demand simple basic investments. however, islamic finance overcome important challenge order grow share global finance contribute cross-border finance. these include need reduce fragmentation islamic finance market due difference accept standard shariah compliance regions, jurisdictions, case even domestically within jurisdictions. this hamper flow liquidity jurisdictions, part yet islamic equivalent international money bond markets. there considerable progress make address challenges. body aaoifi,3 idb’s islamic

supervisor bi central bankers’ speech 3 • between two countries, see malaysian bank collaborate singapore corporates financial player structure s$ denominate corporate sukuk programmes. and singapore-listed company venture tap ringgit sukuk market malaysia. these trend keen encourage. to repeat therefore, i optimistic realise significant growth potential islamic finance next 10–15 years. manage challenge capital flow post-crisis era let move say thing challenge many emerge world face manage capital flows, particularly face extremely low interest rate set advance economy (aes). we unprecedented situation. interest rate expect stay extremely low u much advance world years, reflect decision central bank keep monetary condition highly accommodative economy resume normal growth. there debate among economist effective activist monetary policies, u fed’s qe3 strategy, revive entrepreneurial spirit private investments. if strategy succeed u economy recovers, plus asia well. in meantime, however, significant implication emerge market economies, global investor search good return – good near-zero rate get cash treasury bills. with large amount liquidity move markets, short-term shift investor sentiment lead volatility capital flows. we see shock european periphery send money invest emerge market rush back u safe havens. to clear it, lot good capital flows, include even short term flows. they add liquidity markets, bring buyer seller together. however, know capital inflow also much good thing. they lead asset prices, exchange rates, become disconnect fundamentals. and sudden withdrawal capital emerge economy investor switch ‘risk on’ ‘risk off’ portfolio destabilising. a i mentioned, current global condition unprecedented. the policy response advance country without precedent. globally therefore, need humility understand benefit cost qe3 easy monetary policy advance countries. but wise strengthen policy toolkits asia, deal unpredictable often excessive capital flows. there lesson come experience asia elsewhere, policy response learn other. i mention three set policy response inevitably figure toolkits. first, much sense curtail volatility exchange rate short-term. the cost volatile uncertain exchange rate high small open economy especially – asean economy are. accordingly, malaysia, singapore several asian country felt comfortable leave exchange rate entirely market forces. their central banks, within monetary policy frameworks, seek instil focus long term fundamentals. there merit allow exchange rate asia’s emerge economy appreciate gradually long term, reflect rapid growth. if resist long term trends, likely see inflation economies. but stability short term wise. second, macro-prudential policy important part policy tool kit. many asian country introduce new macro-prudential measure try avoid bubble 4 bi central bankers’ speech property market last two years. malaysia bring strict limit loan-to-value ratio house loans. singapore hong kong do similarly, introduce additional stamp duty transaction tax discourage speculative demand residential properties. these target administrative prudential measure conventional macro-economic tools. but likely remain part policy toolkit, least foreseeable future, give real risk macro-economic stability environment low global interest rate poses. a third fundamental strategy focus build great depth asia’s capital markets, ensure bank system remain sound. a good example strategy fact malaysia. bank negara’s financial sector blueprint ii (2012–2020), release part government’s economic transformation programme (etp), build solid foundation malaysia’s financial system, include develop deep vibrant bond market. the bank several lead asian countries, include malaysia singapore, generally well-managed well-capitalised. they source strength u global financial crisis. however, asia’s capital markets, especially corporate bond markets, need much depth. broad deep capital market allow investor invest long term hedge risks. they help u meet grow infrastructural long term investment need region. this therefore important priority region, fact significant scope future development asian capital markets. regulator work harmonise rule market practice across region, issuance procedure settlement standards. we also need develop securitisation markets, appropriate safeguards, bank recycle capital. more do boost linkage market economies. we pool liquidity across markets, add depth asian capital market. an example malaysian stock exchange, bursa malaysia, singapore exchange stock exchange thailand recently launch asean trade link. we also cooperate encourage finance infrastructure project region. the asean infrastructure fund (aif), initiative lead malaysia, good example. it pool resources, knowledge experience among asean government asian development bank (adb) loan sovereign sovereign-guaranteed infrastructure projects. the fund also issue bonds, bring private sector institutional investors. another example cooperation region credit guarantee investment facility (cgif) amongst asean+3 countries, aim help company asean+3 country raise long term finance infrastructure investment provide governments’ guarantee corporate bonds, thereby reduce risk bond-holders. project iskandar malaysia also prime example intra-regional investment encouraged, country region develop competitive strength jointly. • iskandar malaysia’s performance impressive – poise exceed target rm100 billion investment mark end year. • i glad good progress joint venture temasek hold khazanah nasional, pulau indah venture sdn bhd co-develop two separate site medini. • other significant project include s$1.5 billion integrate eco-friendly
