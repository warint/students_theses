 bi central bankers’ speech 1 lorenzo bini smaghi: bank supervision corporate governance european architecture speech mr lorenzo bini smaghi, member executive board european central bank, close seminar “banking supervision internal audit contributor sound corporate governance financial stability”, moscow, 30 march 2011. * * * introduction lady gentlemen, it great pleasure speak occasion moscow. the cooperation programme end today successful two important field central banks: bank supervision internal audit. look back venture, see three unusual, eventful year pass since 1 april 2008. the macroeconomic, financial, also political environment euro area around globe state flux, sometimes turmoil. likewise move sadden natural disaster human error, act war act terror. at time, three year also see remarkably positive events. the central bank russian federation celebrate 150th anniversary last year. it steer way successfully financial crisis. the bank russia become member basel committee bank supervision financial stability board. the european central bank, meanwhile, mark tenth anniversary euro. it become eu institution result treaty lisbon 2009. and eu commission russia also change status: eu delegation russian federation part european external action service. a i said, bank supervision internal audit focus work past three years. a three-way partnership formed, consist eu delegation, bank russia eurosystem. the eurosystem act ecb eight national central banks: deutsche bundesbank, banque de france, banca d’italia, banco de españa, de nederlandsche bank, oesterreichische nationalbank, bank greece suomen pankki/finlands bank. central bank cooperation challenge time call resolute action the come year likely challenge recent years. central bank require act anchor monetary financial stability rapidly change world. the eurosystem central bank cooperate bank supervision, financial stability, internal audit many fields. in addition programme russia, eurosystem programme basel ii way involve central bank egypt. a crisis response package cover bank supervision financial crisis management conduct south-eastern european countries. and technical assistance give number would-be eu members. europe strengthen institutional framework financial stability generally, europe respond challenge past year structure thoughtful way. the creation european systemic risk board (esrb) broaden scope cooperation institutional awareness respect macroprudential oversight. the ecb support institution provides, inter alia, analytical statistical input esrb structures. the risk board enable european regulator supervisor 2 bi central bankers’ speech complement microprudential perspective systematic monitor assessment potential danger stability system whole. the discipline macroprudential supervision combine information assessment obtain via microprudential supervision macroeconomic monetary insights. we expect macroprudential measures, countercyclical provisioning, mitigate systemic risks. we also expect find macroprudential oversight fee microprudential work alert supervisor wide world macroeconomic risks. besides set esrb, 1 january year, three european supervisory authority (esas) come being: european bank authority, european insurance occupational pension authority european security market authority. we expect new institution sustainably enhance microprudential supervision europe. currently, eu euro area financial system continue face several important risks. the main source concern interplay fiscal imbalances, downside risk economic growth bank fund vulnerabilities. although interplay limit small number euro area countries, relatively small share total eu euro area gdp, potential contagion eu euro area country insignificant. in respect, let state surprise i see quickly lesson crisis forgotten. one lesson need ass risk systemic way, micro level. there systemic assessment without take contagion account, across instruments, across market across countries. the sub-prime crisis collapse lehman clearly show devastate contagion be! it thus surprise see current environment policy makers, academic editorialist totally ignore systemic dimension financial market proposal specific issue like instance bank debt. think specific category asset – senior bank bond – treat specific way without immediately affect assets, certain bank treat way impact whole system, within country also cross border testimony short memory. the apply sovereign debt instruments. the risk relate re-emergence global imbalance disorderly unwind also considerable. moreover, catastrophe japan tension middle east show u risk various sort (natural, geopolitical, etc…) never far away. in addition, new round stress test carry march june year, final set result publish june. there many comment discussion stress tests, often without sufficient information. there doubt success test depend full understand part market participants. it thus essential supervisory authority coordinate closely within eba communication strategy. it’s time cacophony, national authority engage beauty contest. compare previous round, underlie scenario considerably adverse, particular term overall decline gdp encompass sum parameter change (interest rates, haircuts, probability default, …). the probability scenario is, two year horizon, much lower, especially 2011 1%, instead 7% last year. moreover, national supervisor bank le discretion conduct tests. this time eba give direct guidance regard definition projection pre-provision operate profits, include increase cost funding. the threshold stress test set level substantially high minimum solvency requirements. bi central bankers’ speech 3 bank regulation become strict in broad sense, europe actively contribute strong prudential supervision, notably bank supervision. at global national levels, mark tighten bank prudential rules. work corporate governance internal audit progress too. in light financial crisis experience advance economies, could fairly ask whether rule blame way applied. the answer question pertinent also cooperation programme. in fact, decide work foresee programme concern implementation basel ii framework continue. basel ii focus risk-based supervision. it require bank operate structure risk management. the internal capital adequacy assessment process (icaap) require pillar 2 model systematic strategic plan financial enterprise. financial firm must understand risk capital situation. they require continual review risks, capital business environment. i think flourish embrace corporate process culture continual learn paradigm. this focus systematic management financial institution repeatedly stress part cooperation programme. rightly so: soundness financial firm depend managers’ capability understand, measure master risks, grasp business opportunity basis good control downside risks. that capability constitute first line defence. supervision second line defence. internal audit essential part corporate governance the internal audit part cooperation programme focus risk-based audit it audit. the audit function orient towards organisation’s objectives. internal audit deliver independent view advice governance organisation. a comprehensive systematic view risk pose objective organisation whole guide auditor plan work well follow-up recommendations. a it nowadays intrinsic part infrastructure well critical business tool, programme’s focus particular challenge it audit certainly appropriate. overall, programme emphasise risk orientation rather compliance checks, approach indispensable today. only audit function understand dynamic change environment impact change organisation’s objective provide necessary reassurance organisation’s top management. the programme contribute risk orientation – mean considerable cultural change audit function. i think risk-based audit need two key ingredient success: firstly, chief auditor must enjoy full trust back organisation’s top management, even convey unpleasant unwelcome messages. and secondly, auditor job properly empower act autonomously. central bank cooperation – long-term investment bear fruit i seek today shed light importance various tool soundness financial systems: bank supervision, internal audit, micro macroprudential supervision well audit corporate governance. the “investment” programme make bank supervision, society’s “systemic financial risk management”, internal audit, element help organisation achieve objectives, fully line approach. i confident investment bear fruit year come. 4 bi central bankers’ speech finally, let thank involve project – eu delegation, bank russia also colleague eight national central bank ecb. it’s close cooperation uncertain time make remarkable project successful. i sense that, although conclude particular venture, challenge future positive experience programme certainly justify new partnership future. i sense shortage interest enthusiasm join force again. many thank contributed. and thank attention. bi central bankers’ speech 1 simon m potter: improve survey measure inflation expectation speech mr simon m potter, executive vice president federal reserve bank new york, forecaster club new york, new york city, 30 march 2011. wilbert van d klaauw, giorgio topa, robert rich, olivier armantier, basit zafar joseph tracy. the result new york fed–american life panel survey i discus today reflect data collect mid-march 2011. paper contain detail research i summarize today find new york feed website. * * * good afternoon. it pleasure today talk new york fed’s ongoing research measurement household inflation expectations. the view express mine necessarily reflect federal reserve bank new york federal reserve system. that said, i want acknowledge colleague research group push research inflation expectation forward. expectations, particular inflation expectations, play key role conduct modern monetary policy. expectation drive people’s behavior influence wide range economic decision saving, investment, purchase durable good wage negotiations. these decision turn affect real economic activity actual inflation. a result, inflation expectation represent important link monetary transmission mechanism – especially term structure interest rate – greatly influence central bank’s ability achieve price stability. it crucial central bank monitor inflation expectations, make sure remain well anchor consistent policy objectives. since economy constantly buffet unanticipated shocks, short-term inflation expectation reflect effect shocks. for example, energy price increase suddenly due supply disruption, short-term inflation expectation move up. this completely consistent medium-term price stability, time, forward inflation expectation – is, expectation inflation supply disruption end – move. this stability longer-term inflation expectation face movement short-term inflation expectation hallmark sound, effective credible monetary policy. in standard macroeconomic model trivial measure inflation expectations: rational expectation assumption, economic agent model could produce unique inflation expectation horizon. in real world, central bank must rely various indirect approach measure inflation expectations: market-based measures, survey professional economist market participants, survey households. all three type measure advantage drawbacks. it therefore important central bank use variety measure complement one another. before turn focus talk – measurement household inflation expectation – i want provide quick summary market-based professional surveys. the difference yield nominal real government debt use derive measure market inflation expectation price index use protect holder real government debt inflation. in unite states, price index consumer price index (cpi). thus, nominal 10-year yield 3.5 percent real 10-year yield 1 percent, one crude measure average cpi inflation expect next 10 year would 2.5 percent. further, nominal 5-year yield 3 percent real 5-year yield 0.2 percent, crude measure average cpi inflation expect next 5 year would 2.8 percent crude estimate 5- 10-year forward average cpi inflation would 2.2 percent. 2 bi central bankers’ speech i say crude calculation ignore difference liquidity within two type debt, compensation investor require uncertainty real value nominal coupon security variety issues, fact treasury inflation-protected security (tips) index cpi time vary lag. there numerous way measure inflation expectation take account liquidity differences. for example, chart 1 show estimate 5- 10-year forward inflation compensation construct barclays, research staff federal reserve board, new york feed market group inflation swaps. the difference produce differ assumption liquidity various security use estimate yield curve produce board research staff estimates. no attempt make remove compensation inflation risk measures, thus estimate compensation expect unexpected inflation. there clearly different short-term fluctuation various estimates, show similar pattern – exception height financial crisis, contain within range 2.5 percent 3 percent. cpi inflation average historically 0.3 0.5 percentage point inflation rate personal consumption expenditure (pce), price index federal reserve board member reserve bank president provide forecast four time per year. estimate amount compensation investor require inflation uncertainty forward horizon vary close 0 percent 1 percent. yield curve model-based estimate provide decomposition whole forward structure inflation expectations. a show chart 2 board research staff measure inflation compensation, effect recent surge energy price center short-term inflation compensation slightly negative movement forward inflation compensation 2013 onward. of course, recent surge energy price also increase short-term inflation uncertainty around future inflation. thus, increase short-term inflation compensation reflect factors. there numerous survey economist market participant give additional information inflation expectations. many room respondent surveys. a market-based measures, survey produce response specific price index, usually cpi cpi exclude food energy. the survey professional forecaster (spf) also ask numerous question pce deflator. compare market-based measures, survey advantage affect vary market liquidity require adjustment inflation risk compensation. further, spf ask number question short-run inflation uncertainty. these forecast professional core inflation long-run average inflation provide additional insight stability forward inflation expectations. since many shock move around total inflation high frequency remove core inflation, forecast core inflation short medium term provide additional check anchor inflation expectations. recently, large increase economic slack produce great recession, considerable debate relative strength slack generate decline inflation versus power anchor inflation expectation restrain decline. chart 3 show detail recent behavior forecast core pce inflation spf dispersion long-run cpi inflation forecasts. the first panel show average point forecast since 2007 current year year-ahead core pce inflation rate. a one would expect, current year forecast variable, part year-ahead forecast remain current year forecast financial crisis, consistent pull anchor inflation expectations. however, set forecast still called, base summary economic projections, mandate consistent range federal open market committee participants. bi central bankers’ speech 3 the second panel chart 3 show measure uncertainty forecasts. here see uncertainty increase financial crisis take hold return 2007 level recently. the third panel show disagreement across forecaster also increase financial crisis return pre-crisis levels. much disagreement appear relate differ view strength standard phillips curve dynamic versus approach inflation dynamics. the final panel show disagreement 10-year average cpi forecast last 20 years. a aware, one great success federal reserve 1980s 1990s reduction long-run inflation expectations. indeed, since 1998, median forecast spf question stay within narrow range. however, amount disagreement around median increase recently. much increase relate low forecast 10-year average. during past decade many central bank begin explore way improve survey measurement understand public’s inflation expectations. at new york feed november last year conference many different aspect research discussed. in addition initiate new survey gradually move traditionally qualitative quantitative question measures, research conduct analyze quality information content survey-based measure consumer inflation expectations. in late 2006 new york feed initiate major research project examine number issues: first, best way measure public’s inflation expectation term inflation concept forecast horizon? second, household form update expectation future inflation: extent base past inflation experience information source rely on? third, people act expectation so, how? my remark today mainly focus first set issues, i conclude preliminary research two. despite importance inflation expectation forecast future inflation economic activity key link monetary transmission mechanism, surprisingly little know directly answer questions. this partly back 2006 start out, macroeconomist enjoy around 20 year success model question answer simple unambiguous manner. a learn painfully financial crisis, success model much due luck deep insight. our relative ignorance also partly economist receive detail train design survey questions. one issue spark initial interest word questions. we find question inflation expectation directly ask inflation instead ask prices. for example, thomson reuters/university michigan survey (the michigan survey on) ask change “prices general” bank england/gfk nop survey ask expect “change price shop generally.” not expert survey design, decide need wide collaboration understand implication ask price general whether possible ask directly rate inflation. we form cross-disciplinary team among federal reserve research staff, academic economists, psychologist carnegie mellon university specialize behavioral decision-making, well risk perception communication. the initial part project structure three stages. the first two stage – preliminary inquiry conduct phone internet survey – gauge individual interpret michigan survey question would respond alternative question future inflation. the internet survey also “piloted” question wage expectation inflation uncertainty expand information currently elicit michigan survey. these preliminary inquiry guide final formulation question third stage – actual implementation 4 bi central bankers’ speech alternative experimental internet survey inflation expectation use sample panel household draw previous respondent michigan survey. reliable measurement require respondent agree one another – economic modeler – survey question mean. for question ask professional surveys, little room differ interpretation inflation concept since forecast specific price index requested. for question ask households, specific price index use respondent vary interpretation inflation concept. thus, response may display disagreement expectation concept inflation used. indeed, one feature michigan survey’s question “prices general” share survey high dispersion response around median. this evidence disagreement part relate observable characteristic respondent age, gender, education income. however, difference response across demographic group far exceed variation inflation experience groups. when probe survey respondent understand change “prices general” (the michigan survey question), find significant fraction believe inquire price recently pay – often price increase decrease markedly, food gasoline. this tendency think prominent price change one’s experience le common among respondent high financial literacy. by contrast, ask expectation “rate inflation,” respondent tend think le salient price change specific experience price change across broad set item change cost live – result align economists’ definition inflation sustain increase overall price level. ask rate inflation directly therefore produce answer consistent concept forward inflation expectation interest central banks. chart 4 plot time series median response experimental survey “prices general” question rate inflation question. one see median expectation rate inflation question le variable. we also find dispersion response significantly large “prices general” question. further, initial investigation establish evidence many respondent would prefer give range rather point estimate household able answer question uncertainty future inflation. we also find measure individual forecast uncertainty positively correlate width range response give standard point forecast questions. thus, add question elicit panel subjective uncertainty future inflation. i show example question minute. a emphasize above, anchor forward inflation expectation crucial monetary policy. in michigan survey, information forward inflation expectation generate question ask “the change price general next 5 10 years.” our initial exploratory work confirm many household confuse word overwhelm evidence long-term average expectation reported. consider rather elaborate structure michigan question show chart 5, also appear small change various challenge could low median response significant margin. further, ask rate inflation directly produce answer consistent concept forward inflation expectation interest central banks. rather replicate michigan long-term inflation expectation question replace “prices general” “rate inflation” decide work medium-term explicit horizon use probabilistic version question. so example, recent field survey, panel asked: bi central bankers’ speech 5 in view, would say percent chance follow thing may happen rate inflation/deflation one-year period february 2013 february 2014? chart 6 give question full. we field forward inflation expectation question since spring 2008, chart 7 contain time-series information responses. we use establish statistical technique estimate continuous probability distribution individual set responses. we find median median individual distribution represent average forward expectation upper low quartile individual median measure disagreement across respondents. for measure uncertainty report median individual inter-quartile ranges. a complement attempt improve measurement household forward inflation expectations, also investigate expectation wage growth. because firm worker may negotiate change wage line expect rate inflation, data wage expectation additional information source analyze inflation dynamic interaction wage price determination. furthermore, discrepancy expect change wage expect inflation may affect households’ financial decisions. despite obvious importance wage expectations, information wage expectation particularly scarce. in formulate question wage expectation need pose hypothetical situation gain information direct relevance inflation. it easy illustrate give format exact word question: we first ask individual report work pay many job had. we inform subsequent question would ask main job, define job usually work hours. we ask: “suppose that, 12 month now, actually work exact [main] job place currently work, work exact number hours. twelve month now, expect earn job, tax deductions, go up, go down, stay now?” for say go go asked: “by percent expect hourly earn job, tax deductions, go [up/down], 12 month now, actually work exact job place currently work, work exact number hours?” a rest work also elicit uncertainty around wage expectation. chart 8 show time series median response inter-quartile range point prediction question along average uncertainty define above. give nature question, inter-quartile range best interpret dispersion rather disagreement. the result around height financial crisis striking: median response fell 3 percent 0 percent many respondent opt “stayed now” option. moreover, low median expectation wage growth appear unaffected recovery economic activity. the dispersion response around median relatively high, although low crisis. the individual uncertainty around wage growth low around inflation interestingly show increase coincident acceleration economic activity recovery don’t find individual inflation uncertainty. turn second set general question i start with, know consumer form expectation revise response new information relevant many aspect monetary policy. a note previously, large cross-sectional variation inflation forecast 6 bi central bankers’ speech across survey respondent inconsistent traditional rational expectation framework agent assume share information set expectations. this lead alternative model heterogeneity explain reliance agent different model forecasting, use different information set different capability process information. while full-information, rational-expectations world role constant central bank communication, role become crucial world learning. since survey utilize panel design, ability make progress understand expectation form revise time. initial analysis suggest difference individual forecast persistent probably relate different forecast model reference information different experiences. we also find respondent express higher-than-average uncertainty previous survey likely change point forecast current survey. a good understand factor affect individual inflation expectation also help evaluate predict impact effectiveness central bank policy decision communication strategy. specifically, improve central bank’s capacity evaluate strength weakness various communication tool strategy design keep inflation expectation well anchored. the ability especially important time current one, central bank expand toolkits conduct traditional well non-traditional monetary policy. the third final broad question would benefit additional research whether people act expectations. the theoretical link inflation expectation realize inflation consumer decision occur several channels. in addition affect future wage price influence outcome nominal wage contract negotiation price-setting behavior firms, crucial link real interest rate (nominal rate le expect inflation) intertemporal consumption investment decisions. in addition, household fear high inflation expect reduce amount money hold keep wealth real asset land gold, consider good hedge inflation. inflation also raise effective tax rate income earn invest saving. a result, people may invest le save less. however, present little direct empirical evidence strength nature theoretical links. these important questions, variety approach bring bear answer them. surveys, field experiment experiment lab useful understand issues, lie heart mandate central bank. of course many economist perhaps appropriately sceptical whether result many experiment generalized. some recent result survey might reassure economists. work rand corporation, run internet survey inflation questions, design experiment involve nominal future payoff ass whether respond household would behave way consistent report inflation expectations. the result confirm average household use real interest rate base report inflation expectation choose nominal future payoffs. thank listen today. i would happy take question research inflation expectations. bi central bankers’ speech 7 8 bi central bankers’ speech bi central bankers’ speech 9 10 bi central bankers’ speech bi central bankers’ speech 11 reference bi central bankers’ speech 1 malcolm edey: the reserve bank’s strategic review payment innovation speech mr malcolm edey, assistant governor (financial system) reserve bank australia, card payment australasia 2011, sydney, 29 march 2011. * * * i thank darren flood assistance prepare speech. thank much opportunity speak today. this conference innovation payment system. i know business represent would approach innovation, display various presentations. but also common interest ensure system whole develop efficiently cost effectively possible. i’ve ask talk today reserve bank’s role that. a know, rba launch strategic review payment innovation july last year. in talk review, first thing i want stress see much co-operative project. when announce review, first thing call initial round consultations, industry interest party want contribute. we’ve good response that. we discussion (sometimes multiple discussions) main market players; talk people work particular field payment innovation; discussion end-users payment system. base learn that, we’ll put together detail document release around mid year, basis formal round consultation second half year. we hope final report ready around year-end. i start description process i want emphasise much something we’re involvement interest parties. it’s top-down exercise. the process still way go, i’m go pre-empt conclusion today. but i want use time report we’ve find far, we’re approach task, issue we’re likely focus here.1 economic case co-ordination industry the first question might ask is: need strategic review area, now? i say there’s particular trigger now, believe it’s good general principle matter keep periodic review. the rba, payment system board, mandate promote payment system efficiency. a good deal work area focus efficiency price signals. the bank take view that, price signal distort reason, case use regulatory power correct them. 1 to clarify scope exercise, review low-value payment (in words, retail relatively small business-to-business payments). it's high-value wholesale payment system, subject regular assessment process. 2 bi central bankers’ speech but efficiency also cover operational aspect system, include thing like cost, speed reliability payment service and, subject today’s talk, capacity innovate. when think innovation network set like one, it’s useful distinguish two types: proprietary innovations, benefit localise business that’s innovate (and customer business); system-wide innovations, benefit accrue user system whole. it’s reasonable expect service provider good job first kind innovation. in fact see example kind development time. for example, currently see financial institution explore new way use mobile device payment purposes, include make person-to-person payment use exist infrastructure. similarly major bank promote ability system update customer account information real time. but it’s second type innovation serious potential inefficiency, under-investment. that might happen lack co-ordination among industry participants, lack incentive individual provider participate system-wide improvements. we’re start presumption that’s case – could be. a regulator, recognise approach question quite different way approach case regulatory involvement. the rba significant powers, know, designate payment system set standards. but we’re well aware can’t regulate innovation being. that’s intention. a far possible we’ll aim work industry, look whether area co-ordination needed, assist usefully can. objective efficient payment system in take project like this, it’s useful start idea characteristic we’re look promote efficient payment system. here main ones: timeliness not payment time-critical, user system least option available give recipient timely access fund allow timely confirmation parties. accessibility it’s desirable everyone need make receive payment ready access payment system. ease use it go without say system easy use preferable cumbersome. but issue convenience. system require manual entry account transaction detail prone error costly correct discourage use. that one reason payment card popular – need manual entry removed. the need know recipient’s account detail another challenge many payment systems. one old payment method – cheque – deal require recipient’s name, recipient rest. the challenge electronic payment system replicate improve upon sort convenience. bi central bankers’ speech 3 ease integration process payment rarely make complete isolation. typically make part process require reconciliation record information party involved. it’s desirable payment system able integrate efficiently processes. a key example capacity payment system carry additional reconciliation information payment. safety reliability end user payment system need confidence system available need payment reach intend recipient time promised. they also need confident system secure, use expose future loss result information fraudulently obtained. some problem address system participant guarantee payments, good system design fundamental solution. low transparent cost some would say preoccupation rba past decade. if two system perform exactly function, course prefer cheap one. but reality complicate that. each system typically different attribute every system, end user need make choice one cost-effectively meet needs. that mean cost need transparent, choice well-informed. these, then, quality might regard desirable efficient payment system. you probably think more. but give list like that, also need recognise trade-offs. investment innovation come cost, bear initially industry ultimately customer. so conduct review, we’ll need talk provider user payment service cost benefit see different approaches. payment use study one important source information end-user perspective reserve bank’s late payment use study. this study around 1,200 household conduct october/november last year, update early study 2007. participant ask keep diary payment one-week period also ask attitude new payment method cover diary, like contactless mobile payments.2 we expect publish detail analysis find late year, i give preliminary result today throw useful light innovation review. result diary data suggest two main conclusion payment patterns. 1. first, broad pattern payment behaviour observe 2007 study still hold. a. cash remain widely use payment instrument australia dominant instrument low-value payments. 2 the study conduct roy morgan research behalf rba, largely repeat payment diary study undertake part 2007/08 review card payment reforms. it ask around 1,200 study participant late october early november 2010 carry payment diary week record detail payment cash withdrawals. detail record included: payment method used; size transaction; merchant category payment channel (for example, person, internet, phone, mail). 4 bi central bankers’ speech b. card dominant payment method mid-value payment (between $50 $500), use credit card grow relative debit card transaction value increases. c. bpay internet bank use frequently bill payment high-value transactions. 2. second, payment pattern nonetheless evolve degree three year since initial study. in particular: a. use cash decline somewhat. this especially noticeable cash’s share value would call traditional payment method – around 40 per cent 30 per cent value payments; b. debit card appear substitute cash, scheme debit eftpos transaction gain share. those broad result pattern actual payment made. a questionnaire conduct end diary study also give additional information people think different payment methods. here samples. first, use cheques: few 40 per cent consumer report make payment cheque past year. of 40 per cent, graph show main reason choose use cheque (graph 1). graph 1 the common reason people felt alternative type payment making. that significant, give one issue consider industry current review scope phase cheque use. next, order understand attribute people value point sale payments, ask people factor influence choice payment method checkout. perhaps surprisingly, important factor happen carry time. beyond that, main factor cite determine people pay speed process transaction, follow ability use fund ease manage finance (graph 2). the importance speed significant help explain people continue use cash small value transactions, also indicate current push towards contactless card might quite important many consumers. bi central bankers’ speech 5 graph 2 give increase importance internet payment recent years, also spend time explore consumers’ use of, attitude towards, different type online payments. first all, find seem quite high adoption online payments. around 90 per cent respondent access internet, either home work. of those, 80 per cent report make online purchase almost 60 per cent report online transfer fund family member friend. a surprisingly high 60 per cent people internet access say pay bill online. we also try find thing prevent people make even great use online payment (graph 3). the graph show answer online bill payments, also collect response online purchase transfers. graph 3 6 bi central bankers’ speech first all, explain large bar bottom: ask people would make happy use online bill payments, find quarter respondent already satisfy didn’t think could improved. beyond that, far big factor prevent people make use online bill payment risk fraud. this even mark online purchases, around half respondent identify risk fraud factor discourage great use. in fact, level satisfaction low online purchase overall online bill payment transfers. probably reflect low degree comfort online purchase use method like credit card paypal, compare make bill payment use bpay internet bank transfers. adoption two new wave payment technology – contactless payment mobile payment – much low online payments. only around 3 per cent survey respondent make contactless payment last month. le 10 per cent respondent ever make mobile payments. where had, main purpose phone-related purchase ringtones game (graph 4). most mobile payment make effectively internet payment make use smartphone. graph 4 in short, survey doesn’t seem point major dissatisfaction payment service australia, shed light payment-use pattern are, possible area improvement look further. we’ll publish full analysis result late year. result initial consultation a i say earlier, we’ve significant interest show wide range industry player response initial request comments. a number interest party provide u write submissions, many make available informal discussion rba staff. i expect we’ll receive substantial body submission second round consultation second half year. the consultation date highlight number quite specific issue go worth consider part strategic review. i’ll briefly go cross section those, mean exhaustive. i also note many issue new, already think industry. bi central bankers’ speech 7 transmission data payment successful integration payment system process require sufficient information travel payment allow proper reconciliation. a business owner make payment supplier might wish convey information, invoice number, (for example) item invoice pay why. an employer make payment super fund need able provide information relevant employee accounts, amount payment even type payment. even individual send money friend relative might simply want attach personal message payment. at moment, choice largely either:  limit additional information 18 character permit direct entry system;  separate payment information put place process bring back together late stage;  pay cheque attach information source. the question review whether likely represent significant shortcoming payment system year ahead? and is, best mean address achieved? timeliness ease address payment there time really need payment make quickly. the classic example government emergency payments. most government payment individual make perfectly adequately direct entry system. but emergency, availability fund next day might sufficient. in recent time many payment make use rtgs system, even though long way away system’s intend use. even then, speed vary significantly depend system recipient bank. a relate issue ease address payment individuals. a i say before, write someone’s name cheque relatively straightforward, direct electronic payment much difficult. for people currently involve enter bsb account number detail internet bank package. this course mean obtain detail recipient (who mightn’t even remember them) key detail correctly. this probably meet “ease use” test. overseas experience might give u guide issue. for example know unite state put lot emphasis pre-paid card government payments, although doubt part reflect country’s high number unbanked welfare recipients. on side atlantic, uk’s fast payment system provide closely watch example improve timeliness payments. of course strategic review intend forward looking. so asking, demand sort improvements, also extent likely development could meet demand next years. these question might also lead focus constraint major banks’ internal system place capacity provide fast payments. the decline cheque the number cheque write australia decline average 9 per cent per year past decade. over time, add unit costs. the result cheques, already expensive form payment, become increasingly so. nonetheless, consultation reinforce fact cheque use remain entrench certain area meet number specific needs. i already mention 8 bi central bankers’ speech several areas, include ease cheque address others accompany additional information. they also suitable face-to-face exchange provide element financial control. any decision move away cheque (and i’m pre-judging issue) dependent industry’s capacity develop suitable equally convenient electronic alternatives. i’m aware industry separately look this, seem appropriate payment system board also consider decline cheque address public interest perspective. in addition issues, number thing expect come consideration, whether stand-alone topic interweave discussions. these include:  mobile payments. there already lot interest activity area. the board’s main interest determine whether impediment development mobile payments, example relation standards.  standard cut across many area payments, include messaging, device security standards. their design application significant implication efficiency innovation. the increasingly global nature commerce suggest adoption internationally compatible standard important maintain world class payment system.  electronic purse system – is, general purpose, prepaid, typically contactless card like oyster london octopus hong kong. where successful, tend significant interdependency electronic transport ticket systems, slow develop here. the question whether significant impediment development system australia, give already high use payment cards.  security. our survey result suggest concern fraud impede take-up online payments. this may also become issue mobile payments. a question strategic review whether need increase co-ordination co-operation fraud issues. finally it’s worth say that, important individual issue overarch environment innovation. i make distinction start proprietary system-wide innovations. our focus review much second one those. this area need careful attention public-interest perspective, require degree co-operation amongst industry competitor might otherwise happen efficiently. it also require interest end-users non-incumbents take account. the next stage review seek view issues, whether good way address whether new area co-operative approach needed. an inevitable component role reserve bank play, give often step in, one way another, solely industry-based approach prove feasible. conclusion what i’ve outline today big agenda, i expect keep u busy time ahead. a i say start, review much co-operative effort. i staff appreciate assistance we’ve already, industry payment users. and look forward continue work promote best-practice innovation australian payment system. bi central bankers’ speech 1 duvvuri subbarao: frontier issue global agenda – emerge economy perspective commemorative oration dr duvvuri subbarao, governor reserve bank india, 60th anniversary celebration central bank sri lanka, colombo, 29 march, 2011. * * * first all, thank central bank sri lanka (cbsl) governor cabraal invite deliver commemorative oration part cbsl’s diamond jubilee celebrations. i gather number distinguish people give oration part anniversary series. i indeed honour add name select list. my compliment management staff cbsl happy historic occasion. a institutions, central bank go back several centuries. the first central bank, riksbank sweden, establish 1668, nearly 350 year ago. the bank england come shortly thereafter 1694. by turn century 1900, 18 central banks. today, around 180 central banks, tenfold increase last one hundred years. in relative terms, reserve bank india (rbi) central bank sri lanka (cbsl) young institutions. rbi establish 1935, celebrate platinum jubilee last year. apart relative youth, several similarity two institutions. both u wide mandate typical central banks. in addition maintain price stability macroeconomic stability, responsibility currency management, debt management external sector management. more importantly, also obligation calibrate policy promote socio-economic development peoples. and wake crisis, face common challenge manage policies, particularly preserve financial stability, face globalization. india sri lanka geographic neighbours; deep social, cultural economic link go back several centuries. and navigate increasingly complex world, face number similar opportunity challenges. we fast grow emerge economies; aspire raise growth rate double digits, want efficiently translate rapid growth poverty reduction. we also manage “inclusive growth” strategy face globalization. experience show globalization offer incredible opportunity also pose immense challenges. if year global financial crisis – period call “great moderation” – demonstrate benefit globalization, devastate toll crisis show costs. a emerge market economy (emes), cannot withdraw globalization. that neither feasible advisable. we confront globalization head on, manage way exploit opportunity mitigate costs. surely, concern force globalization might impact us. many issue global agenda g-20 deliberate upon. g-20 i attend meet g-20 finance minister central bank governor paris mid-february 2011. apart specific issue agenda, impress g-20 forum group dynamic drive two underlie convictions. first, global problem cannot solve without global cooperation uncoordinated response lead bad outcome everyone; second, solution global problem sustainable reflect also eme perspective. i think way i best add 2 bi central bankers’ speech value series oration focus remark eme perspective issue global agenda. emerge market economy global context fifty year now, historian look define feature first decade 21st century, probably mark rise world-wide terrorism, deepen internet culture devastate global financial crisis. whether emergence emes group rank pari passu others depend emes achieve last decade, importantly also consolidate gain decade beyond. before i go specific issues, let make brief comment emes global context. the shift global balance power favour emes familiar story. some broad trend show remarkable shift been. set gdp 100 base year 2000, follow chart show aggregate growth decade 2000-10 (chart 1)1. against aggregate growth 17 per cent advance economies, emerge market develop country (emdcs) grow 82 per cent brics (brazil, russia, india, china) whop 127 per cent. when look share global gdp, grow dynamism emes become even persuasive. the share advance economy global gdp drop 80 per cent 2000 67 per cent 2010 mirror increase share emdcs (chart 2). quite expectedly share brics increase impressively 8 per cent 17 per cent2. 1 disaggregated number annex table - 1. 2 disaggregated number annex table - 2. bi central bankers’ speech 3 chart 2: share global gdp (at current us$ prices) (percentage) by accounts, world recover financial meltdown follow recession much sooner fear depth crisis. the recovery remarkable global income, trade industrial production fell sharply first twelve month crisis first twelve month great depression. in late world economic outlook (weo – january 2011), imf estimate global growth 2010 5.0 per cent; mark surprise upward revision early projection 4.8 per cent make october 2010. emes, contribute nearly half growth, clearly engine recovery. emes also motive force behind estimate expansion world trade 12 per cent 2010, impressive reversal shrinkage 11 per cent 2009. two faq this post-crisis scenario, mark fast recovery emes, throw two frequently ask question relate emes global context. the first whether emes able sustain global growth near pre-crisis level even advance economy continue languish. people put question, i believe, rhetoric – encourage analytical think rather solicit affirmative answer. sure, multiple growth pole safety-net whole world, expect emes, themselves, lift global growth former level unrealistic. note emdcs account le half world gdp even measure ppp valuations, third world trade good services. the second question emes global context relate decoupling. the decouple hypothesis hold even advance economy go downturn, emes would affect improve macroeconomic management, robust external reserve resilient financial sectors. the crisis fail validate decouple hypothesis emes affected, admittedly different extents. what crisis, fact, reinforce economic prospect advance economy emes interlink trade, finance confidence channels. even decouple hypothesis gain intellectual credence pre-crisis years, never persuasive face globalization. in fact, recent research within imf show detrended aggregate output growth emes strong association aggregate output growth advance economies, “association” fact 4 bi central bankers’ speech increase time, evidence couple strong get stronger. sure, recent year emes le affect recession advance economy owe improve policy framework, effective macroeconomic management grow intra-eme trade. but entire cycle, economic prospect emes remain firmly couple advance economies. in increasingly globalize world, advance economy emes dependent other, go forward, big challenge term sustain growth, contain inflation reduce unemployment. by far big challenge emes convert high growth poverty reduction. against backdrop, let proceed look issue global agenda eme perspective. global rebalancing the first issue i want address eme perspective global imbalances. no crisis complex one go simple single cause. we fairly good idea multiple cause crisis almost everyone agree one root cause crisis build global imbalances. in much global imbalance – matter whether cause “consumption binge” advance economy “savings glut” emes – root cause crisis, reduce imbalance necessary condition restore global financial stability. the post-crisis debate global imbalance three interrelate facets. the first role exchange rate global rebalancing. the second relate capital flow emes raise familiar challenge manage impossible trinity. and third facet framework adjustment process. let turn one one. role exchange rate first, role exchange rate – prime lever redressal external imbalances. global rebalancing require deficit economy save consume less. they need depend growth external demand call real depreciation currencies. the surplus economy need mirror effort – save le spend more, shift external domestic demand. they need let currency appreciate. the question boil surplus country domestically increase consumption deficit country domestically increase savings. the problem adjustment deficit surplus economy symmetric, incentive face asymmetric. manage currency tension require share understand keep exchange rate align economic fundamentals, agreement currency intervention resort instrument trade policy manage disruption macroeconomic stability. capital flow that take second facet global imbalance – return lumpy volatile capital flows. since capital flow become emotive topic around world recent months, important perhaps recall realities. first, emes need capital flow augment investible resources, flow meet two criteria: stable roughly equal economy’s absorptive capacity. the second reality must remember capital flow trigger pull push factors. the pull factor promise growth prospect emes, decline trend rate inflation, capital account liberalization improve governance. the push factor easy monetary policy advance economy create capital flow emes. what say international capital flow comprise structural component cyclical component. it cyclical component typically disrupt macroeconomic stability emes. bi central bankers’ speech 5 that said, multi-speed recovery around world consequent differential exit accommodative monetary policy trigger speculative capital flow emes. the high profile problem throw capital flows, excess country’s absorptive capacity, currency appreciation erode export competitiveness. intervention forex market prevent appreciation entail costs. if resultant liquidity leave unsterilized, fuel inflationary pressures. if resultant liquidity sterilized, put upward pressure interest rate which, apart hurt competitiveness, also encourage flows. currency appreciation problem arise ultra loose monetary policy advance economies. speculative flow lookout quick return potentially lead asset price build up. the assurance advance economy keep interest rate “exceptionally low” “an extend period” also possibly trigger financialization commodity lead paradoxical situation harden commodity price even advance economy continue face demand recession. emes hit harden commodity price inflationary pressures, case net commodity importers, also wide current account deficits. emes deal problem excess flow diverse way depend macroeconomic situation. this broadly take one several forms: control capital entry, tax entry intervention forex market. such measure would attract criticism past go broad economic orthodoxy market force resisted. the crisis change term debate. it broadly accept could circumstance capital control legitimate component policy response surge capital flows. manage capital flow treat exclusive problem emes. in much lumpy volatile flow spillover policy choice advance economies, burden adjustment shared. how burden measure share raise intellectual practical policy challenges. our current theory external sector management draw outdated regime fix exchange rate limit capital flow task largely limit manage current account balance payments. what need theory reflect change situation flexible exchange rate large volatile capital flows. the intellectual challenge build theory encompass current capital account one give good understand type capital control work situations. what practical challenge? the practical challenge theory, need reach share understand two specific aspects: first, extent advance economy responsible cross border spillover impact domestic policies, second, framework rule govern currency intervention face volatile capital flows. g-20 framework global growth the third facet global imbalance happily actually problem approach solution. at pittsburgh summit 2009, g-20 commit new “framework strong, sustainable balance growth” also “mutual assessment process” (map) determine degree g-20 macro policy action “collectively consistent” examine together. the framework assessment ensure individual action country add coherent path forward. the framework essentially consist identify indicator guideline indicator country assessed. at paris meet g-20 mid-february, agreement broad indicator aid u focus, integrate two-step process, persistently large imbalance require policy action. it also agree decide guideline assess indicator next meet g-20 schedule april 2011. 6 bi central bankers’ speech the g-20 mutual assessment process potentially promise mechanism facilitate timely identification disruptive imbalance ensure preventive corrective action take time. needle say, global cooperation vital success map. global reserve currency the global crisis revive familiar concern robustness international monetary system, particular global reserve currency provision liquidity time stress. the system u dollar world’s reserve currency virtue dominant size u economy, share global trade preponderant use dollar foreign trade foreign exchange transactions. and barry eichengreen tell u late book story dollar3 , reserve currency status depend also host intangible factor strategic military relationships, laws, institution incumbency. in line triffin paradox, u meet obligation issuer reserve currency run fiscal external deficit enjoy “exorbitant privilege” make necessary adjustment bridge deficits. with pressure reduce deficit, dominant economy potentially create imbalance global level indeed happen build crisis. an argument make even context single reserve currency, global imbalance inevitable. the u could run persistent deficit emes provide demand side impetus accumulate reserve asset either trade advantage measure self-insurance external shocks. the problem world single reserve currency come fore crisis many country face dollar liquidity problem consequence swift deleveraging foreign creditor foreign investors. paradoxically, even u economy downturn, dollar strengthen result flight safety. base experience crisis, several reform proposal put forward address problem arise single reserve currency. one menu alternative reserve currencies. but cannot happen fiat. to serious contender alternative, currency fulfill exact criteria. it fully convertible exchange rate determine market fundamentals; acquire significant share world trade; currency issue country liquid, open large financial market also policy credibility inspire confidence potential investors. in short, exorbitant privilege reserve currency come exorbitant responsibility. a second solution single reserve currency develop sdr reserve currency. this seem feasible option. for sdr effective reserve currency, fulfil several conditions: sdr accept liability imf, automatically acceptable medium payment cross-border transactions, freely tradeable price determine force demand supply. a third suggest solution aim reduce need self-insurance thereby dependence reserve currency support multilateral option prearrange line credit easily quickly accessed. such multilateral option necessary complement self-insurance cannot substitute; measure self-insurance continue first line defence. none solution fully address problem arise single global reserve currency. what underscore global level need explore 3 exorbitant privilege: the rise fall dollar future international monetary system barry eichengreen. bi central bankers’ speech 7 option protect vulnerability confront consequence single reserve currency. protectionism in post-crisis world, may actually “deglobalization” early orthodoxy globalization unmixed bless increasingly challenged. the rationale behind globalization was, hopefully is, even advance country may see low end job outsourced, still benefit globalization every low end job gone, another high end job – skill intensive, productive – created. if happen rapidly enough visibly enough, protectionist pressure arise, rapidly become vociferous politically compelling. recent international development mark “ironic reversal” fear globalization. previously, emes fear integration world economy would lead welfare loss home. those fear give way apprehension advance economy globalization mean lose job cheap labour abroad. there concern quarter even open protectionism resist relatively well current crisis, opaque protectionism rise. opaque protectionism take form resort measure anti-dumping actions, safeguards, preferential treatment domestic firm bailout package discriminatory procurement practices. experience show country resort restrictive trade practice area cover multilateral rule exploit lack specificity certain rules. to strengthen multilateral trade discipline, need quick conclusion doha round hardly overemphasized. in world grow worry debt create stimulus packages, doha round agreement welcome non-debt create stimulus global economy. the familiar form protectionism trade protectionism operationalized tariff controls. there form protectionism well. martin wolf talk call “macroeconomic protectionism” attempt country shift inadequate aggregate demand output4 the effort several country around world recent time resist currency appreciation manifestation macroeconomic protectionism. another form protectionism “financial protectionism”. what financial protectionism? it situation country impose control increasingly capital inflow capital outflows. in recent op-ed piece financial times5 , richard dobbs michael spence argue “the 30-year era progressively cheap capital near end. the global economy soon cope little capital, much.” their thesis even investment need emes, especially infrastructure grow, global save rise step several factors: age population spend rather save, increase expenditure adapt climate change large economy like china rebalancing towards consumption rather saving. this make capital scarce raise long term interest rate corporates consumers. the question is, save constraint large push country restrict capital outflow defence rise interest rate home? if yes, brace financial protectionism year ahead. 4 financial reform: an emerge market perspective martin wolf, korea-fsb conference financial sector reform, republic korea, september 2–3, 2010. 5 “the era cheap capital come to close” richard dobbs michael spence, financial times, february 1, 2011. 8 bi central bankers’ speech the short point year ahead, pressure protectionism mount protectionism also take new forms. global welfare maximize collectively resist short-term pressure put long-term interest ahead narrow short-term advantage. financial sector reform receive wisdom today financial deregulation share honour global imbalance twin villain recent crisis. it surprise therefore vigorous reform financial sector way. the basel iii package finalize basel committee bank supervision (bcbs) since endorse g-20 seoul summit last november. broadly, reform require bank hold good quality capital carry liquid assets, limit leverage mandate build capital buff good time draw period stress. another crisis drive initiative expand erstwhile financial stability forum financial stability board (fsb) give representation emes. the fsb work number initiative include manage moral hazard associate systemically important financial institution (sifis) stringent regulatory supervisory norms, principle guide compensation bank managements, single set account standard regulation otc derivatives, credit rat agency hedge funds. there also several area substantial work need do include improve resolution regime cross-border bank systemically important non-bank financial companies, address procyclicality financial system, macro-prudential surveillance. we also need approach extend prudential norm line basel iii shadow financial system lay heart recent financial crisis. the financial sector reform agenda drive need prevent type excess financial sector advance economy lead crisis. even so, emes fall line implement reforms. some reform entail high capital capital buff make financial sector safer, come cost pose implementation challenges. let expand little. both bank international settlement (bis) iif come preliminary estimate macroeconomic impact basel iii package. the basel committee carry extensive impact assessment study. emes need supplement self-assessments accurately determine impact new norm financial monetary systems. in likelihood, emes see cost credit go time grow credit demand arise strong growth, structural transformation economy financial deepening. the challenge emes balance tension implement basel iii keep cost credit affordable level. in term capital, bank emes typically high capital ratios, expect comfortably meet high basel iii capital requirements. however, go forward, credit expand bank balance sheet grow, bank find necessary raise capital conform basel iii requirement. basel iii also pose non-cost challenges. for example, operation countercyclical buff need judgement make trajectory business cycle identification inflexion point. wrong judgement entail huge cost term forego growth. many reform anvil, include element basel iii package, allow national differentiation. should emes, keep view national circumstances, decide deviate global standard norm, challenge communicate rationale market interpret deviation regulatory looseness. bi central bankers’ speech 9 realize reform measure design financial system advance economy different implication emes, challenge face emes may entirely different face advance economies, decide seoul summit g20 work towards make financial regulatory reform good reflect perspective emes. the fsb, imf world bank task work agenda report next summit. conclusion let summarize. in remark today, i try give eme perspective issue global agenda. i start give big picture – tectonic shift global economic power towards emerge economies. emes, however, completely decouple advance economies; economic prospect remain link prospect advance economies. even multiple growth pole good safety-net world, collectively good segment world grow sustainable pace. i go issue global rebalancing need address three inter-related issues: exchange rate flexibility, capital control agreement framework strong, sustainable balance growth. a prime source vulnerability global level single reserve currency i emphasize need global cooperation find viable solution. an important issue global agenda protectionism i talk protectionist pressure may arise new form protectionism might take year ahead. finally, i give brief status reform financial sector emphasize need work study implication reform emes. the common thread run issue i raise need global cooperation solve press problem today. the crisis teach u country island economic financial disruption anywhere cause ripples, waves, everywhere. the crisis also teach u give deepen integration country global economic financial system, uncoordinated response lead bad outcome everyone. the global problem face today complex amenable easy solutions. many require significant often painful adjustment national level, world divide nation-states, natural constituency global economy. at time, global crisis show global economy entity important ever. the global crisis take devastate toll global growth welfare. in painstakingly research book, “this time different: eight century financial folly”, kenneth rogoff carmen reinhart show eight hundred years, financial crisis trace fundamental cause learn nothing one crisis next. each time, expert chime “this time different” claim old rule apply new situation dissimilar previous one. it costly world heed lesson. we cooperate firmly exit crisis, also ensure resolve crisis, sow seed next crisis. before i finish, i want compliment cbsl significant contribution growth development sri lanka. over last 60 years, cbsl acquire great reputation professionalism, integrity sense purpose. move forward, central bank emerge economies, rbi cbsl task cut them. we need learn best world, adapt learn demand culture mature emerge economies. we need constantly push envelope, frontier domain knowledge, oftentimes reinvent it, time remain sensitive core concern emerge economy. on behalf reserve bank india, i want wish governor cabraal management staff cbsl best endeavour towards growth development sri lanka. 10 bi central bankers’ speech bi central bankers’ speech 11 bi central bankers’ speech 1 øystein olsen: the economic outlook address mr øystein olsen, governor norge bank (central bank norway), invite foreign embassy representatives, oslo, 29 march 2011. the address base assessment present norge bank’s press conference follow executive board’s monetary policy meet 16 march, monetary policy report 1/11 previous speeches. please note text may differ slightly actual presentation. * * * excellencies, lady gentlemen, i happy continue tradition predecessor invite norge bank discus economic development norway. economic trend during past weeks, world’s attention focus suffer cause earthquake japan, well escalate political unrest middle east countries. the economic impact event still uncertain. apart these, economic financial news past year has, balance, positive. the global recovery gain strength, even though uncertainty persist. a common feature country fare well financial crisis keep house order. norway fall group, although abundant natural resource wealth put u unique favourable position. against backdrop, i would like comment experience implement prevail framework monetary fiscal policy. today look back ten year inflation target fiscal rule. despite financial crisis, golden period norway. economic development influence change global trade patterns. asia replace europe main trade partner many goods, norway reap significant gain terms-of-trade effects. national income almost 30 per cent high real term ten year ago. 2 bi central bankers’ speech while 1980s advance economy clearly dominate performance global economy, contribution global growth emerge economy last decade, substantially exceed advance economies. moreover, global crisis 2008–2009, growth emerge economy sustained, fell sharply oecd area. a growth advance economy remain depressed, emerge economy continue dominate performance global economy. this tendency reflect development global oil market, composition crude oil consumption shift advance emerge market economies. during last decade, global demand oil increase slightly 12 per cent. over period, demand oil oecd country fell nearly 5 per cent. commodity-intensive industrialisation strong per caput income growth emerge economy likely reinforce upward shift aggregate commodity demand. the norwegian macroeconomic framework the change structure global economy help explain economic shift experience norway 2000s. price norwegian exports, oil, gas, metals, mineral fish, rise markedly, price import good fell. in seven year lead financial crisis, volume mainland gdp expand average annual rate 3.4 per cent. exactly ten year ago today, norge bank charge task set interest rate view keep inflation low stable. at time, new fiscal policy guidelines, also know fiscal rule, implemented, chart course petroleum revenue spending. norway’s sovereign wealth fund, call government pension fund global, design prevent fluctuation oil price feed mainland economy. bi central bankers’ speech 3 a decade inflation target the inflation target monetary policy provide sound anchor inflation expectations. over past decade, cpi inflation vary extent. underlie inflation naturally stable, high low target. if look ten-year period whole, inflation 2 per cent, say close target. 4 bi central bankers’ speech still, past ten years, conduct monetary policy tested. during period, gain insight function norwegian economy inflation-targeting regime. let touch upon insights. at begin decade, learn demand strike balance different monetary policy consideration small, open economy. when key policy rate raise restrain pronounce rise domestic cost inflation, strong impact krone exchange rate, observe 2002–2003. this influence real economy inflation outlook. midway decade, inflation rapidly declined. china’s entry world trade increase import norway asia lead persistent fall price many goods. the combination low inflation strong economic growth pose challenge conduct monetary policy. interest rate – home abroad – set low levels. at time, amplify cyclical upturn norway. towards end decade, financial crisis, interest rate reduce sharply record-low levels. the decision low interest rate undoubtedly difficult decision make time. a persistently low interest rate, hand, pose challenge financial stability economy strong willingness borrow property price rising. despite challenge meet past decade, inflation fairly stable close target, show monetary policy effective. compare 1980s, example, inflation considerably low growth mainland economy markedly higher. there conflict low inflation high economic growth, previously claim economists. bi central bankers’ speech 5 the guideline financial crisis the financial crisis 2008 put economic policy guideline severe test. the interest rate cut follow inflation target lead reduction households’ annual interest expense around nok 40 billion, around 4 per cent disposable income. the krone depreciate act buffer. the burden leverage company ease investment project become profitable environment low interest rates. altogether, monetary policy make substantial contribution norway’s resilience crisis. 6 bi central bankers’ speech well anchor inflation expectation make monetary policy effective – reduction norge bank’s key policy rate perceive decline real interest rate. other central bank experience little scope reduce real interest rate sufficiently low level. this downturn contrast sharply downturn 1980s interest rate maintain high level defend krone exchange rate. at time, lack confidence monetary policy fiscal policy. the cost substantial. unemployment increased, line experience european country today. when financial crisis reach norway 2008, much good position. a long period substantial petroleum revenue – clear save plan – provide u considerable leeway. a result, fiscal policy could also use effectively downturn. the guideline stipulate government budget deficit shall time equivalent 4 per cent capital government pension fund global, – bad times, le good times. a fall output employment automatically lead reduce tax unemployment benefit increase. an important aspect fiscal rule allow effect translate weak budget balance. these automatic stabiliser generate strong impulse 2009 2010, amount nok 40 billion two year whole. the increase government pension fund global provided, fiscal rule, room nok 25 billion increase spending. the government storting approve additional spending, bring overall contribution fiscal policy nok 100 billion, equivalent 5.5 per cent mainland gdp, two years. few, country provide strong fiscal stimulus crisis. the guideline 2001 provide clear long-term framework monetary policy fiscal policy. they also provide cyclical adjustment economic policy – part automatically part discretion. in way, guideline reconcile need flexible approach bi central bankers’ speech 7 macroeconomic management gain bring commitment long-term operational objectives. lesson financial crisis even though norway fare well financial crisis, help sound economic policy framework, concern relate financial stability remain. in particular, one area norway differ country manner perhaps like: norwegian household among heavily indebted europe. a activity norwegian economy gather momentum, pressure mount house market. consumer confidence improve house price rise recent months. house start move up, although moderate levels. 8 bi central bankers’ speech so far, low interest rate level lead pronounce increase household borrowing. however, household debt burden historically high level expect increase further. rise debt property price mutually reinforce phenomena. high asset price lead high collateral value loan increase borrow opportunity buyers. this increase overall risk financial system. while monetary policy fiscal policy anchor within long-term, operational framework past ten years, coherent regulatory system financial markets. requirement currently impose individual banks, without adequate regard overall risk financial system. the financial crisis highlight need strengthen current framework. regulation financial sector must secure financial stability, time protect public losses. this agenda norway countries. i would like highlight three main aspect new regulation underway: first, financial crisis reveal bank hold insufficient capital, excessive short-term market fund inadequate liquidity buffers. the new basel iii framework set strict requirements. second, new framework include macroprudential tool apply necessary. bank may subject additional capital requirement credit growth wide economy excessive. third, authority must acquire tool enable bank wind orderly manner. owner creditor – taxpayer – must bear losses. the interest rate banks’ fund reflect risk take rather implicit government subsidy. the outlook despite concern regard financial stability, norwegian economy must characterise strong. productivity fell somewhat downturn, pick again. compare neighbour countries, unemployment norway low, around 3 per cent labour force. in 2010 return oil fund close 10 per cent, capital pass 150 per cent mainland gdp. bi central bankers’ speech 9 in twelve month since january 2010, oil price rise usd 100. this development primarily demand-driven, fuel strong growth global economy, emerge market economy particular. more recently, oil price increase political unrest north africa middle east lead uncertainty regard future oil supply. norwegian manufacture industry also benefit high commodity prices. increase profitability many firm rise real disposable income may boost demand labour. with prospect continue high commodity price fall import prices, norway’s term trade hold period ahead. 10 bi central bankers’ speech this, together tight labour market, may fuel wage growth. look ahead, cost inflation likely edge up. on hand, high net immigration may dampen impact wages. in 2010, population rise 62 000, increase 1.3 per cent. low unemployment relatively high wage level make norwegian labour market attractive job seeker foreign origin. bi central bankers’ speech 11 go forward, continue high labour immigration expect result solid growth labour force. at time, improve term trade lead high activity norwegian economy. capacity utilisation expect revert normal level second half 2011. in come years, output mainland economy expect increase annual rate 3–4 per cent. a strong krone low external price impulse continue dampen impact inflation, inflation remain target time. further ahead, high capacity utilisation profitability business sector point pickup wage growth. at time, fall import price slow. to conclude: norway weather financial crisis good countries, economic recovery norway firm footing. currently, interest rate low, key policy rate 2 per cent. in year ahead, prospect fairly strong growth norwegian economy, drive solid income growth, rise investment high population growth. on balance, consideration stabilise inflation, well development output employment, imply gradual increase key policy rate towards normal level. thank attention. bi central bankers’ speech 1 subir gokarn: financial inclusion – consumer centric view speech dr subir gokarn, deputy governor reserve bank india, vith v narayanan memorial lecture, kumbakonam, 21 march 2011. * * * input pallavi chavan, bhupal singh muneesh kapur gratefully acknowledged. i. introduction it great pleasure deliver vith v. narayanan memorial lecture. i never opportunity meet mr. narayanan, but, i hear read him, clearly person dedicate mission expand reach access bank service way benefit customer service provider. a may know, financial inclusion agenda assume top priority reserve bank india’s current scheme thing bank actively engage financial sector ensure objective establish bank presence village population 2000 people achieved. more importantly, need achieve commercially viable way; bank service provider must see mandate whose burden bear term high cost low earnings. a governor dr. subbarao put it, financial service provider must see inclusion opportunity, obligation. when i accept invitation deliver lecture begin think appropriate topic, issue commercially viable financial inclusion come quickly mind. in effect, exactly would characterize mr. narayanan’s career city union bank contribution institution associate broad socio-economic environment functioned. of course, i opportunity work commercial organization, i never work commercial bank. it would, therefore, presumptuous approach topic perspective business strategy banks. however, know, strategy design vacuum. a sound understand market environment critical input. who potential consumer are, motivate drive decisions, constraint risk face fundamental questions, answer start point strategy formulation. in words, good understand bank financial service provider potential consumer inclusion-oriented product services, likely strategy succeed way benefit consumer producers. this issue i would like address lecture. i attempt characterize potential consumer financial inclusion product services, use survey data report number survey institution observe indian consumer time now. base characterizations, i articulate key message emerge commercially viable financial inclusion. ii. the current status inclusion: overview before i begin look consumer characteristics, let provide quick overview current status access consumer financial services. admittedly, complete picture, cover role activity institution banks. i merely want emphasize gap currently exists, turn represent opportunity financial sector design deliver appropriate product service large number potential customers. 2 bi central bankers’ speech slide 1 provide set summary statistic relate penetration various category financial products. first, relatively low penetration bank branch must highlight – 30,000 6,00,000 habitation bank presence. a well understood, goal physical bank facility every habitation unrealistic, inclusion strategy largely base use information communication technology (ict) expand bank access virtually mechanism business correspondent (bc), carry handheld device network bank’s systems. this enormous technological discontinuity enable spread efficiency mobile telephone network and, clearly, inclusion strategy must take full advantage resource. even then, must recognize constraint rollout bc model, also need certain minimum scale operation make viable. therefore, strategy envisage phase expansion, large habitation target first ensure viability many bcs possible. in sense, phase approach, first focus habitation population 2,000 base acceptance commercial viability key driver success inclusion strategy. the statistic slide 1 provide indication size opportunity. just penetration certain product service low mean represent natural automatic opportunity; penetration could low demand. it ultimately match consumer characteristic potential demand imply allow service provider ass opportunity. however, statistic present slide suggest that, apart save accounts, 40 per cent penetration, several financial product might meet exist consumer requirements, insurance, low penetration. similarly, debit cards, facilitate use technology, thereby reduce dependence bank customer physical branches, may help significantly expand capacity bank network without necessarily set branches. apart aggregate picture, also useful look status perspective inequality. slide 2 slide 3 present data reveal differential access people different income level financial system. from slide 2, appear household income rs. 50,000 (in 2007) find relatively difficult, unattractive, open bank account. the survey reveal whether relatively low penetration bank account income segment can’t open don’t want them. this important distinction, imply different action bank improve penetration amongst households. if access problem, simplify procedure low threshold may sufficient achieve objective and, indeed, exactly do mean no-frills accounts. however, people don’t find adequate value open accounts, challenge inclusion become little complicated. clearly, mere open account go achieve inclusion objective account use platform access range financial service meet various requirement household try satisfy. this raise issue product service design critical component viable inclusion strategy, i shall repeatedly come back course lecture. slide 3 look situation regard access loan differentiate income levels. here again, relatively low access low income group striking. it though household need credit; bank meet requirements, clearly access sources. the question arise here. be people income segment get bank credit can’t don’t want to? a case accounts, answer question critical devise effective inclusion strategy. it may underscore need look product design solution problem low penetration. bi central bankers’ speech 3 iii. an exploration consumer characteristic (a) employment earn differential let move core lecture, i.e., characterize potential consumer product service emerge financial inclusion strategy. let begin nature employment country, which, mind, critical attribute kind financial service people may want. slide 4 provide composition domestic workforce term source income. it strike half workforce categorize self-employed. of course, come surprise, majority service consume day-to-day basis provide people logically fall category. another significant proportion fall category casual labour. only relatively small minority place category regular wage salary earners, relatively large proportion undoubtedly associate public sector. what mean term potential demand financial services? for self-employed, clearly means, among things, need reliable low-cost source work capital, allow optimize inventories, occupy trade activity acquire productivity-enhancing service-enhancing assets, relatively short payback periods. we see how, first, pager and, then, cheap mobile telephony completely change economics self-employed service providers. this, course, happen aggregate level, look deep business model different self-employment categories, i sure discover sector-specific opportunity make similar productivity improvements. discover opportunity convert viable lend model something financial sector may benefit from, term further inclusion agenda expand revenue profitability bases. the data present slide 5 slide 6 provide somewhat different perspective potential consumer base. in slide 5, see relative income worker different kind occupations. this differentiation important reflect number underlie relationship educational status, employment opportunity earn potential. the ultimate goal development policy, financial inclusion critical component, raise income many household possible sustainable way. there is, course, iron law say income earn occupation must equal. differential emerge qualifications, skills, productivity value add legitimate market economy, financial incentive drive resource allocation across alternative activities. however, policy perspective, must also conscious barrier bottlenecks, impede productivity and, consequently, earn potential different activities. a slide 5 indicates, rural areas, people professional qualification regular jobs, administrative sector, earn people low skill ladder self employed. one response could employ many people possible former areas. in sense, attempt decade ago. it generate benefits, also impose costs; case, strategy, inconsistent current emphasis fiscal discipline efficient deployment resource across economy. the focus must, therefore, find way earn potential occupational category raised. access appropriate financial product service surely one these, even possibly important one. of course, may requirement – silver bullet, speak – important success inclusion strategy identify other, complementary requirements. one observation i make recent exposure interaction rural self-help group livelihood mechanism face significant challenge find access right kind market products, result relatively 4 bi central bankers’ speech low realization products, thus constrain earn potential. to mind, general validity proposition implication build appropriate complementary input financial inclusion strategy need explore further. slide 6 present data urban workers. the pattern essentially similar rural one much set conclusion draw distinction legitimate source earn differential one hand cause barrier bottleneck other. the reason i bring urban picture separately presentation emphasize fact financial landscape urban area completely different rural areas. if, indeed, lack access financial service significant reason persistence earn differential urban areas, suggest relatively well-penetrated environment also deliver inclusion potential. if case, must cautious link mere presence financial service provider achievement financial inclusion. the strategy must go beyond organizational presence design appropriate product services, point make early lecture re-emphasized. (b) expenditure pattern let turn analysis consumers, many consider target segment financial inclusion, spend money. slide 7 present picture households’ routine expenditures, large segment is, understandably, food. the proportion income spend food clearly go income go up, aggregate level, proportion significant. but, issue i want dwell here. let move slide 8, display describe “unusual” expenditure households, essentially mean expenditure generally incurred, regular predictable basis. the pattern suggest significant unusual expenditure far ceremonies. this follow medical expenses. the two category together account almost 80 per cent unusual expenditure across households. slide 9 even revealing. it suggest that, among low income households, proportion unusual expenditure spend two activity even significant. we hear people whose household budget severely stretched, even broken, expenditure ceremony healthcare. we perhaps somewhat dismissive first, argue purely discretionary household work within resource limitations. but then, judge household’s perception social obligations? on issue medical expenditures, room discretion; usually matter life death. give significance two category expenditure, particularly amongst low income household also others, think financial product allow household meet expenditure without bear crush burden? the health issue clearly lend low-cost insurance solution progress widen access health insurance. but, need match increase supply health care facilities, mention promotion low-cost treatments, accommodate mass insurance programme. this another example need visualize complementary inputs, amplify benefit financial inclusion. the need develop financial buff expenditure relate ceremonies, though complicate health insurance, also appear lend product design. a lifelong employee organize sector, i benefit member one provident fund scheme other. one important feature scheme i part allow withdraw substantial portion accumulate fund expenditure connect daughter’s marriage (though, son’s, i recall). this is, essence, systematic investment plan for, among things, ceremonial expenditures. product nature already available market; question is, bi central bankers’ speech 5 essentially, one threshold contribution whether low provide access large number households, even give reasonable rate return sufficient accumulation. (c) save investment: choice motivation let u take look way household deploy resource motivate save decisions. this provide basis address specific needs, essentially extension discussion previous section, also get sense limitation option household deploy savings. slide 10 present strike picture. across households, primary channel deploy financial save bank deposit “kept home”, presumably include cash, gold jewellery. the latter surprising, give early data point penetration save accounts. what may surprising, though, significance proportion keep home; so, find urban household actually hold high proportion save form. of course, may reflect great ability afford gold jewellery, pattern raise fundamental question. why household prefer keep save form optimize risk-return trade-off? put (or most) egg one basket, essentially message slide 10, may appropriate strategy conditions; complete absence investment options, example. but, clearly, aggregate level, option absent; indian financial system offer increase variety alternative finely differentiate risk-return profiles, allow individual household significant opportunity match save pattern anticipate requirements. in probability, opportunity also subject threshold requirements, mean household certain income save level cannot yet access them. from inclusion perspective, challenge clearly low threshold way compromise commercial viability service provider. slide 11 present picture motivation people say drive save behaviour. the question obviously allow people acknowledge many list item want response report indicate percentage household mark particular motivation. although data report distinguish household income, height bar clearly suggest motivation cut across income groups. let u focus four frequently occur responses. of four, already spend fair amount time ceremonies. the three are, might quite reasonably expected, old age, children’s education emergencies. once again, risk repetition, i want emphasize point that, requirements, indian financial system currently offer variety product services, threshold requirement apply, mean many low income household whose motivation affluent one cannot access product services. one could argue product service meet requirement commercial viability. but proposition need explore and, hopefully, prove wrong. the essential business-related point i would like make reference save decision motivation must see dynamic context. in economy grow rapidly, household also equally rapidly evolve term consumption save choice motivations. a many successful marketer demonstrated, life-cycle approach consumer extremely effective long-term strategy. a significant proportion low-income household today achieve middle income status years. their choice partly dictate experience service provider transition. service provider get customer first, even relatively low level activity, provide take forward view relationship, realistically look 6 bi central bankers’ speech benefit increase affluence great complex financial need customers. (d) borrow motivation let turn last consumer characteristic i list. slide 12 present data reason people borrow money. consider loan take household surveyed, 50 per cent rural household 45 per cent urban household report borrow money deal financial medical emergencies. business purpose also significant, dominant. of course, since lend money enable people deal situation conventional activity bank formal financial service providers, unlikely requirement would meet category lenders. the data slide 12 validate conjecture; significantly, proportion household borrow purpose institutional source far le borrow non-institutional sources. in fact, may come surprise many household actually borrow institutional source purpose deal emergencies! this suggest capacity meet requirement exists. again, come back question whether right kind product exist expand coverage household currently exclude access credit. iv. key message i try introduce discussion number attribute consumer behaviour motivations, i believe important input devise strategy commercially viable financial inclusion. these relate broadly (i) source livelihood potential consumer segment financial inclusion (ii) spend money, particularly non-regular item (iii) choice motivation respect save (iv) motivation borrow ability access institutional source finance basic requirements. in discuss set issues, i spend time draw implication business strategy financial service providers. in section, i briefly highlight, risk repetition, i consider key message lecture. the first message emerge preliminary discussion current scenario financial inclusion, aggregate level across income categories. the data suggest even save accounts, basic financial service, low penetration amongst low income households. i want emphasize talk below poverty line household only; rs. 50,000 per year 2007, perhaps quite middle class, certainly quite far official poverty line. the concern lack penetration amongst low income group loan also arise. to reiterate question arise data patterns: people can’t access bank service provider don’t see value so? this question need address effective inclusion strategy developed. the second message process financial inclusion go incomplete inadequate measure term new account open operated. from employment earn patterns, emerge sense good access various kind financial service would help increase livelihood potential number occupational categories, turn would help reduce income differential regular, salaried jobs. the fact huge proportion indian workforce either self-employed casual labour segment suggest need product make access credit easy former, offer opportunity risk mitigation consumption smooth latter. bi central bankers’ speech 7 the third message emerge analysis expenditure pattern significance infrequent, quantitatively significant expenditure like ceremony medical costs. essentially, deal kind expenditure require either low-cost insurance options, support correspondingly low-cost health care system low level systematic investment plan, allow even poor household create enough buff deal demand arise. a already point out, though product offer domestic financial service providers. it really matter extend make accessible large number low income households, low possibly uncertain ability maintain regular contributions. the fourth message come strongly motivation save borrow, which, one might reasonably expect, significantly overlap other. it strike need deal emergencies, financial medical, play important role set motivations. the latter is, said, amenable low-cost, mass insurance scheme, attendant service provision. however, former, theme recur entire discussion consumer characteristics, certainly suggest need kind income consumption smooth product significant one effective financial inclusion agenda. this, course, raise broad question role social safety nets, offer least minimum income security consumption smoothing. how extensive mechanism be, much security offer long finance fundamental policy question go beyond realm financial sector. however, extent risk mitigation significant financial need, must receive attention meaningful financial inclusion strategy, way provide practical answer three questions. the fifth final message actually point i begin lecture with. it critical importance principle commercial viability. every aspect financial inclusion strategy – whether design product service delivery mechanism – need view term business opportunity offer deliverable impose service provider. however, also important emphasize commercial viability need necessarily view term immediate cost profitability calculations. like many products, financial service also offer prospect life-cycle model marketing. establish relationship first-time consumer financial product service offer opportunity leverage relationship wide set financial transaction least consumer move steadily income ladder. in fact, high growth scenario , high proportion household likely move quite quickly basic financial service sophisticate ones. in words, commercial viability profitability financial inclusion strategy need view perspective immediacy. there viable investment dimension well. v. conclusion the basic premise lecture need take fully account various behavioural motivational attribute potential consumer financial inclusion strategy succeed. in sense, different business strategy development exercise. where differ though, term significance. there clearly enormous gap come access delivery financial services. close gap contribute enhance livelihood high productivity, improve ability deal occasional, lumpy expenditure well cushion impact financial emergencies. this matter hundred thousand consumers, issue hundred millions. the social cost consequence badly conceive execute inclusion strategy could enormous. we need bring relevant knowledge experience development strategy order maximize possibility 8 bi central bankers’ speech succeeding. understand potential consumer need need one knowledge input; indeed, i try argue, critically important one. i would like end thank sastra university invite deliver

speech 1 mark carney: the paradigm shift – global imbalances, policy, latin america remark mr mark carney, governor bank canada, inter-american development bank, calgary, 26 march 2011. * * * introduction globalization opportunity challenge age. it potential lift billion poverty, vastly expand economic prospects, develop diverse resilient global economy. however, globalization also bring stresses, policy-makers need discipline new framework realise promise. the financial crisis accelerate shift world’s economic centre gravity. emerging-market economy (emes) account almost three-quarters global growth – one-third turn millennium. although paradigm shift multipolar world fundamentally positive, also disruptive. labour, capital commodity market change rapidly. the effective global labour supply quadruple 1980 2005 may double 2050.1 cross-border capital flow exploded, grow rate almost seven time peak last wave globalization.2 commodity market midst supercycle. large imbalance natural consequence globalization. these imbalance good bad. good imbalance product capital move best used, production reorient expanded, economic cycle become commodity intensive. bad imbalance arise country resist misread consequence shift activity demand advance emerge economies. indeed, response pressure influence resiliency globalization process itself. in run-up crisis, poor policy choice reinforce vulnerabilities. country frustrate exchange rate adjustment, recipient large capital inflow squander them. price stability achieved, financial stability forfeited. the result unbalanced, unsustainable growth, culminate economic catastrophe. it clear commitment open market withstand repeat mistakes. today, i concentrate two current policy challenge region could prove decisive: 1) maintain price stability face major commodity shock, 2) maximize return large, volatile capital flows. in case, risk policy-makers downplay longer-term force set short-term policy. a consequence, destabilize global imbalance could re-emerge undermine globalization process itself. 1 adjust percentage population traded-goods sector. see m. carney, “the implication globalization economy public policy,” speech deliver british columbia chamber commerce business council british columbia, vancouver, british columbia, 18 february 2008. 2 cross-border capital flow roughly 20 per cent global gdp crisis, compare 3 per cent turn last century. 2 bi central bankers’ speech commodity major commodity exporters, include canada much latin america, experience large, positive terms-of-trade shock (see appendix, chart 1). real price energy metal well long-term average five years, real food price high level twenty year (chart 2).3 the question whether strength persist. from policy perspective, matter whether price primarily drive demand, supply speculation. in general, supply shock speculative overshoot tend short live look through. demand shock different. while supply disruption due geopolitical unrest natural disasters, speculative pressure reinforced, occasion, direction fundamentally drive price moves, bank’s view large, sustain increase demand primary driver boom. the breadth durability commodity rally underscore conclusion. this surge demand result rapid growth emerge world, particularly asia (chart 3). with convergence still long way off, demand commodity expect remain robust time. base experience japan 1960s korea 1980s, emerge asia’s energy metal intensity gain momentum.4 rapid urbanization underpin growth. since 1990, number people live city china india rise nearly 500 million, equivalent house entire population canada 15 time (chart 4). this process expect continue decades, since urbanization rate china india currently 30 50 percentage point brazil, mexico canada. in parallel, massive new middle class formed. the world’s middle class grow 70 million people year double 40 per cent global population end decade.5 the ramification considerable wide range commodities, high protein diets, refrigeration travel. whether cars, airport meat, consumption development level major emerge market currently fraction advance economy (table 1). even though history teach boom finite, one could go time. with demand story intact, profile commodity price turn supply. time tell whether new supply sufficient, whether consumption converge current western level whether price signal serious attempt reduce carbon intensity ultimately force sustainable equilibrium. the fundamental issue relationship u.s. economic activity commodity price changed, complicate policy response exporter importer alike (chart 5). 3 in all, 18 23 commodity bank canada’s commodity index long-term average. 4 current per caput income $5,000–$10,000 per caput china, thailand, malaysia. commodity demand continue grow rapidly slow income level reach $15,000–$20,000 per capita. see c. cheung s. morin, “the impact emerge asia commodity prices,” bank canada work paper 2007-55. add potential momentum fact per caput income level remain $5,000 india, indonesia philippines. 5 mckinsey & company, “the great rebalancing,” june 2010. bi central bankers’ speech 3 policy implication all idb member country currently face similar challenges, best address eye longer-term trends. first, large persistent change relative price encourage substantial structural adjustment economies. in past decades, commodity-price increase often drive strong growth g-3 economies. more recently, however, high commodity price generated, large part, strong growth emerge markets, particularly china (chart 6). consequently, commodity importer region face adverse implication high commodity prices, without cushion demand boost strong growth g-3 economies. similarly, great pressure manufacture sector commodity exporter come strength exchange rates, absence traditional demand g-3. adjustment inevitable – substantial. in general, change frustrated, rather facilitate policy enhance economic flexibility. second, country need maintain price stability environment g-3 monetary policy cannot expect lead global cycle. a i discus moment, key mistake would let fear capital inflow exchange rate pressure dominate imperative domestic price stability. it paramount monetary policy everywhere act ensure inflation expectation remain line medium-term policy objectives. everything else equal, high commodity price usually necessitate high policy interest rates. the degree policy response depend many factors, include reason behind price increases, expect persistence shock, whether country net exporter. policy-makers also need weigh importance commodity consumption basket (chart 7), historic experience price pass-through, well anchor inflation expectations. it bear consideration terms-of-trade shock could even disruptive. most u become heavily reliant manufacture good component china (table 2). for example, canada, partly consequence chinese trade, good price inflation run 1 per cent past decade. however, commodity price rise sharply china, second-round effect manufacture good price possible, due rise wage input cost and, potentially, exchange rate appreciation. finally, consider process globalization, large-scale displacement, may actually reduce potential growth advance economy adjustment phase.6 canada learn long experience role exchange rate crucial. for commodity exporters, improvement term trade tend put upward pressure exchange rate. when movement nominal exchange rate limited, wage range price respond. this disruptive form adjustment profound implication employment, financial stability competitiveness – objective exchange rate management seek protect. recent experience suggest many emerge economy take real adjustment high domestic inflation (chart 8), part concern capital inflows. to extent nominal exchange rate responds, help offset expansionary effect increase investment, give price signal production sector labour capital shift area high return. 6 l. bini smaghi, “the challenge surveillance coordination,” speech deliver international symposium banque de france, paris, 4 march 2011. 4 bi central bankers’ speech capital flow move hasten adjustment, lead second policy challenge. capital flow capital expect flow, net basis, advance economy towards high expect risk-adjusted return emerging-market economies. such case last wave globalization turn twentieth century canada, emerge economy, run current account deficit average 7 per cent gdp three decades. the scale potential reallocation today significant. investor advance economy substantially overweight home markets: advance economy represent half current global gdp, equity market capitalization nearly three-quarters global capital market.7 a reallocation 5 per cent advance economy portfolio emerge market translate potential flow $2 trillion $400 billion latin america.8 this eight time current annual flow latin america.9 paradoxically, despite secular forces, emerge market currently net capital exporter (chart 9). in effect, large recycle capital: private capital flow advance emerge economy offset official outflows.10 central bank hold 40 per cent u.s. treasuries, delay adjustment home abroad mute price signal locations. two dynamic particularly important. first, expansion gross capital flow dwarf net flows. for example, since 1990s increase gross flow unite state expand three time rapidly increase net flows.11 emerge economy difficulty absorb large private flows, advance economy often misallocated surge yield-insensitive gross claims. in cases, scale movement impact reversal important ramification financial stability. second, face stimulative g-3 monetary policy limit nominal exchange rate appreciation china, many emerge market try forestall capital inflow delay necessary monetary tightening. this turn feed domestic demand, drive commodity price lead generalize overheating. third-best policies, include capital control trendy guise macroprudential policy, pursued. arguably, latin america region affect pressure and, therefore, great interest durable solutions. 7 advance economy represent half current global gdp purchasing-power-parity basis. advance equity market capitalization somewhat overweight gdp representation, give large exposure global company emerging-market growth.

maintain momentum towards longer-term vision. short-term measure first, bob zoellick suggested, major advance economy reaffirm g-7 norm flexible exchange rate without intervention, unless special circumstance warrant 6 bi central bankers’ speech action agreed.12 the reality unilateral intervention seldom effective without surrender monetary sovereignty control domestic prices. by reaffirm principle, advance economy could set stage broad accord among systemically important economies. last week’s concert intervention g-7 provide example principle action. the circumstance clearly exceptional: movement yen become disorderly, volatility excessive, potential adverse implication economic financial stability. to address problem response request japanese authorities, g-7 act concert

where go macro- microprudential policy new zealand speech dr alan bollard, governor reserve bank new zealand, messrs bernard hodgetts mike hannah, basel iii conference, sydney, 25 march 2011. * * * thank mike hannah bernard hodgetts assistance prepare speech grant spencer, toby fiennes, michael reddell, yuong ha anella munro useful comments. introduction follow global financial crisis, general acceptance need central bank financial regulator adopt great “macro-prudential” orientation supervision financial system institutions. while objective prudential policy usually systemic, policy focus ensure balance sheet individual institution robust shocks. the crisis show micro-prudential approach sometimes miss important system-wide financial risks. so, policymakers increasingly focus resilience financial system whole, particular capacity pro-cyclical lend behaviour amplify macroeconomic cycle destabilise manner. i return concept issue later. there currently considerable interest macro-prudential instrument – policy tool might use promote stable resilient financial system help smooth credit cycle, reduce risk boom-and-bust cycles. these tool would take form specific prudential requirement place balance sheet bank financial institutions, capital requirement vary time, restriction lend like loan-to-value caps. this suggest micro-prudential policy unimportant exist tool cannot enhanced. on contrary, strong micro-prudential framework essential robust financial system remain heart effort maintain stability financial system. the basel committee bank supervision (the basel committee) close complete major strengthen micro-prudential framework, keep system-wide stability objective firmly mind. micro-prudential policies/tools the basel committee develop release new global regulatory standard bank capital adequacy liquidity, endorse g20 leader november 2010 summit. while framework broadly set, work undertake area detail, particular regard liquidity standards. in addition, work continue relate international financial reform issue measure systemically important banks, review international account standards, basel committee’s core principle effective bank supervision, international standard financial market infrastructures. the reserve bank new zealand compel adopt full package new global standards. while supportive strengthen global standard bank capital adequacy liquidity, likely adapt aspect standard new zealand condition take different view matter (for instance relation leverage ratio). 2 bi central bankers’ speech we currently process assess potential impact new basel 3 standard new zealand context, yet make final decision measure adopt. we propose “lead world”, jurisdiction likely implement basel 3 ahead basel committee’s timeline, would expect likewise. we also likely continue implement new liquidity policy accord exist timetable (which year ahead basel 3 timeline). while liquidity policy different form basel 3, substance similar, propose modify policy near term. there remain uncertainty liquidity policy align global standard australian prudential regulation authority’s liquidity requirements. we monitor international development engage closely apra process unfolds. with regard basel 3 leverage ratio, risk-based, give mislead picture risk, single leverage ratio imply one size fit banks, credible. however, explore practical issue ratio prior make final decision this. more generally, reserve bank remain commit make improvement exist prudential policy framework, give importance institutional wide financial system stability. with major bank accredit use risk measurement model basel 2 capital calculations, put particular emphasis ensure capital model calibrate plausible economic downturn scenarios, rather relatively benign credit loss condition past decade. macro-prudential/financial policies/tools objective we always system stability objective prudential policies, institutional focus policy work well practice. the conservative through-the-cycle approach capital adequacy, include basel 2 implementation, example micro-prudential stance enable financial system flourish resilient recent crisis. we believe approach micro set effective job almost time. however, nature, micro-prudential supervision always pay sufficient regard macro-financial interactions. the aim design prudential policy macro-effects firmly mind. the challenge researcher identify policy instrument actually use real-world setting. this involve careful analysis individual tool might might able achieve, channel would expect work, potential cost associate use them. the case new instrument rest mainly scope build great financial system resilience risk associate extreme credit cycle. in addition, tool may ability directly dampen credit cycle. some tool potentially effective achieve first objective second. while range instrument view enthusiastically commentators, must careful unintended consequences. the case particular instrument need inform full analysis likely effectiveness real-world setting, along associate cost deploy it. it important clear whether tool would aim build resilience and/or dampen excessive credit growth. bi central bankers’ speech 3 we also need think policy address cross-sectional dimension well time dimension. in words, risk exposure interconnection institution point time (the “cross-section” dimension), well tendency financial institutions, household business become over-exposed upswing, excessively cautious subsequent downturn (the “time dimension”). there also numerous design issues. would instrument set rule discretion? would set leave alone vary course economic cycle? or would deploy exceptional circumstances? what governance arrangement needed? we need conscious cost use macro-prudential tool consider whether use them. some tool potential damage financial system efficiency. they could also result disintermediation (that is, promote lend channel affect restrictions) cause unintended undesirable consequences. during period 1960s 1980s, new zealand country use range prudential measure assist control money credit, look rather similar macro-prudential instrument currently consideration. some tools, include system reserve asset ratio apply trade bank new zealand, ultimately prove quite ineffective lead re-routing financial activity outside bank system. so history remind u need caution. above all, macro-prudential policy view panacea macro-economic imbalances. when seek solution imbalances, also need consider role tax system broad regulatory environment. where clear distortion area exist, need correct lieu adopt macro-prudential solutions. tax distortion area investor house contribute overheat house market new zealand last cycle, reserve bank strongly supportive tax change make area last year. potential macro-prudential instrument new zealand over past year, reserve bank assess range macro-prudential instrument might role play contribute broad financial stability new zealand.1 a countries, credit growth new zealand currently weak, felt press need implement tools. we want credit process able support economic growth. however, certainly period history experience unsustainably strong credit growth asset price cycles, see damage effect these, economy financial system. we certainly face similar development future, want develop macro-prudential toolkit enhance ability deal time comes. rapid credit asset price growth amplify general economic cycle make monetary policy’s task control inflation difficult. we see difficulty arise interest rate alone used. the collateral damage net export sector high new zealand dollar exchange rate previous economic upswing prompt search potential tool assist monetary policy. now, light broad significant social macroeconomic cost arise financial system distress aftermath global financial crisis, great consider additional tools. 1 for discussion macro-prudential instrument see ha hodgetts (2011). 4 bi central bankers’ speech we believe several instrument may useful perspective could potentially form useful part bank’s macro-prudential toolkit future. the instrument consider include credit-based measure liquidity capital buffers. we analyse policy option new zealand context, undertake simulation calculation help establish likely effectiveness. our expectation would use tool infrequently. in regard, basel committee suggest country might use counter-cyclical capital buff every 10 20 year face exceptionally strong credit growth. we think useful perspective. relate would preference standard set work cycle possible, act automatic stabiliser rather discretionary stabiliser. this important learn fiscal policy. while work ongoing, would offer follow preliminary conclusions: credit-based tool a range credit-based tool use emerge economies, especially asia, many years. they include wide range regulate caps, target limits. these tool receive increase attention advance economies. of tools, look specifically loan-to-value restrictions. loan-to-value restriction loan-to-value restriction (or lvrs) use number country response excessive credit growth overheat house market and, balance, appear meet success. such tool could particularly useful circumstance fund credit margin move counter-cyclically, reduce effectiveness liquidity capital requirement brake credit growth boom. another advantage would lvr restriction could impose enforce relatively swiftly, give bank would require long operational lead time meet high liquidity capital requirements. however, use non-price administrative restriction subject great long-term enforcement disintermediation risks. moreover, aware instance lvr restriction apply sector housing. accounting-based tool expect loss provision expect loss provision return forward-looking (and le pro-cyclical) standard 1990s, general provision may base expect loss life portfolio loans, rather current loss experience. the two international account board – iasb fasb – publish propose model expect loss account two board since work align proposals. a return system expect loss provision due course expect play part contribute le pro-cyclical financial system. liquidity tool core fund ratio the core fund ratio tool help promote great financial system resilience require bank fund credit use stable source might choose absence requirement. this discipline particularly desirable period rapid credit growth, recourse relatively cheap short-term wholesale fund rather stable long term fund likely. bi central bankers’ speech 5 a tool actively lean excessive credit growth, simulation suggest core fund ratio could, circumstances, play useful supplementary stabilise role require bank always maintain proportion core fund typically expensive shorter-term wholesale funding. alternatively, core fund ratio could use counter-cyclical policy tool. although core fund ratio could le effective anchor credit growth global boom (when fund spread become compressed), would still effective primary role ensure bank resort stable fund sources. capital-based tool countercyclical capital buff a countercyclical capital buff potential tool build resilience face excessive credit growth, could beneficial subsequent downswing. it also suggest buff might help dampen credit cycle directly. however, calculation suggest would small dampen effect upswing credit cycle effect cost fund (unless one make extreme assumption size counter cyclical buff market cost capital). sectoral risk-weight adjustment sectoral risk weight could adjust boost capital requirement lend particular sector, calculate exist basel 2 framework. while sectoral capital buff would offer scope closely target sector subject rapid credit growth, find simulation use buff likely modest effect price credit affect sectors, unless dramatic adjustment imposed. in principle, sectoral risk weights, generate basel ii through-the-cycle risk models, already reflect risk lend sector, include risk cyclical downturn. accordingly, must, first instance, focus carefully integrity risk model use support basel 2, contemplate additional overlays. in recent years, seek improvement banks’ basel ii risk model new zealand key area house agriculture, become clear risk assessment overly optimistic. moral suasion the potency tool consider instrument affect credit cycle could enhance “moral suasion” effect, addition direct impact via cost fund credit constraints. this might mean simulation calculation understate effectiveness various tool influence credit cycle. the deployment tool would send important signal financial institutions, investors, rat agency general public central bank’s unease rapid credit growth, and/or risk accumulate financial system. it could thus help reinforce change lend borrow behaviour. that said, naturally cautious strength moral suasion effect, particularly context credit boom (where risk aversion may low), instrument widely consider institution “bite”. interplay macro-financial monetary objective the recent focus macro-prudential instrument go hand-in-hand debate role monetary policy lean asset price cycle accumulation financial imbalances. we know easy monetary policy, form low interest rates, interact financial decision encourage great leverage. whether monetary policy moderate imbalance lean dynamic credit boom 6 bi central bankers’ speech complex question. some economist argue monetary policy could use actively address imbalance past. this would essentially see monetary policy take active role lean asset market credit cycle rather focus solely medium-term inflation. an alternative view macro-prudential policy instrument prefer mean deal imbalances. this suggestion blanchard others2 state authority potentially many instrument disposal use crisis. they argue policy interest rate poor tool deal excess leverage, excessive risk taking, deviation asset price fundamentals. whether macro-prudential tool actually suitable lean credit cycle manage various imbalance ultimately rest analysis individual tool policy experience time. some tool may useful, others may well prove ineffective. our analysis recent credit cycle suggest time magnitude previous credit asset price cycle fuel general business cycle make monetary policy task difficult. these credit cycle also result grow macro imbalance institutional resilience weaken due heavy reliance short-term wholesale funding. though bank capital position remain adequate throughout past two decades, downside risks, give sectoral lend look stretched, particularly house agricultural lending. to extent macro-prudential policy may help dampen credit cycle, would le pressure monetary policy exchange rate. while none macro-prudential instrument consider would silver bullet term moderate credit cycle, believe could make useful contribution. it may case macro-prudential tool could employ effectively influence credit cycle adopt multi-pronged approach several tool employ tandem. for example, face evidence excessive credit growth, counter-cyclical capital requirement could use alongside increase core fund ratio, might represent even-handed approach focus either one alone. this approach might even supplement target instrument loan-to-value restriction. use multiple tool fashion would also tend reinforce signal effect lender borrowers. our current policy stance in addition strengthen banks’ liquidity positions, new core fund ratio might expect discourage period strong credit expansion. in recent years, bank tend fund cheaply offshore money market use derivative synthesise fixed-rate term new zealand dollar fund relatively low cost. the core fund ratio, part new prudential liquidity policy, drive bank either compete stable fund non-financial customers, borrow wholesale market term long one year. during period rapid credit expansion, bank thus ability borrow offshore money markets, need put increase emphasis customer deposit longer-term fund markets. a result, lend rate may automatically move high without reserve bank need move official cash rate extent. through channels, policy potential role assist monetary policy, although effect likely operate “at margin”. with short-term wholesale market rate likely rise much, attractiveness new zealand 2 see blanchard et al (2010). bi central bankers’ speech 7 dollar destination “carry trade” investor could also reduced, benefit small open economy term reduce exchange rate volatility. statutory power governance3 the prospect new macro-prudential tool raise important governance issues. these include decision-making particular tool dovetail monetary policy decision-making policy change implemented. in new zealand, reserve bank dual responsibility price stability promote soundness efficiency financial system prudential power reserve bank act. the power act thus provide u scope adopt additional macro-prudential instrument long use intent good achieve financial system stability. on hand, use macro-prudential tool purely macroeconomic stabilisation purpose would require change current legislative arrangements. we believe approach would sensible. in instance would expect macro-prudential intervention aim moderate macro-financial imbalance consistent desire monetary policy stance. in rare event inconsistency monetary policy, would either need hold back macro-prudential intervention, proceed considerable caution. an example might severe downturn where, financial stability grounds, might want keep capital liquidity buff place long usual, also wish stimulate economy. an important issue consideration thus reserve bank might choose implement macro-prudential policy future. the process would begin establish asset market imbalance become exceptional unsustainable − reflect asset price and/or excessive credit. then would determine whether likely contribute macro imbalance future, warrant policy action bolster financial sector resilience and/or moderate credit cycle. we continue work develop set indicator help identify build-up financial imbalances, but, practice, need degree judgment assess whether macro-prudential overlay warrant base bank’s financial stability objective. next, would ass whether macro-prudential overlay would support monetary policy, least work it. the nature imbalance would guide selection appropriate tool. generalise credit growth broadly-based accumulation bank system risk would prompt consideration tool broad-brush effect, core fund ratio, aggregate capital buffer. pressure emanate specifically house sector could suggest target tool loan-to-value restriction adjustment risk weight implicate sectors. turn governance structures, consensus literature whether monetary policy prudential regulation supervision combine central bank, undertake separate institutions. a strong case make central bank best place macro-prudential regulator centralise responsibility within central bank help avoid problem coordination. certainly, appear trend internationally follow crisis. our experience deal policy overlap assist small “full-service” central bank manage monetary policy prudential policy across dimensions. nevertheless, coordination function still pose challenge good internal process important. 3 see spencer, g (2010) discussion reserve bank’s macro-financial stability role. 8 bi central bankers’ speech we establish macro-financial committee 2009 internal consideration macro-financial issue policies. this complement reserve bank’s monetary policy financial system oversight committees, consider monetary policy micro-prudential policy respectively. the macro-financial committee currently review indicator financial stability, oversee production bank’s financial stability reports, analysis potential new macro-prudential policy tools. if new macro-prudential policy implemented, review recommend governor macro-financial committee. the implication recommendation micro-prudential policy monetary policy consider governor potentially refer policy committees. we also regularly consult treasury minister finance keep abreast prudential policy development glean views. the financial stability report, legal requirement act, require u explain justify prudential policy adopt. conclusion micro-prudential macro-prudential policy important. good micro-prudential regulation contribute financial system stability need remain focus improve regulation individual financial institutions. however, learn might enough contain system-wide risks. macro-prudential instrument focus system-wide imbalance also bolster financial system resilience possibly help moderate credit cycles. we need realistic achieved. even credit cycle moderated, eliminated. like countries, new zealand already take step promote resilient financial system liquidity policy help shift bank system stable fund base. in term use macro-prudential instrument good manage credit cycle, press need use tool give recent weakness credit cycle. however, need keep prepare might deal credit asset price boom recur future. our work far macro-prudential instrument suggest keep expectation modest, identify several tool would contemplate use right circumstances. the world little practical experience macro-prudential tool currently

governor bank thailand, thailand focus 2011 – enhance thailand’s competitiveness next decades, bangkok, 28 march 2011. * * * lady gentlemen, it’s honor speak today thailand focus conference. early morning hear prime minister abhisit vejjajiva speak thailand’s competitiveness; late finance minister korn chatikavanij fiscal policy. to close circle, i speak monetary policy complete view investment opportunity prospect thai economy. a international investors, i believe, want firm understand country’s policy environment. this i discus today – monetary policy option go forward light assessment global economy thai economy. the assign title talk today “thai monetary policy environment excess global liquidity”. let stress i different opinion issue excess global liquidity most. global liquidity currently problematic sense fluid, rather excessive. let discus why. first, let give assessment global economy. the global economy enter phase fluid global liquidity amid uneven recovery shift risk appetite. this phase characterize weak recovery advance economy prompt loose monetary policy extraordinary monetary measure qe2 u result artificially low interest rate advance economies. these record-low interest rate encourage investor seek high return risky emerge market assets, particularly asia. in addition push factor low interest rate weak recovery u euro area, strong economic fundamental asia, reflect growth eventual currency gain, serve pull factor. a result, capital become “fluid” – constantly search yield therefore sensitive news rumors. such search risky yield result capital inflow eme asset last year, know. these inflow contribute large appreciation thai baht last year, indeed emerge markets. here i want emphasize inflow due reallocation global portfolio, change portfolio choice, will. there misperception additional inflow “fluid” capital stem excess global liquidity. global liquidity significantly increased. a simplification, think global liquidity ocean. the amount water finite. but unusual weather stir otherwise calm water storm. metaphorically speaking, new global environment loose monetary policy uneven recovery cause large wave liquidity travel advance economy shores. capital inflow help fuel emerge market growth, contribute even uneven global recovery. look bite ahead, recovery solidify advance economy inflation risk rise emerge markets, diminish growth differential diminish, spur volatility capital flows. choppy water may ahead. so i’ve give view current global environment fluid, excess, liquidity. so excess liquidity main issue, is? on top list oil prices, japan crisis geopolitical risk middle east risk interact global fluid liquidity. which naturally lead next question – global growth scenario context? 2 bi central bankers’ speech in central scenario likely scenario, see continue global growth. the u euro area show sign firm recovery, amid monetary fiscal stimuli. late data show strong consumption production. but structural obstacle remain; example, unemployment real estate market issue u sovereign debt problem euro area. the growth prospect asian economy remain robust, underpin strong fundamentals. however, inflation risk rising, fast. on tragic japan crisis, current view impact global economy prove temporary. history suggest japan quickly rebuild recover. and main engine global growth still remain. the current surge oil commodity price also pose challenge global growth, though, expect supply shock limit impact due several reasons: first, increase oil resiliency, second, real oil price still low peak 2008 third, many emerge market administer price cushion blow. there downside risk environment global liquidity amid uneven recovery geopolitical risk middle east may threaten global growth stability. this scenario low probability happening. nevertheless, mindful it. in scenario, oil price surge upward remain high due strong demand emerge markets, partly fuel global liquidity, supply constraint arise adverse weather widespread protract unrest middle east. global recession may result; worse, global stagflation. the outcome depend u euro policy maker respond. u european monetary policymakers therefore rock hard place balance structural risk growth new risk inflation. if u euro recovery still fragile, policymakers may choose keep interest rate low, prompt stagflation road. the u euro policymakers therefore race time. their economic stimulus package must revitalize economy negative side-effects return home derail recovery. in world, bank thailand do? in view, also share many others’, monetary policy poised, pre-emptive perceptive take account central scenario, let say concretely means. first, poise. last year year transition thai economy move crisis toward recovery. this year year regain poise balance risk shift inflation amid selfsustaining recovery. a self-sustaining recovery mean robust broad-based growth. indeed, see expansion across consumption, investment, exports. economic performance beat expectation throughout last year. for 2011, project 3–5 percent growth economy return long-term average growth. the surge oil commodity price project weigh growth prospect thai economy, due fall oil intensity strong broad-based growth. the oil price spike time round also severe previous episodes. on recent unfortunate japan crisis, believe limit impact thai economy. a share thai exports, japanese market account 10 percent. but course, risk protract nuclear crisis dampen economic activity adverse implication global growth. in economy strong growth prospects, le need policy accommodate growth go forward need concern inflation. strong domestic demand diminish excess capacity surely lead price pressure producer compete scarce resources. and recovery go strength strength inflationary pressure rises, must monetary policy stance regain poise – poise neutral rate neither accommodate tight. after all, monetary stimulus much excessive stimulus lead financial imbalances. let share view surge oil commodity price and, particular, respond challenge. the brief answer monetary policy stance continue one regain poise increase vigilance inflation. the long bi central bankers’ speech 3 answer bite complex. the first-round supply-side shock rise oil price allow pas domestic prices. central bank take care over-react price change reflect welcome process market re-balancing demand supply. however, possibility supply shock, especially long-lived, may result second-round inflation. by second-round inflation, i mean persistent general rise prices. second-round inflation may materialize inflation expectation become unanchored result change price set behavior fuel strong domestic demand price rise across board – something every central bank must pre-empt anchor expectation short-circuit vicious cost-price spiral. so second-round inflation risk final assessment? the spike oil commodity price add already present inflationary pressure. monetary policy must therefore pre-emptive, well poised. since last year, domestic demand strong. the output gap project close late year. capacity utilization increase hire become difficult. these indicator point excess demand may lead inflationary pressure. on top that, sustain large supply shock amid strong demand like add fuel fire. it unhinge inflation expectations. and price control delay inevitable price pressure. there therefore increase risk second-round inflation necessitate additional monetary response. a downside risk high oil price global growth, therefore thai economic growth, also exists. however, central scenario, balance risk clearly shift inflation. our projection point significant risk core inflation may breach upper end band. a such, regain poise move toward neutral rate allow u pre-empt inflation risk. by now, probably wonder neutral rate is. let comment briefly mysterious topic. first, concept – monetary policy stance normal neutral aggregate output potential output monetary policy exert pressure growth inflation simply promote stability. in practice, however, determine neutral stance monetary policy exact science. the potential output alone never observe precision, depend labor force productivity, competitiveness global market, demographic structure, degree distortion cause public policy market failures, name few. uncertainty structural determinant make difficult ascertain precisely output potential, implications, neutral interest rate. find neutral rate would depend incoming information demand outlook supply-side factors. that said, i would also add real neutral rate close positive territory. currently real interest rate negative. i say year year regain poise, regain poise unbalance world fluid global liquidity easy. there may exchange rate volatility back fluid flows. hence, bank thailand pursue manage float exchange rate policy lessen volatility. emerge market asia pursue vary degree capital controls. on point, let say view capital control measure option toolkit appropriately designed. the trend shift control capital towards friendly pre-emptive prudential regulation manage flow type rather bar overall flows. on relate point, talk current environment fluid global liquidity lead depress long rate asia, thereby complicate conduct monetary policy. this indeed possibility. however, capital inflow significantly weaken interest rate tool bank thailand. the bank thailand focus short-term rate conduct monetary policy thai economy bank-based short long-term loan free-floating interest rates. i discuss monetary policy poise pre-emptive. lastly, monetary policy must also perceptive, least strive so, medium longer-term 4 bi central bankers’ speech issues. let highlight three issues: beyond normalization, financial imbalances, global imbalances. on first issue, lie beyond normalization? the prospect tighten depend far balance risk shift inflation financial imbalances. a prolong oil price surge may trigger inflation tighten thailand. the downside risk scenario high oil price global recession global stagflation may materialize, depend complex interplay uneven global recovery, fluid capital, supply shock policymakers’ response. the global environment constantly changing. new information development force u revise views. in world, poise particularly important. for poise allow timely response long aware perform balance act top us/euro balance act. on second issue, financial imbalance may foment radar difficult detect. granted, i say monetary policy perceptive. but know limit far-sightedness economist central banker global financial crisis painfully showed. to paraphrase mark twain: “it’s know, don’t know get you.” hence would wise prepare bad build resiliency within. a framework macroprudential policy needed. let remind the bank thailand’s mandate cover monetary financial stability. monetary policy focus primarily price stability. macroprudential policy focus financial stability. we therefore see conflict joint use macroprudential interest rate instrument primarily serve different objectives. prudential measure constitute first line defense financial imbalance serve “sand wheel”, dampen financial cycle, weaken procyclicality, hence reduce propagation financial shocks. the interest rate tool, comparison, blunt. however, last line defense, monetary policy use lean wind excessive asset prices. the prudential measure announce last year – loan-to-value limit 90 percent condominium purchase – example. the measure particularly binding; significant pre-emptive move design signal policy resolve mitigate possible build-up real estate bubbles. ongoing financial sector reform also build financial sector resiliency. thailand’s financial master plan, second phase, continues, focus liberalization increase competition, raise efficiency, strengthen financial infrastructure. on third issue, global current account imbalance remain problematic, global crisis. a long structural problem remain u euro economy china retain present economic policies, likely global imbalance persist medium term risk disruptive correction road. such correction may particularly painful small open economies. firm policy coordination large economy need ensure smooth resolution global imbalances. lady gentlemen, i close conclusion talk today. i give assessment global economy, think policy option go forward, monetary policy poised, pre-emptive perceptive. one theme i emphasize today global environment fluid capital attendant risks. a point departure, let address you, investor, thrive world risk invest thailand. there easy answer. different investment strategy face different risks. investor qualify evaluate manage risk exposure give investment opportunities. however, i tell bank thailand take care risk system, maintain price stability long-run mitigate economic cycle short-run. our flexible inflation-targeting framework target core inflation 0.5 3.0 percent take account economic growth. and framework, exchange rate managed-float play support role adjustor external shocks, leave bi central bankers’ speech 5 room interest rate main instrument price stability. the managed-float base three elements: volatility, competitiveness, fundamentals. volatility manage limit disruption private sector short-run. competitiveness maintain contain excessive currency movement relative region. and importantly, fundamental must allow determine exchange rate movement long-run. but monetary policy alone enough ensure competitiveness long-run. for must sound fiscal policy support national infrastructure prudent debt management; structural police address education, productivity, institutional frameworks. at point, i hope clearly lay policy vision thailand serve basis investment decisions, risk management, and, ultimately, continue partnership thai economy. on note, let conclude talk here, proceed interest program follow this. thank you. bi central bankers’ speech 1 elizabeth a duke: change circumstance – impact financial crisis economic condition worker near retirement business owner remark mr elizabeth a duke, member board governor federal reserve system, virginia association economist sandridge lecture, richmond, virginia, 24 march 2011. * * * it honor invite deliver annual sandridge lecture virginia association economists. this series long history important discussions, include now-famous global save glut speech then-governor ben bernanke 2005. i confess quite intimidate illustrious history, i hope heighten interest contribution offer something prize economist everywhere – fresh data. i go draw preliminary data federal reserve’s survey consumer finance (scf) talk impact financial crisis wealth consumer small business owners. a recent financial crisis unfolded, i keep come back two question seem central understand way consumer small business might respond change circumstance crisis and, importantly, attitude toward spend invest might change go forward. the first question relationship household wealth save rate. and baby boomer myself, i wonder whether relationship wealth save might especially important baby boomer face change wealth plan retire. so i go talk first change wealth impact spend plan risk tolerance consumer close retirement. the question continually arise whether sharp reduction small business credit due change supply credit, demand credit, creditworthiness potential borrowers. while scf data offer definitive answers, give previously unavailable insight role creditworthiness, use change wealth proxy change creditworthiness. i want apologize advance. i find rich data set offer occasionally surprise insight questions, i unable choose two topics. the result somewhat overpacked discussion. despite that, i warn you: these result tip large iceberg may spur question answer minds. the survey consumer finance a may know, scf premier source microlevel information finance american families. the survey normally conduct every three year select new sample consumer will provide detail response question personal finances. because aggregate data consistently indicate crisis severe negative effect households, federal reserve think follow-up survey 2007 survey participant would offer unique opportunity understand impact financial crisis individual family result change financial decision outlook families. although begin mine data, i believe rich understand individual circumstance provide data set prove invaluable ability help u understand consumer approach number important decisions, spending, saving, wealth accumulation. 2 bi central bankers’ speech in 2009, launch program conduct follow-up interview participant 2007 scf update information. a always, consumers’ willingness share personal data interest good public policy critical requirement surveys, participants’ privacy strictly guarded. we extremely grateful public-spirited people dredge financial statements, pension accounts, credit card bills, tax return give u accurate information possible. and particularly grateful nearly 90 percent participant 2007 survey second time 2009. the panel interview conclude early 2010, board staff spend rest year prepare complex set data analysis. early today, federal reserve publish research paper provide overview data, result expect follow.1 change household wealth the shock household wealth associate recent recession extraordinary measure. accord federal reserve’s flow fund accounts, household net worth peak second quarter 2007 fell approximately 28 percent next two year (figure 1). the initial shock house financial asset wipe wealth gain realize since aftermath tech crash 2001. there recovery wealth since trough, since early 2010 remain fairly flat. the personal save rate, trend downward recession, jump crisis spend retreat (figure 2). traditional macroeconomic analysis would attribute least increase save rate correspond drag recovery consumer spend diminish household wealth. that direct effect might compound wealth decline also affect consumers’ confidence expectations, could affect families’ future decisions. for example, worker cusp retirement might need work long plan business owner might unable unwilling leverage personal asset fund expand businesses. in addition, attitude toward risk shifted, household might make different decision spending, saving, past. diversity wealth outcome 2009 the overall pattern wealth decline, however, mask stark difference outcome individual families. to put wealth change perspective, useful look relative measure scale families’ circumstance and, thus, possible link spending. income one possible measure, quite “noisy” income may affect variety transitory factors. in scf, include measure level income family consider usual income.2 take measure scale device wealth changes, see 43 percent family saw wealth decline equal six month usual income 1 jesse bricker, brian bucks, arthur kennickell, traci mach, kevin moore (2011), “surveying aftermath storm: change family finance 2007 2009,” finance economics discussion series 2011–17 (washington: board governor federal reserve system, march) www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2011/201117/201117pap.pdf. 2 for families, median 2007 normal income $53,000 (mean $84,000). take households, difference usual current income average small amount. bi central bankers’ speech 3 (figure 3). almost third saw loss great entire year usual income (not shown). however, fifth family saw gain wealth great six month usual income. to put change wealth perspective, useful consider level household wealth relative normal income crisis. in 2007, one-quarter family total wealth equal le six month usual income, change magnitude would quite significant family (figure 4). in contrast, nearly one-third households, wealth five time usual income. at level individual families, change wealth appear drive primarily change asset valuation, change ownership (that is, change portfolio composition). comparison pattern ownership 2007 2009 show differences, dominant pattern across family change portfolio holdings. moreover, response question ask change portfolio composition crisis indicate 54 percent family make change portfolio period cover panel scf. this perhaps surprising, give large change asset value occur crisis. preretirement age group in dataset, preretirement group include family whose household head 50 61 year old 2007. this age group traditionally particularly strong effect overall economy preretirement year typically characterize peak earnings, peak saving, peak spending. the baby-boom generation, virtue sheer size, outsized influence economy enter every stage life cycle, magnification preretirement effect exception. in addition, 2007, group hold one-third household net worth. because wealth key driver household decision spending, saving, investment, might expect behavioral shift response wealth change significant effect performance u.s. economy. we look change 2007 2009 attitude group change might vary depend whether experience gain loss wealth crisis. i choose preretirement group examine significant size wealth, also seem like group likely affect change wealth feel need change behavior result changes. the preretirement group must accumulate asset sustain retirement, continue working, rely child government support. give vast numbers, adjustment make affect course economy. so informative look finance group impact crisis change outlook result. a case family overall, experience vary widely. the share family 50-to-61 age group saw substantial increase net worth – six month usual income – nearly family overall (figure 5). but 49 percent age group saw decline six month usual income, compare 42 percent family overall. implication behavior it would reasonable expect households’ plan attitude vary base individual wealth outcome experienced. but compare response boomer family lose wealth gain wealth, find remarkably similar answers. in 2009, two-thirds preretirement group report expect retirement age least year late report 2007. the share 4 bi central bankers’ speech family expect extend work life similar regardless change wealth. this likely suggest increase uncertainty future, matter experience financial crisis, also suggest result survey. in term asset management, half preretirement family report plan make change next years; result hold across wealth-change groups. but among expect make changes, increase save commonly report goal. boomer families’ report willingness take financial risk also change panel period. regardless change wealth, family likely report unwilling take financial risk 2009 2007 (figure 6). this sense increase caution reinforce answer question survey pose family amount money think need cope emergency unexpected events. the median value measure desire precautionary save increase substantially 2007 2009 preretirement group experience large change wealth, regardless whether change gain loss, virtually unchanged others (figure 7). furthermore, large percentage increase family experience wealth gains. the large change asset price period may effect willingness family age group consume gain asset reduce spend response asset losses.3 the survey response suggest large drop asset price period may increase boomer families’ sensitivity future loss affect sensitivity future gains. in words, make cautious. in boom year lead crisis, many economist believe increase wealth, especially increase home equity, help fuel consumer spending. however, few 30 percent boomer family report 2007 would will spend increase asset values. in 2009, willingness decline boomer family experience loss well boomer family experience small gains. somewhat counterintuitively, boomer family experience significant gain net worth 2007 2009 – gain great equivalent six month income – also remain largely unwilling spend increase asset values. in fact, among least will 2007 remain among least will two year later. thus, boomer family remain cautious, grow cautious, spend asset gain – regardless whether experience significant loss crisis (figure 8). however, response spend plan prospect asset loss appear strong response prospect asset gains. every wealth-change group report twice likely decrease spend asset value decline increase spend asset value rise (figure 9). all evidence may help explain sharp drop consumer spend household wealth decline continue sluggishness consumer spend even asset value recovered. this asymmetry response hold age group well. the vary change wealth preretirement families, take together change retirement plans, risk attitudes, willingness spend response change wealth, imply effect recent economic turmoil may result long period economic adjustment case past recessions, fundamental attitude appear shifted. 3 the scf ask whether family agree disagree (on five-point scale) follow statements: “when thing i increase (decrease) value, i (less) likely spend money.” note “spend less” version question ask 2009. bi central bankers’ speech 5 i think high level caution display household group, regardless whether change individual circumstance positive negative, especially interesting. this indicate change risk appetite result observation change circumstance others much change one’s circumstances. response regard attitude toward modify spend asset value rise fall suggest relationship save rate household wealth might even persistent past. such impact would magnify change wealth also impact borrow pattern credit approval. to look credit indicators, i decide focus business owner order examine impact change wealth access business well consumer credit. business owner the preretirement business owner group i choose mutually exclusive. indeed, quite bite overlap. more 30 percent small business owner 2007 part preretirement group, tend among wealthy member group. in fact, business owner group hold nearly half household wealth 2007. small business employ roughly half private-sector workers, fill critical niche throughout economy, often see source innovation. for many, ability leverage personal asset critical factor develop businesses. concern credit availability small business appropriately recur worry throughout crisis, information intersection business performance, personal finances, credit hard find. while data still definitive, panel survey allow u look supply, demand, assessment creditworthiness borrowers’ point view. although scf focus families, businesses, collect substantial information closely hold business family own. the survey clearly show high degree interdependence personal business finance many family businesses. for example, family make loan guarantee business use personal asset collateral, loan business owner business common directions. accord recently available data census bureau’s survey business owners, 6 10 small business owner use personal save asset finance expand businesses. the spread gain loss 2007 2009 sharp business owner population overall (figure 10). fifty-seven percent business owner saw substantial loss net worth relative usual income, compare 43 percent overall population; percentage business owner saw large wealth gain relative income also large overall population. the industry business operate significant impact whether business owner gain lose wealth. family business primarily engage mine construction – among small business survey, overwhelmingly construction-related business – likely see substantial decline net worth (figure 11). in contrast, family wholesale retail business likely see substantial gain. those involve utilities, transportation, service – survey, predominantly service – saw large gain large losses, loss exceed gain group. only 82 percent consumer report own business 2007 also report own business 2009. and remain business owner may scale back operation await recovery. we detail necessary ass importance reduce operation directly, suggestive 6 bi central bankers’ speech evidence. for business operation 2007 2009, see decrease median mean business income owner saw wealth fall reverse owner whose wealth rose. some decrease activity may drive decline demand services, may come credit constraints. for variety reasons, cannot look directly change credit availability business owner businesses, look two indicator owner continue business 2009. some business owner use proceed personal loan business purpose use personal asset secure business loans. in cases, business may apply own. if business sole proprietorship, legal distinction business personal borrowing, business owner still may view personal business debt separately. the 2009 scf panel interview ask participant report separately whether apply personal business loan two-year period. if had, ask whether turn loan. the survey also ask whether want borrow personal business purpose convince would turn apply. the data show substantial level personal business application owner whose wealth rise whose wealth fell period scf panel. the level personal application slightly high whose wealth increase period, application likely approve (or le likely believe would denied) (figure 12). the pattern personal loan denial rate consistent change individual circumstances. the denial could also indicate business difficulty significant influence ability business owner borrow personal reasons. indeed, business owner much difficulty document income wage-earners. the combination weak earnings, low net worth, renew focus income verification could make particularly difficult business owner lose wealth refinance mortgage purchase homes. business owner whose wealth rise also likely apply business credit, rate denial fear denial nearly business owner gain wealth lose wealth (figure 13). in case, pattern denial match variation individual circumstances. unfortunately, don’t history series impossible tell change time. but strike similarity credit approval rate business loan request business owner gain lose wealth would seem support anecdotal report time – business credit hard obtain even good borrowers. conclusion the result i discuss today among first detail emerge panel study change family finance financial crisis. the data show significant heterogeneity wealth change family experience period financial crisis 2007 2009. any consequent macroeconomic wealth effect depend distribution gain loss propensity family experience changes. research remain do factor come together, data offer least suggestion may emerge. among preretirement age group, gain lose wealth financial crisis generally appear act lose wealth – sign delay retirement great desire save bi central bankers’ speech 7 avoid risk. in addition, appear asymmetric reaction wealth shock could factor slow recovery spending. business owner much wide change wealth report general population change relate condition industry business operated. business owner increase wealth likely apply personal business credit. although business owner experience decrease wealth likely deny fear denial personal credit, actual denial rate business credit regardless wealth outcomes. moreover, difference credit approval rate personal business application suggest difference financial circumstance applicant work business credit markets. it still early determine consumer spend pattern ultimately alter result change circumstance work financial crisis. but event unfold, scf data invaluable resource try understand new patterns. 8 bi central

membership widen mid 2009 encompass 27 jurisdictions, major expansion original g10 membership. australia represent committee reserve bank apra. i’ve ask speak today might lie beyond basel iii. it’s good question recognise there’s financial regulation basel accord. i’ll try address moment, i it’s worth recap basel process, specifically basel iii accord, intend achieve. the origin basel committee go back 1974, regulator g10 country begin meet office bi share information approach bank supervision. the original basel capital accord (what call basel i) reach 1988, relatively simple affair. the main document mere 13 page long2, compare many hundred page late comprise second third basel packages. the centrepiece basel i minimum capital standard, set 8 per cent risk-weighted asset calculate common basis. one preliminary question could ask is: need kind agreement, rather series national approaches? obviously australian regulator weren’t party formulate basel i, i think see two interrelate rationales. first, financial stability think international public good. all country benefit stability world financial system whole, experience cost system unstable, interest promote sound minimum standards. that’s one important rationale coordinate approach. secondly, rationale avoid competitive low standards. if think domestic context, principle well understood. in long run, might expect market discipline ensure bank maintain high standard balance-sheet quality risk control. but short run, know bank try expand quickly low standards, highly destabilise system. a bank try either gain market share expense prudently run banks, else force bank follow suit, thereby low standard all. to extent, true individual bank also true jurisdictions. and committee take view collective interest agree set minimum standard apply members. 1 that is, australia participate officially member committee. 2 there additional 12 page annexes. 2 bi central bankers’ speech a i said, basel i relatively simple affair. basel ii, announce 2004 become effective 2008, much complex nuanced agreement. in essence, intend broaden scope risk coverage, bring flexibility accommodate difference banks’ business model sophistication risk management. among things, basel ii:  introduce three-pillar structure prudential framework, pillar minimum capital standard, supervisory oversight, disclosure. so framework expand beyond simple reliance minimum capital ratio;  introduce framework capital requirement cover operational risks. in way recognise credit quality wasn’t source risk need back capital;  allow flexibility sophisticate bank determine capital requirement use model-based input rather fix weights. that said, central principle minimum capital standard internationally active bank remain core. when talk basel standards, it’s important keep mind standard always conceive minimum. individual jurisdiction always free exceed them, it’s expect good national regulator would tailor standard local condition supplement effective supervision. in australia’s case, i think well serve prudential regulator apra take conservative hard-headed approach require international minimum. clearly, basel i basel ii standard didn’t prevent gfc, neither exist web nationally-based regulation major economies. so go wrong? this isn’t occasion give detail account cause financial crisis. but regulator around world draw number important lesson it:  bank system need capital, good quality capital, withstand losses;  need make robust liquidity risk;  loan underwrite standard need improved;  governance arrangement bank financial regulator need improved;3  various form conflict interest need eliminate good managed. example include originate-and-distribute lend model go seriously off-track countries, role rat agency advise structure securities. it also include badly structure remuneration practice industry;  need scope regulatory regime act build-up financial excess. not matter basel committee. there number different international body work thing different sphere influence, include g-20, financial stability board international insurance security 3 i refer specifically regulatory system unite state europe, perceive need great coordination among regulatory agencies. bi central bankers’ speech 3 regulators. but since conference basel iii, i’ll focus mainly work basel committee. basel iii apply lesson learn crisis way regulate banks. it core revise set standard capital liquidity. on capital, key element are:  better-quality capital require meet basic minimum;  capital conservation buff set rule manage capital minimum;  time-varying countercyclical buffer, aim mitigate effect credit cycle;  unweighted capital ratio (or “leverage ratio”) act backstop that. for liquidity standard, two main elements:  liquidity coverage ratio, require bank hold enough liquid asset meet 30-day stress scenario;  net stable fund ratio, require banks’ long-term asset match stable source funding. these main element package announce december last year. early speaker today talk thing detail, i don’t want repeat that. instead i’m go use remainder time focus area work still need done. the first point make lot work come international regulatory body that’s still completed. by that, i mean work group like basel committee start yet finished, also area australian regulator work determine response new international standards. let go them. the liquidity standard it’s well understand liquidity coverage ratio, form originally propose basel process, couldn’t apply australia. australian government simply don’t enough debt outstanding bank hold meet standard form. incidentally, problem country would love have. the australian government’s gross debt gdp ratio much 10 per cent, compare number order 80 100 per cent project next year unite state major european economies. there country similar position ours, many. to accommodate case like these, basel standard allows, among options, alternative treatment whereby bank count commit facility central bank towards meet requirement. i think widely understand accept sensible solution australian case. but still number detail yet work out. apra indicate require bank make reasonable use ability maximise liquidity rely rba facility. and they’ve indicate consult bank compliance principle monitored. the term rba liquidity commitment haven’t yet determined. that include fee. what make clear that, meet objective international standard, fee need market based, design leave bank broadly incentive exist jurisdiction alternative treatment needed. 4 bi central bankers’ speech since international lcr requirement doesn’t come effect 2015, there’s plenty time work detail undertake appropriate consultation. there even time case stable fund ratio, implementation isn’t schedule 2018 detail propose basel standard le well developed. so area work ongoing. the counter-cyclical capital buff the basel iii package provide additional layer capital set national regulator base state credit cycle. the intention regulator would adjust buff countercyclical influence, raise good times, release support lend credit tight. to avoid regulatory arbitrage, standard include system mutual recognition, would effect ensure capital charge base location lend occurs, rather home jurisdiction lender. the buff proposal also specify standard quantitative indicator assist decide activate it. gloss technical detail, would base ratio aggregate credit gdp. when ratio sufficiently trend, would signal raise buffer, it’s trend, low it. in way, would allow surplus capital release system needed. i know scepticism kind rule-based approach, it’s important recognise committee’s proposal leaf lot scope flexibility discretion national level. in view, that’s go much needed. have work monetary policy area many years, indicator approach propose remind analytical device know taylor rule. the economist john taylor, year ago, make observation well-designed monetary policy would respond systematically deviation inflation output normal values. it’s relationship easily verify data. taylor’s work spark army researcher try estimate “optimal” taylor rule set policy interest rate. it’s useful analytical work, it’s field open definitive conclusion world simply complex summarise way. no-one would think reduce actual decision-making process mathematical formula, least one devise international committee. if that’s true monetary policy, it’s much true financial stability policy, complexity even greater. there’s nothing financial stability policy, example, correspond core monetary policy objective numerical inflation target, single instrument policy interest rate: financial stability policy wide range instrument disposal, there’s single summary indicator aggregate financial risk. so i think we’ll need avoid much focus area simple formula. have say that, i’m idea prudential regulator vary capital requirement response change circumstances4, presumably co-ordination central bank. but i suggest area take time national policy approach develop, it’s one much effort international standardisation isn’t go helpful. 4 in fact, basel ii principle pillar ii already allow scope occur. bi central bankers’ speech 5 systemically important bank another area ongoing international work systemically important financial institutions, know acronym sifis. this get question regulate institution big fail – or, would prefer call it, important fail, interconnect fail. the focus question really arise experience unite states, uk european country crisis, significant public fund commit rescue fail institutions. understandably, country would like reduce risk happen again. one obvious line approach that, institution consider important fail, make safe and, therefore, le likely fail. on front, propose institution judge systemically important subject additional layer require capital. work currently do basel committee fsb. another line attack (and isn’t mutually exclusive first one) reduce prospective impact failure occur. this lead proposal bank come business resolution plans, so-called “living wills”, suppose ensure orderly continuity core function bank fails. it’s important, course, good preparation stress events, i know number regulator pursue banks. how far it’s possible push idea live will remain seen, i wouldn’t see panacea. and give difference national circumstances, i think another area much effort international standardisation isn’t go helpful. when talk international approach regulate systemically important institutions, there’s interest question group institution defined. i firmly view define global importance, relative importance within national systems. the purpose global sifi policy (to use cumbersome expression) limit international spillovers, failure major bank affect system whole global scale. individual country sifi policy institution large domestic terms. apra example well-articulated framework calibrate standard intensity supervision accord circumstance institution.5 but view international effort sifi regulation need focus firmly systemic importance world level, mean focus small number large player global impact fail. be much internationalisation? so far, i’ve speak thing already reasonably well advance international regulatory agenda. one big question i think hasn’t get attention deserve is: be much internationalisation bank industry? when talk bank interconnect fail, important dimension international interconnectedness. it’s reasonable ask question: bank interconnect sense, make le interconnected? one way might do great use subsidiary structure bank operate across borders. i don’t want overstate case i recognise it’s complex issue. but i think number advantage kind model point view financial 5 see probability impact rat system (apra november 2010) supervisory oversight response system (apra november 2010). 6 bi central bankers’ speech stability. in particular, key policy tool manage financial distress locate domestic level.6 liquidity provision bank currency-specific tool, preserve national central bank issue currency. bankruptcy laws, resolution powers, bank regulatory regimes, fiscal power might need crisis operate domestic level. the effect subsidiarisation, least principle, would ring-fence national operation cross-border bank within separate legal entity country operate. there’s good argument kind structure would simplify management financial stress events. it might also reduce concern cross-border arbitrage difference capital regulation. i aware also argument side. in instances, ring-fencing might realistic option, host country might prefer foreign bank enter branch order benefit full support parent. some would argue concern cross-border resolution could good address ways. another point subsidiary structure likely expensive operate. but i’m sure view decisive argument it. a lot post-crisis regulatory change add cost financial intermediation, do anyway reduce systemic risk. the point cost benefit need carefully weighed. so argument sides. i’m today seek present firm view, i think it’s area hasn’t sufficiently debated, i simply raise one deserve attention.7 supervision lend standard i start say there’s financial regulation basel committee. there’s also financial stability good regulations. the best possible set regulation won’t, own, stop next crisis, simple reason every crisis different, people innovate around regulations, can’t regulate foolish behaviour. i don’t want interpret counsel despair. good regulation obviously make difference, effort improve regulatory regimes, keep date, made. but also need thing hard convert rule (and i’m talk international scene here): need banker investor don’t take silly risks, supervisor prepare ask tough question step see excess, good-quality implementation rule already have. i think, way, australia well serve prudential regulator front. but would shame if, international debate, basic get lose focus re-writing rules.8 6 this leaf aside special case europe, supranational entity operate respect single jurisdiction. 7 for detail discussion, see fiechter et al: subsidiary branches: doe one size fit all? imf staff discussion note 11/04, 7 march 2011. 8 international regulatory body clearly aware issue. see example intensity effectiveness sifi supervision (fsb 2 november 2010). bi central bankers’ speech 7 end-piece i want conclude, i may, say word current situation. a know, reserve bank release half-yearly financial stability review early today. a usual, we’ve give account various uncertainty exist around global financial system. the tragic event japan new element picture, instability north africa middle east. it’s go take time implication assessed. but, acknowledge uncertainties, world financial system past half year generally improving. australian bank good shape, come crisis profitable well capitalised. they strengthen liquidity position use deposit funding. australian business reduce gearing. household raise save rates. when think post-crisis environment might look like, seem unlikely we’ll go back day consistent double-digit growth credit saw pre-crisis years. that growth drive part factor can’t repeat – deregulation financial system 1980s, transition low inflation 1990s. in post-crisis environment, borrower investor cautious were, home abroad. that’s likely mean le demand leverage le growth private balance sheets, even economy grow strongly. if trend continue, i think good financial stability, also mean lend institution get use low rate expansion typical pre-crisis years. bi central bankers’ speech 1 jean-pierre danthine: swiss monetary policy public eye speech mr jean-pierre danthine, member govern board swiss national bank, money market event, zurich, 24 march 2011. * * * i would like thank marlene amstad gero jung valuable support draft speech. i also want thank rita kobel rohr helpful comments. introduction: great recession v great depression the great recession behind us. in case switzerland, may wonder term justified. with fall output 3.2% top cycle 2008 trough 2009, recession severe since mid-1970s.1 however, measure quarterly basis, consumption, meaningful indicator economic well-being, barely fell. in switzerland, great recession (relatively severe) recession. what it, transform many fear could new great depression great recession? a historical data show, downturn global industrial output first ten twelve month two crisis similar (chart 1). economic historian occupy question long time. let venture say policy reaction fiscal monetary authority occupy central position historians’ final answer. chart 2 3 provide illustration difference policy response 1929 2008. the much strong monetary policy reaction, great willingness run fiscal deficit incomparably large amount support financial sector distinctive feature present crisis. monetary fiscal policy restrictive great depression. the opposite case great recession; continue expansive. stabilisation package help bank sector large, non-existent early thirties. it hard argue policy response play crucial role avoid repetition great depression. of course, expansive fiscal policies, support measure financial sector unconventional monetary policy come free. this see increase public debt level register many country size of, correspond risk present in, many central banks’ balance sheets. what turn reason why, switzerland, great recession take form “relatively severe recession”? a number factors, already hint money market speech last year, surely play: sound condition swiss economy enter crisis, demand impulse provide immigration, absence real estate bubble, strong private save ahead crisis, and, last certainly least, expansionary monetary policy response complete determine calibrate support one big banks. today, i focus one discuss element monetary policy response, intervention foreign exchange market. before so, i would like stress key element swiss financial market structure show particular resilience help provide appropriate financial condition throughout crisis swiss economy: swiss franc repo market. the good performance market closely relate another element snb’s policy draw public attention, even criticism – collateral policy. 1 during recession 1974–1976, real output switzerland fell 10%. 2 bi central bankers’ speech i. an important feature swiss money market: snb’s collateral policy a plausible popular diagnosis recent financial crisis start bank run. in contrast “traditional” bank run, occur 1930s,2 run current crisis take form large sudden increase collateral haircut u repo market.3 if one plausibly estimate size u repo market $10 trillion eve crisis, 20% increase haircut lead withdrawal fund bank sector equivalent $2 trillion.4 chart 4 provide estimate increase haircut u market chart 5 display drop overnight repo volume march december 2008.5 this run repo market obvious implication ability bank sector lend. the consequent dearth liquidity u dollar felt throughout world, particular europe. it main reason swap agreement initiate federal reserve number international central banks, include snb. the aim substitute central bank liquidity provision fail money market u dollars, directed, particularly, international market participants. in contrast account early phase financial crisis us, chart 6 report evolution exchange volume swiss secure unsecured money markets. the contrast last two chart could striking: switzerland, secure interbank market progressively take collapse unsecured market achieve record volume activity week follow lehman brother collapse. clearly market show resilience fulfil function, doubt help prevent credit crunch materialise switzerland. note late development (starting late autumn 2008) strongly mark abundant liquidity situation create snb swap agreement central bank late intervention foreign exchange markets. a result, demand short-term liquidity market participant disappeared. preliminary evidence strongly suggest key factor relative performance swiss u repo market lie quality collateral back repo transactions.6 in us, emphasise bi study, repo market double size since 2002, gross amount outstanding year-end 2007 roughly usd 10 trillion.7 these market end finance one-half total asset major investment banks. this growth volume base widely broaden collateral basket, include corporate bonds, bond issue agencies, mortgage-backed security lower-rated collateral. in march 2008, follow bear stearns rescue, confidence wan market participant immediately cease accept collateral treasury agency securities. in switzerland contrast, collateral accept 99.8% transaction secure interbank market correspond definition snb collateral basket, is, collateral accept snb repo operations. the snb’s collateral policy base transparent, essentially rule-based approach. this mean security exclude list acceptable security 2 see diamond dybvig (1983). “bank runs, deposit insurance, liquidity”, journal political economy 1983, vol. 91, no. 3, pp. 401–19. 3 typically, total amount deposit amount le value underlie asset, difference call “haircut”. for details, see gorton metrick (2009) “securitized bank run repo”, nber work paper series (nber work paper no. 15223), august 2009. 4 this could reasonable approximation. see gorton (2009): “slapped face invisible hand: bank panic 2007”, prepare federal reserve bank atlanta’s 2009 financial market conference, may 2009; gorton metrick (2009). 5 chart 4 illustrate average repo haircut structure debt. this good indication overall “haircut index”, show gorton metrick (2009). 6 another important difference swiss repo market conduct highly efficient automate centralise platform u repo transaction trade counter. 7 hördahl king (2008). however, number estimate give almost repo transaction conduct counter. see also imf (2010), global financial stability report, october 2010. bi central bankers’ speech 3 new information application exist publish criteria. compare many central banks, definition eligible collateral unusually open sense snb rare among central bank accept security denominate foreign currency home currency, swiss franc. the quid-pro-quo multi-currency policy security eligible snb repo transaction must satisfy stringent quality requirements: requirement concern credit rat liquidity properties. this policy coherent – open strict! – substantial advantages. first, initial margin haircut apply standardise repo transactions, make system capital efficient.8 second, allow broad range financial institution participate, include many international banks. third, create incentive bank hold high-quality, liquid asset balance sheets. finally, already suggested, highly credible collateral policy result snb eligible collateral become standard secure interbank money market swiss francs. this, turn, make essential contribution create robust secure interbank market thereby keep interbank credit line open time crisis. ii. the snb’s intervention foreign exchange market let move second main point, intervention foreign exchange market carry snb 2009 2010. the snb act foreign exchange market period one reason one reason only: zero interest rate low bind reach economic situation unequivocally call looser, tighter, monetary conditions. the goal maintain price stability, meant, circumstances, avoid deflation. one always mind clear recipe avoid deflationary trend situation. the famous illustration statement u experience late 1920s early 1930s. at time u policymakers underestimate consequence bout deflation fail take aggressive action. the consumer price index (and gdp deflator) decline 24% august 1929 march 1933, virtually flat 1921 1929. this decline accompany fall real gdp almost 30 percent.9 a recent example japan’s “lost decade”. there situation underestimate degree. however, public action culminate double japanese public debt prove insufficient avoid protract deflationary episode. let review history intervention detail. at begin 2009, severe downturn global economy translate serious threat deflation switzerland. for example, inflation forecast produce imf show inflation switzerland negative territory two year row. price stability evidently assured. the substantial increase value swiss franc since begin financial crisis represent inappropriate tighten monetary conditions. yet, imperative monetary condition keep loose possible, fortiori avoid monetary tightening. give interest rate effectively zero level, snb decide prevent appreciation swiss franc respect euro march 2009 on. the snb achieve goal repeatedly intervene foreign exchange market course 2009. this policy maintain monetary policy assessment (mpa) december 2009. by end 2009, economic situation show sign improvement threat deflation estimate diminished. a consequence, snb decide certain appreciation swiss franc could allow without price stability compromised. at december mpa, snb therefore announce would act 8 there are, however, twice daily margin call case variation collateral market value. 9 source: imf (2003), “deflation: determinants, risks, policy options”, april 2003. 4 bi central bankers’ speech decisively event excessive appreciation swiss franc. this policy maintain throughout first half 2010. in spring 2010, news state swiss economy turn increasingly positive although forecast remain fraught major uncertainties. it clear, instance, partial unemployment (short-time work) could reabsorb without significant additional increase rate unemployment. the recovery appear way presume remain fragile. at time, sovereign debt crisis europe cause major tension financial markets. in general, market commonly afraid euro could face long term structural problems, flight safe investment universal pressure swiss franc substantial. the snb consider that, time, swiss economy unlikely gain enough strength able withstand violent appreciation franc. such development would place swiss economy severe strain threat deflationary trend would come fore. the snb prepare take risk; resist excessive appreciation franc lead acquire large quantity foreign exchange. a well known, eu authority come “shock awe” package10 that, hesitations, market participant accept provide reassurance, although complete final solution european periphery debt problem. by end may, pressure franc start subside. take stock development visible strengthen recovery swiss global economies, snb consider june monetary assessment threat deflation largely disappeared. a appreciation swiss franc long threat price stability economy previously. in second half year snb thus refrain carry intervention foreign exchange market. one summarise historical episode follows. from march 2009 end year snb decided, view provide appropriate monetary condition economy recession, give traditional monetary policy hit zero low bound, would prevent appreciation swiss franc euro. it maintain policy stance mpa december 2009. a chart 7 shows, nominal export weight value swiss franc appreciate 10% since august 2007 halted. in fact, march december 2009 period, swiss franc depreciate little 2% respect euro le 1% export-weighted basis. in december 2009, snb update view economy decide appreciation franc would tolerable excessive appreciation need prevented. it maintain policy june 2010. over course period, franc gain almost 8% respect euro lose 10% dollar. chart 7 show export-weighted value franc increase approximately 2.5% period. after june 2010, snb refrain intervening. until end year franc gain around 10% euro, 15% dollar 10% export-weighted basis. what conclude this? we certainly conclude snb able hold policy, “defeated markets”. on contrary, snb announce would thus provide swiss economy monetary condition contribute reasonably swift recovery crisis early return pre-crisis gdp levels, while, importantly, assure price stability. chart 8 show evolution swiss gdp comparison industrialize countries. the downturn 10 see press release council european union’s extraordinary council meeting, economic financial affairs, brussels, 9/10 may 2010. bi central bankers’ speech 5 le severe switzerland swiss output first reach pre-crisis level. overall, gdp rise 2.6% 2010, fall 1.9% 2009. chart 9 show evolution inflation together recent conditional forecast. the inflation rate recover 0.7% 2010 hit low –0.5% 2009. why snb intervention often perceive unsuccessful? for outside observer study performance swiss economy go crisis look chart 8 9, must puzzle. all realise performance result amply expansionary fiscal policy; contrary, swiss policy mix, expansionary monetary policy combine contain fiscal policy, appropriate give circumstances. with crisis originate almost entirely foreign market hit export sector strongly, large domestic fiscal stimulus would miss target. the result appropriate policy mix, place burden response crisis shoulder snb, see remarkable account swiss general government: public surplus 2009 2010 (+0.8% +0.2% relative gdp, respectively) reduction debt level le 40% gdp.11 one reason misperception probably view, propagate academic literature subject, central bank intervention foreign exchange market gear achieve exchange rate target generally unsuccessful so. a repeatedly emphasised, objective snb 2009–2010.12 the snb’s objective provide appropriate monetary condition swiss economy. a give exchange rate level context may maintain limit time period, subject review macroeconomic condition evolve. and snb’s experience 2009 demonstrate (illustrated chart 7), influence exchange rate level temporarily feasible make sense zero low bind traditional monetary policy instrument exhausted. iii. conclusion: judge whether intervention successful? all action snb consider light mandate. the primary goal ensure price stability, take due account overall economic situation. in way monetary policy contribute create environment foster prosperity economic growth. to achieve goal, snb strive provide appropriate monetary conditions, achieve exchange rate target. the primary indicator success intervention inflation chart. conversely, significant gauge potential cost intervention find central bank’s balance sheet. our foreign exchange intervention reveal costly result serious inflationary pressure two three year now. a subsequent speaker, dewet moser, explain detail, since june 2010 snb set use instrument allow u adapt conduct monetary policy new excess liquidity situation. we convince instruments, reverse repos snb bill various maturities, fully operational, constitute efficient toolset time come. they place snb sound position steer libor rate level require maintain price stability. 11 the swiss confederation also public surplus 2009 2010 (+0.5% +0.4% relative gdp, respectively) debt level around 20% relative gdp. 12 see, example, hildebrand, philipp (2010) “monetary policy challenges: swiss export globalise world”, brussels, november

enhance stability – current issue financial regulation keynote speech professor axel a weber, president deutsche bundesbank, frankfurt finance summit, “financial market regulation, supervision role central banks: uniform regulation subsidiary supervision”, frankfurt main, 23 march 2011. * * * 1. introduction lady gentleman first, i would like thank opportunity speak today. we fourth year crisis originate u house market eventually spread throughout financial system. it lead worldwide slump economic activity and, 2010, spark serious sovereign debt crisis euro-area member countries. this course event demonstrate global character financial system – crisis long purely national issue – therefore underscore need internationally coordinate reform regulatory supervisory frameworks. let briefly discus issue globalise regulation supervision european perspective. 2. reform regulatory framework the regulatory reform three main build blocks: first, basel iii enhance regulatory framework banks. second, new rule systemically important financial institution (sifis) and, third, adequate regulation shadow bank sector. the g20 endorse basel iii november 2010. a regard two areas, intensive discussion ongoing, result emerge late year. at general level, doubt internationally harmonise approach necessary three areas. give global nature financial system, fragment approach would invite regulatory arbitrage thus provoke renew build-up systemic risk le regulate jurisdictions. nonetheless, uniform international principle adapt heterogeneous national structures. specific national legislation typically take good account national particularities, example term market structure mode refinancing. the challenge therefore strike right balance ensure level international play field avoid one-size-fits-all approach place unnecessarily onerous, even harmful, burden adjustment national financial systems. whether would case eu basel iii framework implement instrument regulation rather directive currently hotly debate issue. for european commission, would definitely easy enforce common standard regulation, approach would leave limit leeway member state accommodate country-level difference deal unintended consequence emerge rule come effect. 3. reform supervisory framework the reform supervisory structure involve similar trade-off, though tilt somewhat favour national particularities; national supervisor naturally intimate knowledge local financial institution supranational supervisors. nevertheless, clear experience crisis financial supervision require high degree international cooperation: firstly international bank operate supervise different jurisdictions; secondly potential systemic risks, predominantly cross-border phenomenon. 2 bi central bankers’ speech to facilitate supervision international banks, european system financial supervisor (esfs) set up. part system european bank authority (eba), responsible supervise bank sector. to allow adequate subsidiarity, eba follow members-based approach national supervisor member board work groups. with regard systemic risk, establish international cooperation particularly important. to strengthen macroprudential approach supplement traditional microprudential approach, focus supervision broaden level individual bank systemic level. this achieve various means. institutionally, important element european systemic risk board (esrb), create part esfs. it task detect systemic risk early issue individual member state warn recommendations. nevertheless, esrb power enforce recommendations, remain responsibility national government ensure recommendation followed. 4. the role central bank now, last point, let say word role central bank new regulatory supervisory framework. naturally, central bank strong interest financial stability, stable financial system allow monetary policy measure implement efficiently. at time, central bank great expertise matter concern financial system. consequently, already play, continue play, prominent role safeguard financial stability microprudential well macroprudential level. at microprudential level, central bank many country involve supervision individual banks. in addition, naturally analyse development macroprudential level extensively consequently play major role esrb. however, wherever central bank involve financial supervision, imperative compromise independence primary objective, maintain price stability. 5. conclusion lady gentleman there doubt regulatory supervisory framework reflect global nature financial system. nonetheless, heterogeneous national structure make imperative maintain certain degree flexibility reform regulation supervision. to strike balance uniformity subsidiarity certainly formidable challenge i confident eventually succeed create stable resilient financial system. thank attention. bi central bankers’ speech 1 prasarn trairatvorakul: growth, sustainability inclusiveness – thailand’s key success factor dinner talk dr prasarn trairatvorakul, governor bank thailand, japanese chamber commerce (jcc), bangkok, 23 march 2011. * * * lady gentlemen, let begin extend deep condolence japanese business community thailand immense loss cause unprecedented earthquake tsunami japan. despite tragic incidents, i confident strength determination japanese people, together support around world, enable japan recover swiftly. for today, i would like thank japanese chamber commerce invite share distinguish audience assessment thai economy. i also look forward hear view concern regard economic prospects. needle say japan thailand long history close economic relationship, japan top foreign investor thailand. a such, thailand become production hub several japanese industries, include vehicles, electronics electrical appliances. i therefore hope discussion today help align understand strengthen partnership two economies. for presentation evening, i would like offer assessment economy base i see three important attribute determine economic progress thailand – “key success factors”, will. first growth must sustainable. we don’t want three year boom follow three year bust. second, country’s potential growth rate high enough continuously raise people’s general standard living. and, third, growth maximize inclusiveness. by i refer maximize exposure everyone economic development, term participation development process share benefits. this would lessen problem inequality, foster social harmony. that said, i wish underscore that, even though growth visible factor, growth alone sufficient sustainability inclusiveness also crucial ensure long-term economic success. look economic strength weakness context three success factor provide good understand role central bank policymakers advance economic development agenda thailand. indeed, success factor entail three correspond fundamental responsibility policymakers. the first responsibility ensure continue macroeconomic stability, prerequisite economic sustainability, gear economy towards operate potential level. second raise people’s standard live expand potential growth rate economy. third, maximize inclusiveness, ensure equal exposure economic opportunity all. lady gentlemen, let start first success factor, namely economic sustainability, i consider thailand’s important strength. after 1997 crisis, thailand long experience current account deficit problem. inflation average 2.6 percent past decade, half 5.1 percent average rate 1990s prior 2 bi central bankers’ speech asian crisis1. meanwhile, unemployment rate low around 1 percent. the bank sector, severely affect 1997 crisis, safe sound, minimally affect global financial crisis ten year late result strengthen risk management governance. despite ongoing net capital inflow thailand, appear sign asset price bubble degree leverage corporate household sector still low. overall, i believe thai economic stability strengthen continuously. this achievement attributable sound fiscal monetary policy, together appropriate market-friendly regulations, aim keep economy operate close potential. suffice say bank thailand fulfil responsibility help achieve economic stability. under inflation-targeting framework, policy interest rate main instrument use influence save spend economy demand match potential supply. this economic balance has, turn, produce low stable inflation environment necessary sustainable growth. in addition interest rate tool, central bank also regulatory tool prevent undesirable accumulation financial imbalances. indeed, so-called “macro-prudential policy” use complementary policy tool interest rate policy long sub-prime crisis. to give examples, bank thailand impose cap loan-to-value ratio high-end real estate loan since 2003. we also tighten credit card personal loan regulation 2004 2005, respectively. these pre-emptive measure help reduce balance sheet vulnerability ensure thailand’s resiliency fast recovery sub-prime crisis. nevertheless, despite success far stability front, cannot afford complacent economic stability shock occur time form, thus must remain vigilant. lady gentlemen, economic stability mean end end itself. this also stable economy grow undesirably low rate, especially productivity sluggish. this bring second success factor, namely high potential growth. thailand, despite strength economic sustainability, moderate potential growth rate compare peers. over past decade, gdp grow average 4.4 percent2 annually, average growth rate rise 5.1 percent exclude sub-prime crisis period. this growth performance somewhat low bank thailand’s research result3, estimate thailand’s potential growth 6.1 percent next decade. our estimate result base assumption country’s investment growth next 5 year return normal trend, approximately 10 12 percent growth per year see 2002–2005. but, aware, current growth rate investment around 9

chuenchoksan, s. nakornthab, d. (2008). “past, present, prospect thailand’s growth: a labor market perspective,” discussion paper. bank thailand. bi central bankers’ speech 3 pipeline. these public investment welcome step towards infrastructure developments, help low logistic cost boost thailand’s productivity. in view, public investment must low production cost crowd private investment medium term. have say that, physical infrastructure must complement human capital development, enhance productivity potential growth. over past decade, government continuously work improve country’s education health care systems. there extension term year compulsory education financial support increase access high education. subsidize health care poor provide extend coverage years. although public spend (as percentage gdp) education health care thailand comparable neighbor countries, quality remain relatively low. this evident cross-country comparison ratio attend secondary school well relatively low life span, especially compare japan long life span4. hence, move towards high labor-skilled economy, thailand need improve access well quality education health care enhance quality human capital. distinguish audience, apart strengthen infrastructure investment human capital investment, exchange rate also play important role influence thailand’s productivity long-run insofar affect efficient resource allocation economy. give recent development global economy, many agree thai baht unlikely go back level see pre-2006 era. this structural change two implications; first, uncompetitive export sector challenged. second, strong baht opportunity thailand increase productivity high imported-capital investments. the first implication excessive concern long unemployment rate remain low, case thailand. this market mechanism allow efficient adjustment uncompetitive firm either upgrade themselves, close free labor resource competitive firms. this reallocation process imply country make good use labor resource therefore yield high productivity. at present, thailand’s unemployment rate hover steadily around 1 percent despite strong baht appreciation recent years. in meantime, export growth remain robust swift recovery global crisis. these development possibly indicate export sector adjust well labor resource allocate efficiently. in line view, baht appreciation somewhat catalyze adjustment thai economy efficient use labor resources. in fact, thailand continue face shortage labor supply employ immigrant worker neighbor countries. this tight labor market phenomenon create incentive firm shift factor production labor capital. this shortage labor accentuate second implication strong baht, since shortage labor, addition cheap capital good baht term, give incentive investor make imported-capital investments. this part private sector role essential, especially thailand benefit immense foreign direct investment japan play top role. lady gentlemen, let turn last success factor: inclusiveness, probably weak achievement among three success factor far. however, inclusiveness something increasingly gain attention thai policymakers recent years, part 4 imd, 2010. 4 bi central bankers’ speech root cause political unrest. i believe inclusiveness one long-term solution thailand political stability. yet, i stress inclusiveness different concept equality. it focus create equal opportunity rather equalize income. income equality ultimately mean reward system independent performance erode efficiency. inclusiveness, hand, refer equal opportunity still preserve efficiency reward incentive system allow rich poor economic opportunity. a such, inclusiveness refer equal access public infrastructure education, fair competition equal treatment law regulation all. in way, inclusiveness provide equal exposure yield benefit economic prosperity. improve inclusiveness thailand long process initiative already put place. these include decentralization public spending, good access education, informal sector debt alleviation, good credit access low income group. while initiative bode well inclusiveness, government must careful excessively gear government spend towards populist policy eventually add financial burden already-tight budget sovereign debt future. in particular, important government prioritize balance public consumption public investment accordingly. more importantly, efficient management good governance key ingredient policy success regard. for part, bank thailand also put inclusiveness one main agenda financial master plan ii, efficiency provision financial infrastructure. the objective provide financial access all, particularly underserved, efficient financially viable manner without compromise financial stability prudence. this still on-going process commit to. lady gentlemen, before end talk evening, i would like address concern raise japanese corporation thailand, report survey jetro (japan external trade organization). the key concern include political stability, development customs-related system human resource development. on politics, i good faith upcoming election another important step towards political stability, commitment improve inclusiveness mention early would bring long-term solution country. a custom system, thailand continue improve custom system past five year attest improvement indicator trade across borders, category ease do business assessment, do international finance corporation (ifc). export-related requirement term number document period procedure reduce shorten time. these improvement work certainly help promote efficiency international trades. with regard issue human resources, i see reliance migrant labour fill current labour shortage long-term viable solution thailand. in fact, economy, joint effort private public sectors, need raise labour productivity upgrade production technology us high skilled labour. finally, let close stress three success factors: growth, sustainability inclusiveness necessary complementary achieve long-term economic progress thailand. for central bank’s part, many issue discuss even beyond functional scope bank thailand. our main role ensure sustainable growth maintain macroeconomic stability appropriate monetary policy financial regulations. for this, i assure fully commit role responsibility. a broad national economic policy agenda, public policy aim improve country’s productivity necessary, alone sufficient raise thailand’s potential growth rate; contribution private sector key eventual success. and, i convince work together achieve bi central bankers’ speech 5 common goal strengthen long history economic partnership bring economic prosperity japan thailand. thank you. bi central bankers’ speech 1 sanusi lamido sanusi: bank nigeria national economic development – critical review keynote address mr sanusi lamido sanusi, governor central bank nigeria, seminar “becoming economic driver apply bank regulations”, organise canadian high commission joint collaboration charter institute banker nigeria (cibn) royal bank canada (rbc), lagos, 7 march 2011. * * * protocol 1. i delight invite present key-note address important forum. i wish commend organizers, canadian high commission, charter institute banker nigeria royal bank canada gather top policy maker operator bank finance industry today important seminar focus bank sector nigeria. the theme seminar “transformational bank economic development” indeed topical, couldn’t come good time, consider bank sector nigeria pass critical decisive path reform reposition effectively impact sector economy, especially real sector. 2. economic development enhance productive capacity economy use available resource reduce risks, remove impediment otherwise could low cost hind investment. the bank system play important role promote economic growth development process financial intermediation. many economist acknowledge financial system, bank major component, provide linkage different sector economy encourage high level specialization, expertise, economy scale conducive environment implementation various economic policy government intend achieve non-inflationary growth, exchange rate stability, balance payment equilibrium high level employment. 3. the role finance economic development widely acknowledge literature. in particular, schumpeter (1911) put role financial intermediation center economic development. he argue financial intermediation bank system play pivotal role economic development affect allocation savings, thereby improve productivity, technical change rate economic growth. he believe efficient allocation save identification fund entrepreneur best chance successfully implement innovative product production process tool achieve objective. 4. the endogenous growth literature also support argument financial development positive impact growth. well function financial system able mobilize household savings, allocate resource efficiently, diversify risk, enhance flow liquidity, reduce information asymmetry transaction cost provide alternative raise fund individual save retain earnings. these function suggest financial development positive impact growth. 5. lady gentlemen, many here, i may state obvious, highlight central role bank play development every economy mobilize resource productive investment conduit implementation monetary policy. yet, i give emphasis requires. due critical nature roles, fact ability bank effectively impact economic development hinge largely soundness efficiency, government across world continue take variety measure safeguard bank sector reforms. such reform often focus increase risk management procedure enhance corporate 2 bi central bankers’ speech governance order strengthen reposition bank industry enable contribute effectively development real sector intermediation process. in addition, reform may involve comprehensive process substantially improve regulatory surveillance framework; foster healthy competition bank operations, ensure efficient framework monetary management, expansion save mobilization base, enforcement capital adequacy, promotion investment growth market-based interest rates. the need reform on-going basis become imperative increase sophistication global financial products. the recent experience global financial crisis underscore imperative country embark bank reform regular basis. 6. lady gentlemen, process reform financial sector usually involve movement initial situation control interest rates, poorly develop money security market under-developed bank system, towards situation flexible interest rates, expand role market force resource allocation, increase autonomy central bank deepen money capital markets. it would indeed difficult define component “good” bank sector reform absolute terms. generally speaking, good reform would engender clear market entry exit conditions; ensure ability bank function accord market principle without state intervention decision-making; guarantee central bank independence establish independent bank oversight. this mean reform domestic financial system comprise three key policy actions. the first removal price restrictions; is, removal ceiling deposit interest rate restriction lend interest rates. the second component removal quantity restrictions; is, removal direct credit allocation mechanisms, relaxation reserve requirements, removal restriction foreign currency deposits. the third policy action consist removal entry barrier financial system. in country heavy government presence financial sector, reform would usually involve privatization public financial institution relaxation restriction creation private financial institutions. liberalization would also include open financial system foreign players. all action aim promote strong competition financial system, improve efficiency intermediation dismantle monopoly financial system. 7. thus, well reposition bank therefore expect perform role efficiently contribute development growth economy. bank sector reform lead improve financial service lead cost reduction industrial concerns. more people access fund bank system increase aggregate demand good services. increase aggregate demand impact positively output employment generation thereby reduce poverty – ultimate goal economic management. 8. in final analysis, bank reform aim ensure financial deepen imply ability financial institution effectively mobilize save investment purposes. the growth domestic save provide real structure creation diversify financial claims. it also presuppose active participation financial institution financial markets, turn entail supply quality (financial) instrument financial services. 9. lady gentlemen, i wish bore chronicle distress reform take place nigeria since 1950s. i do many fora. suffice say many crisis happen many reform initiate implement bank sector. at inception reform 2004, thrust policy grow bank position play pivotal role drive development sector economy, well induce improvement operational efficiency. a result, bank consolidate merger acquisitions, raise capital base n2 billion minimum n25 billion, reduce number bank 25 89 2005 late 24. beyond need recapitalize banks, reform focus ensure minimal reliance public sector funds, rather rely bi central bankers’ speech 3 private sector. the adoption risk focus rule-based regulatory framework; adoption zero tolerance regulatory framework data/information, rendition/reporting infractions; strict enforcement corporate governance principle banking; expeditious process rendition return bank financial institution e-fass; revision update relevant law effective corporate governance; ensure great transparency accountability implementation bank law regulation. 10. the implication resource base bank weak volatile, render operation highly vulnerable swing government revenue, arise uncertainty international oil market. it also observe many bank appear abandon essential intermediation role mobilize save inculcate bank habit household micro enterprise levels. the apathy bank towards small savers, particularly grass root level, compound problem low domestic save high bank lend rate country, reduce access relatively cheap stable fund could provide reliable source credit productive sector affordable rate interest. 11. another aspect reform seldom mention relate change policy approach cbn. begin december 2006, bank introduce low interest rate base framework make monetary policy rate operate target. the new framework enable bank proactive counter inflationary pressures. also, use framework, upper low limit monetary policy rate set, coincide rate stand lend facility stand deposit facility, respectively. the corridor regime help check wide fluctuation interbank rate also engender orderly development money market segment. 12. there are, doubt, positive outcome reforms. first, bank size enable undertake fund large ticket projects, especially infrastructure, oil gas sectors, new window enlarge single obligor limits. the large size bank also engender improve customer confidence. the number bank branch increase 3,247 2003 5,837 2010 employment sector rise 50,586 2005 71,876 2010. also, capital market receive boost several bank record success initial public offer (ipos). the consolidation exercise also impact payment system positively few number bank make easy deploy new automate clear system also reduce length time spend clear floor. concern supervision, relative ease oversee 24 bank 89 deserve mention. 13. in spite positive developments, new set problem emerge threaten financial system 2008, coincide global financial crisis. the surge capital put pressure availability human capacity sector couple poor corporate governance risk management framework lead recent experience margin loan high risk investments. consequently, capital market bubble burst, balance sheet bank become erode extent remain time “life support” cbn. inter-bank rate spike bank try borrow rate order remain afloat, size non-performing loan significantly increased, customer panic re-emerge several instance unethical conduct among management bank revealed. in addition, critical question “are bank play pivotal role drive development” could answer affirmative. it scenario set stage recent set reforms. 14. the reform could broadly divide two. the first part reform focus ensure nine banks, cbn/ndic special examination reveal dire state, rescued. some action include reduction cash liquidity ratios, expand discount window operations, enable bank borrow 360 day cbn. it also admit non-traditional instruments, like commercial papers, 4 bi central bankers’ speech promissory note bankers’ acceptance discount window. interbank lend also guarantee encourage bank lend among themselves. the sum n620 billion inject eight bank direct rescue package, corporate governance enhance appointment new management teams. over all, say system restore path stability. 15. the second aspect reform couch term medium long term objectives. under this, financial sector stability emphasize alongside need position bank provide fund development real sector economy. the four cardinal pillar reform are: enhance quality banks, establish financial stability, enable healthy financial sector evolution, ensure financial sector contribute real economy, critical type growth translate improve welfare. 16. enhance quality bank entail initiation cbn five part programme enhance operation quality bank nigeria. this programme consist following: industry remedial programme fix key cause crisis; risk-based supervision; reform regulatory framework; enhance customer protection; internal transformation cbn. issue effective corporate governance, data quality, financial crime see increase attention. more so, consumer confidence also tackle reform programme complaint desk open ensure financial service deliver customer transparently fairly possible. 17. establish financial stability entail conscious action cbn, regulatory agency stem wide fluctuation key macroeconomic indicators. the high point pillar include, strengthen financial stability committee within cbn, establishment macro-prudential rules, development directional economic policy counter-cyclical fiscal policy government development capital market alternative bank funding. it hop new macro-prudential rule would leverage following:  limit capital market lend set proportion bank’s balance sheet;  prohibit bank use depositors’ fund proprietary trading, private equity venture capital investment;  adjust capital adequacy forward look capital requirement drive stress test cbn. 18. enable healthy financial sector evolution entail cbn review basic one-size-fits-all model banking. this make possible emergence international, national, regional, mono-line specialize bank non-interest banks, etc, different capital requirement commensurate depth operations. 19. the fourth pillar reform direct bear development real sector seek position bank system contribute growth development various sector economy. the spirit pillar anchor fact real economic growth must support actual rise physical good services. this segment reform seek break classical orthodoxy leave allocation financial resource market forces. rather, reform identify priority sector develop tailor intervention support promote growth sectors. some key intervention real sector reform pillar include: n200 billion commercial agricultural credit scheme (cacs); n300 billion power aviation intervention fund; n200 billion restructuring/refinancing manufacture sector/sme; n200 billion small medium scale enterprise guarantee scheme (smecgs). 20. the cacs establish cbn collaboration federal ministry agriculture. it fund issuance fgn bond worth n200 billion, bi central bankers’ speech 5 debt management office (dmo) two tranches. the first tranche n100 billion raise pass participate bank on-lending farmers. loan make scheme single digit interest rate subject maximum 9.0 per cent, cbn bear interest subsidy maturity. the scheme initially promote commercial agricultural enterprise late expand accommodate small scale farmer on-lending scheme state governments. the sum n96.81 billion disburse 104 project 11 bank 18 state government include federal capital territory, end december 2010. 21. under power aviation intervention fund, cbn make available sum n300 billion stimulate credit domestic power sector trouble airline industry. the amount part initial n500 billion intervention fund source catalyze finance real sector nigerian economy. the main objective initiative help finance badly need power project allow bank refinance loan heavily-indebted airline industry. the programme operate way borrower able access fund interest rate 7 percent payable quarterly basis include charge order refinance exist loan lease provide work capital two sectors. the fund manage bank industry (boi) africa finance corporation (afc) serf technical adviser fund. 22. a part effort towards unlock credit market ensure credit flow real sector economy, cbn make available n200 billion re-financing/re-structuring banks’ exist loan portfolio manufacture sector smes. the main objective fund fast-track development manufacture sector improve access credit manufacturer well improve financial position dmbs. the type facility fund include long term loan acquisition plant machinery, refinance exist loans, resuscitation ail industries, work capital refinance exist leases. the loan amount single obligor maximum n1 billion respect re-financing/re-structuring interest rate 7 per cent payable quarterly basis. all commercial bank development finance institution (excluding boi) enlist participate scheme. a end december 2010, n199.6 billion disburse 539 beneficiary across twelve different sector economy. 23. the n200 billion small medium scale enterprise guarantee scheme establish cbn 2010 aim promote access credit smes nigeria. the scheme provide guarantee loan bank sector order absorb risk element inhibit bank lend real sector. the activity cover scheme include manufacture agricultural value chains; smes, processing, package distribution primary products. the maximum amount guarantee n100 million form work capital, term loan refurbishment, equipment upgrade, expansion overdraft. the guarantee cover 80 per cent amount borrow valid maturity date loan, maximum tenor 5 years. 24. a new finance framework agriculture, nigerian incentive–based risk share system agricultural lend (nirsal) introduced. this model finance agriculture different many way current model yield desire impact make adequate credit available sector. nirsal demand drive credit facility rather current supply drive funding. it would adopt value chain approach lend bank would free choose part chain would interest lending. it would build capacity bank engage deliver loan provide technical assistance, reduce counterpart risk face bank innovative crop insurance products, reward performance agricultural lend would manage performance base incentives. nirsal would pool current resource cbn’s agricultural finance scheme investor fund transfer 6 bi central bankers’ speech different component programme. in words, exist agricultural finance insurance scheme would assessed, modify integrate nirsal. 25. all development initiative cbn underpin new engagement bank industry bankers’ committee adopt collaborative approach financial service lead national economic development transformation. the bankers’ committee identify 3 key sectors: power, transportation agriculture, critical development real economy, well change drive sector contribute economic development nigeria. we work identify initiative focus sector financial system support, determine requirement success include fund engage advocacy effect government policy changes. the bankers’ committee also support industry-wide capacity-building work development regulation legislation support lend three key sectors. 26. available data show macroeconomic environment improve considerably. inflation rate moderate low double digit prime lend rate go significantly. the exchange rate relatively stable. all impact growth real economy. 27. from recent experience discover preponderance toxic asset bank portfolio largely contribute liquidity challenge face banks. however, operation amcon start strengthen balance sheet deposit money banks. it important bank system learn strictly comply basel requirement operation order safeguard stability. therefore, bank manager must guide professionalism good corporate governance principle day day activity bank remain safe, sound competitive global market. 28. maintain safe sound bank sector essential, give key role bank play facilitate economic growth finance developmental projects, particularly key infrastructure, agriculture industry. most emerge market economy know use domestic financial institution execute real sector big ticket project financial institution nigeria exception hope achieve developmental objectives. therefore, bank globally competitive, current reform bank sustain strengthened. 29. finally, lady gentlemen, school think question rationale central bank pursue call multiple objectives. let emphasize fact develop economy need strong growth, typically central bank’s objective include developmental role addition core mandate ensure price stability. indeed, global financial crisis, central bank subordinate price stability objective achieve financial stability initiate growth. 30. despite unusual monetary policy environment, cbn recently pursue objective financial stability initiate growth, critical eye price developments. the point focus price stability inconsistent financial stability economic growth objective cannot economic growth without price stability. thus, expectation effective implementation recent initiative would help promote small medium enterprises, bring necessary improvement power sector, increase agriculture output, create employment reduce poverty well put nigeria path meet target millennium development goal (mdgs). i thank attention. bi central bankers’ speech 1 benny popoitai: the national informal economy policy speech mr benny popoitai, act governor bank papua new guinea, launch national informal economy policy, port moresby, 24 february 2011.

member executive board european central bank, investmentforum 2011, salzburg, 21 march 2011. * * * lady gentlemen, i would like thank invite event. it austrian economist joseph schumpeter state “a nation’s monetary system reflection everything nation wants, suffer is. … nothing say nation make clearly term monetary policy.” in light this, i would like explore way single currency single monetary policy contribute significantly growth stability economies. over last 12 years, euro successful bring inflation; also serve defensive buff crisis. nevertheless, i would also like talk fact effort require safeguard success euro. effort required, particularly part governments, devise economic fiscal frameworks, essence single currency. however, effort also necessary part financial market participant supervisors, give maintenance financial market stability crucial prerequisite monetary macroeconomic stability. when first launch 1999 euro cash changeover take place 2002, euro meet certain degree criticism scepticism. today, euro single currency 17 countries, total population 330 million citizens. the euro prove resound success. give average rate inflation euro area first 12 year currency’s existence stand 2% (show chart), euro stable deutschmark austrian schilling earlier. and case despite test time monetary policy experience late – evidence recent financial crisis early turmoil oil commodity price (for example, oil price reach peak usd 145 per barrel). even international standards, euro fare well. indeed, regional difference within euro area term rate inflation growth le comparable regional difference observe unite states. furthermore, euro establish second international reserve currency behind u dollar, investor trust euro invest euro-denominated financial products. i would like take opportunity to:  provide insight current current economic situation;  explain single currency contribute towards management financial market crisis;  offer overview financial market reform european union;  outline still do guarantee stability euro long-term horizon. assessment economic situation euro area allow first explain ecb’s current assessment economic outlook monetary policy perspective. a regard economic situation euro area, bi central bankers’ speech 1 number positive signals. the economy follow upward trajectory (show chart). since trough second quarter 2009, economy make close half recession-induced production losses. the relatively low rate growth observe line experience economy recover severe financial crises. a peculiarity current recovery comparison previous upturn relatively low contribution growth stem consumer spending. however, area to, positive signals. a regard private households, labour market situation stabilising, boost consumers’ purchase power and, extension, domestic demand. the impact crisis weigh strongly number hour work number employed. that rebound economic activity also make felt number hour work rate unemployment, although latter hover around 10%. in near future, available forecast indicate gradual recovery economic activity euro area likely continue. accord recent projection ecb staff (table), real economic growth rate expect stand 1.3% 2.1% year 0.8% 2.8% next year. at time, outlook growth area export domestic demand predict improve. overall, recent economic data confirm underlie momentum economic growth euro area favourable. however, regard economic activity medium-term risk price stability, surge oil price increase cause concern (show chart). in light heighten geopolitical uncertainties, price per barrel lead north sea oil, brent crude, ratchet upwards around 25% since begin year, peak close usd 117. rise oil price already clearly visible effect rate inflation euro area. this stand 2.4% february year hover markedly 2% come month back persistently elevate oil prices. our assessment risk medium-term price development tilt upside. in recent projection euro area, ecb staff see inflation range 2% 2.6% year 1% 2.4% next year. it must stressed, however, projection take account recent oil price hike base assumption wage pressure remain subdued. the question also remain unanswered whether indirect tax administer price stem necessary fiscal consolidation measure next year rise sharply currently anticipated. against background, strong vigilance is, course, necessary monitor situation closely. should sign inflationary risk medium term, ecb ready determine take appropriate action good time. in summary assessment current situation, safe assume cyclical recovery way stand sound foundations. the oil price-indiced increase inflation monitor closely. the fact view overall economic situation actually rather favourable, lady gentlemen, due least stability euro, monetary policy stance orient stability decisive action undertake financial crisis stabilise bank sector. let explain somewhat great detail. the financial crisis test strength euro the financial crisis put euro economy euro area well truly test. during financial crisis, govern council ecb prove capacity take necessary step timely manner readiness contribute positively financial stability. the speedy intervention ecb make possible prevent liquidity confidence crisis spiral systemic crisis. the ecb respond immediately – early 2 bi central bankers’ speech 9 august 2007 – tension suddenly emerge money markets. ever since, eurosystem bolster stability interbank market extensive liquidity provision. within space seven months, ecb low key interest rate 325 basis point 1% (show chart). in order provide support finance condition provision liquidity bank system, eurosystem implement string temporary non-standard measure past two half years. the financial crisis soon make evident monetary policy able achieve goal also economic financial policy national level live responsibilities. a large number government adopt sizeable measure strengthen capital base in, guarantee for, financial sector, well economic stabilisation measure curb real economic downturn. together stabilisation package put place governments, non-standard measure ecb stabilise effect financial sector economic activity euro area. the concert effort contribute financial stability economic recovery euro area. in recent months, situation money market euro area improve further. on whole, bank request significantly le liquidity before. since last summer, ongoing process normalisation observe interest rate spread interbank money market (eonia), le return level prevail onset financial crisis august 2007. these development indicative increase trust among bank euro area – development due largely decisive action undertake ecb. look important money market (such unite state unite kingdom), see there, too, interest rate spread narrow similar rate. their central bank likewise intervene form interest rate cut extensive non-standard measures. the government stabilisation measure come price, however. in particular, financial crisis put public finance pressure – euro area country indeed advance economies. this phenomenon clearly manifest surge public deficit government debt ratio (show chart). a result financial crisis, budget deficit industrialise countries, unite kingdom, unite state japan, even reach double-digit levels. accord autumn 2010 economic forecast european commission, public deficit euro area stand 6.3% gdp last year, decline 4.6% gdp project year. these figure far exceed 3% ceiling lay stability growth pact. the deterioration public finance number euro area member state impact negatively investors’ confidence government bond issue countries, thus turbulence financial markets. this also reflect sharp increase cost provision loss government bond number euro area countries. the additional distortion give rise instability financial system, also impact ecb’s monetary policy action. allow take close look two aspects: first need stable financial system second relate safeguard stability euro way stability-oriented economic fiscal policies. financial market reform european union the financial crisis highlight turbulence financial market massive impact economic growth. the crisis, originate market complex financial instruments, rapidly evolve crisis encompass large part financial sector. this result decline lend household enterprises, well drop 4% euro area growth 2009. bi central bankers’ speech 3 although cause financial crisis multifaceted complex, far-reaching reform lead improve regulatory framework for, good supervision of, financial market essential order avoid recurrence adverse development future. there general consensus necessity improve regulatory framework supervision. the g20 country quick strive reforms, since elaborate basel committee bank supervision financial stability board (fsb). all all, progress already make area reform financial market regulation, notable advance agreement reach basel committee, i.e. “basel iii”. the accord call strong reinforcement current capital requirement liquidity reserve financial institutions. even relation previously unregulated less regulate financial institutions, investment fund rat agencies, tentative step take improve transparency. bank operate internationally, financial flow become global character. regulatory supervisory measures, contrast, largely take coordinate national level fail take development consideration adequate extent. that reform field financial market supervision much appreciated. the head state government agree new structure financial supervision european union (eu), view good prevent future financial market disruptions. this three newly establish european supervisory authority banks, insurance company financial market become operational begin 2011 design enhance micro-prudential supervision. however, financial crisis remind u fact bank operate international scale, also teach u that, give close financial interlinkages, disruptive development within individual credit institution may for-reaching consequence financial system whole. risk financial system whole emanate individual institutions, also specific component financial market financial instrument used. the identification surveillance systemic implication matter public interest. in europe, mind european systemic risk board (esrb) establish mandate conduct macro-prudential supervision within eu. headquarter frankfurt main, esrb expect help ensure good able deal systemic risk future, particular give political decision-makers early warn systemic risks. much thus achieve respect reform financial market regulation supervision since onset financial crisis. but effort undertake respect thus far need continued. let mention three aspect i regard particularly important: first, regulatory net need cast wide wider. the crisis reveal significance systemic risks. if good counter risk systemic nature, systemically relevant financial institutions, market infrastructure must regulate treat exactly way. this hold particularly true event stringent regulatory requirement impose traditional bank sector. where systemically relevant financial institution concerned, also essential continue investigate whether additional regulatory provision need institution might contribute cost deal crisis. second, great transparency require regard over-the-counter trade activity non-banking sector. great transparency would possible financial product trade central trade platforms, stock exchanges, settle clear houses. give grow importance, particularly crucial clear house appropriate risk management scheme place. furthermore, activity non-4 bi central bankers’ speech bank must become transparent. this also include improve quality plausibility risk assessment rat agencies. and third, bank must encourage undertake reform accept responsibility, particular, review individual corporate governance model regard risk assessment, incentive structure compensation. safeguard future stability euro lady gentlemen, allow turn second aspect key importance stability euro, stability-oriented economic fiscal policies. in order counter potential systemic implication government debt situation number euro area country decisive timely manner, head state government eu agree establishment permanent european stability mechanism (esm) safeguard fiscal stability whole euro. this mechanism supersede european financial stability facility (efsf), remain temporarily place june 2013. the esm activate financial stability euro area whole jeopardy. member country financial distress receive financial assistance form credit, subject fulfilment strict conditions. i regard decision important contribution keep financial system stable, thus safeguard stability euro. nevertheless, existence mechanism see inducement postpone correction stance economic policy long trust help euro area countries. in order prevent happening, essential permanent stabilisation mechanism underpin fundamental strengthen regulatory framework compliance fiscal policy objective need competitiveness. it thus crucial framework monitor public budget economic activity euro area reform effective manner. the van rompuy task force european commission put forward proposal improvement make two areas. the proposal recommend strengthen stability growth pact. in particular, suggest possible sanction member country excessive deficit impose sooner currently foreseen. next year, enhance macroeconomic surveillance framework applicable euro area also implemented. this comprise introduction early warn mechanism base scoreboard predefined macroeconomic indicators. at time, european commission assume responsibility use indicator order identify potential macroeconomic imbalance excesses, report thereon political authorities. the ecb opinion current reform effort area sufficiently extensive. in fact, govern council ecb consider proposal table european commission may indeed go way towards improve macroeconomic fiscal surveillance euro area, fall short quantum leap forward need surveillance euro area order guarantee smooth function economic monetary union. a regard fiscal surveillance, great automaticity procedure definition clear bind regulation reduce debt ratio required. in term macroeconomic surveillance, clearly define sanction necessary. effort must focus clearly vulnerable country (those suffer loss competitiveness), order ensure sustainable effectiveness late framework. moreover, procedure require transparent effective trigger mechanisms. in future, stability euro, stability financial system sound economic financial policy need view inseparable one another. the monetary union design economic monetary union. what need also second pillar. bi central bankers’ speech 5 the ecb do pursue stability-oriented monetary policy, keep value money stable provide crisis-related liquidity needs. the policy domain mention call upon shoulder part burden safeguard stability financial system single currency long term. a single market common currency also demand well-coordinated economic fiscal policies. this call clear rule mechanism monitor policies. allow briefly discus three key area i consider vital long-term success euro. these element are: sound fiscal policy, sustainable economic growth stable financial system. 1. sound fiscal policy the soundness public finance guarantee stability growth pact. unfortunately, however, rule pact ignore often – even prior financial crisis. for reason, imperative that, first, fiscal consolidation effort european level comply rule stability growth pact. second, foundation stability growth pact need reinforcement. 2. sustainable economic growth stable price precondition sustainable growth generation employment. equally important competitiveness euro area member counties. in euro area countries, excessive increase unit labour cost current account imbalance cause competitiveness decline significantly past years. this mean country position unable respond crisis degree flexibility required, result weaken economic productivity growth surge unemployment. to combat this, economic reform foster growth employment sustainable basis essential. such reform direct increase competitiveness. to end, flexible labour product market required, well long-term project enhance infrastructure competitiveness and, all, promotion innovation investment train research. 3. a stable financial system the financial crisis illustrate significance systemic risks. it make clear procedure place assess threat – stem proliferation individual, mutually reinforcing, risk relevance stability financial system real economy whole – inadequate. the government central bank contribute stabilise financial system. it last stabilisation, however, call institutional reform lead good regulation supervision. in addition, essential consideration give question private sector might able good protect consequence financial crisis, order create strong incentive risk awareness longer-term perspective economic activity undertake financial sector. lady gentlemen, past 12 years, euro contribute significantly europe’s economic sustainability stability. if succeed implement necessary reform decisive manner, ecb able guarantee long-term stability euro. i confident success story euro endure, benefit eu citizens. 6 bi central bankers’ speech bi central bankers’ speech 7 8 bi central bankers’ speech bi central bankers’ speech 9 10 bi central bankers’ speech gertrude tumpel-gugerell: protocol bring national bank serbia line eu central bank standard introductory statement m gertrude tumpel-gugerell, member executive board european central bank, press conference occasion sign protocol european central bank, national bank serbia delegation european union republic serbia, belgrade, 18 march 2011. * * * mr šoškić, governor national bank serbia, mr degert, ambassador head delegation european union republic serbia, lady gentlemen, i happy back belgrade. like last time, i announce start close cooperation programme ecb, national central bank eu national bank serbia. this programme, fact already way since 1 february 2011, fund eu. much happen since i last belgrade 1 september 2008. at end previous cooperation programme, deliver need analysis report governor, radovan jelašić. since experience major financial crisis affect eu republic serbia. i would like reflect two point introductory remarks. the need analysis report complete may 2009 make number recommendation advancement national bank serbia technical domain amendment would require serbian legislation. such change necessary serbia receive acknowledgement prepare join european union national bank serbia reach level would commensurate ready join european system central banks. the ecb cooperate 17 national central bank prepare need analysis report national bank serbia. today proud announce 21 national central bank board. we elaborate detail plan intend when, how, next two years, different component programme. we believe large group partner work ecb benefit programme national bank serbia. in need analysis report two year ago look six area central bank national bank serbia. a part current programme, see joint press release, cover diverse range topic span 11 area national bank serbia’s competencies. in 2008 2009 much work involve prepare need analysis report hand eu central bank experts. they propose benchmark national bank serbia measure assess readiness join escb. they responsible deliver assessment recommendation area could improved. the new project start offer train session staff bank support preparation new draft legislation well internal rule procedure policy bring bank line eu central bank standard work methods. governor šoškić team commit prepare large number programme outcome deliverables, part, eu support serbian colleague reach target set themselves. today i formally confirm support commitment behalf eu bi central bankers’ speech 1 central bank sign relevant protocol alongside governor šoškić ambassador degert. let briefly turn second element change last three year i highlight moment ago. the financial crisis grip world since october 2008 challenge eu well serbia. there many lesson learn crisis. in view time available, i would like focus two them. one importance good public finance role central bank help safeguard financial stability. in eu, stability growth pact always see key component process ensure sound public finance fiscal policy remain national competence advance towards federation and/or harmonise fiscal policies. very much ecb’s regret, reform stability growth pact 2005 weaken fiscal framework substantially. the great flexibility create lead lack enforcement fiscal discipline eu level insufficient national incentive comply eu rules. draw lesson current crisis euro area particular, ecb advocate quantum leap term economic governance: good coordination countries, clear rule economic policy conduct, quasi-automaticity implementation sanction non-compliance. i would like underline important country like serbia, advance emerge economy, pursue sound fiscal policies. a open economy face balance payment challenges, crucial serbia pursue stability-oriented macroeconomic policy bring international recognition put country position finance domestic external deficit temporarily, turn would smooth development process. another lesson draw crisis eu need review reinforce structure micro macro-prudential supervision. the result establishment three pan-european supervisory authority give power promote eu interest secure financial stability day-to-day supervisory power remain member state level. on macro-prudential side, ecb ask take challenge new obligation arise establishment european systemic risk board (esrb). the ecb provide chair esrb secretariat. while ecb many year raise voice financial stability concern risk euro area, new esrb must work eu-wide perspective assume additional role issue warn recommendations. the authority responsible financial stability either need comply recommendation explain wish so. we consider useful way forward absence radical step transfer competency national european level. from point view individual country, include serbia, i would also stress important financial stability mandate clearly allocate central bank play important contributory role context. we draw number conclusion financial crisis europe – include central bank level. we draw inspiration firm intention perform task good way avoid repetition last couple years. the implication that, extent, best practice central bank eu move target, since consider duty remain always forefront development help u achieve objective best way possible. from perspective, today’s event see mark continuation already strong partnership national bank serbia large number national central bank european union. it hopefully also highlight partnership continue many years, even successfully conclude current programme end january 2013. 2 bi central bankers’ speech bi central bankers’ speech 3 the ecb coordinate programme frankfurt main dispatch resident programme coordinator remain belgrade completed. the national central bank identify respective expert supervision, foreign exchange reserve management payment systems, give examples. the national bank serbia also make strong commitments, assign substantive resource programme coordination. i wish expert manager involve success achieve ambitious target two-year central bank cooperation programme. many thank good luck all. bi central bankers’ speech 1 svante öberg: my view monetary policy 2006–2011 speech mr svante öberg, first deputy governor sverige riksbank, handelsbanken, stockholm, 18 march 2011. * * * i riksbank five year appointment deputy governor riksbank expire turn year. i celebrate 65th birthday i inform general council riksbank i seek reappointment. this make natural look back conduct monetary policy last five year and, light experience, discus direction monetary policy year ahead. the three thesis i argue speech are:  monetary policy expansionary financial crisis  monetary policy work well crisis  the repo rate need raise every meet year (and perhaps next year too) monetary policy expansionary year financial crisis my first thesis thus monetary policy expansionary year full force financial crisis hit world september 2008. this apply sweden abroad. i present argument support thesis section. abroad monetary policy expansionary year financial crisis unite state euro area. the short-term real interest rate, short-term nominal interest rate minus inflation, commonly use describe expansionary monetary policy is. this assume average approximately 2 per cent long term. in unite states, real interest rate negative period 2003–2005, euro area approximately 0 per cent period (see figure 1). at time, china country currency tie u dollar, result expansionary monetary condition country too. large current account surplus china oil-producing country lead capital flow unite state euro area also keep long-term interest rates. the consequence expansionary monetary policy become apparent development economy. inflation unite state 2 per cent measure use various measure core inflation, resource utilisation high normal rapid expansion credit. from mid-1990s 2006, real house price increase unusually rapidly, approximately 80 per cent, relatively stable early 1950s mid-1990s (see figure 2). house price increase dramatically part europe too, example ireland spain, remain largely stable countries, example germany. however, euro area whole increase price large unite states. the expansionary monetary policy contribute high level growth world period 2004–2007. gdp growth 4.5 5 per cent per year. such long period rapid growth around world occur since early 1970s (see figure 3). 2 bi central bankers’ speech the high level global growth lead turn substantial increase price oil 2004 2008 rise inflation many country towards end period. the similarity year precede oil-price shock 1970 striking. in year too, monetary policy expansionary, gdp growth high oil price increasing. the price crude oil increase rapidly 1973 1979, lead high inflation (see figure 4). it was, however, expansionary monetary policy cause credit expansion house price bubble unite states. there number causes, example new financial product spread risk bank investor understand risks. the aim house policy unite state also long increase home ownership provide support semi-nationalised mortgage company fannie mae freddie mac. there also several problems, example fact regulation supervision financial market weak. in europe, common currency introduce 1999. this mean interest rate several country previously high interest rate germany reduce common euro level. in countries, contribute dramatic expansion credit, rapid growth high level inflation. in addition, regulation supervision financial market national processes, despite fact operation concern crossborder. however, become apparent situation untenable spring 2010 connection crisis public finance europe. each country certainly believe good reason conduct particular choice monetary policy. but world whole, close economy overall monetary policy affect growth inflation, monetary policy become expansionary. this result strong gdp growth rapidly increase price crude oil commodities, well rapid credit expansion rise asset prices, house certain regions. this ultimately lead financial crisis housing-price bubble burst. now, may say rather pointless criticise something hindsight. it easy say do then. however, point criticise do learn history. even today, see pattern: expansionary monetary policy world whole, strong growth rise energy commodity prices. sweden my view, hindsight, monetary policy sweden also expansionary year precede financial crisis. the repo rate gradually reduce 1.5 per cent july 2005. i think reduce much low long. both nominal real short-term rate low normal period lead crisis. in opinion, normal level nominal short-term rate around 4 per cent, normal level real short-term rate around 2 per cent1 (see figure 5). swedish economic growth high year crisis. resource utilisation also high normal. the gdp gap positive, unemployment low average precede years. inflation nevertheless low period 2004–2006. measure term cpif2 term measure use time, cpix,3 1 sverige riksbank, “what normal repo rate?”, article monetary policy report, february 2010. 2 the cpif calculate cpi fix mortgage rate thus directly affect change mortgage rates. 3 the cpix exclude households’ mortgage interest expenditure direct effect change indirect tax subsidy cpi. bi central bankers’ speech 3 well 2 per cent. in evaluation swedish monetary policy period 1995–2005, giavazzi mishkin say sign monetary policy tight begin 2002.4 i agree them. look back event, perhaps say couple repo rate increase 2001 2002 could avoided. the previous governor riksbank, lars heikensten, also admit hear riksdag committee finance 1 april 2004. but view repo rate reduce much low long. i see four factor support this. first, resource utilisation probably high riksbank estimated. the gdp gap difficult calculate, particularly end time series connection severe downturns. accord two gdp gap present monetary policy report february, gdp gap prior crisis approximately +4 per cent. my assessment gdp gap fact approximately +2 per cent.5 however, fact resource utilisation high apparent crisis. this seen, example, compare calculation gdp gap real time, point time concerned, recent calculations. the calculation real time show gdp gap actually assess relatively normal crisis (see figure 6). second, inflation gradually increase 2007 2008 4 per cent. inflation increase rapidly even effect rise mortgage rate discounted. this largely due rise energy food prices. these price rises, i mention earlier, root expansionary monetary policy high level growth world whole. the impact monetary policy come considerable time lag rate inflation see year affect monetary policy previous year (see figure 7). third, inflation expectation also increased. the fact inflation expectation one year ahead increase natural give measure inflation rate also increased. however, inflation expectation five year ahead interpret indication whether monetary policy credible not. a long expectation close inflation target, sign respondent expect riksbank attain target long term. the fact long-term inflation expectation increase 2.5 per cent therefore worry (see figure 8). fourth, rapid expansion credit rapid increase house prices. lend non-financial company household increase 10–15 per year year precede crisis house price increase around 10 per cent per year. the price tenant-owned apartment increase even rapidly. this trend begin already mid-1990s, accelerate year precede crisis6 (see figure 9). 4 giavazzi, francesco mishkin, frederic: an evaluation swedish monetary policy 1995 2005, riksdag committee finance, november 2006. 5 see example svante öberg: potential gdp, resource utilisation monetary policy, sverige riksbank, 7 october 2010. 6 giavazzi mishkin (op. cit.) say one reason inflation low period 2002–2004 riksbank, since 2002, begin take house price account. however, late paper mishkin write one lesson crisis strong reason monetary policy counteract credit-driven asset price bubbles, see example mishkin, frederic: monetary policy strategy: lesson crisis, october 2010. 4 bi central bankers’ speech a comparison simple taylor rule7 also indicate repo rate significantly higher. a taylor rule indicate whether level repo reasonable. base inflation measure term cpif hicp8 gdp gap i present earlier, repo rate, accord taylor rule, around 7 per cent third quarter 2008. i believe, i say earlier, present positive gdp gap exaggerated. with assessment gdp gap, repo rate accord taylor rule would instead around 6 per cent third quarter 2008, still considerably high 4.75 per cent reach crisis (see figure 10). when i look back monetary policy conduct since i join riksbank 1 january 2006 point financial crisis hit sweden september 2008, i therefore believe monetary policy expansionary year precede crisis. inflation increase reach level tangibly high inflation target, resource utilisation high normal rapid expansion credit. despite this, repo rate low normal period lead crisis. a rapid increase repo rate would thus better. there also two circumstance i part believe unfortunate. the first i enter reservation april 2006 executive board decide increase repo rate, i regret afterwards. this would make difference actual development interest rates, would good idea make view clear already time. i subsequently enter reservation favour increase repo rate several time 2007 majority executive board decide increase it.9 the second thing i accept low repo-rate path first time present path february 2007. this completion wage negotiation large part labour market send wrong signal social partners; wage could significantly increase without consequence form high inflation. wage expectation rise high level since mid-1990s. but focus work require produce decide repo-rate path first time adequately realise consequence decision. when visit different venue speak monetary policy, i often ask raise repo rate 4.50 4.75 per cent september 2008, financial crisis hit sweden full force. the member executive board divide issue, three (including me) three stefan ingves use decide vote push decision through. i usually say information time i would make decision again. i fear face period stagflation; high inflation low growth, similar period follow oil-price increase 1970s. in situation must, term mandate, give priority keep inflation close inflation target. however, financial crisis radically change precondition monetary policy. 7 taylor, j.b., (1993). discretion versus policy rule practice. carnegie-rochester conference series public policy 39 (1993) 195–214. amsterdam: north-holland. the taylor rule follow simple form describe monetary policy conduct unite state period 1987–1992 well: r = p + 0.5y + 0.5(p-2) + 2 r = policy rate, p = inflation last 12 month per cent = gdp gap per cent. in formula, assume inflation target 2 per cent real policy rate long term 2 per cent. 8 the hicp harmonize index consumer price that, among things, use eu comparison member states. mortgage rate exclude calculate hicp. 9 minute monetary policy meet hold 29 march 2007, 3 may 2007 18 december 2007. bi central bankers’ speech 5 monetary policy work well financial crisis my second thesis monetary policy work well financial crisis. i explain why. but first i would like describe briefly characterise crisis. the characteristic financial crisis i experience two crisis past, one late 1970s early 1980s one begin 1990s, see mainly perspective ministry finance. when i come riksbank i believe bad crisis behind us. however, case. instead experience third crisis, international term severe crisis since world war ii. the financial crisis hit sweden rest europe full force september 2008, major u investment bank lehman brother file bankruptcy. it become much difficult bank fund operation financial market function normally. some market function all. the central bank take role lender last resort several government provide guarantee support programme bank sector. monetary policy also quickly become expansionary unite states, euro area countries. in addition, number central bank adopt measure also push longer-term interest rates. there also shift towards expansionary fiscal policy. despite extensive policy stimulus, financial crisis lead severe downturn unite state europe develop country part world. experience previous financial crisis show usually follow long period weak growth, high unemployment seriously weaken public finances.10 gdp fell unite state euro area 2009 unemployment increased. inflation fell rapidly, mainly early increase price energy food turn price decreases. however, part world affect crisis great extent. country china india continue enjoy high rate growth. the financial crisis mainly affect sweden fall international demand swedish exports. gdp fell 5.9 per cent 2007 2009, increase 5.5 per cent 2010. already year downturn bottom out, production return le level crisis. but gdp still far level postulate trend increase without crisis would lead (see figure 11). unemployment peak almost 9 per cent turn year 2009/2010. the increase unemployment much le predict riksbank’s early forecast much le indicate normal okun link gdp growth unemployment.11 this probably crisis primarily affect industrial sector substantial effect gdp small effect employment, activity part economy keep expansionary monetary fiscal policy (see figure 12). cpi inflation fluctuate considerably recent years, mainly repo rate cut rapidly connection crisis. cpif inflation, exclude effect inflation, fluctuate much le also adjust energy food inflation close long-term target cpi 2 per cent (see figure 13). 10 reinhart, carmen rogoff, kenneth: “this time different: a panoramic view eight century financial crises”, 2008. 11 sverige riksbank, “the effect financial crisis labour market – comparison sweden, euro area unite states”, article monetary policy report, february 2011. 6 bi central bankers’ speech the riksbank’s measure crisis my second thesis thus monetary policy work well crisis. but riksbank’s effort concern monetary policy, relate even great degree measure preserve financial stability. the experience gain financial crisis tell u measure preserve financial stability monetary policy measure must cooperate counteract negative consequence crisis always easy relate one type measure certain problem type another. the reason i think riksbank able handle crisis well measure take quickly forceful help preserve financial stability keep domestic demand. they also implement limit period time thus become part permanent support system. the riksbank thus react quickly problem arose. of course, swedish bank expose u house market great extent. but dependent market function order get funding. in order cover loss normal fund channels, riksbank provide loan approximately sek 500 billion autumn 2008.12 this increase riksbank’s balance sheet total approximately 7 per cent approximately 22 per cent gdp, balance sheet federal reserve (fed) european central bank (ecb) relation gdp. around half lend kronor half dollars. in order able lend much dollars, riksbank borrow dollar feed rapidly-concluded swap agreement. the riksbank’s dollar asset far small. in autumn 2008, foreign currency reserve correspond sek 200 billion invest number different currencies. in 2009, reserve strengthen borrow approximately sek 100 billion via swedish national debt office (see figure 14). monetary policy also react quickly forcefully. the repo rate cut rapidly 4.75 per cent september 2008 0.25 per cent july 2009. the large cut come already december 2008. the repo rate never low before. in july 2009, riksbank also assess repo rate would remain exceptionally low level next 12 month so. this express repo-rate path time. in order, underline assessment repo rate would remain low level throughout follow year, keep longer-term interest rate too, riksbank, three different occasions, provide loan total almost sek 300 billion fix interest rate 0.25 per cent one year (see figure 15). in july 2010, riksbank begin normalise monetary policy. the repo rate raise 0.25 per cent 0.5 per cent subsequently raise another four time 1.50 per cent february 2011. the large loan repay bank without replace new, similar loans. the riksbank’s balance sheet total thus fell approximately 10 per cent gdp. this contrast balance sheet total several central banks, continue increase. it possible carry reduction riksbank’s balance sheet without give rise significant problem financial markets. this riksbank lend money bank not, like fed, ecb bank england, purchase bond asset crisis.13 if riksbank do so, could lead serious problem time come phase support measures. it course difficult estimate effect measure take riksbank connection crisis many thing also impact course events, least fiscal policy measure take authority preserve 12 the riksbank also extend type collateral could approve loan provide liquidity assistance two small banks, kaupthing carnegie. 13 by lend money, riksbank also avoid exposure substantial interest rate risk. bi central bankers’ speech 7 financial stability. nevertheless, note swedish bank come crisis well. total lend household non-financial company continue increase throughout crisis. it also note fall production employment le feared. domestic demand keep expansionary fiscal monetary policies. conclusion with hindsight, i think draw two conclusion action take riksbank connection financial crisis. first, see crisis coming. of course, many observer saw crisis come either. however, draw attention problem house mortgage market unite states, financial stability report mention problem relate swedish banks’ credit expansion baltic countries. but new feature financial crisis bank unable fund operation market something prepare for.14 second, riksbank react quickly forcefully crisis hit sweden. the riksbank’s extensive lend bank rapid reduction repo rate exceptionally low level soften impact crisis swedish economy. together expansionary fiscal policy keep level domestic demand mean employment decrease le unemployment increase le could expected, inflation keep reasonable level. underlie inflation keep close 2 per cent inflation expectation five year ahead, increase crisis, fell back stabilise around 2 per cent. monetary policy need become le expansionary period ahead my third thesis repo rate need raise every meet year, perhaps next year too. i explain i make assessment. i begin brief description international development next year present view swedish monetary policy period ahead. abroad there many similarity situation autumn 2008 spring 2011. for world whole expect see gdp growth 4 per cent per year, although considerable difference different regions. growth continue unite state europe although, due financial crisis, slow rate normal downturn. we expect see gdp growth around 3 per cent per year unite state 2 per cent per year euro area, inflation rate almost 2 per cent areas. but emerge economy grow rapidly (see figure 16). the strong increase demand emerge economy push demand energy commodities. there therefore substantial increase crude oil price price commodity recently. there risk price continue rise inflation therefore also rise emerge market develop countries. inflation expectation also increase recent month upward shift monetary policy expectation (see figure 4). 14 report swedish national audit office 2011, “measures take authority safeguard financial stability: lesson light development baltic country 2005–2007”. 8 bi central bankers’ speech recent development north africa middle east push price crude oil even further. uncertainty future supply oil contribute oil price high monetary policy report publish february. this illustrate fact price trend become even sensitive supply disruption demand high relation supply. the earthquake japan great catastrophe country suffer since world war ii. the consequence japanese people devastate material damage huge. it still early determine economic consequence earthquake be. in short term already lead production losses, late year production may rise connection reconstruction work follow disaster. the fact nuclear power station operation already lead disruption supply electricity production, long term reduction capacity generate electricity use nuclear power japan country may lead rise price type energy, include oil. a always, monitor development carefully connection monetary policy update april make renew assessment international outlook also take account event japan may affect development global economy slightly long term. sweden at late monetary policy meet february, decide raise repo rate 1.25 per cent 1.50 per cent assessment repo rate would need increase 3.6 per cent end forecast period, three years’ time. my assessment need raise repo rate 0.25 per cent every meet 2011 2.75 per cent end year. this entail somewhat steep upward path second half 2011 repo-rate path present main scenario monetary policy report. however, light uncertainty development interest rates, i enter reservation repo-rate path confine comment meet (see figure 17). i discus view monetary policy year ahead little detail take picture economic outlook present late monetary policy report start point. the discussion base analytical framework so-called loss function use norge bank.15 this include deviation inflation inflation target, resource utilisation, interest rate level accordance simple interest-rate rule change interest rate. asset prices, exchange rate market rate also take account. inflation the forecast inflation sufficiently close inflation target justify repo rate increase present repo-rate path. the forecast cpi inflation 2.4 per cent per year average forecast period, forecast cpif inflation 1.8 per cent. it estimate cpif inflation around 2 per cent end forecast period. however, considerable uncertainty concern forecast inflation relation deviation target may regard small (see figure 18). my assessment is, however, inflationary risk primarily upside; word risk high rate inflation expect great risk low rate inflation. if inflation increase expect monetary policy report, is, view, likely repo rate need raise quickly predict repo-rate path. in case quite possible need raise 15 monetary policy report 1, 2011, page 17–19, norge bank. bi central bankers’ speech 9 0.25 percentage point one meet need increase 4 per cent already next year. resource utilisation in overall assessment, resource utilisation le normal present present forecast high normal rise towards end forecast period. this also indicate need high repo-rate path present path. the riksbank us several different measure resource utilisation. accord measures, gdp gap, example, approximately –1 per cent first quarter 2011. my assessment little high this, le zero. the level indicate so-called ru indicator also support claim resource utilisation largely normal. the ru indicator, develop riksbank weigh together large number indicator form summary measure resource utilisation, reach normal level already fourth quarter 2010. several measure also indicate resource utilisation normal (see figure 19). unemployment, hand, still high normal. unemployment vary 6 8 per cent around average 7 per cent ten year precede financial crisis.16 if current rate fall unemployment continues, reach normal level autumn 2011. although, assessment monetary policy report take place quickly, remember riksbank others underestimate strengthen labour market recent year (see figure 20). monetary policy must also take account development economy affect wage formation. monetary policy must resist temptation stimulate production employment short term level compatible stable development wage inflation. a rapid improvement labour market may lead problem wage negotiation begin autumn. wage formation work well last 15 year help keep inflation low stable level. it would unfortunate wage negotiation conduct situation overheat labour market. in current situation, shortage labour probably good measure strain labour market unemployment. the shortage labour business sector back almost normal level fourth quarter 2010. in several part business sector, however, shortage great normal, example manufacture industry construction industry, several type labour, example technical white-collar worker industrial sector computer consultant (see figure 21). the fact shortage labour already high even though unemployment still high normal indicate match labour market deteriorated. this also indicate beverage curve, show relation unemployment vacancies. this shift outwards, certain level vacancy compatible high rate unemployment. in part, may cyclical phenomenon, change large may also relate structural deterioration (see figure 22). 16 one difficulty present ass whether normal rate unemployment change due financial crisis economic policy. in connection severe downturn, sustainable rate unemployment (nairu) usually increases, least initially. but nairu probably also affect labour-market reform implement recent years. some reform probably reduce nairu others may increase it. it remain see net result factor be. 10 bi central bankers’ speech repo rate level i also believe take level repo rate account decide monetary policy. particularly strong reason require set repo rate long period time considerably low regard long-term average. monetary policy sometimes use stimulate economy sometimes use tighten economy, permanently stimulate economy mean low interest rate. long period low interest rate namely lead financial imbalances. they can, example, lead rapid expansion credit long term may lead household unable afford meet interest amortization payment mortgages. the households’ interest rate expectation retrospective long-term expectation reduce low interest rate prevail number years. problem arise interest rate rise. but household mortgages. a i say first part speech, too-expansionary monetary policy also contribute kind financial imbalances. i therefore usually also look taylor rule mention would entail repo rate level. the taylor rule indicates, i say earlier, repo rate high actually crisis, i think reasonable. the taylor rule also indicate repo rate reduce le quickly much actually crisis hit. if instead we, member executive board, follow result simulation riksbank’s model ram crisis hit, repo rate would reduce slowly. apply current situation sweden, taylor rule would give repo rate 3 4 per cent. this indicate repo-rate path even high is. repo rate change even though thus factor current forecast indicate repo rate increase rapidly, i believe value change repo rate steady pace small steps. unexpected, substantial change may entail cost household company could cause instability financial markets. this also reason 2006 2007 riksbank period repo rate increases. i enter reservation every meet 2007 majority want increase repo rate 0.25 percentage points. the important thing therefore repo rate continue raise small step meet meeting. my assessment late monetary policy meet need raise 0.25 percentage point every meet year reach 2.75 per cent end year. however, difficult ass situation turn year. this partly uncertainty increase long term, partly i long member executive board nor, way, lars nyberg. other member executive board may make different assessment direction monetary policy. however, inflation turn high estimate monetary policy report, riksbank may need increase repo rate fast indicate repo-rate path. it quite possible raise 4 per cent already next year. conclusion my overall assessment monetary policy work well five year i member riksbank’s executive board. the average cpi inflation period 2006–2011 1.8 per cent current forecast inflation year. it estimate repo rate average somewhat low 2011 bi central bankers’ speech 11 2006, contribute reduce average cpi inflation somewhat period. the average cpif inflation six year 2.0 per cent, equal inflation target. the riksbank also help keep level production employment years. on hand, view, hindsight, monetary policy expansionary year precede financial crisis. inflation increase level tangibly high inflation target, resource utilisation high normal rapid expansion credit. despite this, repo rate low normal period lead crisis. a rapid increase repo rate would better. we foresee financial crisis, hit swedish economy full force september 2008 riksbank act quickly forcefully. this mainly concern measure preserve financial stability. however, expansionary monetary policy conduct riksbank also play important role reduce severity downturn follow wake financial crisis. look forward, i think repo rate raise every meet year, consider economic development envisage last monetary policy meeting. if inflation become high expected, may necessary raise repo rate normal level around 4 per cent soon next year. the average repo rate last 10 year cannot take start point average repo rate long term. however, time, i am, course, prepare reassess view direction monetary policy external condition change significantly, september 2008. there think monetary policy tight. however, rate growth 5 per cent repo rate 1.50 per cent, i think say monetary policy tight. it gradually become slightly le expansionary. there four hawk two dive executive board present, six doves. 12 bi central bankers’ speech bi central bankers’ speech 13 14 bi central bankers’ speech bi central bankers’ speech 15 16 bi

speech bi central bankers’ speech 1 thomas m hoenig: monetary policy shift economic risk speech mr thomas m hoenig, president federal reserve bank kansa city, london school economics, london, 30 march 2011. * * * introduction the past three year period great challenge policymakers worldwide, include central bankers. unprecedented step take restore stability world economy and, importantly, assure sustain recovery. i certainly support goals. while i argue handle large financial institution differently done, i support federal reserve’s massive liquidity injection design staunch financial crisis. after all, central bank exist part purpose. however, crisis past, incumbent upon central bank return another responsibilities: create condition sustain economic recovery require look beyond short-term goal long-term consequences. for year, i advocated, tight u.s. monetary policy, one would begin unwind policy put place crisis. in january 2010, recovery enter third quarter, i express view federal open market committee modify rate guarantee market. that is, agree policy remain accommodative, i vote promise “exceptionally low rate extend period.” a recovery continue spring, i judge federal reserve gradually shrink enlarge balance sheet minimal market disruption dispose mortgage-backed security trade market premium. thus, i vote replace mature mb similar securities. finally, fall, i question long-term benefit ease monetary policy recovery – i vote qe2. today, view changed. the fomc gradually allow $3 trillion balance sheet shrink toward pre-crisis level $1 trillion. it move u.s. federal fund rate zero toward 1 percent within fairly short period time. then, evaluate effect actions, prepare move fund rate toward level could reasonably judge close normal sustainable. i recognize action simple implement. they would impact different economic sector differently vary degrees. they involve tradeoff effect uncertainty short-term reaction financial market real economy. however, unreasonable radical inconsistent experience deal past crises. they focus long run – reflect sharp awareness policy gear long toward extensive accommodation undermine market discipline encourage speculative activities. put another way, action reflect view long exceptionally accommodative monetary policy remain place, great danger resource misallocated within across world economies. give wide difference view around issues, i want take time even share perspective u.s. monetary policy choice effect economic financial outcomes. recovery way the financial crisis over, u.s. economy recovering. gdp growth unite state average 3.0 percent third quarter 2009 fourth quarter 2010. and worth note period, international monetary fund estimate global gdp growth average 4.9 percent. also, unite state add 2 bi central bankers’ speech 1.5 million job private sector one-year period end february year. other part world, especially asia, experience particularly strong growth. while part europe u.k. grow le robustly, fact remain u.s. much world experience sustain economic growth. with unite state many world economy experience growth u.s. financial crisis over, i would expect see change policy stimulus put place height crisis would throttle back. however, change policy hold unite states. the reason delay existence significant productive capacity remain unused many develop nations. while u.s. economy clearly strengthened, yet return pre-crisis output employment levels. it unemployment rate, example, remain near 9 percent. in u.k., unemployment remain near 8 percent. thus many issue policy turn one’s confidence long run economic trend degree monetary accommodation need ensure trend continue. shift economic risk the monetary policy implement currently within unite state much world accommodative height crisis. policy interest rate remain zero, federal reserve’s balance sheet continue expand even economy improves. with actions, fomc’s objective shift contain global crisis quickly accelerate economic growth. it component focus raise inflation expectations, increase asset value push growth aggregate demand, and, state september 2010 press release, employment. while i agree worthy goals, i concern maintain crisis-oriented policy tool achieve significantly change economic risks. past success pursue form policy mix best. central bank long run a swiss central banker advise duty central banker take care long run short run take care itself. in unite states, simple expression codify laws. the federal reserve act require that, “the … federal open market committee shall maintain long-run growth monetary credit aggregate commensurate economy’s long-run potential increase production, promote effectively goal maximum employment, stable prices, moderate long-term interest rates.” these mandate recognize factor production come together systematic fashion across economies, sector within economy resource availability create growth. the process simple occur quickly – purpose put policy context long run. it within context policy acknowledge improve economic trend begin withdraw degree accommodation. if done, risk introduce new imbalance long-term inflationary pressure already fragile recovery increase significantly. short-run action consequence in spring 2003 worldwide concern u.s. economy fall “japanese-like” malaise; recovery stalling, deflation likely occur unemployment high. this prevail view despite fact u.s. economy grow 3.2 percent annual rate global economy’s average growth nearly 3.6 percent. in addition, feed fund policy rate 1 ¼ percent. although bi central bankers’ speech 3 know low rate would support expand economy, june 2003 low 1 percent leave rate nearly year, insurance. follow action, unite state world begin extend credit expansion house boom. from july 2003 july 2006, monetary base unite state increase average annual rate 4.9 percent, credit increase annual rate 9 percent, house price increase annual rate 14 percent. the long-term consequence policy well known. the unite state world suffer one bad recession decades. the crisis sometimes describe “perfect storm” unfortunate event somehow come together systematically undermine financial system. such event included, example, weak supervision misguide national house policy. while factor certainly contribute severity crisis, monetary policy cannot escape role primary contribute factor. in review data early economic crises, fact extend period accommodative policy almost inevitably follow combination balloon asset price increase inflation. i recently compare movement real policy interest rate inflation four countries: unite states, u.k., germany korea 1960 present (chart 1). the relationship negative rate high inflation unmistakable. also, relationship negative rate house price bust advance economy since 1970 instructive. in instance, nearly 50 percent house price bust precede negative real policy rate year bust (chart 2). if house bust think tail-risk event, percentage high. thus, also worth note month, u.s. real federal fund rate negative 11 quarters. these relationships, course, must test vigorously final conclusion drawn; data strongly suggestive find consistent scholar allan meltzer. extend period accommodative policy, pursue enhance short-term economic growth, often highly disruptive economic effects. after ease action 2003, unemployment decline 6.3 percent june 2003 5 percent two year late 4.6 percent follow year. however, late 2009, follow bad credit crisis, unemployment rate 10 percent. the future a 2003, concern voice past year u.s. economy face prospect deflation, slow growth high unemployment. this case despite many action world economy take remedy crisis stimulate growth. for me, difficult conclude monetary expansion would assure sustain recovery, may event may slow economic growth, event relate real factors. a unite state continue ease policy recovery, sign world build new economic imbalance inflationary impulses. i would suggest also long policy remain is, great likelihood pressure build ultimately undermine world growth. in unite states, example, low interest rates, begin see asset accelerate price. agricultural land prices, example, increase double-digit rates. high-yield security financial market demand price premium beyond would judge reasonable relative risk. why? to quote market participant, “what choices?” the world time experience rapidly rise commodity prices. while increase may reflect global supply demand conditions, least increase drive highly accommodative monetary policy unite state economies. and, recently, unite state evidence accelerate 4 bi central bankers’ speech increase core prices. over past four months, core pce inflation unite state increase modest rate 0.7 percent rate 1.5 percent. i understand u.k. also experience rise prices. while one say certainty whether continue, evidence mount might. i conclude remark even follow observation. i track average growth money price level unite state 19th century present (chart 3). it surprise one strike parallel long-run growth money growth price-level index. from end world war ii alone, price index increase factor ten. with track record, hard accept deflation world’s dominant concern. conclusion central banker must look long run. if current policy remain place, almost certainly stimulate growth asset value inflation. this may temporarily increase gdp employment, long run, risk instability, damage inflation lose jobs, dear price middle low income citizen pay. however, long run yet here. we opportunity assure great long-term stability. move policy highly accommodative merely accommodative would step right direction. in way, achieve good long-run outcome delay normalization. bi central bankers’ speech 5 bi central bankers’ speech 1 brian wynter: the year ahead – view bank address mr brian wynter, governor bank jamaica, american chamber commerce (amcham) forum, kingston, 25 march 2011. * * * lady gentlemen: for long u remember, jamaica hamstring persistent macroeconomic problems. they well-known bear repetition: low gdp growth, adverse fiscal debt dynamic relate unsustainable imbalances. these problem exacerbate global economic financial crisis commence 2008. in order break cycle, country take bold step 2010 far result success key performance indicators. in january 2010, government successfully negotiate jamaica debt exchange (“jdx”) local investor result astonish rate participation. this pave way sign stand-by arrangement international monetary fund (“imf-sba”) entail jamaica give commitment economic path set reform would establish maintain fundamental conducive sustainable growth development. the key objective result medium-term programme set jamaica’s debt gdp ratio downward trajectory, entrench fiscal discipline accountability raise growth rate real gdp. in context, monetary policy aim bring inflation mid-single digit level maintain medium-term context flexible exchange rate. these commitment enable government access unprecedented level fund multilateral financial institutions. a combine total us$2.4 billion, amount 20 per cent gdp, expect receive jamaica programme’s two-year period provide budgetary support meet balance payment needs. so, progress date? well, far see materialisation number goal envision medium-term programme. it envision fiscal policy strategy result stable medium-term outlook would create condition substantial sustain reduction interest rates. this would achieve consolidate public finance would set stage low deficit progressively low finance needs. and, indeed, result. for fiscal year 2011/12, expect process fiscal consolidation continue. the government show commitment process continue adjust expenditure revenue fall budget. additionally, government demonstrate commitment fiscal transformation commencement phase implementation central treasury management system, result efficient management public sector finances. the process divest government public body drag budget achieve major milestone continuing. with developments, go continue decline fiscal deficit debt ratios. low demand finance domestic market government continue result resource available private sector credit. repeat success meet quantitative target imf-sba lead increase confidence prospect economy. we saw strong preference jamaica dollar asset fiscal year steady appreciation exchange rate. the bank end 2010 strong net international reserve (“nir”) 2 bi central bankers’ speech us$2.17 billion, increase us$442.1 million year. gross international reserves, us$2.98 billion, represent 23.7 week project good service imports. in context relatively stable market condition year, bank low interest rate 30-day certificate deposit 375 basis point 6.75 per cent end-february 2011. in addition, bank increase pool loanable fund system reduce cash reserve requirement jamaica dollar foreign currency deposits. market-determined interest rate also trend year fast pace central bank’s policy rate. despite emerge challenge rise international commodity prices, headline inflation continue progress towards achievement target fiscal year 7.5 9.5 per cent. statin release inflation report february ten day ago although may come surprise news medium appear conclude result report sufficiently newsworthy report timely manner. interestingly, i read statement one today’s newspaper food price rise 25 per cent last year environment minimum wage j$4,500 per week. well, exactly. in inflation report february release statin ten day ago, price food category record increase 7.8 per cent 12-month period end february 2011. headline inflation month february minus 0.4 per cent. with january’s decline 0.2 per cent, inflation 11 month fiscal year-to-date 6.7 per cent. it quite clear target fiscal year 2010/11 likely comfortably achieved. at time, weak project performance economy term gdp growth last year. this come context adverse local international weather condition (tropical storm nicole, ash cloud europe) temporary fall-out economy experienced, particularly tourism sector, disturbance west kingston may. however, look forward next 12 months, expect low interest rate abundance credit resource increase investment productive sector economy. in regard, central bank project gradual recovery come fiscal year gdp growth expect range 1.0 2.0 per cent. the initiative spearhead plan institute jamaica identify synchronize high impact project enhance inner city communities, improve economic infrastructure protect environment result acceleration growth come stream. lady gentlemen, interest rate money market low see several decades. this phenomenon pas lightly. it doubt bring part confidence exhibit multilateral financial institution jamaica’s economic programme, confidence affirm credit rat agencies. of great significance, confidence country’s economic prospect demonstrate willingness local investor accept low low rate investments. foreign investor also share optimism overwhelm participation global bond offer february. with policy undertake 2010, jamaica set firmly path sustainable growth development. the on-going reform financial sector increase stability soundness. stable financial market reassure investor safety investments. lady gentlemen, fiscal year 2011/12 set year accelerate progress i urge part change. thank you. bi central bankers’ speech 1 joanne kellermann: the challenge diversity central bank speech m a j kellermann, executive director netherlands bank, european central bank (ecb) diversity forum, frankfurt main, 28 march 2011. * * * within de nederlandsche bank, role model important emancipation female staff. a first woman dnb’s govern board, i glad act role model sense. although dnb may appear male bastion, it’s good remember continuance – shortly establishment – depend woman: widow borski. when king willem i found de nederlandsche bank 1814, 5000 issue share sell immediately. however, madam borski confidence newly establish bank and, 1815, decide buy remain 2000 shares. her purchase subject secret condition king would issue extra share three years. many year late madam borski sell share tidy profit. introduction – general many woman incline nature wait organisation notice management potential. they apply position comfortably meet job requirements. when interview job candidate sex, recruiter tend easily recognise gender-specific aspect value highly. personal within organisation – despite successful diversity policy – gender aspect sometimes play significant role. a woman member dnb’s govern board, i see task speak situations. for example, single woman include recent list potential candidate position divisional director. however, i able intervene add name good female candidate list. why need diversity policy? dnb convince diversity among staff lead good results. in view tight labour market, dnb keen use female potential. finally, guardian financial stability, dnb important social role. in keep social responsibility, wish pursue diversity policy ensure workforce good reflection society. this mean diversity within dnb embrace gender aspect, i focus today. case point employee different cultural backgrounds, occupational handicap different sexual preferences. i’m glad tell dnb network homosexual lesbian employee that, third time, dnb participate boat canal parade part amsterdam gay pride celebration. the talent top charter let tell interest dutch initiative, launch 2007 government, corporate sector women’s representatives: talent top charter. the idea behind charter bring talented woman top help keep there. the netherlands lag behind internationally respect number woman top 2 bi central bankers’ speech management positions. in 2008, signatory report number woman top function organisation 16.7%. their aim bring figure 24.6%. the talent top charter since sign almost 170 organisations, include dnb 2008. commitment dnb by sign charter, commit realise preserve continuous smooth flow woman top positions. here overview exact percentage dnb past years. a commission monitor whether actually honour commitment signatory. start year 2009, woman underrepresented 28%, dnb set target woman fill 32% management position 2012. it’s important note moment – 2009 – many woman whose potential talent recognise groom managerial position. so dnb’s vision policy meet challenge increase gender diversity. what measure take realise vision? i’d like share experience lesson learn process. dnb’s vision objective in context commitment talent top charter, set target figure 2012. these clear measurable target show heading, end themselves. the slide show situation 2004, now, target 2012. the target divisional director set 25%, department head 30% section head 40%. dnb’s govern board expressly commit target supervisory board give annual update progress towards them. dnb translate vision several diversity targets. within dnb, promote that:  woman enter organisation professional late move management positions,  woman participate train mentor programmes,  woman nominate management vacancy appoint  woman valuable capacity see stimulate put forward present management candidates. we deploy range instrument realise diversity targets. let’s take look specific instruments. instrument 1) entrant we make recruitment selection process diversity-proof enhance awareness gender aspect among recruitment selection staff. in addition, hr advisor interview candidate train operate broad gender perspective. moreover, try always include woman selection commission, generally consist hr advisor, line manager sometimes team member. bi central bankers’ speech 3 2) development – vlot question dnb year-long train programme develop management potential. within dnb, management development programme important employees’ chance secure management position. formerly, candidate apply join programme themselves. now, divisional director ask nominate candidate ensure least half nominee female. if ratio fall short, management commission discus nomination divisional director. woman make least 40 percent group eventually admit management development programme. to create sufficient pool high-potential women, dnb launch personal development course young promise staff year ago. at least 40 percent entrant group, too, women. 3) appointment management position dnb us open application procedure management vacancies. management development staff regularly discus gender diversity person involve select interview candidates. the name prefer candidate pass management commission, consist four divisional directors, put propose nomination dnb govern board. an important success factor recognise female management potential woman make 50 percent management commission. after all, people incline appreciate gender-specific aspect candidate sex. another important success factor management development staff actively encourage female colleague apply management position. woman still appear need encouragement. finally, i notice divisional director become keen appoint female candidate enhance diversity team. 4) discover female talent within dnb, too, woman tend wait organisation notice management potential. the human resource department hence engage active dialogue dnb’s female staff. in way hr officer detect management potential gain overall impression women’s professional desire ambition obstacle face career. our term employment already conducive female participation thank opportunity 36-hour work week four day partially pay parental leave. moreover, work time dnb flexible. we aim support talented woman ambition become managers. through “empower yourself” workshop mentoring, woman valuable capacity identify encourage profile management candidates. a mentor system prove practice effective development tool, decide radically expand 2009. part success mentor easy quick way adult learn. 5) management target the success diversity measure hinge management commitment. when introduce diversity policy make manager aware prejudice women, also benefit bring workplace. diversity, broad sense too, highlight workshop seminars. 4 bi central bankers’ speech all manager dnb require set personal performance target promote diversity. the point meet specific target figure give undertake actively support diversity. role model also important within dnb. role model make employee aware effect behaviour create support envisage changes. a women’s network dnb organise wide range activity dnb staff. a 2007, man woman act role model others choose shortlist. a person make significant contribution shift boundary within dnb award annual

the current state payment system integration remark mr daniel mminele, deputy governor south african reserve bank, southern african development community (sadc) payment system integration workshop, centurion, 22 march 2011. * * * good morning lady gentlemen. it pleasure again, honour ask make remark open sadc payment system integration workshop. it little year since launch project integrate region’s payment systems. if cast mind back, time reasonably constructive world going. most part world emerge severe recession, global economy successfully pull away brink, economic indicator generally point right way, albeit risk could identify. we subsequently see encourage growth rate first quarter 2010. all this, however, start change second quarter, european sovereign debt crisis present new challenges, still u today, process expose fragile bank financial system still crisis, deliver sober message road strong sustainable global recovery go rather slow one, would uneven across country regions. more recently, witness series natural disasters, geopolitical risk increasing, full impact global economy remain uncertain stage. and late part world inflation concern come fore again, require delicate balance act part policy maker ensure inflation expectation remain anchor avoid undue damage recovery prospects. a start monetary policy committee meet late today, i certainly comment south african situation, refer statement issue thursday afternoon. we many lesson learn crisis, crisis also leave many question unanswered. these challenge uncertain time experience way another also bear sadc payment system integration project. two area specifically spring mind: the one evolve agenda package measure address root cause global bank crisis, event europe, certain euro zone member country rescue others together multilateral organisations, result european integration project put rather severe test. the two circumstance present different set challenge could impact sadc integration project different ways, could impact different set role-players. the emergence measure address issue lead global bank crisis direct impact commercial banks, regulator require refine exist introduce new regulatory supervisory measures. the event europe, reveal that, doubt benefit monetary unions, certain circumstance put serious constraint countries, hand may harbour even broad implications. country sadc region probably carefully monitor situation europe reassess admittance criterion control measure future sadc monetary union. 2 bi central bankers’ speech commercial bank require conform stringent regulatory requirement new measure introduce follow bank crises. regulator require review oversight supervisory procedure commercial banks. a high level co-operation regulatory body become essential ensure different facet commercial bank’s structure operation adequately examined. joint oversight mutual co-operation initiative regulator formalise memoranda understand observe formalisation role different regulator integrate environments. the significant commitment require commercial bank meet new requirement could result shift focus away regional initiatives. regional initiative could take less priority banks. the role sadc bank association become even crucial effort integrate payment system environment. commercial banks, despite commitment effect change meet new regulatory requirements, continue play part make regional integration initiative success, least stand benefit opportunity regional integration bring it. the sadc bank association ideally position work bank community, close work relationship project team similarly paramount importance. event recent past europe prompt sadc examine carefully criterion admittance monetary union. this together time take establishment control measure procedures, likely delay eventual establishment sadc central bank introduction sadc single currency. the date initially contain regional indicative strategic development plan (risdp), call establishment sadc free trade area (fta) 2008; sadc custom union 2010; sadc common market 2015; sadc monetary union 2016; single currency

operate environment, deliver system time introduction sadc currency. the change environment possible change schedule require flexibility approach manage project. the sadc payment system project team therefore make adjustment approach strategy. i believe consequence change approach focus discussion workshop. establish regional structure could possibly make significant impact integration process. by simply broaden base could make ideal start point sadc integration. it increasingly suggest structure like cma sacu leverage expand include sadc countries. legal constraint could address legal framework enhance create environment, allow sadc country include meet convergence criteria. the payment system project team adopt approach payment system integration project introduce concept model

adjustment global economy keynote address mr josé de gregorio, governor central bank chile, 2011 institute international finance (iif) latin american economic forum, calgary, 27 march 2011. * * * i grateful luis oscar herrera, enrique orellana tatiana vargas valuable comments. thank much invitation speak 2011 iif latin american economic forum. the last year challenge economic policy around world many decades. from unprecedented inflationary shock 2007–08, global economy go financial crisis recession 2008–09, scale see since great depression. now, experience process recovery strong inflationary pressure tension world economy result asymmetry process. the purpose talk today global adjustment, proceed current challenge policymaking are, special focus asymmetry implication economic policy. the uneven recovery the world economy grow unevenly subject many tensions. most advance economy recover crisis, still high rate unemployment excess capacity, expect last time. although sign improvement recovery, many economy still weak financial position, domestic demand expect grow low rate time. after year financial excesses, household many countries, particularly u.s., accumulate excessive debt. many advance economy also weak fiscal positions, due fiscal expansion implement contain recession, measure support bank sector, simply fiscal profligacy take place prior crisis. in particular, level government debt european country require significant protract fiscal consolidation avoid insolvency. therefore, deleveraging process household government imply domestic demand unlikely engine growth. a consequence scenario, inflationary pressure relatively contained. the rise commodity price effect headline inflation, propagation price limit negative output gap. this sharp contrast situation emerge market economy (emes). accordingly, monetary policy advance economy remain expansionary, despite tighten near future, still low interest rate emes, well use consider neutral stance. in contrast, emes grow strongly, suffer moderately global crisis, many already reach level full capacity, may even overheat (figure 1). at global level, buoyancy emes result high commodity prices, couple specific factors, weather problem impact agricultural production tension middle east north africa, push food price record high oil price high level well. this price shock, couple strong domestic activity, result inflationary pressure must contain tight monetary policy. contrary situation advance economies, international price (supply) shock find fertile territory propagate wage price economy strong cyclical position. 2 bi central bankers’ speech this uneven recovery world economy result uneven monetary policy landscape (figure 2), strengthen currency emes induce capital inflow countries. free trade export-led growth successful growth strategy develop countries, see strengthen currency threat strategy. consequently, many country try fight appreciation via capital control exchange rate intervention. china u.s. deserve special mention, center tension adjustment. china growth engine world, would exaggeration call “grower last resort” global economy. they decide appreciate gradually, much slowly emes commodity exporters. since december 2009, yuan appreciate almost four percent, figure much close ten percent emes. the comparison even dramatic look long period time. this achieve massive reserve accumulation limit financial integration. however, measure foreign exchange market real effect – is, real exchange rate, relevant variable point view competitiveness – measure need support real side economy. in case china, high save rate. china save half gdp result current account surplus sustain depreciate real exchange rate. otherwise, attempt maintain depreciate nominal exchange rate sooner late lead inflation, way achieve relative price adjustment nominal exchange rate allow adjust. the u.s., turn, undertake extraordinary monetary expansion. beyond reach zero low bind federal fund rate, unconventional measure add additional monetary stimulus. in particular, massive purchase security implement so-called qe2 program. this explain dollar reach low level several decade (figure 3), result expansionary monetary policy, also lack domestic demand external imbalances. global rebalancing world economy need country strong cyclical position direct domestic demand imports, country insufficient domestic demand increase exports. exchange rate adjustment facilitate process. therefore, fast appreciation yuan would relieve appreciatory pressure emes, make adjustment balanced. but, achieve sustain basis, enough let exchange rate adjust. structural reform also require achieve sustainable efficient reduction china’s save rate. on hand, rise advance economies’ interest rates, particular u.s., would also alleviate currency tensions. however, main responsibility policymakers secure sustainable growth home economy favor citizens, deal repercussion actions. the response emerge market economy emerge market economy face two challenge consequence global environment. first, exchange rate appreciation resumption capital inflows, second, inflationary pressures. sometimes, two challenge may lead inconsistency macroeconomic management. however, important highlight small open economy attempt persistently manage exchange rate away fundamentals, particular overvalue level, may end lead inflation. if adjustment come change value currency, happen inflation. this reason illusion think central bank control exchange rate inflation rate. however, option available transitorily reduce pressure exchange rate monetary policy continue focus price stability. bi central bankers’ speech 3 in flexible inflation target framework, first implication regard exchange rate fluctuation monetary policy would tend lean wind. indeed, persistent exchange rate appreciation would disinflationary effect would induce loose monetary policy one would prevail depreciate exchange rate (everything else constant). however, current juncture, effect prevent need tighten monetary policy, give strong growth emes inflationary pressure come commodity prices. a second option mitigate currency appreciation exchange rate intervention. in order keep control interest rate, intervention must sterilized. of course low effect monetary impact sterilized, consistent inflation stabilization. in chile, since 2008 intervene twice, implement pre-announced way, know schedule intervention sterilization, interfere monetary policymaking. the rationale intervention twofold. on one hand, accumulate reserves, strengthen international liquidity position, hand, provide transitory relief sector need undergo adjustment due current international conditions. a debate tool use capital controls. this particularly important country go period important net capital inflows, case chile. capital control part central bank’s toolkit emes. however, effectiveness still matter discussion, instead discuss evidence i would like point distortion may bring about. first, may redirect capital inflow control segment financial system uncontrolled ones, foster shadow bank system. and second, may generate discrimination corporate sector firm may access foreign finance free controls, firms, especially small medium size enterprises, seek finance expensive domestic sources. capital control macro tool, recently consider “macroprudential” measure well. their purpose avoid build financial vulnerabilities, particular currency maturity mismatches. but, also achieve regulation directly introduce prevent mismatch appropriate risk management. finally, give recent call use capital control emes, collective action problem. a one country impose capital controls, push international financial flow elsewhere, induce others impose capital controls, on. now assume country able impose capital control margin, change net capital flows. then global adjustment would take place, emes would grow beyond potential, generate inflation, weak economy would trap low demand growth. emes still try temper capital inflow transitorily, completely avoid would unfeasible inefficient. conclude remark despite current tensions, global economy adjusting. exchange rate emes commodity exporter strengthen – albeit different speed economy try smooth adjustment – global recovery take place (figure 4). fortunately, trade restrictions, represent big threat global recovery, implemented. in recent week witness increase tension world, turmoil middle east north africa natural nuclear disaster japan. we need play close attention developments, change perspective dual-speed recovery world economy. a discuss above, policy decision large country repercussion rest world. however, main role policymakers secure recovery create basis sustainable growth, require macroeconomic financial stability. policy 4 bi central bankers’ speech measure u.s., qe2, try that. beyond professional assessment, successful recovery u.s. good world economy. by token, chinese authority decide gradual path adjustment secure enough growth social economic need face. from macroeconomic standpoint, policy exchange rate management something many emes try several times, although i firm believer exchange rate flexibility crucial small open economies, course general rule apply case circumstances, especially large low-income economies. overall, world need sustain recovery u.s. growth china. the valid emes. we need contribute global adjustment, main concern must welfare citizens. contain current inflationary pressure essential allow sustainable growth. delay monetary policy adjustment may result severe adjustment future. also, rebuild fiscal buff important order balance recovery good prepare conduct macroeconomic policies. some day ago, chilean government announce timely relevant fiscal tighten contribute moderation aggregate demand. the world go currency war; neither emes flood liquidity advance economies. but, emes, many tension challenge must deal appropriately order build resilient economy take full advantage great progress achieve recent year term

jean boivin: the “great” recession canada – perception v reality remark mr jean boivin, deputy governor bank canada, montreal charter financial analyst (cfa) society, montreal, 28 march 2011. * * * introduction i please able deliver speech today montréal cfa society – first speech quebec deputy governor bank canada. a active stakeholder quebec canadian economies, centre economic life country. thus, i don’t tell past year challenging. barely three year ago, financial crisis source major concern worldwide. this unprecedented event serious costly repercussions, continue feel today. in aftermath crisis, global economy enter recession rightly characterize “great.” economic activity g-7 country drop 5 per cent. accord international monetary fund (imf), number unemployed person around world jump 30 million, advance economies.1 this strike figure, especially think almost equal entire population canada. the canadian economy spared: it still face major difficulties, significant risk remain road ahead. yet, also true country’s economic prospect improve since crisis, see montréal, enjoy strong growth among canadian urban centres. in fact, come recession, canada leader among g-7 countries. employment economic activity surpass pre-recession levels. in light progress made, ask: what real extent recession? what lesson learned, implication future? the purpose speech today reflect event still fresh minds. let u remember, however, answer question become clear time, new data analysis become available.2 the recession: first impression at first glance, answer seem simple. after all, recession define generalize sustain decrease economic activity, broad measure available gdp. it would appear task simply measure extent decrease gdp recent recession compare decrease other, similar episode canada, elsewhere. child’s play, might think. this could first approach descendant – future economists, yet born, inkling live – would take: study compare economic cycle canada. examine economy angle, would observe recession 2007–09 seem serious previous recession canada that, fact, much short (chart 1). the behaviour employment would 1 m. dao et p. loungani (2010), “the human cost recessions: assess it, reduce it,” imf staff position note no. spn/10/17, international monetary fund, 11 november. 2 with publication national account first quarter 2011, schedule 30 may, statistic canada begin historical review past four years. 2 bi central bankers’ speech seem confirm diagnosis: employment loss much le serious and, compare recession past 30 years, job regain much sooner (chart 2) but diagnosis base narrow, mechanistic read statistical measure economic activity could prove false, least, incomplete. if descendant open-minded enough, might lead examine headline time: « l’économie canadienne paralysée », la presse, le 31 mai 2008 “a financial drama no final act sight,” new york times, 14 september 2008 « nous somme au milieu d’une crise grave », le droit, le 25 septembre 2008 “it couldn’t get worse, but it did,” new york times, 12 october 2008 « l’économie canadienne s’atrophie encore », la presse affaires, le 2 mar 2009 « nous étions au bord de la catastrophe,» le devoir, le 18 juillet 2009 on basis preliminary diagnosis, descendant might wonder fuss about. let u hope, however, curiosity spur future economist inquiry. behind first impression hide much complex reality. canada’s economy weather violent storm, thank wise precaution appropriate navigation, arrive safely port, damage perhaps, still afloat. the global economy edge precipice but cannot judge severity storm basis safe arrival. let’s go back autumn 2008. minister finance central bank governor around world meet washington. the tension anger air palpable. after credit bubble burst august 2007, financial crisis spread like wildfire. the liquidity crisis turn solvency crisis. in september 2008, crisis worsened, effect felt throughout entire american financial system, trigger series event breathtaking speed. in short order, witness bankruptcy lehman brother nationalization fannie mae freddie mac.3 the contagion spread europe, key british, german belgian bank either nationalize need major bailouts. stock market register great drop 75 years. the spectre great depression 1930s hover horizon, remind u recession follow financial crisis usually long difficult others leave behind indelible scars.4 implication canada although canada epicentre crisis, contagion spread number transmission channels. the financial crisis clearly lead massive 3 officially, federal national mortgage association federal home loan mortgage corporation. 4 in decade follow financial crisis, growth annual gdp usually one percentage point lower, unemployment rate generally five percentage point higher. see c. reinhart v. reinhart (2010), “after fall,” national bureau economic research work paper no. 16334. in recent study conduct international partners, bank estimate cost financial crisis economy represent 63 per cent gdp. see strengthen international capital liquidity standards: a macroeconomic impact assessment canada (bank canada, 2010). bi central bankers’ speech 3 slowdown global economic activity, direct impact foreign trade. since three-quarters export destine market unite states, experience teach u unite state sneezes, canada catch cold (chart 3). further, increase integration global economy, fate national economy much closely interrelated, even might expect base scale international trade.5 a global financial crisis, therefore, affect canada international trade, also weaken financial markets, shake consumer business confidence, postpone capital investments, light high level uncertainty.6 phase one: sudden slowdown for reasons, financial crisis expect significant impact canada, first phase cycle, certainly case. during last recession, gdp decline 3.3 per cent three quarters. in contrast, period time 1980s 1990s, fell 2.2 per cent 1.9 per cent, respectively a prominent feature recent recession spectacular drop exports. export hard hit previous recession, decrease 16 per cent three quarters, significant drop recession 1980s 1990s 8 per cent (chart 4). investment equally hard hit recession. there 22 per cent downturn investment three quarter (chart 5). nothing like ever seen. it take two year 1980s recession, three year 1990s recession, downturn comparable magnitude recorded. this recent decline investment partly due exceptionally high level uncertainty haunt global economy. in sum, recent recession different previous ones, owe pronounce slowdown trigger unusually steep drop export investment. during initial phase, effect crisis canada – albeit somewhat less degree – comparable unite state show real sign become “great recession” (chart 6). phase two: rapid recovery despite rapid slowdown, recovery fast follow previous recessions. why? neither export investment provide answer. while gdp recover pre-recession levels, business investment export recover 45 per cent 67 per cent, respectively, loss incur recession. 5 empirical study show link country particularly tight country simultaneously sustain shock. see, example, j. boivin m. giannoni, “global force monetary policy effectiveness,” international dimension monetary policy, j. gali m. gertler (eds.) (chicago: university chicago press, 2008). 6 recent research bank canada empirically demonstrate financial channel play key role transmission shock originate unite states. see k. beaton b. desroches, “financial spillover across countries: the case canada unite states,” bank canada discussion paper no. 2011–1 (2011); k. beaton, r. lalonde s. snudden, “the propagation u.s. shock canada: understand role real-financial linkages,” bank canada work paper no. 2010–40 (2010). 4 bi central bankers’ speech if recovery speedier, despite weak contribution investment exports, support recovery must come household government spending. this indeed case. household spend decline 2 per cent 2009 2010, compare 6 per cent previous two recessions. the contribution government spend growth one percentage point year. the great strength household government spend reflect canada’s favourable position outset recession. major adjustment make structure canadian economy. business household balance sheet relatively sound, bank system robust, manage prudently, sufficiently capitalized. canada’s monetary policy framework effective credible. the fiscal situation favourable, social safety net regulatory framework effective. a well, household spend boost prosperity arise strong demand natural resource improve term trade. this favourable position give canada flexibility need respond strongly crisis without compromise credibility public policy frameworks. thank expansionary monetary fiscal measure adopt concert g-20 countries, canada able support domestic demand contribute significantly economic recovery. important linger issue in canada, then, room manoeuvre help u effectively absorb aftershock global economic crisis. it essential maintain buff light elevate risk still exist worldwide structural issue persist canadian economy, even recession. the standard live able sustain medium term depend, fact, ability address issues. allow address three issues: household indebtedness, international competitiveness and, importantly, productivity. household indebtedness let u start household debt. since begin recovery, household credit increase twice rate personal disposable income. in autumn 2010, canadian household debt climb unprecedented level 147 per cent disposable income (chart 7). the relatively healthy financial condition canadian household begin “great” recession help canadian economy good withstand initial shock crisis. however, go forward, essential maintain necessary room manoeuvre keep household spend viable path. this lead u believe rate household spend closely correspond future earnings, certain sign effect already observed. canada’s international competitiveness the second issue ability compete internationally. the slow recovery export due part sluggishness global economic activity. it also due continue erosion canadian business competitiveness past ten years. this erosion attribute appreciation canadian dollar canada’s poor productivity performance. thus, canadian exporter see market share wide range good drop u.s. market – far important market canada – exporter countries, china mexico, gain grind (chart 8). bi central bankers’ speech 5 a global economic growth continue take root, see early evidence recovery net exports. but, point, export still weak compare previous recessions. and world grow international competition, assume force cause erosion competitiveness previous decade simply fade away global recovery. this situation highlight need diversify export market increase ability compete, american producers, also foreign exporters. productivity investment this bring u third issue. a i discussed, international competitiveness base ingenuity, efficiency produce, or, short, productivity. but beyond influence international competitiveness, productivity fundamental determinant economic well-being. to improve productivity, need investment. the slow recovery investment cycle particularly surprise light relatively favourable financial conditions: interest rate remain low, exchange rate facilitate import machinery equipment. the elevate level uncertainty experience recession, especially global perspective, major hindrance business investment. this uncertainty confine borders: link uncertainty business investment clearly evident economy unite states, germany unite kingdom.7 yet heighten uncertainty part explanation. although recession unite state serious american face least degree global uncertainty experience canada, canadian business investment machinery equipment lag behind unite state (chart 9). in 2009, canadian worker access, average, approximately half capital expenditure machinery equipment information communication technology (ict) available american counterparts. this new phenomenon. in fact, 1987 2009, canadian investment machinery equipment ict per worker represented, average, 77 per cent 59 per cent, respectively, similar american investments. it true business investment start recover end 2009. yet much progress remain made: le half extraordinary drop investment last recession recovered. with increase globalization market demographic challenge face, maintain standard live require improve productivity. we must continue innovate invest promise projects. conclusion: perception vs. reality we fond repeat old adage: “an ounce prevention worth pound cure.” recent experience expand notion show good prevention measure also make cure effective. before great recession, canada able protect ensure room manoeuvre absorb shock crisis. the lesson learn past reflect adoption sound public policy frameworks. a 7 see r. bachmann, s. elstner e. sims, “uncertainty economic activity: evidence business survey data,” national bureau economic research work paper no. 16143 (2010); n. bloom, “the impact uncertainty shocks,” national bureau economic research work paper no. 13385 (2007); n. bloom, j. van reenen s. bond, “uncertainty investment dynamics,” national bureau economic research work paper no. 12383 (2006). many old study issue also available. see, example, b. s. bernanke (1983), “irreversibility, uncertainty, cyclical investment,” the quarterly journal economics 98 (1): 85–106. 6 bi central bankers’ speech solid position, combine relatively healthy state canadian households, give u flexibility withstand bad effect global shock. future economist study 2007–09 recession canada may find difficult go beyond first impression ass true impact. some undoubtedly surmise economic activity time indeed reflect, extent shock, also ability absorb it. the storm weather major one. we forget could strike time vulnerable le flexible. thing could unfold differently, disastrous results. it comfort know that, collectively, able limit damage. we must proceed strategy serve u well: continue learn experience ensure good prevention and, necessary, good cure. for this, must strive deal issue confront u strength determination. thank you. bi central bankers’ speech 7 8 bi central bankers’ speech bi central bankers’ speech 9 10 bi central bankers’ speech bi central bankers’ speech 11 bi central bankers’ speech 1 brian wynter:

gather mind meet consider do political economic freedom since independence, learn experience want go. come share vision future one thing always elude u might expect much outcome conference. i believe agree, however, aspect experience would like keep re-living others would wish upon next generation. in contribute process, i go focus important aspect caribbean experience explicitly address elsewhere agenda – role monetary arrangement shape development. they form define component policy choice make independence and, mind, account outcome generally acknowledged. there another reason make occasion opportune time introspection reflection issues. the year 2011 mark 50th anniversary start operation bank jamaica. the establishment institution 1960 precede independence see part institutional machinery place time come manage affairs. so, bank much tune theme celebration welcome opportunity appraise central bank’s role collective affair contemplate form role might take future. in context, remark focus jamaica, reference caribbean neighbour background contrast. the path take – post independence, post bretton wood i begin sketch path take independence post- bretton wood era. among group former british colony caribbean, jamaica first establish central bank, follow trinidad & tobago 1964 guyana 1965. by end 1960s central bank take note issue function currency board replace would do little else way exercise discretion monetary exchange rate policies. so, national currency appeared, maintain look parity old money except issue institution newly christen nation states. after break-up bretton wood system 1971 adoption generalise float major industrial countries, caribbean nations, like develop countries, face issue type monetary arrangement adopt. typically, consideration include desire policy independence, “balanced growth” price stability home, context continue traditional trade link industrial countries. the option face range creation currency enclave panama puerto rico, wide variety peg arrangement institutional structures, formation currency union one eventually adopt eastern caribbean. the liberal extreme, join system independently float currencies, immediately feasible. for part, develop country 2 bi central bankers’ speech respond change international monetary system peg currency major trade partner. however, peg arrangement come unprecedented pressure follow oil shock 1970s subsequent swing demand commodity export develop countries. the alternative economic compression restructure demand sharp change international borrowing; indeed, prove road travelled. but, become clear 1980s large-scale borrow unaffordable economic restructure inevitable, question suitable monetary exchange arrangement arose. the small state caribbean – member country eastern caribbean central bank – well barbados, belize the bahamas choose make adjustment economy without change exchange rate and, process, experience loss competitiveness obviously elsewhere. in territories, wage award monetary condition need consistent low inflation stable exchange rate, leave brunt adjustment process government finances, employment output. the large state caribbean – jamaica, guyana trinidad & tobago – adopt flexible exchange rate part structural adjustment programs. the prevail consensus development thinking, lead washington-based institutions, point likelihood great export diversity, sustainable balance payment improve economic efficiency adoption flexible exchange rate regime accompany economy-wide reforms. in jamaica, many change area trade liberalisation, tax reform fiscal adjustment implemented. a period economic growth, spearhead nontraditional exports, occur towards end 1980s multilaterals agree result process relatively modest short-lived compare fast sustain growth promise start. one outcome process particularly sharp jamaica impact inflation. even initial adjustment domestic price level accompany change taper off, set motion wave negative expectation exchange rate depreciation accompany inflation which, turn, push organize labour make wage demand protect live standards. government expenditure expand meet need funded, large measure, borrowing. fiscal dominance, open capital account absence reserve define heavy role monetary policy rein domestic expenditure. a large part book “bank jamaica – the first forty years’ devote narrate range policy response undertake central bank uphill fight maintain macroeconomic stability. the inflation experience the average inflation, growth gdp change per caput income experience jamaica last five decade interesting: bi central bankers’ speech 3 alarm are, average inflation rate decade fact mask episode even alarm instability. in one seven-year period – 1990–1996 – inflation amount 248 per cent annual average 35.5 per cent. we need pause consider inflation rate level fix contract like pensions, save salary person low bargain power. inflation level virtually destroy value income rely meet normal expense erode provision put aside retirement. it grim silent reaper leaf behind mass work poor indigent pensioner transfer windfall owner property asset denominate currencies. many live period would experience purchase insurance policy help fund child’s education provide source income retirement. you would found, example, princely $100,000 policy purchase 1971 redeem today would worth le $200 1971 dollars. while face value see equivalent us$110,000 then, could purchase us$1,200 today. people whose life shape experience adapt response survive environment. worker negotiate short contract demand adjustment compensate past loss insist provision anticipate erosion purchase power. they demand high interest rate save sustain purchase power deposit attract instrument insurance policy heavy investment component periodic adjustment inherently good able keep pace inflation. and, many, diversification solution despite interest rate available domestic instrument quantum foreign currency deposit domestic financial institution exceed us$2.0 billion keep rise year. the inflation experience spawn behaviour. it make otherwise sane conservative people condone, “invest in” even promote wild financial schemes. it send economic activity underground – avoid taxation seek high returns. can type behaviour describe rational reaction recur bout instability? that open question. but nothing read event last 50 year good explain perennial uncertainty, constant hedging, relentless rent-seeking absence commitment project delay pay-off typify economic behaviour jamaica. you would note figure i read last decade, thing improving. you would know usual medium channel but, week ago, statin released, usual date, inflation report month february. the outcome reduction price 0.4 per cent bring inflation 11 month fiscal year date 6.7 per cent. the treasury bill auction today deliver yield 6.46 per cent three-month instrument 6.63 per cent six-month instrument. so, annual inflation fallen, financial market stable and, recently, market-determined interest rate fall low level decades. a number factor would contribute include fiscal consolidation, external support cooperation many local wealth holder decision makers. the analysis on-going transformation something doubt form part discussion late conference. the key point i wish make context juncture provide ideal time u consider institutional safeguard could preserve price macroeconomic stability next 50 year leave next generation different good experience. policy institutional option different future we menu essentially set option policymakers post-bretton woods: peg (or fixing) exchange rate, monetary union, dollarisation independent central banks. the difference 40years experience since spend lot time energy discuss regional issues. 4 bi central bankers’ speech the first three – fix peg, monetary union dollarisation – imply relinquish discretion monetary policy. they differ degree commitment reversibility inherent regime and, sense, actual currency unit would look like. the answer question “what’s wallet?” would tell world choice was. a fix exchange rate a fix peg appeal establish know predictable parity jamaica dollar against, likely, u dollar. it would thus keep jamaica dollar pocket preserve nominal external value fiat. other thing equal, policy would limit permissible rate domestic monetary expansion would thus, absence local supply shocks, tie domestic inflation unite states. give current strength net international reserve grow record exchange rate stability, might seem many perfect time establish official fix exchange rate. go back not, however, straightforward move. somewhat akin idea original sin, reputational issue burn people’s psyche – perennial uncertainty option government would continue adjust parity whenever deem necessary. the issue credibility stack year experience expedient adjustment pressure arise absence statutory institutional commitment maintain parity. there realities. supply shock feature life caribbean, which, long-lasting, may require adjustment economy-wide price like exchange rate. further, exchange controls, traditionally institutional safeguard ensure reserve adequacy, would anachronism time open border financial integration. thus, reserve may sufficient time support exchange rate stability, change investor sentiment consequent outflow capital could manage restriction credit expansion, reserve requirement interest rate hikes. this would gear towards sustain rate may well unsuitable economic circumstance country would thus provide safe target would wish bet parity maintained. in light realities, i would rule fix exchange rate. determine parity would suitable state economic nature nearly impossible. defend inappropriate parity expensive lose proposition almost guarantee occur circumstance bind arise test resolve authorities. finally, exchange control, companion measure necessary order support peg, rule law, international agreement, de facto integration progress. monetary union the next candidate join rest caribbean community (“caricom”) monetary union use single caribbean currency. partly enhance credibility monetary policy commitment mainly facilitate regional integration, head government caricom take decision july 1992 establish caribbean monetary authority 1997 move towards full monetary union caricom member year 2000. suriname haiti subsequently join group membership dominican republic considered. a caricom-based monetary union would thus embrace virtually whole caribbean area. the development monetary cooperation see important symbiotic adjunct tendency towards hemispheric cooperation trade since would reduce uncertainty payments. it would also seek deflect issue individual member contend pressure balance payment pool foreign reserve bi central bankers’ speech 5 conduct monetary policy regional monetary authority would aim maintain integrity regional currency. whatever original merit clear advantage facilitate regional trade, initiative clearly lose steam 20 year discussion. part reason even absence difficulty make payment across border use de facto caribbean currency – u dollar. the main drawback sign single currency imply cede control part national governance regional authority. while would always representation member, regional monetary policy stance would necessarily affect member differently give wide difference find economic characteristic member several important areas. this would first union face issue others, like unite state different condition among member states, like european union others, mechanism effect fiscal transfer compensate adverse effect common policy members. in regard, note example so-called “less develop countries” caricom always extremely sensitive need protect population via “special differential treatment”. in similar vein, jamaica always continue focus north america europe external economic relation way relegate mechanism promote commerce caricom secondary role. replace jamaica dollar caribbean dollar would likely enhance predictability external internal value would offer strong level commitment announce peg. by token, would prove strong handicap fundamental economic adjustment require locally change parity require unanimity among equal partner union. dollarisation dollarisation return discussion table periodically tout even strong commitment monetary stability would abolish currency entirely replace domestic money u dollar – circulation account purposes. a case caribbean dollar, adoption u dollar would offer benefit tie inflation experience unite state monetary policy would flow federal reserve washington. of course, key difference u dollarisation caribbean dollarisation. there would domestic input policy making. there would right share seigniorage – income accrue issuer national currencies. there would mean support financial system liquidity shortage arose. dependence unite state currency circulation could raise issue security sovereignty (as report occur panama). therefore, dollarisation could offer kind assurance seek establish would would say world “we capable”. more important, would present guarantee reversibility especially question security, sovereignty independent national development issue assume centre stage nation’s political life. i would argue good alternative. a strong autonomous central bank the start point offer succeed generation much please environment price stability, growth development define tolerable rate inflation not. currently, medium-term forecast build around get inflation 4%–5% range is, approximately, collective experience 6 bi central bankers’ speech trade partners. there need public consensus, involve high level leadership, academia, commerce inform public, level inflation authority hold to. this first step. the second step deal perennial imbalance public finance counterpart imbalance current account. these lead huge overhang debt service consume virtually government’s tax revenue crowd public investment infrastructure social development. this part story behind slow growth sluggish change per caput income. it also retard growth productivity one sure way achieve growth gdp without inflation. the third step put place institutional arrangement ensure low stable inflation become key responsibility central bank measure ensure accountability place. this difficult sound require modification legal operational framework already have. the emerge literature redesign central bank follow two strands: one hand, delegation monetary policy conservative central bank determine policy consistent low-inflation preference (the “reputational” option); and, hand, formulation strict principal-agent contract inflation target still set elect official achievement contract central bank empower instrument implement (the “contractual” option). the federal reserve board unite state example first option new zealand’s reserve bank often cite example second type. their relative merit still unfold but, give dependence reputational solution personality single institution, contractual option hold great promise credible, long-term, apolitical solution. an autonomous central bank would one insulate short-term political priority term reference governance provisions. it focus low stable inflation would monitor report parliament implementation inflation target regime prove effective anchor inflation expectation grow number industrial develop countries. it would retain responsibility financial stability would thus mandate wherewithal respond potential threat stability arise support systemically significant entity need arises. such institution would making, could achieve goal think important collective well-being would see u next 50 year proudly hold jamaican dollar wallets. thank you. bi central bankers’ speech 1 ryuzo miyao: economic activity price japan monetary policy summary speech mr ryuzo miyao, member policy board bank japan, meet business leaders, oita, 23 march 2011. * * * introduction it honor today talk mr. kugimiya, mayor oita city, business leader oita prefecture. and i express gratitude understand cooperation various business operation bank japan’s oita branch. first, i extend deep condolence people hit tohoku-pacific ocean earthquake, particularly lose love ones. the earthquake big record, damage geographically widespread. the quake exert various adverse effect daily life economic activity, see heighten problem power supply shortage associate damage. although situation may deem national crisis, important u determination overcome difficulty rise disaster. in remark today, i talk upheaval cause earthquake bank’s responses, follow overview japan’s economic financial development well monetary policy. i conclude offer impression regional economy oita prefecture. i. effect tohoku-pacific ocean earthquake bank’s response a. settlement system financial market look first settlement system follow quake, incident – mainly pacific coastal area tohoku region – include destruction branch disruption automate teller machine financial institutions. moreover, day earthquake occurred, system trouble financial institutions. financial institution make strenuous effort combat situation utilize undamaged branch and/or make deposit withdrawal operation weekend holidays. some clear house quake-stricken area continue suspend bill check clear (15 clear house march 18), effort i mentioned, settlement systems, include bank japan financial network system (boj-net), area operate smoothly whole. the bank also strive ensure business continuity through, example, set disaster management team immediately quake occur make sure boj-net run normal. the bank provided, branch offices, cash quake-stricken area saturday sunday well (the amount cash provide branch office tohoku region 55 billion yen saturday, march 12 sunday, march 13, 256 billion yen march 14–18). also, response subsequent plan power outage concern power supply shortages, bank take possible measure stem interruption settlement funds, partly continue business use in-house power generation branches. the boj-net provide stable power supply, cornerstone japan’s settlement system infrastructure. since various financial need expect arise quake-stricken areas, demand cash exchange damage banknote coins, bank utmost support areas. through aggressive responses, bank continue ensure smooth boj-net operation 2 bi central bankers’ speech cash supply make every effort ensure stability japan’s settlement system whole. in money market, fund provider increasingly hold back fund provision since morning monday, march 14, become difficult make transaction call market. in response, bank conduct same-day operations, first since may 2010, offer 82.4 trillion yen one week (21.8 trillion yen march 14, 20.0 trillion yen march 15, 13.8 trillion yen march 16, 15.6 trillion yen march 17, 11.15 trillion yen march 18), 57.8 trillion yen actually provide market. a result, overnight call market relatively stable recent days. by contrast, cp corporate bond markets, investors’ risk aversion strong underwrite cp corporate bond declined, result significant rise issue rates. the issue rate recently somewhat high, seem attributable small part protract problem quake-stricken nuclear plant well effect earthquake. in addition, stock bond markets, stock price long-term interest rate fallen, reflect investors’ risk aversion due heighten uncertainty regard future. in particular, stock price decline significantly, may 15, nikkei stock average plunge 1,015 yen previous day. this rate decline third large history, follow decline record black monday 1987 failure lehman brother 2008. moreover, foreign exchange market, yen depreciate immediately earthquake occurred, appreciate – reflect trend risk aversion – reach range 76.0–76.5 yen u.s. dollar early morning march 17. subsequently, due mainly concert intervention g-7 country friday, march 18, yen hover around 80–81 yen u.s. dollar stock price also recover somewhat. b. economic activity a effect earthquake economic activity, damage geographically widespread, social infrastructure include port road heavily damage tohoku region, large-scale factory damage tokyo metropolitan areas. it expect return normal distribution system take time concern regard stable power supply, include metropolitan areas, continue. in meantime, restoration effort make day day. in situation, follow could pinpointed, albeit qualitatively, three future effects. first, time, effect damage see substantially supply side, include production capacity, impact economic activity, mainly production distribution. since many part manufacturer automobile electronic device quake-stricken areas, supply chain home abroad force cut off, albeit temporarily. second, uncertainty future could put downward pressure economic activity deterioration household business sentiment. and third, various form demand associate restoration emerge medium term, time size demand uncertain present quite difficult envisage. while difficult quantitatively gauge effect earthquake present, much situation restoration lifelines, utilities, distribution slow, give earthquake big record japan accompany enormous tsunami. with mind, least extent economic activity push downward supply side could large might prolong compare with, example, great hanshin-awaji earthquake 16 year ago, warrant due attention. bi central bankers’ speech 3 c. policy response with thing mind, bank recognize that, ensure stability public sentiment financial markets, critical examine effect earthquake japan’s economic financial condition immediate future well promptly announce guideline money market operations. therefore, bank shorten duration monetary policy meet one day initially schedule two day and, upon examine current situation, judge necessary enhance monetary easing. in particular, give prevent deterioration business sentiment increase risk aversion financial market adversely affect economic activity consider appropriate policy response present, bank decide increase amount asset purchase program, mainly purchase risk assets, 5 trillion yen 40 trillion yen total. specifically, 5 trillion yen increase asset purchase make mainly risk asset – namely, cp, corporate bonds, exchange-traded fund (etfs), japan real estate investment trust (j-reits) – 3.5 trillion yen government security 1.5 trillion yen. while remain uncertainty future, bank endeavor gauge effect earthquake financial institution financial system, well take possible measure order secure stability settlement system financial markets. ii. development economic activity price monetary policy japan a. overview the bank judge japan’s economy get soft patch and, longer-term perspective, continue recover moderately. at time, impact earthquake japan’s economy project mean small, least short run. it necessary examine vigilance earthquake affect bank’s previous outlook economic activity prices, together risk factor bank highlighted. next, i examine issue – although judgment make prior earthquake – start overseas economies. b. overseas economy let first talk u.s. economy. the economy continue recover, couple additional stimulus measure financial fiscal sides. business sentiment improve among manufacture nonmanufacturing firms, stock price improve trend support also good performance global businesses. in situation, business fix investment recovery trend, albeit moderate one, private consumption recovering, exceed level lehman crisis. on hand, balance sheet adjustment household sector likely take time house investment low level, especially term sale newly construct houses. the employment income situation improve somewhat, pace improvement remain moderate. in circumstances, due attention pay recent rise commodity price affect u.s. economy. inflation expectation perceive market uptrend since autumn 2010. household inflation expectation rise since turn year recent indicator consumer sentiment turn toward decline. the pace rise commodity price accelerated, due partly speculative capital inflow unrest middle east amid originally robust demand emerge economies. while commodity price recently soft risk aversion heighten globally, trigger earthquake japan, trend price rise continuous high price likely remain extent basis trend real demand 4 bi central bankers’ speech back high growth emerge economies. i pay close attention future development commodity price effect inflation expectation around world, include unite states. next, look east asian emerge economies, especially china, economy exit deceleration phase start latter half 2010 continue grow rapid pace. the structure growth indicate ongoing virtuous circle continue robust expansion domestic demand chinese economy increase export china peripheral asian countries, turn spread domestic demand countries. in situation, within asian emerge economies, concern inflation start heighten partly rise commodity prices, well robust domestic demand. moreover, term maintain domestic demand expansion, wage increase tandem price rise inevitable. this might turn increase upward pressure inflation. therefore, asian emerge economy proceed gradual rise policy rate create environment sustain high growth. if previous accommodative policy conduct – refer “behind curve” – prolong high inflation take hold, negative impact economy. thus, order prevent negative impact, important act ahead time. a asian emerge economy drive force behind global economic growth, attention pay potential future actions. lastly, european economy recover moderately lead exports, drive particular germany major economies. the rise inflation trend become pronounce european central bank suggest future policy rate rise. in peripheral european country suffer fiscal problems, long-term interest rate stay high uncertainty remain elevated. c. japan’s economy in light recovery u.s. economy high growth asian emerge economies, effect inventory adjustment it-related good run course around world. private consumption japan show sign pick suffer reverse follow sharp increase see previously. although represent judgment make prior earthquake, japan’s economy get soft patch, drive particular recovery export production. look market development prior earthquake, stock price remain uptrend yen range 80–85 yen u.s. dollar. this attribute fact overseas stock prices, especially u.s. stock prices, rise reflection monetary ease unite states, corporate profit cash flow improve substantially. on hand, improvement see component relate domestic demand, business fix investment private consumption, employment income situation remain moderate. the pace improvement output gap price development generally moderate. just like unite states, channel favorable performance corporate sector feed household sector seem somewhat weak. the likely underlie mechanism follows. even economy achieve export-led recovery, rise import cost due increase commodity price would cause term trade worsen real income undermined. a result, even gdp figure increased, gross domestic income (gdi) would increase much. for example, recovery phase 2000s – is, 2002–2007, lehman crisis – real gdp growth rate 1.8 percent average real gdi, exclude trade losses, remain 1.2 percent average. during period, increase real gdp bring net export expansion, accumulate six-year period, bi central bankers’ speech 5 amount 23 trillion yen. the trade loss period amount 18.7 trillion yen, mean real gdi grow 4.3 trillion yen. these figure suggest sector economy burden losses. during recovery phase 2000s, firm contain total labor cost constrain wages. the reduction cost wage represent firms’ strenuous effort achieve structural transformation streamlining. the reduction production cost play role stimulate economy supply side, thereby constrain price rises. on hand, reduction total labor cost wage lead reduction household income, turn undermine transmission mechanism work domestic demand. thus, say trade loss recovery phase 2000s burden household sector streamline corporate sector. if mechanism underlie economic recovery lead export production, trend seem continue even recovery phase lehman crisis. it appear that, back global increasingly competitive environment yen’s appreciation, firm enhance effort proceed structural transformation increase growth potential accelerate shift production site overseas. it also seem firm maintain cautious stance allocate corporate profit bring effort mention domestic business fix investment, employment wages. there possibility mechanism continue operate while, recently, uptrend commodity price constrain domestic income. i closely examine whether trend continue would affect outlook japan’s economic activity prices. let repeat view i present far consideration earthquake struck. therefore, i examine vigilance earthquake-triggered risk aversion around world effect global economy, well japan’s economy. d. monetary policy in october 2010, bank decide implement comprehensive monetary ease pursue powerful monetary easing. comprehensive monetary ease briefly summarize follows. first, bank clarify adoption virtually zero interest rate policy. second, bank confirm would maintain virtually zero interest rate policy judge price stability sight, judgment would base “understanding medium- long-term price stability.” third, take account little room decline short-term interest rates, bank establish asset purchase program, aim purchase various financial asset – namely, government securities, corporate bonds, cp, etfs, j-reits – view encourage decline longer-term market interest rate various risk premiums. this quite extraordinary unconventional monetary policy package include bank’s commitment continuation virtually zero interest rate policy, balance-sheet expansion, purchase risk assets. when package introduced, back slowdown overseas economy sharp appreciation yen, business household sentiment deteriorate asset price include stock price sluggish. correct sentiment risk-taking appetite excessively deteriorate market expect produce sustain effect low risk premiums. in fact, period introduction comprehensive monetary ease earthquake, risk premium generally declined, see rise stock price reit prices. it also expect bank’s bold measure encourage risk take boost firms’ “animal spirits,” thereby lead increase japan’s growth potential improvement productivity. also, unite states, period follow lehman crisis introduction large-scale asset purchase program – so-called “quantitative ease ii” – november 2010, unconventional monetary ease measure implement four times. in particular, 6 bi central bankers’ speech decision purchase 600 billion dollar longer-term treasury security november 2010 produce effect decline long-term interest rate borrow costs. it also appear effect boost stock price moderate overly pessimistic market view u.s. economy see summer 2010 correct trend excessive risk aversion, thereby continue affect risk premium request market participants. a dollar world’s key currency, monetary ease unite state may another global transmission channel. specifically, result federal reserve’s commitment virtually zero interest rate policy policy action lehman crisis, economy strong linkage dollar, emerge economy commodity-exporting economies, end import u.s. monetary easing, turn bring economic expansion country unite states. u.s. global firms, manufacture nonmanufacturing, deeply involve business operation widely around world. thus, economic expansion area strong linkage dollar would enhance profit growth expectation u.s. businesses, would turn entail rise u.s. stock price lead recovery private consumption. therefore, say powerful monetary ease policy continue two year unite state entail “international spill-over effects” stimulate economy home, due rise u.s. stock price expansion overseas economies. it important note unconventional policy measure implement japan unite state undisciplined, unlimited monetary easing. in case japan’s comprehensive monetary easing, clarify temporary extraordinary policy measure, asset purchase program establish manage bank’s balance sheet. similarly, case unite states, federal reserve chairman ben s. bernanke emphasize large-scale asset purchase program short-term policy measure federal reserve commit achieve medium- long-term price stability. so far, i examine monetary policy effect japan unite states. what highlight common factor that, market sentiment confidence swing excessively direction pessimism, central banks’ aggressive action asset purchase make correct situation influence risk premium sustain manner. a mention earlier, response earthquake, monetary policy meet hold begin last week, bank decide increase amount asset purchase program, mainly purchase risk assets, view enhance monetary easing. this measure expect effect similar one mention above, that, confront unprecedented earthquake disaster, measure aim counteract deterioration business sentiment excessive increase risk aversion, thereby prevent economic activity deteriorating. while uncertainty likely remain high, measure take bank exert powerful effect various effort toward normalization pay off. conclude remarks: economy oita prefecture in conclusion, i refer development area. oita prefecture designate new industrial city high-growth period, actively attract growth-promising company region, cooperation public private sectors, little le 50 year pass since oita coastal industrial zone formed. therefore, industrial structure quite well balance solid, material industry steel oil congregate area, also process industry precision machinery, bi central bankers’ speech 7 semiconductors, automobiles. look ratio manufacture prefectural gross product fiscal 2007, oita post high 23.3 percent compare national average 21.2 percent kyushu average 17.1 percent. there many factory extremely high production efficiency, suggest value manufacture good shipment per establishment per worker number one kyushu number three nation. since region high share manufacturers, significantly affect decline export production cause failure lehman brothers. subsequently, view many productive efficient new factories, oita’s export production recover relatively steadily tandem recovery overseas economies. moreover, i rediscover oita bless abundance resource high brand recognition, range fruit sea seki aji, seki saba, shiroshita karei, well dry shiitake mushroom kabosu, production large japan, internationally popular hot spring resort yufuin beppu. moreover, oita geographical advantage locate near rapidly grow east asian economies, give region great advantage term production tourism. in addition, improvement traffic infrastructure, include full open kyushu shinkansen line month ongoing extension work region eastern kyushu expressway, expect intensify interaction within kyushu region area include kansai region. look toward future oita’s economy, i pay close attention follow two issue could lead future growth oita prefecture. first, wide-ranging cooperation medical welfare areas. many medical equipment manufacturer congregate oita prefecture prefecture’s total value medical equipment production rank fourth japan. in october last year, oita prefecture formulate “initiative eastern kyushu local medical industrial center (or eastern kyushu medical valley initiative)” cooperation neighbor miyazaki prefecture. the medical welfare area consider growth area nation’s growth strategy, and, give characteristic influence substantially business cycle, expect contribute regional economy. i believe cooperation among government, industries, academia enhance base wide-ranging cooperation, industrial congregation advance future. the second issue regional revitalization utilize natural energy. oita prefecture top nation term number hot spring source amount hot water, and, support geothermal energy, advance prefecture natural energy utilization, supply self-sufficiency ratio natural energy rank first among prefecture japan. a natural energy, recently nationwide effort public private sector enhance utilization together beefed-up effort toward solve environmental problems. also oita prefecture, sign promote use natural energy source geothermal power generation, include small hydroelectric generation biomass generation. in perceive natural energy area business opportunity, local firm appear cross traditional business border enter area innovations, i expect future growth. with that, i conclude speech move exchange view you. thank you. bi central bankers’ speech 1 deepak mohanty: economic financial development north-eastern state speech mr deepak mohanty, executive director reserve bank india, gauhati university, guwahati, 24 march 2011. * * * the assistance provide dr. p.k. nayak acknowledged. i thank gauhati university invite address distinguish gathering. the north-eastern state (nes)1, also know land seven sisters, richly endowed. the north-eastern region cover 5.5 per cent total geographical area country account 3.9 per cent national population 2.7 per cent all-india net domestic product (ndp). the lushness landscape, geographical ecological diversity range community reside make ne one ethnically linguistically diverse region asia. each state region distinct culture tradition. i indeed delight amidst morning. a well-functioning financial system key sustainable economic development country. although reserve bank actively engage development financial sector country long time, step effort recent year enhance penetration formal financial sector promote financial inclusion view improve well-being society. give special difficulty face north-eastern region, reserve bank undertake special initiative extend outreach bank facility region. against background, i propose briefly delineate economic financial structure region. i shall highlight various financial inclusion initiative take reserve bank, especially nes. in conclusion, i shall present think policy challenge lie ahead. macroeconomic trend let begin macroeconomic trends. the last decade characterise high economic growth all-india level. where ne stand process? they contribute vary degree uptick growth. the data net state domestic product (nsdp) available comparable basis 2007–08. over 8-year period, 2001–08, weight average nsdp growth ne low 5.2 per cent compare 7.1 per cent all-india level. there were, however, significant inter-state variation within ne growth performance three states, viz., nagaland, arunachal pradesh tripura good all-india average (table 1). the low growth assam manipur mainly due poor performance agriculture industry. while growth rate agriculture particularly low assam mizoram, growth rate agriculture nagaland high. an important lesson state replicate best sectoral growth pattern within region, growth ne could easily surpass all-india level. sectoral analysis reveal economic structure ne le mirror indian economy whole service sector dominate economic activity. however, share industry gdp half indian economy whole (table 2). the need, therefore, place great emphasis promote growth industrial sector region. 1 north-eastern state comprise arunachal pradesh, assam, manipur, meghalaya, mizoram, nagaland tripura. 2 bi central bankers’ speech notwithstanding significant difference growth rates, growth per caput real income period 2000–01 2007–08 ne almost twice all-india level, significant inter-state difference (table 3). bi central bankers’ speech 3 income distribution ne equitable all-india level reflect much low gini coefficient per caput income ne compare all-india level (table 4). fiscal trend follow move towards rule-based fiscal consolidation centre early 2000s, many fiscal reform measure also undertake states, include nes. consequently, ne begin improve revenue account 2003–04 state achieve revenue surplus. by 2005–06, ne achieve revenue surplus persist till 2008–09. improvement mainly account growth revenue receipt outstrip growth revenue expenditure. it may note within revenue receipts, current transfer centre form grant tax devolution key component behind correction revenue account achieve nes. during 2004–09, current transfer account 80 per cent total collection, nes’ effort towards good revenue collection contribute limit extent. consequently, consolidate gfd-gsdp ratio ne decline significantly 2005–09 (table 5). state finance witness considerable deterioration 2009–10 evident key deficit indicators. even though moderate impact states’ tax revenue tax devolution centre (as ratio gsdp) due overall macroeconomic slowdown observe indian economy 2009–10, revenue expenditure increase due high administrative expenditure arise revise pay structure. however, capital outlay also increase great focus transport, water supply sanitation, irrigation flood control, education, sports, art culture. the fiscal consolidation process, however, 4 bi central bankers’ speech resume ne 2010–11 budgets. it important ne improve quality expenditure great emphasis capital expenditure sustain fiscal consolidation process. there also need ne improve tax revenue. financial indicator the formal financial system india dominate banks. nes, however, lag behind part india term development banking. this evident low bank penetration (higher average population per branch) ne compare all-india average, though significant variation across state region mizoram meghalaya much good ratios. the credit-deposit (c-d) ratio ne much low 34 per cent end march 2010 73 per cent all-india level (table 6). even credit expand fast pace deposit last decade, gap remain wide. the credit penetration, measure ratio bank credit nsdp, ne also remain significantly low all-india level (chart 1). this raise question whether low credit penetration ne due lack absorptive capacity region. however, seem case non-formal source finance region dominate finance activity rural sector. a per 59th round national sample survey (nss) data indebtedness farmer household nes, 45 per cent finance avail farmer formal financial sector, remain 55 per cent non-formal sector. this significantly high all-india level share informal sector 42 per cent (chart 2). this show absorptive capacity considerable scope improve bank penetration nes. bi central bankers’ speech 5 6 bi central bankers’ speech financial inclusion measure financial inclusion important bring poor under-privileged section society within bank fold thereby generate sustain equitable growth. let turn various measure initiate reserve bank promote financial inclusion. first, reserve bank long institute mechanism call “priority sector lending” credit channel certain prefer sectors, which, inter alia, include small-scale industry, small business agriculture. in post-reform period, priority sector expand include advance retail trade, educational loans, micro-finance low-cost housing. this help further cause financial inclusion. second, union finance minister announce budget 2010–11 every village country 2000 population must access bank service march 2012. in order operationalise process, commercial bank prepare financial inclusion plan submit reserve bank. a brick-and-mortar branch viable small centres, approach meet challenge business correspondent (bc) model leverage communication technology. under model, bank appoint agent provide basic bank service door-step client behalf banks. third, reserve bank ask bank open no-frills accounts. these account low minimum balance requirement provision small loan way overdrafts. this convenient account small depositors, especially rural areas. fourth, major impediment common person open bank account “know your customer” (kyc) norm. the norm relax small accounts, viz., deposit rs.50,000 credit rs.1 lakh. a simple introduction exist account holder bank adequate open account. in regard, aadhar, unique identification number (uid) project central government, aim provide unique id number everyone country, help poor establish identity meet banks’ kyc norms. fifth, farmer get credit bank conveniently kisan credit card (kccs) general purpose credit card (gccs). sixth, several bank facility available, common person may aware them. hence, financial literacy become critically important. accordingly, reserve bank initiate “project financial literacy” objective disseminate information regard central bank general bank concept various target groups. our “financial education” website link offer basic banking, finance central bank child ages. our website also available 13 languages, include assamese. finally, also learn process reserve bank. we recognise responsible banking, must sensitive need common person. accordingly, governor, dr. subbarao initiate outreach programme last year part platinum jubilee celebrations. under outreach programme, top management reserve bank visit least one village every state union territory state government official commercial bank give focus attention financial inclusion. this highly enrich experience u understand grind realities. accordingly, decide continue programmes. i glad indicate already conduct outreach camp assam arunachal pradesh. during current visit, outreach camp organise manipur, nagaland tripura. special financial inclusion measure ne while financial inclusion measure expect improve bank facility general throughout country, include nes, i would also like highlight special financial inclusion measure initiate nes. bi central bankers’ speech 7 first, december 2009, reserve bank relax branch authorisation policy permit domestic schedule commercial bank (other rrbs) open branch rural, semi-urban urban centre ne sikkim without need take permission reserve bank case, subject reporting. second, improve bank penetration nes, reserve bank request state government bank identify centre need set either full-fledged branch offer forex facilities, handle government business meet currency requirements. we also offer fund capital run cost five year provide state government concern will make available premise put place appropriate security arrangements. meghalaya first state take advantage facility: eight centre allot three public sector banks, follow bid process state. however, progress towards open branch slow lack proper infrastructure identify centres. in tripura, five centre allocate tripura gramin bank december 2010. i understand branch expect open shortly two centres. similarly, work identification centre open branch complete arunachal pradesh, nagaland manipur. policy challenge let turn broad macroeconomic policy challenges. development ne high agenda central respective state governments. recognise special requirement region need significant level government investment, ne recognise special category state central plan assistance state significant. a i indicated, reserve bank also initiate special measure spread bank promotion financial inclusion. nevertheless, accelerate pace growth nes, i may highlight challenge lie ahead. first, weak market linkage major constraint development region. for reason, urgent attention need pay develop roads, air links, telecommunication component transport communications. investment infrastructure could scale public-private partnership model. second, initiative need take promote sustainable industrial development compatible unique bio-diversity region. agro-based industries, food processing, wood products, traditional textile light manufacture industry encourage come region. third, need increase agricultural productivity promote diversification horticulture floriculture agro-climatic condition region well- suited. fourth, sustainable growth paradigm help acceleration growth also improve fiscal sustainability help low debt-gsdp ratio. fifth, high level literacy human development level couple bio-diversity provide ample opportunity development tourism exports. sixth, deterrent bank lend high level non-performing asset (npas) region. this been, part, due unviability activity finance bank lack adequate engagement borrowers. there is, therefore, need improve credit culture financial education could play vital role. in addition, bank augment staff strength branch emphasis staff knowledge local custom practices. give preponderance community-based society nes, group lend could successful mode credit delivery. hence, need promotion self-help group (shgs) great linkage banks. in regard, nabard important role play, promotion shgs, also capacity 8 bi central bankers’ speech building, along sidbi concern state government agencies. another area substantial scope expansion low-cost housing. expansion house loan remain poor mortgage cannot create many part nes. however, bank explore innovative structure house loan great emphasis group lending. seventh, plan financial sector development, physical presence bank branch important. but topography region, dispersal population, transport bottleneck law order condition area inhibit branch expansion certain commercial centres. hence, stake-holders – banks, state government reserve bank – need work close co-ordination increase bank penetration promote financial inclusion region. conclusion to conclude, north-eastern region immense potential. the need, therefore, identify opportunity recognise challenge work towards sustainable inclusive growth region great penetration formal financial sector. bi central bankers’ speech 1 caleb m fundanga: small-scale cross-border trade payment service southern africa official open remark dr caleb m fundanga, governor bank zambia, roundtable symposium small-scale cross-border trade payment service southern africa, lusaka, 21 march 2011. * * * distinguish invite guest let begin welcome roundtable symposium small-scale cross-border trade payment service southern africa. may i also warmly welcome colleague neighbour country come join u important event. it sincere hope shall enjoy stay zambia shall find roundtable symposium fruitful. distinguish lady gentlemen, cross-border trade play important role support livelihoods, especially border communities, thereby buttress prosperity region. furthermore, strengthen commercial ties, promote cultural understanding, deepen community relationships, cross-border trade help nurture harmonious relation amongst country region. the unique feature small-scale cross-border trade lie geographical proximity minimise transportation costs, thereby allow trader take advantage difference supply, demand, price various good service available either side border. it worth note cross-border trade activity report foreign trade statistics. however, survey conduct subject show cross-border trade carry individual small trader families. the volume trade small value quantity, agricultural product consumer good main trade goods. the traders’ mode transport conduct business foot, use bicycles, take minibus taxi side border. lady gentlemen, cross-border trade benefit traders’ life income also strengthen local production, foster service provision. it also benefit people involve activity associate trading. this entail cross-border trade significant driver employment income generation household would otherwise live poverty, especially remote area employment scarce. furthermore, lady gentlemen, cross-border trade low import price widen range choice good available consumers, well enable exporter benefit high value-addition. finally, cross border trade gender dimension woman actively involved. from foregoing, distinguish lady gentlemen, clear small-scale cross-border trade play vital role economies, particularly generate income, create employment alleviate poverty. however, lady gentlemen, small-scale cross-border trade face lot barrier impediments, include lack access financial payment service currency exchange transmission facilities. trader side border force carry cash must first convert fund unite state dollar respective country domestic currency country purchase good service from. by doing, cross-border trader face many risk include theft, exchange loss conversion costs. lady gentlemen, although bilateral effort towards formalise facilitate small-scale cross-border trade southern africa, 2 bi central bankers’ speech enough. for instance, zimbabwe sign memorandum understand malawi facilitate informal trade, especially small medium-sized enterprises. mozambique zambia also sign memorandum understand facilitate repatriation currency two country accumulate trader locate along common border areas. it expect memorandum understand expand include malawi. the lack financial payment service hind small-scale cross border trade also lead establishment entrenchment parallel currency market borders. needle say, associate vice counterfeiting, facilitate illegal trade, well enhance cross-border money launder activities. moreover, u monetary authorities, illegal cross-border local currency circulation create potential complicate conduct monetary policy, especially significant amount country’s domestic currency use outside jurisdiction. the volume good service trade amount currency handle individual trader may seem small. however, collectively significant implication conduct monetary policy. for instance, world bank estimate small-scale border trade southern africa around $17.6 billion. other study estimate small-scale cross-border trade account 42% gdp sub-saharan africa. lady gentlemen, reason roundtable symposium convene follow objectives: 1. to stimulate broad interest topic small scale cross border trade; 2. to initiate inquiry design world bank project aim foster small scale trade innovative cross-border payment service southern africa; 3. to look opportunity provide cross-border money transmission service benefit small-scale trade remittance transfers. it anticipate roundtable symposium shall come refine design world bank project launch late 2011 focus five country southern africa, namely: angola, malawi, mozambique, south africa, zambia. a draft copy project design circulate all. the project aim enhance trade low transaction cost trade payment improve access financial service small-scale traders. the goal increase small value trade payment formal channel transition payment away cash improve competition innovation market trade relate payment services. it also expect forum result attain good alignment project scope stakeholder needs, particular buy-in private public sector stakeholder country covered. lady gentlemen, roundtable forum bring together decision policy makers, private public sector country cover project, single regional event represent government central bank officials, trade payment system experts, international development community, mobile network operators, international money operators, payment service providers, academic researcher involve topic small-scale cross-border trade payment services. i positive symposium shall achieve state objective wish encourage actively freely participate deliberations. with words, lady gentlemen, i declare roundtable symposium open. thank you! bi central bankers’ speech 1 andrew g haldane: capital discipline remark mr andrew g haldane, executive director bank england, base speech give american economic association, denver, colorado, 9 january 2011. * * * the view necessarily bank england

sowerbutts, marco spaltro, george speight, belinda tracey, paul tucker, matthew willison peter zimmerman comment contributions. the basel committee set capital standard international banks. there three vintage standards: so-called basel i date 1988, basel ii date around 2004 basel iii agree end last year.1 these international capital standard support three pillars. pillar i define regulatory rules, pillar ii provide scope supervisory discretion, pillar iii seek foster market discipline disclosure. in counter systemic shocks, three support pillar understandably felt good one. but success international capital standard forestall bank distress mixed. basel i regulatory rule arbitrage due risk insensitivity. this give rise basel ii great focus risk calibration. but basel ii buckle weight recent crisis. repair since apply basel iii. historical experience suggest unlikely end road. this paper ass suggest mean improve robustness regulatory framework. the quest risk sensitivity pillar i rule cause regulatory complexity opacity blossom. this may inhibit effectiveness supervisory discretion market discipline (section 1). in consequence, pillar i may bear much load pillar ii iii little. here i focus pillar iii. there may straightforward way rebalance basel scales, re-injecting market discipline. have bank issue graduate set contingent convertible (“coco”) securities, responsive early sign market stress, one possible way (sections 2 3). that would practical effect reinforce pillar i pillar iii, deliver potentially balance robust regulatory edifice. get may take time. but modest adjustment dividend bonus distribution policy bank would help (section 4). section 5 concludes. the first pillar the recently-agreed basel iii package deliver material strengthen regulatory standards. though detail complex, essence reform easily described: “more – better”. so bank capital future high quality. bank required, first time international accord, hold liquid assets, future resilient. risk management extensive future robust. and bank supervisor plentiful future smarter. that response virtually every financial crisis past fifty years. it arrest crisis cycle – anything, incidence crisis appear risen.2 it may 1 goodhart (2011 forthcoming). 2 bordo et al (2001). 2 bi central bankers’ speech even slow cycle, massive cost time’s crisis attest. so although recent basel iii package may necessary, must real question whether sufficient cope next time’s crisis. history, least, provide grind pessimism. a think experiment, imagine instead design regulatory framework scratch. finance classic complex, adaptive system. what property would complex, adaptive system finance ideally exhibit best insure future crises? simplicity one. there key lesson, here, literature complex systems. face complexity, temptation seek complex control devices. in fact, complex system typically call simple control rules. to otherwise simply compound system complexity control complexity.3 uncertainty would divide, would multiply. robustness would second. this particular mean context complex systems: resilience give ignorance.4 more often, call knightian uncertainty simply model error. the dynamic complex systems, large bank interconnect financial webs, well understood. that mean uncertainty need take seriously financial regulatory framework robust. timeliness would third criterion. complex system often exhibit knife-edge property, discontinuity tip point naturally-recurring feature.5 those feature punctuate present financial crisis. in physic finance, cliff-edge little chance full recovery. that underscore importance timely, pre-emptive regulatory intervention financial disaster averted. (a) simplicity how exist regulatory rule compare criterion – simplicity, timeliness, robustness? take simplicity. by standard, exist regulatory rule far simple. for large banks, highly complex. they become time give evolution basel framework. back day basel i, calculate regulatory capital ratio especially tax time-consuming. it involve little half dozen calculations. these calculation could conduct back small envelope competent clerk. possess envelope clerks, banks, regulator market participant able perform calculations. they transparent verifiable. in way, regulatory rule (pillar i) provide solid platform supervisory discretion regulator (pillar ii) market discipline investor (pillar iii). the basel pillar mutually reinforcing. basel ii change calculus. in part avert regulatory arbitrage, quest great risk-sensitivity. regulatory capital rule become finely calibrate banks’ underlie portfolio risks. in practice, mean two things. first, number independent category risk asset increased. and second, great use make banks’ internal model generate risk metric associate asset class. the consequence regulatory shift system complexity extraordinary. for large complex banks, number risk category exploded. to illustrate, consider position large, representative bank use advance internal set model calibrate capital. it number risk bucket increase around seven basel i to, conservative estimate, 200,000 basel ii. to determine 3 for example, perrow (2007) cliff (2011). 4 hansen sargent (2007). 5 haldane (2009), haldane may (2011). bi central bankers’ speech 3 regulatory capital ratio bank, number calculation rise single figure 200 million. the quant computer displace clerk envelope. at one level, technical progress; appliance science risk management. but costs. give complexity, become increasingly difficult regulator market participant vouch accuracy report capital ratios. they long easily verifiable transparent. they much article faith fact, much art science. this weaken pillar ii iii. for market cannot observe, unlikely able exercise discipline over. and regulator cannot verify, unlikely able exercise supervision over. bank recently begin voice concerns. (b) robustness a cost complexity arise model error. model uncertainty, distinct risk, rarely take account interpret report capital ratios. but without idea uncertainty, difficult know much confidence place report solvency measures. how large confidence interval investor regulator ought place around them? calibrate confidence interval around capital would involve aggregate across myriad asset multiple models. rather tellingly, complex calculation anyone carry out. but draw banks’ publish model output, possible gauge uncertainty around key balance sheet component – example, retail credit portfolio, wholesale credit portfolio trade book. for retail credit portfolio, consider simple, single source model error – calculate probability default (pd) different class borrower. under advance model-based approach calculate retail pds, loan place risk bucket. so degree intrinsic uncertainty risk bucket true pd lie indeed whether lie assign risk bucket all. to gauge importance uncertainties, mortgage portfolio two large bank examine capital calibrate use report models. these capital ratio simulate two counterfactual assumptions: (a) true pd uniformly distribute within risk bucket; (b) true pd high record pd one risk bucket. the result illustrate chart 1 2. chart 1 look distribution report capital ratio, index 100, assume model uncertainty exist within risk bucket symmetric. even assumption confidence interval significant, “true” capital ratio lie anywhere 15% report ratio. once allow possibility pd systematically under-estimated, degree uncertainty great still. the “true” ratio lie 35% report ratio. that equate several percentage point capital. a different way gauge effect model uncertainty look different bank value essentially identical exposures. for uk banks’ wholesale credit portfolio, fsa conduct exercise 2009.6 a hypothetical portfolio construct base 64 externally rat corporate, bank sovereign exposures. bank ask use model generate pd capital hypothetical portfolio, could compare across banks. the range report capital requirement hold common portfolio striking. for wholesale exposure banks, capital requirement differ factor 100%. 6 financial service authority (2010). 4 bi central bankers’ speech for corporate exposures, differ factor around 150%. and sovereign exposures, differ factor 280%. those difference could equate confidence interval around report capital ratio 2 percentage point more. a final mean gauge potential model error consider past evidence. during crisis, model error large egregious trade book. chart 3 4 compare uk banks’ pre-crisis capital hold trade book trade book loss crisis. loss six time great pre-crisis trade book capital (chart 3). and capital ratio would need 2.5 percentage point high accommodate model risk (chart 4). a fundamental review trade book underway address problem. this evidence provide glimpse potential model error problem view three different angles. yet suggest model error-based confidence interval around report capital ratio might run several percentage points. for bank, difference life death. the shift advance model calibrate economic capital arrest trend. more likely, intensify it. the quest precision may come expense robustness. hayek title 1974 nobel address “the pretence knowledge”.7 in it, highlight pitfall seek precisely measurable answer question dynamic complex systems. subsequent research complex system confirm hayek’s hunch. policy predicate over-precision risk catastrophic error. complexity risk model may perpetuate hayek’s pretence mind risk manager regulators. (c) timeliness one purport benefit model-based calibration increase sensitivity capital requirement change risk. report regulatory capital ratio good reflect risk thus principle offer timely advance warn impend bank stress. the data tell somewhat different story. to see that, consider experience panel 33 large international bank crisis. this panel conveniently partition bank subject government intervention form capital guarantee (“crisis banks”) free intervention (“no crisis banks”). chart 5 plot report tier 1 capital ratio two set bank run-up lehman brother crisis september 2008. two observation striking. first, report capital ratio two set bank largely indistinguishable. if anything, crisis bank look slightly strong pre-crisis regulatory solvency measures. second, regulatory capital ratio offer, average, little advance warn impend problems. these conclusion essentially unchanged use basel iii definition capital. this visual evidence formalise construct type i (false positive) type ii (missed crisis) error estimate 33-bank panel. assume, way illustration only, bank’s tier 1 capital ratio dip 8%, deem signal distress (table 1). the probability type i error use regulatory capital ratio 50%, probability type ii error around 43%. on assumptions, suggest regulatory capital ratio well predict crisis coin toss. they essentially uninformative future bank stress. take together, paint altogether encourage picture. a critic might argue regulatory capital ratio become complex verify, error-prone reliably 7 hayek (1974). bi central bankers’ speech 5 robust leaden-footed enable prompt corrective action. from first principle perspective, score poorly optimal control device complex system finance. resurrect third pillar what could do strengthen framework? a think experiment, consider drop risk model instead rely market. market-based metric bank solvency could base around market rather book value capital. the market price bank know offer useful supplementary information collect supervisor assess bank health.8 and also evidence offer reliable advance warn bank distress.9 to bring think life, consider three possible alternative bank solvency ratio base market rather account measure capital:  market-based capital ratio: ratio bank’s market capitalisation total assets.  market-based leverage ratio: ratio bank’s market capitalisation total debt.  tobin’s q: ratio market value bank’s equity book value. the first two essentially market-based variant regulatory capital measures, third well-known corporate valuation metric.10 how fare first principle complex, adaptive systems? they clearly offer advantage simplicity transparency. 200 million separate calculation would condense simple, single sum. the clerk would make glorious return displace quant. market-based measure could observe verify real-time regulator market participants. that could help enhance supervisory discretion market discipline. market-based capital ratio could support three pillars, help rebalance basel scales. market-based solvency metric offer two advantages. first, reliant myriad, mis-specified models. they largely model-free, error-free.11 they robust model error ignorance. second, history suggest that, least late crisis, would give far timely signal impend stress, good guide prompt corrective action, ahead crisis cliff-edge reached. to illustrate that, chart 6–8 look three market-based measure solvency 33-bank panel, break “crisis” “no crisis” banks. there clear blue water solvency ratio crisis non-crisis banks, second materially weaker. in two year prior lehman brother crisis, average market-based capital ratio around 5 percentage point low crisis crisis banks. second, market-based measure capital offer clear advance signal impend distress. for example, market-based capital ratio crisis bank begin fall april 2007, well year ahead lehmans crisis. to formalise visual impression, table 1 show type i ii error three market-based capital measures. these 8 cannata quagliariello (2005), gunther et al (2001), krainer lopez (2004). 9 berger et al (2000). 10 calomiris herring (2011) prefer variant first measure. 11 largely, even marked-based measure solvency rely disclosure banks, model-dependent degree. 6 bi central bankers’ speech comfortably outperform coin toss. replace book value capital market value low error half, often much more. market measure provide few false positive reliable advance warn future bank distress. take together, then, market-based solvency metric perform creditably first principles: appear offer potential simple, timely robust control complex financial web. contractual prompt corrective action but market-based metric put use design regulatory framework? market warn useless unless act on, either market regulators. it difficult devise reconfiguration banks’ capital structure would bake-in benefit simplicity, robustness timeliness. this would involve cocktail revise regulatory capital standard fortify market discipline. it might work follows. alongside equity, bank would require issue set contingent convertible instrument – so-called “cocos”. these instrument attract quite bite attention recently among academics, policymakers bankers, though remain uncertainty design.12 in particular, consider coco follow possible design characteristics.  trigger base market-based measure solvency, chart 6–8.  these trigger graduated, stretch banks’ capital structure.13  on triggering, claim convert debt equity. although novel respects, coco characteristic would simple understand. they would easy monitor real time regulator investors. and would alter potentially quite radically incentives, thus market dynamics, ahead bank stress become acute. to see why, imagine bank whose expect future profits, hence market capitalisation, slumped. if erosion profit sufficiently material, conversion high trigger occurs. upon triggering, chunk bank’s debt convert equity, automatically recapitalising bank provide extra equity cushion. this equity infusion ought help restore market confidence bank’s soundness. if first conversion trick, profit shock sufficiently large, ring ladder. low trigger provide graduate safety net. a trigger pulled, convert coco offer progressively great stuff cushion. this double boon. it confer benefit (contractually pre-agreed contingent) equity. but knowledge graduate safety net ought also help stabilise investors’ confidence bank. under capital structure, banks’ insurance contract would fundamentally different present. instead equity provide haste stress, safety net would extend automatically advance. and instead provide state ex post, insurance would come private creditor ex ante. timely self-insurance would replace laggardly public insurance. there would prompt corrective action. but would operate autopilot, use contractual, market-based navigation system. 12 for example, flannery (2010), flannery perotti (2011), duffie (2011), calomiris herring (2011). 13 alternatively, could graduate tranche coco operate single trigger. the economic impact two structure would similar. bi central bankers’ speech 7 this contractual automaticity would provide shoot arm incentive thus market discipline. first, incentive investors. know trigger might close pulled, claim converted, coco investor likely sit take notice. if conversion take place prevail market price, incentive among exist shareholder similarly sensitised. early sign deteriorate profit sentiment likely result great investor activism. such activism absent run-up crisis, part early morning wake-up call investors. second, incentive management. if investor grumpy early morning wake-up call, management bank likely hear hoarse protests. and anticipate protests, management le likely sail close wind least quick tack fear squall. management, too, would provide incentive remain shipshape. third, incentive regulators. in depth crisis, recent experience shown, temptation forbear bail-out strong. it surprise authority often opt great certainty bail-out ex post, whatever preference ex ante. this policy time-consistency problem lie heart current regulatory debate. good resolution tools, would need coco enough, lessen dilemma essential part reform programme. they give authority extra option creditor bail-in write-down debt-for-equity conversions. they provide statutory backstop, enable bail-in private sector creditors. a such, necessary ingredient restore market discipline. coco buttress market discipline help lift authority horn time-consistency dilemma. they augment regulatory discretion point distress contractual rule well ahead distress. capital replenishment contractual automatic; write price ex-ante deliver without temptation ex-post. because intervention would prompt, transparent rule-based, scope regulatory discretion would constrained. for reason, time-consistency problem ought reduced, perhaps materially. a contractual belt add resolution braces. to achieve benefits, change would need banks’ capital structure. but reconfiguration would especially dramatic. indeed, would simple cde: c(ocos) + d(debt) + e(quity). the layer bank equity would augment layer cocos, slice define market-based triggers. banks’ capital would comprise multi-sliced equity, actual, contingent. in respects, model greatly dissimilar one recently propose swiss bank commission.14 in achieve capital structure, one option would regulator require it, switzerland. but possible bank might find capital structure best interests. to see why, consider standard model optimal capital choice value-maximising firm. the firm face trade-off. debt confer benefit tax deductibility, equity offer benefit low expect bankruptcy costs.15 the trade-off two set benefit define optimal capital ratio firm maximise expect value (chart 9).16 now consider add coco mix. they are, effect, hybrid debt equity whose payoff depend state nature. when nature kind time good, offer upswing (tax-deductibility) benefit debt. and nature cruel time bad, offer downswing (bankruptcy costs) benefit equity. they are, 14 commission expert limit economic risk pose large company (2010). 15 debt could also provide incentive benefit discipline management (jensen (1986)). 16 leland (1994). 8 bi central bankers’ speech language economists, form “contingent” contract contingency question crisis. a chart 10 illustrates, optimal fraction coco banks’ optimal debt structure likely non-zero. in words, cde capital structure might smart option value-maximising investor managers, even without need regulatory intervention. the social value capital structure might, course, great still – example, social cost crisis high private costs. that would justify regulatory capital backstop. this capital structure share risk-sharing benefit reform proposals. for example, similar risk-shifting property mutual fund limit purpose bank model.17 when required, risk share across capital structure, mutual fund whose equity claim adjust value. but risk-spreading would kick-in need to. bank bank nature kind mutual fund cruel. they butterfly summer, provide hedgehog winter. from if structure best state world, already exist? at least two legitimate concern raised. first, might market-based trigger invite speculative attack short-sellers? the concern coco holder may able short-sell bank’s equity force conversion, use proceed coco conversion cover short position. there several practical way contract design coco could lean speculative incentives. perhaps simple would base conversion trigger weight average equity price prior interval – say, 30 days.18 that would require short-sellers fund short position long period, commensurately great cost. it would also create uncertainty whether conversion would indeed occur, give risk price bounce back short-seller suffer loss. both would act speculative disincentive. a second potential firewall speculative attack could come impose restriction ability short-sellers cover position proceed conversion. restriction naked short-selling apply around time season equity offer jurisdictions.19 a rule prevent cover short position proceed coco conversion could provide disincentive destabilise short-selling banks’ equity. a relate concern coco alter seniority structure banks’ capital, holder coco potentially suffer loss ahead equity-holders. but provide price coco convert equity close market price, conversion transfer value exist equity-holders coco investors. and provide conversion equity need imply investor loss. if market move really unjustified, price correct time towards fundamentals. the holder convert coco garner upside. so coco susceptible market aberrations, view managed. in respect, market error fundamentally different model errors. market error temporary risk, model error permanent uncertainty. market error managed, 17 for example, kotlikoff (2010). 18 for example, flannery (2010). 19 safieddine wilhelm (1996), example. bi central bankers’ speech 9 model error cannot. put differently, market-based coco cost type i error may relatively modest end-investors. a second key practical issue whether plausible imagine investor base coco emerging. recent sign encouraging. two major international bank issue coco total around us$10bn since start year. credit suisse recently issue $2bn coco public auction, reportedly 11-times over-subscribed. some market commentary suggest coco market could grow around $1 trillion next years.20 despite progress, investor demand coco remain uncertain. tellingly, none coco issue far market-based triggers, none graduate ladder trigger and, view, none extend far banks’ capital structure. in short, case cde capital structure is, present, unproven. but may simple, evolutionary way catalyse market demand achieve capital structure. perhaps simple way would require bank make discretionary distribution staff shareholder cocos. in way, investor base coco would emerge organically grow line banks’ profits. a well catalyse coco market, distributive approach would two benefits. first, would boost resilience bank keep revenue business augment banks’ capital base. give large dividend bonus pay bank historically, distribute coco could increase banks’ capital base materially. consider uk banks. imagine 50% bonus pay coco rather cash 2000 2006. by 2007 start crisis, uk banks’ capital ratio would around 1 percentage point high (chart 11). have 50% dividend addition cocoed, assume coco count tier 1 capital, capital ratio would 3 percentage point higher. that roughly £70 billion, around amount external capital uk bank raise crisis. second, coco payouts potentially good align risk-taking incentive among staff shareholder cash even equity payouts. the crisis demonstrate visibly downside equity-based remuneration. one temptation gamble resurrection poise brink, give gambler’s option embed equity. a second perverse incentive seek external equity dilutive impact might managerial wealth. both adverse side-effects evident bear stearns lehman brothers. remunerate management coco remove temptation, much way would credibly loss-absorbing sub-ordinated debt.21 in peacetime, management long offer upside equity, downside. the asymmetry payoff embed peacetime bonus package – “heads i win, tail society loses” – neutralise somewhat pay cocos. this good align risk shareholder staff risk society large. there old lesson, here, eat cooking. this ought help discipline chefs, reduce temptation pursue risky recipe first place. encouragingly, bank practice may already begin match theory. several bank recently announce future consider remunerate shareholder staff cocos. 20 standard & poor’s (2010). 21 calomiris (2010) gordon (2010). 10 bi central bankers’ speech conclusion tackle complex bank complex regulation fight fire fire. this unlikely work theory. crisis experience suggest work practice. a regulatory framework need state neither omniscient walrasian auctioneer (shouting hundred million risk prices) deep-pocketed financier (doling hundred billion taxpayers’ money). a regulatory gosplan work good banker tractors. the role regulation instead set overarch rule game. in tackle bank stress, mean framework banks’ capital structure. a far possible, framework aim leave price risk ex-ante, consequence risk ex-post, market. the framework outline could one simple, robust timely way help achieve that. it different.

england, national asset-liability management global conference, london, 24 march 2011. * * * i would like thank alina barnett, rohan churm michael hume considerable help prepare speech. the view express necessarily reflect member monetary policy committee. the remit monetary policy committee clear: hit 2% inflation target. but inflation february 4.4% – well target. it target much past 5 years. and likely remain next year so. at time, monetary policy remain extraordinary loose levels. this month mark second anniversary bank rate reduce 0.5%; it’s low ever level. and stock asset purchase finance central bank reserve – qe – remain £200 billion. there onus committee explain action consistent remit. there good case defence. but need continue make it. it need make international investors, many morning, go continue confidence invest uk. more generally, need make preserve accountability credibility committee. the mpc accountable hit inflation target. development rest world certainly affect us. and inflation always close target. but ultimately uk inflation responsibility: make control threadneedle street. the credibility monetary policy rely company household confidence committee keep inflation close target. after series fail monetary framework 1970s 80s, gain credibility associate introduction inflation target creation independent policy committee greatly improve function economy. the task maintain low stable inflation make substantially easier, enjoy sustain period economic stability. we lose hard-fought gain peril. the mpc stand charge four counts. why inflation high? why inflation much high expected? could inflation remain high? and current stance policy consistent inflation outlook? my task today make case defence. why inflation high? on first count – inflation high – case defence advance number colleague recent month hopefully familiar many you.1 over past years, economy hit series large price level shock – oil commodity prices, vat, sterling exchange rate – raise companies’ cost put upward pressure prices. together factor account strength inflation. 1 see example speech bean (2011), king (2011), mile (2011), posen (2011). 2 bi central bankers’ speech indeed, recent analysis bank’s inflation report suggest factor account rise level consumer price since begin 2007 8–12%.2 this dwarf extent inflation exceed 2% inflation target period. now, really court law, i fear judge may look point degree disdain, suggest sound like series excuses. “inflation inflation”, may say, “whatever cause. your job keep inflation close target”. i’ve considerable sympathy argument: high variable rate inflation see recent year affect ability household company plan spend investment decision degree certainty. but remit mpc recognise try keep inflation target face large shock disturbance “may cause undesirable volatility output.”3 i fear might sound like i’m resort technical loop-holes bolster defence. but case. this element remit central operation monetary policy recent years. the foremost task monetary policy past year ensure financial crisis lead prolong depression. to offset price level shock would mean preside even deep recession. i’m say i perfect foresight, i wouldn’t change policy stance all. but hurdle want materially tight policy face severe downturn post-war period pretty high. but argument hypothetical. a many may know, mpc perfect foresight. indeed, far it! which lead second charge mpc: inflation much high expected? why inflation much high expected? on committee, always stress uncertainty associate forecast inflation mean forecast – outturn relative forecast – judge term entire forecast distribution rather single point forecast. but even view way, inflation recent year turn significantly high think likely. consider, example, forecast committee make two year ago february 2009. at time, probability committee attach inflation 3% 2010 le 5% quarter. in event, cpi inflation 3% every quarter 2010 average 3.3% (chart 1). however viewed, prolong period unexpectedly high inflation need explained. that explanation come two halves, source inflation surprise 2009 different 2010. in 2009, surprise largely stem extent increase import price associate sterling’s depreciation pass high consumer prices. the 2 see box page 34–35 february inflation report. the box explain range estimate suggest factor might add 6% – 10.5% level price 2007 end 2010. my number update analysis recent impact january 2011 vat rise additional increase energy import prices. 3 the relevant clause remit state “the framework base recognition actual inflation rate occasion depart target result shock disturbances. attempt keep inflation inflation target circumstance may cause undesirable volatility output.” see http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/d/open_letter_from_chx_to_boe_22032011.pdf bi central bankers’ speech 3 mpc’s initial judgement next year le half increase import price would fee high uk consumer prices, remainder absorb margin low nominal wages. this judgement base part number influential study make year prior sterling’s depreciation suggest degree exchange rate pass-through many countries, include uk, fall significantly period great moderation. indeed, general view emerge amongst many academic commentator pass-through many major economy fall close zero.4 the mpc’s initial judgement around 40% increase import price would pas consumer price top end emerge view. however, judgement look woefully optimistic compare degree pass-through think occurred, close 100%.5 this error judgement account surprise strength inflation 2009 (chart 2). however, account much le surprise 2010, since extent additional pass-through lessen time go on.6 instead, 2010 surprise largely stem sharp pickup import price inflation see much last year, drive surge commodity prices. at time make february 2009 forecast, expect import price increase slightly 2010. in event, price oil, food metal increase 20 40% 2010, lead bout import price inflation. these high commodity price directly affect price food energy consume. but effect go wide that. high metal price raise cost import cars. likewise, cotton price cost clothes. all told, unexpected increase commodity world trade price account lion’s share surprise strength inflation 2010 (chart 3). so two significant factor account recent extend period high expect inflation.7 in 2009, surprise strength largely reflect great expect pass-through sterling’s depreciation consumer prices. there good reason 4 taylor (2008) argue global economy experience reduction degree exchange rate pass-through recent years. microeconomic study attribute decline increase globalisation, increase competition domestic foreign firm (campa goldberg (2006)). macroeconomic study argue due monetary policy’s focus price stability cause price adjust slowly (devereux engel (2001), taylor (2000, 2007), devereux, engel storgaard (2004)). empirical study ihrig et al (2006), find exchange rate pass-through consumer price u.k. fall 0.20 1990s almost zero thereafter; similar effect find g7 country exception germany. 5 the february 2011 inflation report (section 4 box page 34–35) describe estimate suggest import price increase since 2007 add 4% 6% overall price level. this equate pass-through 66% 100%. i discuss reason degree pass-through may large least fast predict early study speech last year (dale 2010). 6 the analysis present base forecast make february 2009. the extent surprise stem degree exchange rate pass-through subsequent forecast reduce quickly suggest analysis since mpc learn high pass-through adjust subsequent projection accordingly. 7 there course many element mpc’s forecast differ projected. for example, previous bank analysis (see box page 48–49 august 2010 inflation report) highlight small expect impact weakness demand. act opposite direction, appear consumer-facing company may squeeze margin anticipate 2009/10. the various change vat period also complicate task forecast inflation. however, relative february 2009 forecast consider here, change vat contribute significantly surprise strength inflation 2009/10, since effect temporary reduction vat december 2008 include forecast, main impact recent increase vat come first quarter year. 4 bi central bankers’ speech think degree pas may relatively limited, start 2010 judgement show wrong incorporate close full-pass forecast since then. by contrast, unexpected strength inflation much 2010 largely stem surge commodity prices. could inflation remain high? to summarise: there’s great puzzle inflation target much past years. our economy subject series large shock – oil commodity prices, vat, sterling exchange rate – raise inflation. the scale shock account overshoot inflation relative target. moreover, possible, albeit benefit hindsight, explain inflation recent year high expected. but past. what matter monetary policy prospect inflation next 2 3 years. my broad view inflation outlook similar describe february inflation report. inflation probably rise near-term recent commodity price increase pas supply chain. but out, inflation likely fall back temporary impact price level shock wane slack economy associate deep recession gradually recover continue pull inflation. but risk uncertainty associate inflation outlook mean impossible know certainty much period inflation moderate. indeed, quite possible inflation may considerably high low central view take february report. this lead third item charge sheet: could inflation remain high? the simple answer question – i’m afraid – yes. i would highlight two risk particular. the first global price pressure continue add domestic inflation. there number potential channel could operate. at first blush, natural suspect might appear continuation recent rapid increase price oil commodities. a i said, commodity price increase sharply past year strong demand emerge economies, especially china, underpin much rise, look set continue.8 but ignore fact one reason commodity price increase much 2010 exactly demand expect remain strong. indeed, look ahead, future price broadly flat. now many reason commodity price may expect follow exactly path imply future prices. for example, investor require positive risk premium hold commodities, commodity cannot easily stored. and sharp movement commodity price certainly possible. but i wouldn’t expect see rapid increase commodity price like see past year unless global demand turn significantly strong – supply weak – currently anticipated. but inflation home could also affect general inflationary trends. average inflation large emerge economy increase 2.8% 5.3% last year.9 this large part reflect rise local global food prices. but overheat many emerge 8 event japan middle east north africa also important influence commodity price recent weeks. oil price increase reflect fear supply disruption heighten risk premium, non-oil commodity price fall response concern weaken demand. 9 this group cover bric economy plus 22 emerge newly industrialise economies. bi central bankers’ speech 5 economy play increase role. these economy account little 20% uk’s imports. so inflation remain elevate country could material impact domestic inflation. under circumstances, may expect impact high inflation overseas’ economy offset correspond depreciation exchange rates. but economy operate peg exchange rate regime far clear rely upon, least near term. a third external factor could add domestic inflation pass-through past depreciation sterling. our central view close 100% pas term direct impact high import price consumer prices. but hard precise exact degree pass-through, range estimate include february inflation report suggest pas date may low two-thirds. moreover, quite possible pass-through may exceed 100% company make domestically produce good service able use increase competitiveness associate sterling’s depreciation widen margins.10 so number potential channel development abroad may affect domestic inflation. but repeat point i make front: inflation home made. if think global price pressure likely push cpi inflation extend period, uk monetary policy need set way reduce domestically-generated inflation, leave room external price pressures. and respond argument i see make number commentator recent months. no: raise bank rate directly dampen global inflation. but ensure lead high persistent domestic inflation. the second upside risk inflation i would highlight prolong period target inflation erode public’s confidence mpc keep inflation close target. inflation target 49 past 60 months. over 5 year period, inflation average 2.8%. inflation likely remain target next year so. this suggest mid 2012, inflation likely target best part six half years. yes, perfectly possible explain inflation high long. and yes, good reason monetary policy try keep inflation close target period. but like judge look earlier, people, point, may start sound like series excuses. this risk heighten fact mpc consistently under-predicted inflation period. it much easy wise event. for many people, one thing inflation know certainty much cost live increase recent years. and take signal path future inflation, could significant implications. discussion mpc credibility often frame term set binary arguments. ha mpc lose credibility not? be inflation expectation anchor de-anchored? this approach encourage focus measure medium-term inflation expectations. the rate inflation expect next year may consistently move around since mpc attempt bring inflation back target short time horizons. but 10 in extreme, law one price (loop) suggest that, absence transport cost trade barriers, price give commodity world. even though loop unlikely hold perfectly, mechanism underpin loop might cause sterling depreciation lead increase price domestically produce good services. 6 bi central bankers’ speech line argument suggest stability inflation expect 5 10 year ahead provide good metric judge credibility monetary policy. the evidence medium long-term measure inflation expectation somewhat mixed. the recent survey conduct bank nop suggest 5-year ahead inflation expectation increase 0.4% point past year. the correspond survey measure collect citigroup/yougov barclays rise similar amounts. but citigroup/yougov barclays measure remain level reach 2008. and measure medium-term inflation expectation derive financial market little change compare year ago. but i’m cautious much comfort take relative stability measure two reasons. first, although economist may like think otherwise, company household far good thing spend time formulate detail expectation rate inflation likely prevail 5 10 year time. many may use simple rule thumb form view future inflation, “inflation equal target”.11 or may base expectation view hear express others read newspapers.12 importantly, expectation form way may relatively sticky.13 rule thumb change perform poorly period time. expectation base view others may update occasionally. a such, may time see full effect extend period target inflation fully reflect inflation expectations. second, fundamentally, i worry binary approach monetary policy credibility – credible credible, anchor de-anchored – miss key risk inflation expectations. despite lurid newspaper headlines, i don’t believe many people think monetary policy committee adopt secret aim keep inflation 2% target indefinitely. give that, i don’t find surprise asked, many survey respondent significantly raise expectation inflation medium term. more likely, however, company household may look back prolong period target inflation infer committee perhaps become tolerant deviation inflation target. a such, inflation may expect return target gradually. rate inflation expect prevail 5 10 year may increase, inflation expectation 2, 3 4-years ahead may well do. this risk almost impossible monitor since information term structure inflation expectations, especially household companies, sparse. but could profound implication inflation outlook performance economy. if company household expect inflation return target quickly set price pay demand accordingly. and doing, monetary policy le – term vary level demand economy – ensure does. inflation credibility self reinforcing. the credibility gain associate move inflation target independent policymaking committee country lead reduction persistence inflation. inflation come back target quickly cost term output volatility reduced.14 if company household begin expect 11 brazier, harrison, king yates (2008). 12 carroll (2003). 13 mankiw real (2002). 14 there reduction persistence uk inflation without increase volatility output. benati (2006) find inflation target period stable macroeconomic period uk history. some argue due low le volatile shock hit uk economy (benati bi central bankers’ speech 7 inflation return target slowly would harm efficient function economy. wage price set behaviour could change. the task keep inflation close target would become costly. inflation persistence would increase. we need guard gain credibility build past 15 year so. how current stance policy consistent inflation outlook? the existence upside risk lead fourth final charge level mpc. be current stance policy consistent inflation outlook? a i’ve explained, central view committee – i share – much current strength inflation drive series price level shocks. inflation likely fall back next year, temporary impact factor wane persistent slack economy continue pull inflation. that outlook drive current stance monetary policy. policy need remain highly accommodative order support spend income reduce risk inflation significantly undershoot target medium term. but considerable uncertainty extent inflation likely fall time period. that uncertainty map differ view exactly accommodative monetary policy need be. on one hand, risk strength durability recovery may disappoint. our economy still face considerable headwinds, especially within household sector, real income squeeze many family may yet adjust fully implication substantial fiscal consolidation train. on hand – i’ve discuss – risk inflation may remain high long currently expected. either global price pressure continue add domestic inflation persistent period target inflation start become ingrain wage price set behaviour. it still early reach firm conclusions, seem likely terrible event japan political upheaval middle east north africa add risks. the huge disruption japan uncertainty associate event libya likely dampen global demand, least short run. but accompany increase energy price likely add domestic inflation. at mpc meet two week ago i vote raise bank rate 0.75%. even increase rates, stance monetary policy would remain highly stimulatory. bank rate would still close historic low stimulus programme quantitative ease would unaffected. but i judge remove monetary stimulus warranted. i would like tell judgement drive “nice” reasons. that i confident recovery would continue apace. that low level bank rate reach depth recession long needed. that position monetary policy could begin gradual process normalisation. but i’m afraid nice reason factor drive decision. in particular, i’m confident strength recovery. my central view – similar february inflation report – growth likely close average historical rate next years. but pretty disappoint outlook give depth mumtaz (2007)) others argue due good monetary policy (batini nelson (2005), nelson nikolov (2004)). 8 bi central bankers’ speech recession recovering. and considerable scope growth surprise downside, particularly household retrench further. rather, vote raise rate drive concern – despite relatively weak outlook growth – risk inflation target medium-term upside. in particular, risk continue global price pressure effect prolong period target inflation mean level demand consistent achieve inflation target probably fallen. nasty reason rather nice ones.15 i stress i’m certain turn right policy decision. a key lesson i learn financial crisis economist know lot le economy economy work many would like believe. policymakers need approach task humility pragmatism. if growth turn materially weak i anticipate medium-term pressure inflation ease unexpectedly, i reverse decision. but growth expect around average historical rate, inflation likely remain 4% rest year bank rate record low levels, withdrawal policy stimulus seem sensible. the juxtaposition high inflation loose monetary policy mean onus mpc explain actions. the case defence need made. and good story tell. we explain inflation target much past years. we think understand – albeit benefit hindsight – surprise strength inflation. and learn episodes. i can’t say monetary policy perfectly anticipate every twist turn economy. we continue surprise event need adjust policy accordingly. but i assure mpc remain commit focus ever determination hit inflation target. 15 this distinction nice nice reason raise bank rate make interview charlie bean western mail 1 february

management regulation: smart regulation, safe markets”, frankfurt main, 23 march 2011. * * * lady gentlemen, i please able open conference house finance frankfurt. frankfurt host three european institutions: european central bank (ecb), european insurance occupational pension authority (eiopa) european systemic risk board (esrb). this city home europe’s monetary authority, also important supranational responsibility supervisory matters. with eiopa esrb, frankfurt host half european body new european system financial supervisors, two european supervisory agency (esas) – european bank authority (eba) european security market authority – base london paris respectively. i look great interest today’s programme, exceptional quality. in open remarks, i would like lay scheme build block financial reform still progress. i believe look back year financial reform follow global crisis, identify three main build blocks: the first bank regulation. the global community make big step forward here. it make right diagnosis and, basel iii framework, draw appropriate lessons. my friend nout wellink chair basel committee; i privilege chair committee governor head supervision, provide guidance basel committee. the second build block regulation financial markets. here, reform must ensure much great transparency various market segment products, ensure sufficient competition markets, attenuate much possible pro-cyclicality derive information asymmetries, structural feature rat market phenomenon herding. the third build block macroprudential oversight. this new discipline focus interaction various part financial system financial sector real economy. new institutions, include esrb equivalent oversight committee around world, pursue task identify source systemic risk, issue early warn recommend remedial action. the birth date macroprudential oversight europe probably identify start year originally conceive 2009 work jacques de larosière high-level group, include friend otmar issing. eighteen month policy design institutional establishment remarkable achievement. it make possible thorough groundwork well excellent transposition commission rapid decision european parliament european council. i feel honour chair new body, esrb. let focus three build block turn, start banking. 2 bi central bankers’ speech i. bank regulation basel iii basel iii, constitute cornerstone regulatory reform bank sector, provide high minimum capital requirements, good risk capture, strict definition eligible capital element particular focus common share transparency. the revise regulatory framework allow appropriate transition period financial institution adjust new standards, thereby ensure smooth phasing-in new regulatory requirement without compromise nascent economic recovery. by 1 january 2015, minimum capital requirement common equity tier 1 total tier 1 capital gradually raise level 4.5% 6.0%, respectively. this gradual phasing-in minimum requirement complement appropriate observation period non-risk-based leverage ratio liquidity standards. the esrb, together eba, play important role policy set implementation, former contribute ensure consistent implementation policy framework throughout eu. we begin process. in addition necessary transposition national european law basel iii rules, two issue still need addressed: systemically important financial institutions; capture so-called shadow bank system within regulatory framework. work progress systemically important financial institutions, particular financial stability board. the main objective reduce probability failure institution and, case failure occurs, reduce impact financial system. in september 2010, governor head supervision agree systemically important financial institution additional loss absorb capacity. work currently underway define institution systemically important, determine capital surcharges, contingent capital element limit systemic fallout. with shadow bank system, ensure tight regulatory rule provide incentive financial institution shift activity unregulated areas. oversight shadow bank sector need improved. the fsb already do valuable work – support ecb – shadow banking. in context, ecb provide financial stability board (fsb) flow fund data composition financial sector concern euro area. the concrete challenge lie establishment suitable definition shadow bank outline possible regulatory option address risk pose sector. give background crisis, regulatory effort financial institution focus banking, important work underway also financial institutions, specification capital adequacy regime insurance company (“solvency ii”). ii. market regulation let turn second build block, namely regulation financial markets. this area challenge complex banking. the main observation draw crisis risk market return mainly exogenous, come stochastic variation real economy. they come financial risk itself. the financial structure think place assess, absorb neutralise risk either dysfunctional work magnify volatility. key factor create risk opaque financial structures, particularly vulnerability contagion domino effects, pro-cyclicality financial markets. the lack transparency many financial instrument mean market player could exploit – own, private benefit – information generally available. bi central bankers’ speech 3 pro-cyclicality act formidable accelerator financial trends. two important factor drive amplification distort incentive herd behaviour. the role distortion economic incentive probably good know traditionally widely appreciate even within neo-classical modelling. by comparison, herd behaviour driver pro-cyclical pattern financial market still need thorough explanation. it difficult rationalise herd behaviour. there two possible explanations. one significance market player’s evaluation performance relative rest market. this reminiscent keynes’ famous beauty contest analogy. to successful environment, individual participant form opinions, follow general mood prevail among market participants. everybody seek ride wave create general sentiment, hop step general sentiment turns. the second explanation global market fact le atomistic think. indeed, despite globalisation, increase market concentration already long-term trend crisis. derivative activity u bank system, example, dominate small group large institutions. and, course, market credit rat famously dominate three signatures, act standard-setters enormous volume transactions. many regulatory initiative underway remedy issues, include work otc derivatives, rat agency alternative investment vehicles. but address challenge could also support reorient significant resource research. in particular, i would welcome enrichment think economics finance, include new approach necessarily rely notion equilibrium, universal rationality efficiency. inspiration fields, natural sciences, may particularly pertinent. i think example market movement stability instability, tranquillity turbulence. in physic phenomenon describe phase transitions. when factor exceed critical level, system behave qualitatively differently situation factor stay level. let turn third build block regulatory reform, macroprudential supervision. iii. macroprudential oversight a early remark suggested, financial crisis reveal many respects. it reveal fallout failure large financial institutions. it reveal fragility financial system feature trend cut across institutions, market infrastructures. and illustrate amplitude consequence adverse feedback loop financial system real economy. all three element key feature systemic risk: first, contagion; second, build-up financial imbalance unsustainable trend within across financial system; third, close link real economy potential strong feedback effects. the crisis reveal fundamental importance systemic risk. of three element i mentioned, contagion link real economy least novel current episode. the unexpected element rigour systemic risk trigger collective behaviour financial institution way interact financial markets. the main new avenue explore therefore improve understand interconnectedness financial system, via direct link financial institution indirect one create financial markets. everybody see major risk emerge within financial system itself. it real economy throw financial system disarray, reverse. 4 bi central bankers’ speech endogenous risk – risk emerge within financial sector – many causes. they may arise, example, large part system rely source funding, similar exposure – rise financial imbalances, currency mismatch widespread mis-pricing risk. we also see turbulence arise relatively modest initial shocks. the system interconnect look stable turn “meta-stable”, mean potentially highly instable. snow mountain slope meta-stable, look pristine tranquil yet turn avalanche minor disturbance. for reasons, establish new framework macroprudential supervision counterpart elsewhere, include unite state new financial stability oversight council. in case europe, still one reason macroprudential oversight, single european market. cross-border cross-sectoral financial integration within eu foster competition, freedom establishment free flow capital. the single financial market crucial component overall single market project, macroprudential supervision enhance resilience market. so exactly new discipline macroprudential oversight conducted? financial stability issue exclusively central banks. micro-prudential supervisor key role, stable institution essential necessary condition achieve financial stability. this esas national supervisor together central bank member esrb esrb esas form european system financial supervisors. the esrb’s main task threefold: identify prioritise systemic risks; issue early warn significant systemic risk emerge; issue policy recommendation remedial action response risk identifies. the esrb focus individual institutions, individual country individual macroeconomic issue – take strong horizontal focus, across countries, across sector across boundary financial sphere real economy. interlinkages spillover key term analysis. to achieve tasks, esrb draw information many sources, include strong analytical input members; intelligence gather financial system participants; data necessary understand nature interlinkages define financial system. esrb analysis must broad-based cover potentially aspect eu’s financial system – markets, institution infrastructure. the esrb establish time concern market policy-makers short-term vulnerability seem prevail perception medium- longer-term risks. this confront esrb, well macroprudential body around world, specific challenges. the esrb need consider activity initiate, well fully-fledged macroprudential policy framework develop medium term. at time, must develop policy framework, template exist analytical background capture part tasks. in medium term, esrb macroprudential authority 27 eu country need operational policy framework specific instruments. the esrb ready support – technical level – work european institution start design implementation countercyclical capital buffers. other macroprudential instrument also desirable. work issue initiated. for example, new rule margin collateral counteract fluctuation cycle. the specific capital requirement risk-weighted asset might also adjust cycle. when macroprudential instrument established, possibly around middle decade, authority finally tool mitigate pro-cyclical behaviour financial bi central bankers’ speech 5 players. authority set part regulatory requirement solvency liquidity situation single institutions, take view macroprudential cycle. other instrument need address interconnectedness, include complex innovative element market functioning. one specific focus authority ensure efficient secure central counterparties create reduce risk otc markets. concentration risk produce increasingly large financial institution trade post-trading also need addressed. finally, authority need new regulatory instrument keep pace impact new technology – include high frequency trading, algorithmic trade new universal trade platforms, gain grind rapidly. last week, esrb select member advisory scientific committee provide advice analytical issues. we also establish advisory technical committee, assemble expert central banks. the institutional set-up complete esrb focus substantive tasks, substantive review june year. combine focus short-term risk medium- longer-term perspective major challenge. conclusion let conclude. i believe halfway comprehensive reform crisis call for. we achieve blueprint stringent bank regulation include loss-absorbing capital, good risk coverage limitation undue leverage. countercyclical capital buff mean low pro-cyclicality. the oversight financial institution well market market infrastructure strengthened, organisational structure financial supervision overhauled. but much remain done. the important aspect implementation reforms. moreover, issue systemically important financial institution require reflection, oversight proper function financial market way avoid undue volatility, excessive influence dominant player oligopolistic market structures, reinforce transparency, need address resolutely. such understand would enhance great focus academic research analysis intricate interaction complex financial systems. the appropriate benchmark financial system whether provide appropriate finance real economy stable sustainable way. thereby, thereby only, make valuable contribution economy. thank attention. bi central bankers’ speech 1 ben s bernanke: community bank period recovery change speech mr ben s bernanke, chairman board governor federal reserve system, independent community banker america national convention, san diego, california, 23 march 2011. * * * it’s pleasure opportunity speak independent community banker america (icba). this sixth consecutive year i’ve meet event, theme remark year tell story financial economic upheaval experienced, also difficult issue continue confront banker policymakers today. back 2006, le two month i start chairman, i speak strong performance community bank well important longer-term challenges. in subsequent years, remark touch need strengthen regulation supervision fannie mae freddie mac, approach reduce preventable mortgage foreclosures, community bank financial crisis, last year, need address problem financial institution “too big fail.” my theme today vital role community bank need play economic recovery, value federal reserve place insight community banks, evolve regulatory environment. community bank economic recovery to me, title 2009 icba annual report, empower main street, concise accurate description critical role community bank play u.s. economy. community banker live work business, institution deep roots, sometimes establish several generations. they know customer local economy. relationship bank therefore core community banking. the large bank typically rely heavily statistical model ass borrowers’ capital, collateral, capacity repay, approach add value, bank whose headquarter key decisionmakers hundred thousand mile away inevitably lack in-depth local knowledge community bank use ass character condition make credit decisions. this advantage community bank fundamental effectiveness cannot match model algorithms, matter sophisticated. the ibm computer program watson may play mean game jeopardy, i would trust judge creditworthiness fledgling local business build longstanding personal relationship customer borrowers. give important role community bank play local economies, federal reserve keenly interest health collective future. local communities, range small town urban neighborhoods, foundation u.s. economy community need community bank help grow prosper. a i’m sure aware, financial crisis aftermath hit community bank especially hard, institution continue need time repair balance sheets. although yet would like be, good news many community bank recover report strong performance. indeed, despite bad economic condition since great depression strain balance sheets, community bank already part meet credit need customers, notably include small business customers. we spend lot time federal reserve try understand promote lend small businesses, one interest thing find small business lend contract overall mid-2008 2010, contraction 2 bi central bankers’ speech uniform. in fact, majority small bank (in case, asset $250 million less) actually increase small business lend period. and bank asset $250 million $1 billion show slight decline small business lend period, contraction nearly sharp large banks. this hard evidence underscore important benefit relationship banking, particularly period unusual economic financial stress. community bank federal reserve you may recall remark group last year, i note decentralize structure federal reserve system, 12 reserve bank 24 branch locate city across country, design ensure local insight information would incorporate deliberation board federal open market committee. during debate lead passage dodd-frank wall street reform consumer protection act, emphasize supervisory responsibility state-chartered bank member federal reserve system bank hold company size provide valuable economic information grass-roots level would difficult replace, also give u full picture nation’s financial system. at time, range expertise federal reserve develop make monetary policy engagement financial system allow u bring unique insight value-added supervisory activities. fortunately, congress decide preserve federal reserve’s exist supervisory authority small well large bank organizations. it also broaden federal reserve’s connection main street add hundred thrift hold company institution supervise. we delight that, supervision, gather economic intelligence, activity community affair department around country, able remain fully engage grass-roots america. the federal reserve undertake several recent initiative enhance interaction community bank ensure fully take perspective unique characteristic account policymaking. first, many years, board committee governor provide oversight bank supervisory regulatory matters. although many committee’s effort wake financial crisis understandably focus large complex bank organizations, board belief important sharpen focus small bank organization well. a result, recently establish special supervision subcommittee focus community bank small regional institutions. this subcommittee chair former longtime community banker, governor betsy duke, also include former state bank commissioner, governor sarah bloom raskin. the subcommittee provide leadership oversight variety matter relate specifically supervision community small regional banks.1 in particular, subcommittee review new policy proposal lens effect proposal could small institutions, term safety soundness potential regulatory burden. among things, subcommittee also monitor federal reserve’s work relationship state bank supervisors, particularly important share supervisory responsibility state member banks. we also undertake initiative solicit feedback community bank regular basis. in october, board announce would form community depository institution advisory council provide insight information economy, lend 1 for supervisory purposes, federal reserve generally consider bank organization asset $10 billion le community bank organization asset $10 billion $50 billion regional bank organizations. bi central bankers’ speech 3 conditions, issue interest community banks.2 to make council representative possible, 12 reserve bank local advisory council comprise representative banks, thrift institutions, credit unions; one member local council serf national council meet board twice year washington. local meet already begun, first meet national council board take place soon. personally, i look forward hear community banker issue range local economy regulatory reform. community bank regulatory reform a know, key challenge community bank year ahead adapt change regulatory environment, particularly regulatory reform contain dodd-frank act, well change associate basel iii reforms. we certainly aware appreciate concern community bank regulatory changes, and, i described, step effort understand concern respond appropriate. i think worth emphasize change see financial regulatory architecture principally direct large complex financial firms, include nonbanks. consequently, one benefit reform creation level play field financial institution sizes. focus reform largest, complex financial firm make sense. the recent financial crisis highlight fact financial firm grow large, leveraged, interconnect failure could pose threat overall financial stability. the sudden collapse major financial firm among destabilize event crisis. the crisis also demonstrate inadequacy exist framework supervising, regulating, otherwise constrain risk major financial firm well toolkit government time manage failure. a i discuss last year’s meeting, major thrust dodd-frank act address too-big-to-fail problem mitigate threat financial stability pose systemically important financial firms. the too-big-to-fail problem pernicious one number substantial harmful effects. critically, reduce incentive shareholders, creditors, counterparties firm discipline excessive risk-taking. and produce competitive distortion enable firm large systemic footprint fund cheaply firm implicit subsidy too-big-to-fail status. this competitive distortion unfair small firm damage competition today, also spur growth large firm consolidation concentration financial industry. a financial system dominate too-big-to-fail firm cannot healthy financial system. the act address too-big-to-fail problem multi-pronged approach. under it, develop more-stringent prudential standard bank firm asset great $50 billion nonbank financial firm designate systemically important financial stability oversight council. these more-stringent standard include strong capital leverage requirements, liquidity requirements, single-counterparty credit limits, well requirement periodically produce resolution plan conduct stress tests. our goal produce well-integrated set rule meaningfully reduce probability failure largest, complex financial firm minimize loss financial system economy firm fail. in so, aim force firm take account cost impose broad financial 2 this group replace former thrift institution advisory council, provide board useful information perspective thrift institution credit unions. 4 bi central bankers’ speech system, soak implicit subsidy firm enjoy due market perception systemic importance, give firm regulatory incentive shrink systemic footprint. complement efforts, federal reserve work time regulatory agency central bank around world design implement strong set prudential requirement large, internationally active bank firms. these effort include agreement reach december major element new basel iii prudential framework large, globally active banks. basel iii make financial system stable reduce likelihood future financial crisis require large bank hold better-quality capital more-robust liquidity buffers. a stable financial system benefit bank institution and, course, economy whole. we work adopt basel iii framework unite state timely manner. a central issue bank agency face implement basel iii unite state decide capital rule apply bank systemic internationally active. we recognize importance strike right balance promote safety soundness throughout bank system keep compliance cost small bank firm low possible. also, minimize impact new capital rule credit availability global economy still recovering, international colleague agree allow long transition period implementation new standards. in addition strict regulation supervision large financial firms, dodd-frank act place new check growth acquisition major financial firms. it expand current restraint acquisition bank hold company include broad range acquire firm (not banks) broad range liability (not deposits). this expansion reflect financial system change important way since 1994, congress first adopt concentration limit bank bank hold companies. the act also impose new restriction capital market activity bank firm – restriction disproportionately affect structure profitability large bank firms. for example, so-called volcker rule restrict ability bank firm engage proprietary trade security derivative invest sponsor private investment funds. among important aspect act measure authorize reduce financial economic effect failure large firms. a clear lesson past year government must force choose bail systemically important firm fail disorderly disruptive manner. instead, need tool resolve fail firm manner preserve market discipline – ensure shareholder creditor incur loss culpable manager replace – time cushion broad financial system possibly destabilize effect firm’s collapse. of course, framework place bank several decade now, know. the dodd-frank act create analogous framework systemically important nonbank financial firms, include bank hold companies. resolve large, multinational financial firm safely likely always difficult challenge, great deal work remain do make new authority fully effective. ultimately, though, change mitigate moral hazard financial system reduce expectation government support creditor counterparties large firms. take together, measure i describe give u financial system safer, efficient, equitable. in short, two key objective financial regulatory reform are, first, address problem emerge largest, complex financial firm crisis and, second, create good balance respect regulation oversight bank nonbank financial firms. the federal reserve belief right goal bi central bankers’ speech 5 reform. we commit work u.s. financial regulatory agency implement act relate reform manner achieve law’s key objective appropriately take account risk profile business model small bank firms, include community banks. before i conclude remarks, let say word transfer thrift hold company supervisory authority federal reserve. we work closely office thrift supervision, office comptroller currency, federal deposit insurance corporation make transfer smooth possible, progress far good. the federal reserve belief company control depository institution hold appropriate prudential standards, include capital, liquidity, risk management. a such, intend create oversight regime thrift hold company consistent with, rigorous as, supervisory regime apply bank hold companies. that said, appreciate thrift bank hold company differ important ways, play different role economy, remain govern different statutes. we mindful difference unique characteristic thrift industry develop supervisory approach thrift hold companies. conclusion my colleague, governor duke, recently tell examiner “community banker creative, committed, stubborn, resilient.” i know won’t mind repeat sentiment here, i’m sure community banker room would wear word badge honor. community bank face substantial challenge month year come, include still-difficult economic conditions, continue uncertainty real estate key markets, change regulatory environment. but community bank face difficult time before, industry remain vibrant resilient. i confident community bank successfully navigate new challenge well. thank every day meet need

answer lie outlook public private consumption. it surprise public sector spend act dampener growth uk economy government rebalances finances. we experience similar phenomenon mid-1990s economy recover early ninety recession. but episode, private consumption resilient, increase annual rate 3% year five year 1993–97. most forecaster currently much downbeat private consumption, similar view underpin bank england’s inflation report forecast. an important contributor weakness private consumption – particularly year – squeeze household income high inflation. indeed, money terms, household consumer spend rise 5% last year – strong nominal consumption growth bi central bankers’ speech 7 since 2000. but squeeze rise price limit real growth le 1%. with consumer price inflation remain high, pattern likely continue year. most forecaster assume limit upward pressure wage high inflation short-term, partly downward influence relatively high unemployment partly rise inflation expect temporary. the late consensus forecast average earn growth pick 3% 2012 current underlie rate increase 2.3%. however, income data service already report pay settlement move 2.8% private sector, push number pay deal link retail price index. in judgement, upside risk inflation consumption growth strong rebound wage growth recovery proceeds. this one reason – though one – i believe current inflation report forecast inflation fall back 2% target relatively optimistic. the behaviour wage consumption therefore important influence outlook growth inflation next couple years, clearly area monetary policy committee monitor closely. with import price pressure vat add inflation short-term, surprise see squeeze real income relatively subdue consumer spend first half year. but wage increase start pick current forecast suggest response persistently high headline inflation, likely see combination strong consumption growth high medium term inflation. this scenario, i see quite likely, would reinforce case raise uk interest rate head inflationary pressures. economic growth uk monetary policy the uk’s monetary policy framework focus objective price stability, currently define term 2% target cpi inflation. there good reason make achievement price stability centrepiece monetary policy uk, many country follow approach. while monetary policy affect growth rate economy short term, medium long term, economic growth drive supply side factor – enterprise, innovation, investment skills. attempt boost growth solely loose monetary policy policy – experience 1970s late 1980s – end create great economic instability almost certainly hamper longer-term growth prospects. the best contribution monetary policy make support underlie force growth therefore foster climate stability – primarily term level price also seek promote relatively stable demand climate avoid potentially destabilise lurch policy. a i already noted, need stabilise uk economy face massive global financial shock late 2008 early 2009 fully justify large cut bank rate injection quantitative ease mpc make time. but economy grow inflation run persistently 2% target, large degree monetary stimulus long appropriate danger create instability growth inflation, rather stabilise economy monetary policy should. one justification frequently use maintain current monetary policy set “output gap” model inflation process. accord view world, stabilise growth keep inflation target two side coin. weak growth build margin spare capacity push inflation, whereas strong growth likely associate capacity work build-up inflationary pressures. the uk economy appear conform model first decade mpc, recently break long act reliable guide policy-setting. 8 bi central bankers’ speech in speech last month, i set reason might case.6 first, relationship spare capacity inflationary pressure may much complex simple model suggest – particularly service sector dominate uk economy. second, accommodative policy pursue depth recession allow company pas cost increase may encourage company believe price power past. we see evidence today strong price expectation continue register manufacturer cbi survey. and, third, uk open international economy. global price pressure value pound appear great impact inflation rate domestic margin spare capacity. there criticism make “output gap” view world. measure “output gap” frequently revised, partly gdp data revision partly change view trend capacity level output truly lies. for reasons, “output gap” notoriously difficult measure real time.7 indeed, quite significant revision gdp profile early 1990s recession initial estimates. and already see revision gdp data recession recovery – example rise 2009 fourth quarter gdp growth revise provisional estimate 0.1% 0.5% space twelve months. for reasons, i believe need particularly wary base monetary policy present fine judgement current future growth economy. the mpc’s remit clearly couch term keep consumer price inflation target responsibility take action see sort significant upside deviation experienced, recently, number year now. most evidence suggest recovery underway likely continue, even though pace growth somewhat uncertain. there upside risk growth outlook well downside concerns. the world economy grow strongly major factor underlie current inflationary pressure global energy commodity prices. and strong response wage growth current high headline inflation could support strong growth consumption forecaster currently expect. we enter period uk monetary policy-making judgement make mpc much le straightforward appear financial crisis. the global climate inflationary seem unlikely margin spare capacity uk economy prevent current inflationary pressure become embedded, without monetary policy tightened. we hear news today cpi inflation rise – 4.4% – could easily rise 5% late year. once business individual come expect high inflation – increase sign begin – expectation much hard dislodge. in environment, inflation run considerably target level set rise further, failure take timely monetary policy action risk abrupt destabilise rise interest rate future. that surely something business represent today would want see. and could much big threat future economic growth gradual increase interest rate i argue since middle last year. 6 see sentance (2011). 7 this point repeatedly

mukete, assistant governor bank namibia, launch namibia consumer trust, windhoek, 15 march 2011. * * * director ceremonies, executive director namibia trust – mr michael gawaseb, the chairperson namibia consumer trust – mr sandi tjarondo, the board trustee consumer right trust, distinguish invite guests, member media, lady gentlemen, it great pleasure today witness launch namibia consumer trust. my research indicate trust first kind set advocate right consumer namibia. the launch come opportune time many namibian find without appropriate avenue find redress right infringe often feel powerless stand giant business financial sector. it view mind bank namibia regard initiative welcome development time concert effort make ass regulatory landscape consumer protection measures. this dozen piece law develop many decade ago, surely outlive usefulness. it therefore take much determine effort coordination audience room, also across sectoral regulator government institution address inefficacy exist laws. it worth note law reform and development commission already issue public invitation effect i wish urge participate indispensable exercise. director ceremonies, lady gentleman allow ask rhetoric question, financial regulator concern right consumer financial services? lack information – “information asymmetry” consumer financial service provider place customer disadvantage. consumer protection therefore seek level play field supplier consumer financial services. financial service fact often complicated, often involve large amount money individuals. it true need consumer protection unique financial area. nevertheless, considerable difference degree compare areas, partly often difficult even hindsight ass quality financial services. in namibian case, challenge face protect exist customers, need put effort bring estimate 51% population exclude mainstream financial services. it background, bank namibia recognize need advocate financial inclusion one new key strategic focus. director ceremonies, empirical research reveal financial exclusion ally phenomenon amongst others; lack financial education, lack consumer protection therefore, financial discrimination; lack suitable product services. my speech today focus mainly consumer protection ministry finance go present collective strategy financial literacy. bi central bankers’ speech 1 director ceremonies, lady gentlemen, let inform role bank namibia consumer protection issue arise financial service provider fall within purview. there many piece legislation directly administer bank, bear consumer protection. i highlight late speech i introduce initiative strategy aim specifically consumer bank services. these law allow bank, among others, act prudential regulator supervisor commercial bank ensure customers’ deposit investment safe. concomitantly, bank ensure bank license process “fit proper” person permit manage bank institution prevent potential depositor loose money scrupulous persons. director ceremonies, i equally honour express current future initiative pursue bank namibia area consumer protection. these include recent enactment bank institution amendment act 2010, enable bank recommend minister finance issue regulation unfair term contract commercial bank customers. by nature, bank service often require customer enter agreement banks. sometimes unaware right without afford opportunity study agree certain contractual term conditions, customer desperation service sign contracts, end bind extend periods. these contract present consider bind customers, irrespective onerous, unreasonable unexpected term might be. a bank regulator, bank namibia interest encourage standard good bank practice whereby commercial bank act fairly reasonably relation customers. it background addition possible regulation unfair terms, bank busy develop code good bank practice. the code shall set bank industry’s key commitment obligation customer standard practice, disclosure principle conduct relation bank services. director ceremonies, term best practices, code shall provide contract commercial bank customer shall clear, plain simple terms, understand special knowledge required. a good example draw president obama sign new credit card bill right law, challenge industry create simple, easy understand credit card agreement “don’t need law degree magnify glass understand.” this mean eliminate provision confuse terminology use lawyer reason tradition habit, replace legalistic plain-language, introduce information design enhance readability comprehension. it thus intention bank contract simple, short, preferable design fit one two pages. the key aspect code enforce good lend practice bank avoid over-indebtedness. bank will, therefore, expect act best interest customer ensure know understand customer’s needs, offer product service suitable needs, provide information enable make inform choices. the code require bank place effective complaint handle procedure appropriate timeline within complaint deal with. this also mean bank direct first “port-of-call” offer redress customers, dedicate complaint desk handle customer grievances. at juncture i wish inform bank namibia, together industry, issue say draft code good bank practice, course year public comments. therefore, director ceremonies, i humbly request audience present room spend time justice consumer protection initiatives, 2 bi central bankers’ speech bi central bankers’ speech 3 agree close heart provide extensive comment bank draft consultative paper. director ceremonies, lady gentlemen, the initiative pursue bank namibia sister regulator, namibia financial institution supervisory authority, establishment financial service ombuds office, term draft financial institution market bill. this office finance resourced two institutions. it expect serve additional mechanism redress consumer aggrieve financial service providers. director ceremonies, lady gentleman in another attempt protect consumers, bank namibia wish use unique occasion warn consumer persistent mushroom pyramid scheme relate schemes. these type entity start proliferate namibia ordinary citizen continuously lure unbelievable testimony opportunity get poverty. the downside however, entire families, household even pensioner target may loose hard earn cash suffer hand schemes. in effort protect consumer general public, bank institution amendment act 2010 make participation operation scheme criminal offence. before i conclude, director ceremonies, kindly permit opportunity inform audience 2010, payment system management amendment act promulgate give bank mandate authority regulate bank fee charge necessary. thus, act enable bank namibia set standard protect consumer exploit exorbitant fee charges. chronologically, i sure audience agree start point cash deposit fee main barrier majority people want open maintain account commercial banks. accordingly, bank namibia’s intention focus cash deposit fee individual smes 2011.the standard also call compulsory introduction low-cost basic retail bank account, treat public utility rather money make product commercial banks. it worth mention commercial bank already place similar account. all efforts, lady gentlemen, built-in mechanism gear towards enforce consumer protection. in conclusion, director ceremonies, initiative namibia consumer trust certainly potential become vehicle large scale consumer protection initiatives. the bank namibia please associate launch initiative today. we commit maintain enhance market confidence strong, fair progressive way, cannot alone. regulation complex balance act collaboration regulators, industry consumer make work financial system whole. the bank belief strong relationship consumer trust enhance important role play influence policy strategic outcomes. my final message context is, therefore, invitation consider support develop strong relationships, communicate consumer together grassroots level ensure position make inform confident financial decisions. i sure long difficult road get today, launch certainly remove obstacle road ahead. i therefore wish urge continue work hard towards objective protect educate consumer namibia right sector economy. director ceremonies, lady gentlemen, i thank kind attention. prasarn trairatvorakul: live capital flow – delicate balance act speech mr prasarn trairatvorakul, governor bank thailand, 5th annual euromoney thailand investment forum, live capital flows: delicate balance act, bangkok, 22 march 2011. * * * lady gentlemen, it’s honor speak today 5th annual euromoney thailand investment forum. since yesterday, must already hear many interest discussion thailand’s prospects. here, i would like reaffirm thailand indeed recovery path. over long horizon, prospect asean integration rise asia also offer cause optimism. a international investors, naturally would want participate thailand’s excite prospects. before put money thailand, however, i suspect would want understand macro-policy environment. our recovery gain momentum, central bank echo vigilance regard inflationary pressures. meanwhile, global environment suggest capital likely flow economy. in complex situation, i believe might want know central bank’s view stance are. since majority capital markets, focus talk today relate capital inflows. capital inflow always continue welcome thailand. indeed, capital inflow vital thailand’s development. for past 30 years, capital inflow help finance country’s productive capacity thus help raise standard live million thais. go forward, capital expect flow region least two reasons, namely, growth differential emerge asia advance economy change nature global liquidity. on first reason, strong growth momentum asia likely draw capital. this factor especially strong advance economy continue cope legacy crisis. in contrast, asia survive global crisis relatively well. recent number show asia’s growth past year drive external internal demand. for year, momentum expect continue, rapid growth middle class large asian economy china india make prospect intra-regional demand even hopeful long horizon. another development worth note change nature global liquidity, particular, increase fluidity likely push capital flow emerge asia easily could also lead easy capital flow reversal condition change. this rise fluidity global liquidity seem roots, least part, macro policy advance economies. specifically, large fiscal debt quantitative ease advance economy help contribute rise fluidity. first, large fiscal burden many advance economy alter risk profile supposedly risk-free asset government securities. a line traditionally risk-free risky asset become blurred, investor would will search yield switch back forth asset easily. second, although money use advance economies’ central bank purchase security end mainly bank system time being, quantitative ease help raise investors’ risk appetite. on one hand, qe likely make bi central bankers’ speech 1 recovery advance economy bite firm improve consumer business sentiment. with that, investors’ risk-appetite risen, drive investor risky assets, include commodity emerge market securities. on hand, qe drive yield advance economies. the combination rise risk-appetite low yield advance economy push investor search high yield elsewhere thus make commodity emerge market security attractive. of course, must note despite alter risk profiles, government security advance economy likely remain ultimate safe assets. a such, portion capital flow could reverse easily risk appetite wanes. experience show so-called “risk aversion” episode could coincide large withdrawal fund emerge market back advance economies. these fluctuation capital flow could potentially pose important challenge emerge markets. while capital inflow generally beneficial, mean cost-free. potentially, large inflow capital lead exchange rate overshooting, hurt segment real sector may trouble adjusting. moreover, could seep speculative activity drive asset prices. especially vulnerable real estate equity markets. a market heat up, capital inflow often find way in, create potential bubbles. invariably bubble burst, balance sheet firms, individuals, bank well government affected. the burst bubbles, couple capital outflows, could devastate effects. the asian crisis decade ago good reminder us. currently, bank thailand set tool disposal help economy deal effectively capital inflows. these tool include (1) flexible exchange rate foreign exchange market intervention, (2) macro-prudential measures, (3) capital account regulations. together, tool indeed powerful, careful coordination require use them. let briefly elaborate use each. in framework, flexible exchange rate core tool, since act automatic stabilizer towards capital inflow general. a capital pour in, especially drive favorable growth potential economy, flexible exchange rate act automatic stabilizer would help lessen chance overheat dampen pressure asset price otherwise might turn bubble. exchange rate adjustment face large capital inflows, however, without costs. an excessively rapid appreciation currency could disruptive real economy, since often constraint adjustment real economy, labor market friction price behaviors. here challenge need balance well. in general, would allow currency appreciate extent movement broadly consistent economic fundamental would cause undue disruption real sector. let note i think thai economy, years, become capable cop exchange rate movements. we see risk protection via financial market instrument part private sector. exporters, particular, able diversify term product line market destinations. nevertheless, time time still need dampen pressure exchange rate, central bank often resort exchange rate intervention. while intervention could help contain excess exchange rate volatility, focus end process. in word, fx intervention “passive” mechanism deal capital inflows. by time intervention, capital would already flow economy. imbalance could already build up. furthermore, market expectation upside currency gain persist, could invite even capital inflows, along great pressure exchange rate high chance imbalance buildup future. for real economy, may delay necessary adjustments. finally, fx intervention costless. we fund intervention local interest rate high would earn international reserves. 2 bi central bankers’ speech experience also show that, even large appreciation currency, capital inflow could still seep fuel speculative activity market real estate equity. to help deal specific pocket economy show sign potential bubbles, macro-prudential measure could used. a recent example risk-weights adjustment relate loan-to-value (ltv) ratio loan make property purchases. while macro-prudential measure aim help lessen effect capital already flow economy, capital account regulation use deal directly size type incoming outgo flows. with aim create balance capital flows, bank thailand continue liberalize capital outflows, inflow side time resort tight regulation situation deem necessary. implement capital account regulation, le it, require delicate balance act. for outflow liberalization, one hand allow thai resident outflow beneficial help lessen upward pressure currency well improve investment profile thai private sector toward diversify possibly efficient one. on hand, risk assessment capacity local investor remain low, rapid outflow liberalization could make country’s balance sheet vulnerable rather robust. a balance act even difficult apply re-regulation capital inflows. a measure mild would lack effectiveness, drastic measure would costly. for one thing, distortionary effect would large; another, increase policy uncertainty could turn away productive investor raise country’s risk premium. aware undesirable side effect controls, would limit use absolutely necessary temporary basis. on use interest rate policy, may view policy interest rate another tool deal capital flows, public debate whether recent hike policy interest rate bank thailand consistent think recent capital flow developments. specifically, many argue hike would actually induce capital inflow add pressure currency. on issue, let say following. under inflation targeting, policy interest rate use primarily help maintain price stability achieve long-term balance growth domestic economy. designate policy rate another role, like manage capital flows, would confuse primary role, especially risk overheat together surge capital inflow present policymakers dilemma. thus, interest rate policy mean deal directly capital flows. it side effect capital flow is, however, ignored. a fine balance act also need come make interest rate decision give dilemma. perceivably, large interest rate differential may push factor capital flows. however, give relatively small interest rate differential thailand major economies, view gradual increase policy rate cause inflows. in fact, empirically find factor growth differential global risk appetite liquidity far important interest rate differential explain recent surge capital inflow country. on hand, give pickup global domestic demand recovery, risk inflation recently materialize pose increase threat domestic price stability. with considerations, deem recent interest rate normalization necessary consistent inflation targeting, impact capital inflow minimal. so let recap challenge. capital inflow beneficial cost-free. to help deal capital inflow effect macro economy, flexible exchange rate, macro-prudential measures, various form capital account regulation tools, policy rate preserve primary objective domestic price stability. each tool advantage disadvantages. to deal challenge, may already notice, balance use tool needed, balance could well evolve time. bi central bankers’ speech 3 4 bi central bankers’ speech lady gentlemen, to live successfully capital flow require central bank work properly. for u forum, i believe make easy thailand cope capital flows, least partly, capital market development. an efficient capital market like good irrigation system help channel flow productive uses. such market, enough breadth, could also become shock-absorber towards capital inflows, quantity-wise, would complement flexible exchange rate act “price-wise” shock absorber. a market wide variety product instruments, vary type investors, well competitive service likely stable benefit u all. an efficient capital market thus one aim strive for. i hope i far convince live capital inflow easy require effort public well private sector. indeed, successfully live capital flow delicate task, title speech suggests. on part, i want assure bank thailand aware interrelate issue always take account make policy. tough choices, however, always made. we try best balance different stakeholders’ needs. for you, investors, take point value policy transparency, aim provide such, addition macro-stability override mandate. thank you. bi central bankers’ speech 1 mario draghi: the

the euro: idea go back long way the idea single currency, place congeries local national monies, gain much grind modern europe second half nineteenth century. why that? it would natural think universal currency timeless aspiration: extend traditional function therefore advantage money wide geographical sphere. a possible explanation redistributive use money put centuries: classical antiquity middle ages, adjust currency – increase reduce gold silver content metal coin – often way prince appropriate resources; strike coin attribute sovereignty. it take long time reach point,

council european central bank (ecb). it fall one half compare previous two decades; reduction great see unite state period. in italy, average annual increase consumer price bi central bankers’ speech 3 five percentage point low twenty-year period precede introduction euro. today exogenous price shock modest repercussion euro-area economies: increase oil price 2007 2008 comparable, real terms, end 1970s, generate one-off rise consumer price le two percentage points, take hold inflation, contrast happen past several country area. accord estimates, inflationary effect italy shock kind reduce one tenth 1970s. of course, structural change production process play part, credibility earn monetary policy result change price wage set play crucial role. price stability low risk premium lead low nominal real interest rates, thereby foster economic growth. from introduction euro today, real three-month interest rate italy average 1 per cent, four percentage point low previous decade; average nominal rate bank loan house purchase short-term loan non-financial firm average 4.5 5.5 per cent respectively, compare 11.3 12.6 per cent ten previous years. it surely monetary condition responsible growth difficulty italian economy. again reference twelve year euro, annual expenditure interest payment italy’s public debt average 5.3 per cent gdp, 11.5 per cent first half 1990s 7.5 per cent 1980s. it still case today that, despite strong pressure government security market country area, yield italian ten-year security line average record last decade. the response euro-area monetary policy global crisis last three year rapid decisive. inflation expectation hold firm even height crisis, allow u take action keep market working, support lend avert collapse economy. money market rate reduce close zero; exceptional liquidity creation measure adopted. without union, simply coordinate national decision would produce rapid effective results. some countries, include own, could overcome crisis. but credibility earn necessarily last ever; remain vigilant safeguard price stability. the culture stability must also extend fields: fiscal policy, structural reform weakness emerge european construction, clearly recent sovereign debt crisis. the sovereign debt crisis euro-area country the strain spread outwards greece, generate disorder country’s public finances, hit irish portuguese government security market last spring. spanish italian government bond also see yield spread widen respect correspond german securities. the response european institution government follow rough path. the financial support plan greece, agree begin may 2010 euro-area country european commission imf, eliminate tensions, which, contrary, spread stock, bond interbank markets. to contain contagion risk pose countries, several day late eu council institute financial stabilization arrangement country area could get loan analogous condition apply imf similar circumstances. it 4 bi central bankers’ speech decide bulk resource would come european financial stability facility (efsf), new body authorize fund market issue security guarantee country euro area. in day number country adopt announce drastic plan consolidation public finances. in month may 2010, govern council ecb come conclusion tension market compromise monetary policy transmission mechanism. it launch security market programme purchase public security issue euro-area country view support market segment hit especially hard crisis; confirm commitment supply abundant liquidity system. this imply monetary finance sovereign state creation liquidity; intervention temporary sterilized. this set measure stem tensions, nevertheless begin intensify summer even final part year, affect greek bond portugal especially ireland, issue government guarantee bank liabilities. at end november eu finance minister approve plan financial support ireland. this measure help allay eliminate tensions, context elevate uncertainty market regard prospect stabilization country hit crisis possible interconnection sovereign risk vulnerability bank systems. the crisis originate imbalance country concern public finances, others bank system. overcome difficulty first require drastic, resolute national measures. the stance monetary policy expansionary long time: since may 2009 eurosystem’s reference interest rate hold 1 per cent, exceptionally low level; real short-term rate remain negative wide margin even start cyclical recovery. the emergence inflationary pressure call careful evaluation timetable manner proceed normalization monetary conditions. a deterioration expectation must prevented, keep impulse originate international price transmit domestic price wage thereby influence inflation beyond short term. a president trichet recall occasion meet begin march, govern council ecb remain prepare act firm timely manner ensure risk materialize. we follow tragic event japan close heartfelt attention. the exchange rate intervention agree 18 march finance minister central bank governor g7 country intend prevent excessive volatility exchange rate adverse effect economic financial stability. a construction strengthen the sovereign debt crisis bring light least two factor fragility european construction. in first place, rule avert imprudent fiscal policy countries, either unable unwilling exploit positive phase economic cycle order consolidate public finances. each country give specific medium-term objective budget position, agree european level: position balance surplus, depend specific sensitivity economic cycle interest rates; objective subject review light long-term factor population age debt level. in addition, country whose public debt exceed 60 per cent gdp reduce “at satisfactory pace”. when global crisis came, many country still far achieve objectives. bi central bankers’ speech 5 second, system multilateral surveillance prevent pronounce macroeconomic imbalances: productivity differentials, current account deficits, excessive private sector borrowing. in 2009, deficit current account balance payment amount 10 per cent greece 7.5 per cent portugal. in ireland, portugal spain, financial debt household firm amount one half two time euro-area average 170 per cent gdp (in italy equal 130 per cent). in ireland, large national bank balance-sheet asset total five time gdp; collapse property price recession cause huge losses. imbalance kind ultimately repercussion public finances, even country initially order. in irish case, public resource spend support bank come 20 per cent gdp. last autumn european commission work group lead european council president herman van rompuy put forward proposal concern aspects: make stability growth pact cogent; extend surveillance macroeconomic developments. it propose pact strengthen prevention fiscal imbalances, intensify monitor introduce timely monetary sanctions, adjustment, provide particular possibility initiate excessive-deficit procedure deficit exceed 3 per cent gdp also reduction debt towards 60 per cent ceiling deem unsatisfactory. in macroeconomic field, system monitor imbalance potentially significant implication euro area’s financial stability envisaged, quantitative indicator critical threshold base european council may issue recommendation country concern and, serious cases, apply financial sanctions. lastly, recommend efsf replace 2013 onwards permanent mechanism financial support, european stability mechanism (esm). only country consider solvent would access financing, would conditional case adopt serious adjustment plans; others would ask negotiate debt restructure plan private creditor return situation solvency. on 15 march eu finance minister agree “general approach” fully implement recommendation commission van rompuy work group. in particular, approve proposal introduce numerical rule – one twentieth debt-to-gdp ratio excess 60 per cent ceiling – annual reduction debt. several day early head state government euro area increase effective lend capacity efsf €440 billion set future esm €500 billion; also decide exceptional circumstance fund mechanism could purchase euro-area countries’ government security primary market. the pact euro, measures, widen focus attention include macroeconomic imbalances, strengthen budget discipline area, improve mechanism support country get financial difficulty. this necessary step avoid dangerously sap community spirit lifeblood euro. the measure base correct principles. the technical negotiate effort involve substantial; result encourage yet sufficient. discussion pact continue policymaking fora; deficiency point hazy corrected. fiscal policy surveillance need rely automatic procedure limit politicization public account far possible avert possible collusive conduct countries. several aspect complex reform european governance still require attention work. it necessary, example, determine precision 6 bi central bankers’ speech “relevant factors” consider assess adequacy pace public debt reduction; identify set indicator serve signal situation macroeconomic imbalance relate critical thresholds; establish criterion evaluate country’s solvency. concern structural policy boost potential output competitiveness, pact, time being, rely procedure base peer pressure, case lisbon strategy worked. the commitment national government remain central. we must forget golden rule: increase economy’s growth potential consolidate public budget national priority first all. government pursue even independently european rules, good peoples, special commitment country farthest objectives. italy’s situation between 2008 2009, global crisis full swing, italy’s budget deficit rise 2.7 5.4 per cent gdp; discretionary policy contribute increase.2 the deficit euro area whole tripled, rise 6.3 per cent. in 2010 deficit decline 4.6 per cent italy, euro area remain unchanged accord european commission estimates. the government’s management account facilitate fact solidity italian bank system require significant aid charge public budget. italy’s public debt, already high, rise again. it management prudent; average residual maturity lengthen progressively, notwithstanding context remain uncertain volatile. the financial condition firm household solid whole. savers’ propensity invest high-risk financial instrument low; debt limited, although concentrate variable-rate liabilities, inherently riskier. the italian economy’s problem – well worth recall – structural difficulty growth. the arduous task economic policy change situation time reduce ratio public debt gdp. to rebuild solid primary surplus rapidly elude need take measure structurally support growth: challenge. raise tax rate question: would jeopardize objective growth penalize honest taxpayer unbearably; indeed, rate ought gradually low headway make reduce tax evasion avoidance. the option control spending, selective approach distinguish foster growth impede it. wise political choice must necessarily base detail assessment effects, include macroeconomic effects, every expenditure item. the attentive multilateral surveillance sustainability public budget envisage new pact feared; help us. the reform already carry out, especially pension reform, put u among country require small correction budget balance ensure long-run stability. the new european rule debt reduction would much tight constraint u one already impose exist rule structural budget balance. it estimate 2 see

successfully play lead role since 1950s.” one hundred fifty year ago italian undertake equally important construction: country’s monetary unification, would consolidate political unification attained. these two historical event join ideal continuity. for us, present future euro also continuation long history. 3 see ignazio visco, “la governance economica europea: riforma e implicazioni”, remark deliver university l’aquila twentieth anniversary economics faculty, 8 march 2011 (only italian). jean-claude trichet: reform emu – time bold decision speech mr jean-claude trichet, president european central bank, conference group progressive alliance socialist democrat european parliament “what future euro?”, frankfurt, 18 march 2011. * * * lady gentlemen, honourable member european parliament, it pleasure opportunity speak conference afternoon. we meet time multiple challenge world. for three half year now, focus challenge economy society unfold financial crisis. but tragic event japan past week remind u even great threats. the potential impact earthquake aftermath japanese economy world economy something think deeply come day discuss friend bank japan. for moment, heartfelt think people japan, whose life whose livelihood see havoc. your conference today ask “what future euro?” in address question, i would first like speak achievement past, focus challenge ahead europe’s economic monetary union (emu). i would like reiterate explain need i call “quantum leap” economic governance europe. and i would like outline mean practice need do make quantum leap reality. 1. achievement euro first, let take brief look back history euro. have privilege serve member european central bank’s (ecb) govern council since launch euro ecb’s president past seven years, i report achieve great deal. all european take pride achievements. the key understand current challenge recall specific construction modern economic monetary union rest two separate economic monetary pillars. under monetary pillar, europe: single currency, single monetary policy single central bank system – ecb core. the economic pillar decentralised, responsibility fiscal economic policy hand individual countries. these policy steer overall rule coordinate ensure national economic policy fully compatible fact single currency without part political federation. when work properly, structure balance independence nation economic interdependence heart emu. it represent approach sovereignty shared, mean neither exclusively national exclusively european. when emu first established, many people ask monetary union could function effectively europe sovereign states. the answer function effectively appropriate economic union. bi central bankers’ speech 1 2. the “m” emu let discus two pillar little detail, first “m” emu. in monetary policy terms, ecb clear assignment: deliver price stability. accord primary mandate, definition price stability mean inflation rate close 2% medium term. and 12 year since launch emu, average annual inflation rate euro area 1.97%. this best result major central bank euro area last 50 years. for germany, inflation rate even low average since euro launched. from 1999 2010, inflation average 1.5% per year. and achieve challenge times, period since august 2007. over years, cope burst dot com bubble, aftermath event 11 september 2001, jump oil price $145 per barrel, rise price food commodities, course bad financial crisis since great depression. yet throughout different economic shock – could either inflationary deflationary – citizen euro area remain confident commitment. proof medium- long-term inflation expectation firmly anchor line ecb’s definition price stability. observer financial market also expect year come price stability maintained. for next five years, professional forecaster currently foresee inflation precisely 2%. these achievement come expense employment. on contrary, since economic monetary union began, employment euro area rise 14 million, compare 8 million unite states. and achievement come expense growth either. adjust population growth differences, growth euro area almost unite state past decade, 1% per year term gdp per caput growth. 3. the “e” emu let turn economic pillar, e emu. here, need fundamental reforms. economic union fundamental counterpart monetary union. a single market single currency call solid framework handle collegial governance national fiscal policy macroeconomic policies. i recall 1989 delors report stated: “an economic monetary union could operate basis mutually consistent sound behaviour government economic agent member countries. (…) uncoordinated divergent national budgetary policy would undermine monetary stability generate imbalance real financial sector community.” the need good coordination recognise citizen europe, particularly euro area. the recent eurobarometer survey show that, average, four five euro area citizen favour great policy coordination country overcome crisis. this important: citizen want strong coordination economic fiscal policy among country euro area. european integration lead people europe appreciate value cooperation, especially difficult times. 2 bi central bankers’ speech so coordination require? at core, mean strengthen economic governance europe, project i know european parliament fully committed. let share view ecb progress make remain done. 4. the ecb’s position reform economic governance the ecb recently publish legal opinion economic governance proposals. in separate publication website, highlight 10 point call ambitious steps. we believe must draw some, appropriate lesson crisis. in essence, thrust message follows. more automatic speedy procedures, broad range enforcement tool ambitious policy requirement urgently require euro area level. but sufficient solidly anchor national level: gap eu national level must closed. an effective way achieve would swiftly implement strong national budgetary framework member states. early week, ecofin council take step forward. in particular, council accept introduction annual fiscal expenditure benchmark numerical benchmark (the 1/20th rule) debt reduction. the fact council “expects to, rule, follow recommendation commission, explain position writing” – step right direction. it would big step assurance would implement strict rules-based manner. a regard anchor objective eu fiscal coordination national budgetary frameworks, essence directive transpose national law faithfully possible, late end 2012. it would helpful eurogroup could issue formal statement effect. the ecofin council also agree framework prevention correction excessive macroeconomic imbalances, include early warn mechanism eventual sanction case euro area countries. the ecb welcome intention channel fine collect crisis resolution fund. nevertheless, view, still ambition governance warranted. 5. the need great ambition governance reform let briefly highlight main point explain find important. you see remark specific. this point time decisions, matter u complex. parliament receive 2000 amendment six legal texts. therefore, specificity recommendation essential. let summarise four headings. first, surveillance procedure fast automatic, include new macroeconomic surveillance framework. we see ever importance timely correction fiscal imbalances. therefore, cannot wait month even year policy corrected. in meantime, spillover would hurt member states. bi central bankers’ speech 3 in past, council often suspend procedure stability growth pact, thereby weaken credibility. this must happen again. the newly agree “comply explain” principle fiscal surveillance still leaf much room discretion. moreover, cover new macroeconomic surveillance framework. beyond this, ecb belief use reverse majority vote could extend across various surveillance provision – two regulation financial sanction euro area countries. second, enforcement tool also need effective. for example, new macroeconomic surveillance framework need provide clear incentive envisage financial sanction already first instance non-compliance. discretion reduce suspend financial sanction – either grind exceptional economic circumstance response reason request member state – strongly reduce effectiveness set wrong incentives. this permitted: help nobody. third, policy requirement ambitious match current reality euro area. the new macroeconomic surveillance framework, amend council, yet provide clear focus euro area country large current account deficits, significant loss competitiveness high level public private debt, well vulnerability challenge economic monetary union. a regard fiscal surveillance, ambitious benchmark need establish excessive deficit. the scope consider “any relevant factors” case excessive deficit clearly reduced. the adjustment path towards country’s medium-term budgetary objective also need ambition. in context, annual improvement structural balance significantly high 0.5% gdp country’s government debt exceed reference value 60% gdp, otherwise fiscal sustainability risks. fourth finally, also crucial guarantee quality independence fiscal economic analysis. we propose establishment eu advisory body recognise competence. it go without say remain weakness collection report data address immediately rigorously. these main area recommendation. it clear implementation new governance framework significant impact national policies, call enhance democratic legitimacy. a key issue anchor forthcoming reform firmly national level mean strong budgetary frameworks. for euro area countries, independent national fiscal policy institution mandatory. clear borrow framework also considered. i welcome euro area countries’ commitment 11 march transpose eu fiscal rule national legislation include sub-national levels. the ecb and, i believe, also citizen europe count european parliament drive change forward. we mandate european institution take broad perspective. we independent specific national circumstances. and think long-term, citizens. let borrow word willy brandt, speak first head government member state european community address plenary european parliamentary assembly, back 1973. “this political should, long last, carry day many national administrative egoisms, may justify individually, long tolerated. have go much astray past years, must achieve good harmonization economic policies. new decision 4 bi central bankers’ speech bi central bankers’ speech 5 need place precise obligation us, bind member state closely.” 6. the quantum leap if european parliament go direction, would provide true “quantum leap” rule regulate country make national economic policies. country need clear rule guide policy-making, sanction stray sustainable path. for still hesitate whether go far, let recall happen year ago: period generally acknowledge period economic fair weather, government decide weaken stability growth pact 2004 2005. this initiative lead euro area’s large economies. the ecb voice “grave concerns” time. government use benign year put fiscal house order. i see many acknowledge weaken pact serious misjudgement. the crisis give u opportunity. it make plain flaw stability growth pact allow countries’ fiscal policy become problem – themselves, everyone else within monetary union. we obligation fix flaws. all them. we lay grind policy towards sustainable balance growth. it growth contribute last job creation social harmony. 7. conclusion let draw conclusion. a i indicated, history euro something european take pride. i every confidence future euro one equally take pride. but get point, several improvement need make economic union. a i indicated, progress made. yet need draw lesson current situation complete work europe’s economic monetary union. we must ensure well-functioning monetary union complement equally well-functioning economic union. all do achieve common goal: union individual freedom collective respect; union responsibility cooperation; union stability prosperity. thank attention. bi central bankers’ speech 1 durmuş yilmaz: expectation global economy speech mr durmuş yilmaz, governor central bank republic turkey, leader change summit, istanbul, 15 march 2011. * * * distinguish guests, it great pleasure speak leader change summit gather politicians, decision makers, journalists, economist bureaucrat play prominent role field inspire society across world. today, i share think regard outlook global economy challenge face emerge market economy aftermath crisis. then, i discus role central bank new era. finally, i conclude remark experience turkish economy response monetary policy. distinguish guests, more two year collapse lehman brothers, dust international financial system seem somewhat abated. unprecedented measure take central bank fiscal authority put financial market back relatively steady course late 2009. a economic activity start gain pace, risk perception gradually improved, notwithstanding heighten sovereign risk euro area, concern house labor market unite states, uncertainty regard health financial institution advance economies, huge influx capital flow associate risk emerge market economies, last least, question surround pace demand rotation global economy. a long list lesson financial stability emerged, though put practice subject intense debate. the cooperation global scale key solve current problem address future ones, maintain spirit cooperation among nation get challenge memory crisis start fade away. outlook emerge market economy a know, capital flow emerge market economy intensify recently thank good growth prospects, interest rate differentials, relative stability financial institution country prove strength flexibility extreme shocks. a liquidity global financial system increase thank rapid expansion high power money major currency countries, central bank small open economy face risk lose control monetary conditions. policy rate hike contain inflationary pressure restrain credit expansion likely lead widen interest rate differentials, thereby fuel even capital inflows, borrowing, high asset price inflation. a result, emerge market economy today face grow risk asset bubbles, excessive borrow inflationary pressure – threaten financial stability. the problem face country current account deficit much challenge surplus ones, since deal financial stability problem arise strength capital flow risk sudden stops. assess whether capital flow emerge market economy permanent transitory challenge task. the current wave capital inflow reflect global push factor (including ample liquidity low interest rate across advance economies) well country-specific pull factor (including buoyant growth prospects, relatively sound fiscal positions, decrease country risk perceptions). over medium term pull factor 2 bi central bankers’ speech likely remain complacent, relative advance economies, emerge market expect grow faster, would put upward pressure interest exchange rates, perpetuate attractiveness international capital. although far certain whether quantitative ease several advance economy would persist medium term, monetary authority country likely maintain accommodative stance near future well. all all, current outlook suggest capital flow emerge market economy may permanent phenomenon, magnitude subject change risk perceptions. while tool manage large capital inflow well known, appropriate policy mix depend country-specific circumstances. fiscal policy, monetary policy, exchange rate policy, foreign exchange market intervention, macro-prudential tools, capital control could use cope inflows, entail tradeoffs, likely quite costly emerge deficit country particular. some country opt various form capital control, although effectiveness need evaluate base objective impose first place. some study find capital control compositional effect could alter maturity new investments. so far reduce volume flows, empirical evidence inconclusive. unless authority full control capital accounts, partial restriction unlikely offset impact flows, prevent appreciation local currency provide space independent monetary policy. in principle, flow capital advance economy emerge one appreciation currency latter time mutually beneficial secular trend, long support strong fundamentals, good growth prospects, high productivity differentials. rather fight trend restrictive capital control excessive reserve accumulation, strong legitimacy use macro-prudential policy mitigate adverse effect volatility capital flows, especially speculative nature, financial stability. several emerge economy start implement measure limit credit growth asset price bubbles. these measure include raise reserve requirement ratios, require high income- deposit-to-loan ratios, tighten capital adequacy requirement liquidity ratios, introduce transaction taxes, fee etc. the adequacy measure yet seen, swift proactive response policy maker positive step forward, recent event clearly demonstrate likely cost le undertake preventive measure prior crisis clean aftermath. of course, economic condition institution differ across countries. an effective macro prudential tool one country might work another country. therefore, policy maker need take country specific factor account design framework. it also imperative academic community international organization focus issue develop set concrete policy tool national authorities, discretion, use identify, ass manage systemic risks. financial stability central bank the critical importance financial stability central bank’s perspective new. smooth function financial system payment mechanism concern central bank since foundation. in fact, reason call “the bank banks” “the lender last resort” financial institutions. however, time financial system get complicate expand exponentially, supervision regulation partially transfer institutions. the challenge face central bank establish framework combine price financial stability primary mandate identify policy instrument target both, even time seem conflict other. bi central bankers’ speech 3 central bank typically calibrate short-term interest rate primary policy instrument determine monetary stance. since policy rate blunt instrument affect entire economy, use achieve target may lead unintended consequences. the level interest rate require ensure price stability differ interest rate need preserve financial stability. for example, boom period drive productivity financial innovation shocks, low policy rate would suffice contain inflation; yet level interest rate may still lead accumulation financial risks. moreover, boom periods, emerge market typically attract large capital inflow even reasonably low level interest rates. in periods, external internal equilibrium require different interest rate monetary policy use one instrument. the “tinbergen rule” suggest one instrument could employ achieve one target, case conventionally recognize price stability. there clearly need second set policy tools. this second instrument, opinion, may form macro prudential tool directly address financial activities. should authority responsibility relate financial stability centralize vest central banks? on one hand, benefit vest decision make power responsibility one institution, happen central bank, clear: coordination problem, effective communication one voice, swift response emergencies. there also downside approach. the distinction “goal independence” “instrument independence” lie foundation call central bank independence today. if central bank assume regulatory supervisory activity regard financial system become authority responsible oversight, instrument need achieve goal may reach point principle democracy necessitate much close coordination cooperation government, blur central bank’s independence. expand role central bank economy potential create strong ordinary entity democracy emphasize accountability responsibility elect officials. central bank play vital role maintain financial stability past likely future. the optimal use policy rate macro-prudential tool achieve price financial stability would define criterion assess success central bank post crisis era. during crisis, new monetary tool explore central banks. now, addition continue explore monetary policy tools, policy maker would elaborate us regulatory rule limit risk threaten financial stability design optimal institutional structure purpose find perfect balance risk lose central bank independence risk create coordination problem (between central bank regulatory supervisory agency). financial stability turkey monetary policy in second part speech, let turn financial stability turkey monetary policy start implement aftermath global financial crisis. turkey use among emerge economy high volatility particularly sensitive global risk perception throughout 1990s early 2000s. however, time headwind global crisis remain relatively subdue thank resilience financial system prudent macro policies. of course, growth rate economy drop sharply, neither price financial stability seriously jeopardized. in fact, turkey one emerge country end high credit rat pre-crisis level. a combination several factor make difference, lack excessive borrow turn key. unlike peers, leverage ratio turkey stay moderate level 4 bi central bankers’ speech period excess global liquidity, thank prudent policy bank regulatory supervision agency central bank turkey. in fact policy implement turkey since 2002 incorporate basel iii principles, countercyclical buff (banks turkey permit expand unless ratio least four percentage point legal minimum) liquidity ratio (both local foreign currency). debt level public sector also reduce significantly thank quite ambitious fiscal discipline. the real strength economy, however, come management foreign exchange risks, critical aspect small, open economy. thank prudent regulation oversight, overall fx position turkish bank sector balanced. household carry long position fx, limit exposure curreny shocks. although corporate sector carry significant fx position, debt mainly long term. all factor contribute resilience turkish economy global crisis, turn provide ample space central bank turkey implement front-loaded aggressive monetary ease without compromise price stability objective. no rescue package need support bank system. thus, government able enact modest still quite effective counter-cyclical fiscal policy midst global turmoil. since early 2010, due anemic growth external demand, current account balance deteriorate rapidly, whereas core inflation remain subdue output gap persists. recent surge capital flow toward emerge markets, include turkey, potential exacerbate divergence pace recovery domestic external demand. if pattern growth coexist rapid credit expansion deterioration current account balance, may lead financial stability concerns. these development make essential effectively utilize policy instrument policy rates. consequently, today’s challenge financial environment, likely persist foreseeable future, central bank turkey underscore four basic principle upon monetary policy would build maintain financial stability. the first one discourage excessive leverage keep debt ratio bank corporate sector modest levels. the second principle extend duration borrow private public sector, well household deposits. the third principle strengthen fx position public private sector, usually achilles’ heel emerge economy sizable current account deficit. the fourth principle good management foreign currency risk corporate sector instrument like turkish derivative exchange. in november 2010, start quantitative tighten deal rapidly increase macro imbalance drive short term capital inflow acceleration credit growth. to end raise require reserve ratio control rapid credit expansion restrict supply loanable funds. another issue consider lengthen maturity capital inflows. this important improve quality capital account, limit maturity mismatches, avoid exchange rate misalignments. to end, low policy rate widen corridor overnight borrow lend rate create extra volatility short-term interest rates. although look quite complicate first sight, framework adopt spirit significantly different conventional inflation target framework. the difference that, previously policy instrument one week repo rate, instrument “policy mix”—which consist combination short term interest rates, reserve requirement ratio interest corridor. we seek use instrument right combination order cope inflation macro-financial risks. the monetary policy stance framework determine path policy rates, mixture policy instrument outline above. just like conventional inflation target framework, policy forward look contingent economic outlook. the exact bi central bankers’ speech 5 set policy mix depend factor affect price stability financial stability. although early ass success policies, initial impact far seem promising. conclusion the recent crisis put front center rise economic power emerge countries. it also demonstrate vulnerability within global system, especially across financial markets. financial stability become major concern policy makers, potential reshape monetary policy framework central banks. significant step undertaken, significant progress still need tackle global imbalances. that involve revisit economic policies, also economic institutional infrastructure shape them. a quest new global order continue theoretical practical levels; predictability, balance sustainability new global order depend cooperative coordinate effort establish well-represented infrastructure. thank attention. bi central bankers’ speech 1 miroslav singer: the czech republic outside emu – success story bear painful lessons. a czech view resolve euro crisis speech mr miroslav singer, governor czech national bank, part omfif (official monetary financial institution forum) golden series world money, reform club, london, 28 june 2011. * * * a horrible end good endless horror. lieber ein ende mit schrecken al ein schrecken ohne ende. ferdinand von schill (1776–1808) lady gentlemen, a know, eurozone face serious problem present time. it opinion important lesson learn collapse bretton wood system early 1970s. the czech policy authority learn lesson – often hard way – first split czechoslovakia 1993, financial currency crisis hit czech republic late decade. in speech today i recall lesson examine apply order minimise cost resolve eurozone debt crisis. before go further, however, i’d like draw attention four basic – surprising, perhaps even shock – fact czech republic. first all, may come shock learn czech republic eastern european country. in fact, capital, prague, lie 90 mile west vienna. in word famous londoner – actor michael caine – “not lot people know that”. what more, czech economy west might think geographically, also economically. this bring shock fact number two. despite tepid real growth average 3%, czech economy grow 10% average recent year thank appreciation exchange rate. therefore, czech economy multiply size 4.5 time since 1993 nominal term euros. consequently, could buy average 7% p.a. core european countries’ real gdp last 18 years. and shock fact number three. despite, maybe thank to, first-hand experience financial crisis (bad loan exceed 40% gdp late 1990s), bailout need taxpayers’ money use save czech financial firm late turmoil. finally, good deal le shockingly i’m please say, czech national bank central bank, also integrate supervisor czech financial industry since 2006. this set-up give u many advantage term deal financial crisis maintain financial stability national level, hopefully also enhance understand current event eurozone. i’d like remind important event which, i feel, provide u important lesson guidance deal current crisis. the first collapse bretton wood system begin 1970s. the key lesson event so-called impossible trinity, namely impossible fix exchange rate, free capital flow independent monetary policy time. crack start appear bretton wood system 1960s result globalisation financial system enormous growth cross-border capital flows. this process accelerate expansive fiscal policy usa, foster monetary expansion, loss competitiveness u producer growth u trade deficit. a 2 bi central bankers’ speech soon rise demand dollar exchangeable gold encounter limit stock u gold reserves, credibility u dollar foundered. this loss credibility undermine foundation global monetary system built. the fall bretton wood system teach u fix exchange rate require consistent macroeconomic framework correspond coordination aspect monetary policy. various adjustment set-up might reduce partial imbalances, cause problem tackle head on, effect adjustment short-lived matter time whole system come crash down. now let’s move forward time 20 years, split czechoslovak currency follow dissolution czechoslovakia 1993. for many years, fiscal transfer mask significantly inferior performance slovak economy relative czech neighbour west. this performance gap widen closing-off slovak armament industry federal centre begin 1990s. after country split two, state goal keep common currency come market pressure czech slovak entity transfer deposit czech bank capital flow countries. a result, goal abandon le two month independent czech crown – koruna – introduced. i add cnb plan b run preparation currency split since second half 1992. consequently, decide act, able act fast. so, lesson learn event? the lack political preserve federal czechoslovak state quickly recognisable consequence common currency. a result, cost event relatively low order quickly restore new currency markets. despite u-turn decision-makers’ communication, situation easy read markets, citizen economic agent general. a year later, czech economy hit severe currency financial crisis. until 1996, czech republic maintain fix exchange rate regime generally stabilisation-oriented (restrictive) macroeconomic policies. however, entry oecd relate capital flow liberalisation create impossible triangle. this lead twin deficit attempt “half-free” exchange rate regime similar make bretton wood case. additional factor data error insufficiently credible first reform package exacerbate problems. serious worry czech national bank credibility reputation contribute mistakes. a change government make act government le predictable. the defence exchange rate end central bank without knowledge government. this cause wide rift open two authorities. a general lack coordination macroeconomic policies, possibly restrictive monetary policies, culminate severe financial crisis. the outcome costly event could, benefit hindsight, judge avoidable significant extent. general u-turn make policy authority contribute high costs. even majority market players, many decision take time difficult predict, read adjust to. the chief conclusion two czech-made episode turmoil predictable action produce lower-cost outcome unpredictable ones. this time cnb plan b, fix regime abandoned, take several month prepare first coherent monetary policy framework end fix exchange regime. all bring current parlous situation eurozone. let start observations. the eurozone’s mechanism support economic divergence rather convergence. the rule wrong, manifestly idly ignore regardless quality. to see this, consider example eurozone’s debt exceed maastricht debt criterion one-half, deficit exceed deficit criterion factor almost two. only three eurozone country – finland, luxembourg bi central bankers’ speech 3 estonia – fulfil maastricht criteria. the belief eurozone membership discipline consequence join prove unsubstantiated. a case czech crisis 1990s, political economic policy authority make numerous u-turn state eu level crisis. there volte-face, example, bank bailouts necessity them, need relax monetary policy europe, state eu financial sector, no-state-bailout clause, sufficiency current greek package. in addition, several false myth propagated, example consequence greek bankruptcy german french bank sector need ecb central bank positive equity. in fact, numerous central bank negative equity yet problem operate credible enough. the real capital central bank credibility reputation, figure balance-sheet. credibility reputation virtue thrive consistent credible policy communication. another myth eurozone cannot survive greek default. why not? be insolvent? be significant trade dimension greece eurozone? accord available dtcc data – incomplete probably cover majority cross-border transaction – even cd often mention present systemic problem european financial system. note cd greek debt high year ago, euro strong peak last summer’s greek crisis. the market appear think greece fundamental survival eurozone. finally, imply solve debt problem, greece portugal saved. they not. competitiveness real issue countries. no economy survive thrive unless competitive. the upshot recent u-turn market completely confuse see predictable outcome adjust to. they see allow greece leave eurozone depreciate, also see willingness support country sufficiently. the solution crisis already make unavoidably costly due past incredible unclear communication. there two possibly costly credible way restore competitiveness. the first solution within framework eurozone. this would involve restructure debt impose rigorously enforce fiscal discipline. but structural reform hardly enough restore competitiveness within short enough period time scenario. in addition, ten billion euro aid would flow strong eurozone economy weak one restore competitiveness. such generous aid would probably conditional distribution aid manage greek authorities. the ecb would provide liquidity support – assurance support – greek bank sector. i believe give relatively small size greece – even, need be, greece portugal – action within realm politically feasible. the second way crisis “classic” imf prescription, say, fiscal discipline, debt restructure currency devaluation. note make scenario easy aid also desirable least form support drachma ecb and/or european authority (among others) avoid overshoot exit eurozone. note currently see rather disorderly effort along line first scenario keep current eurozone together. in spirit could see orderly exit eurozone, political will. in short, minimise costs, either scenario need carry orderly way, disorderly implementation result dramatically increase cost cases. therefore, instead current muddle through, one two way choose clearly communicate markets, voter others. otherwise, risk loss credibility everyone involve europe likely imf well. further continuation current uncertainty 4 bi central bankers’ speech continue cause significant economic cost eu europe particular. at present, risk event push greece (and/or others?) unexpected default shoot up. that would surely costly outcome, least short term. we need avoid repeat 1997 russian default, russia receive programme aid, everyone expect work, need turn much big two month later. there also rapidly increase risk citizen run greek bank well rocket risk eu/eurozone country’s voter produce outcome will, addition likely profound consequences, complicate find solution technical issues, i.e. structure debt restructuring. to conclude, crisis whose cause lie eurozone institutions, assure create – together eurozone – prevent crises. without close involvement eurozone institutions, include ecb eurozone member states, probably result disorderly meltdown least european economies. on many levels, include level european institutions, crisis cause incoherent and/or insincere communication, increase uncertainty market participant broad sense. our country’s history tell u generally predict loss currency fix much low cost (including political ones) unexpected one. if eurozone country eu institution opt “safe” greek membership eurozone, must present solution broad, generous general enough convince market credibility. this solution good come fast, though, muddle significant economic cost increase risk dramatically. in meantime, authority least avoid communication increase risk run bank anger voter fiscally sound eurozone states. last least, plan b would highly desirable. let end stress disorderly outcome clearly go interest czech republic economy. there possibility happy (i.e. relatively costless) end. but end uncertainty. after all, muddle current crisis clearly occupy european decision-makers extent prevent solve issue important core crucial part eurozone eu – example, change part world, currently slide global relative benchmark quite fast, way enable europe regain past ability compete globally. bi central bankers’ speech 1 jean-claude trichet: complete economic monetary union speech mr jean-claude trichet, president european central bank, gala dinner state european union conference “revitalising european dream: a corporate view”, brussels, 28 june 2011. * * * lady gentlemen, thank invite conference. the theme dedicate especially relevant today, draw lesson bad financial crisis since world war ii. these days, “europe” benefit bring come take granted. thank success european integration, threat war become memory past many europeans, particular young generation. this make urgent develop renew vision kind europe want indeed need – vision easily understand share amongst eu citizens. each generation need affirm commitment europe. a pierre werner observed, “it necessary even bear well 1950s 1960s realise european union come chance, base fundamental necessity life amongst people europe”1. thankfully, “fundamental necessity life” – especially economic sphere – still seem felt understand people europe. when asked, eurobarometer surveys, issue european institution focus come years, european believe priority give economic monetary policy (37% eu 41% euro area). more three four european (78%) agree measure reduce public deficit debt country cannot delayed. more three quarter respondent (77%) consider strong coordination economic financial policies, well close supervision financial institution would effective combat crisis. the idea initiate reform benefit future generation attract equally strong support. revitalise europe revitalise europe mean bring reality today’s europe, institution policies, close wish concern eu citizens. a europe stability responsibility burden today’s adjustment shift onto future generations. an open flexible europe foster education, entrepreneurship innovation, ample employment opportunity high standard living. a europe fully bring economic political weight bear ever globalise economy. 1 «il est nécessaire que même ceux qui sont nés bien après le années 50 et 60 se rendent compte que l’union européenne n’est pa un coup du hasard, qu’elle se fonde sur de nécessités fondamentales de la vie entre le peuples de l’europe » (on 11 december 1997, eve luxembourg european council). 2 bi central bankers’ speech there good basis – indeed take pride past achievements. have serve member govern council ecb since launch euro president almost eight year now, let say accomplish lot: for example, company euro area worry price stability – i come back late issue – possible devaluation country main trade partners. they face low transaction hedge costs. there price transparency ample access finance, general. since start euro, employment euro area rise 14 million, compare 8 million unite states. adjust population growth differences, growth per caput euro area almost unite state past decade, 1% per year term gdp per caput growth. trade among euro area country also rise strongly. the value export import good within euro area increase one quarter gdp 1998 one third gdp 2007, trade within euro area country represent half total euro area trade. economic monetary union the key understand current challenge euro area specific construction economic monetary union. the coexistence achieve monetary union – single currency, single monetary policy eurosystem ecb helm – largely decentralise economic pillar. indeed, member state responsible fiscal economic policies, call treat matter common concern. those policy subject european governance framework ensure fully compatible requirement single currency. our governance framework largely rely self-discipline national governments, hard constraint eu level case hard rule suppose apply. we assume country sufficient incentive “keep house order” thereby contribute common good euro area. an overly narrow interpretation principle subsidiarity also shield national economic policy see undue european interference. the experience first twelve year emu suggest limit de facto soft policy coordination largely exhausted, interdependency inside monetary union call strong euro area dimension. let take close look two emu pillar separately. the “m” emu the “m” emu, monetary pillar, perform well. the ecb clear assignment: deliver price stability, define annual inflation rate close 2% medium term. and 12 year since launch emu, average annual inflation rate euro area 1.97%. this best result major central bank euro area period 12 years, last 50 years. bi central bankers’ speech 3 we achieve challenge times. over years, cope burst dot-com bubble, aftermath event 11september 2001, jump oil price $147 per barrel 2008, rise price food commodities, course bad financial economic crisis since great depression. yet throughout different economic shock – could either inflationary deflationary consequence – citizen market participant euro area remain confident commitment. inflation expectation firmly anchor line definition price stability. the “e” emu it “e” emu, progress needed. already 1989 delors report state “an economic monetary union could operate basis mutually consistent sound behaviour government economic agent member countries. (…) uncoordinated divergent national budgetary policy would undermine monetary stability generate imbalance real financial sector community.” what mean practice? it mean improve economic governance. it mean strengthen rule prevent unsound policies. and mean prohibit individual country pursue policy harm euro area whole. for reason, i called, name govern council, commission, council european parliament ambitious reinforce economic governance euro area. we call “quantum leap” governance, substantially deepen economic union. essential reform in short-term, tackle urgent issue implement structural adjustment programme currently underway. the new economic governance framework currently negotiate need agree implement full without delay. we must get institutional framework medium-term right. the two eu co-legislators commission negotiate new economic governance package precede weeks. the european parliament confirm position last thursday’s plenary vote. the ecb particularly welcome strong message send regard fact stability growth pact’s procedure make automatic. our past experience apply pact, especially weaken core provision 2005, amply demonstrate reform procedure sine qua non determine response current crisis. in context, govern council ecb regret european council decide espouse european parliament’s view issue end last week. this issue key importance ecb. we consider essential progress decision-making procedure council make automatic. 4 bi central bankers’ speech the extension reverse qualify majority vote preventive arm pact, european parliament rightly insist on, perceive loss sovereignty. it mechanism would allow member state protect good harmful effect unsound fiscal policies. since begin discussion reform economic governance may 2010, ecb ask great automatism decision-making procedure limit room discretion. this major component “quantum leap” call for. have council le room manoeuvre suspend halt fiscal surveillance procedure year precede crisis, euro area country would face severe sovereign debt crisis today. however, entire story – surveillance instrument lack altogether regard build-up competitiveness loss macroeconomic imbalances, make solution fiscal problem even challenging. therefore, ecb also call fully-fledged surveillance procedure competitiveness indicator macroeconomic imbalances. a matter fact, point risk associate competitiveness loss since 2005 insist peer review mutual oversight. the new procedure need focus country large competitiveness loss high indebtedness, since country pose potential threat function emu. in short term, party take responsibility agree ambitious governance package two pillar – surveillance fiscal policy surveillance macroeconomic policies, send clear message strengthen economic policy framework dent crisis. we urge swift ambitious completion legislative procedure bring certainty new framework. an additional element strong economic policy coordination competitiveness convergence surveillance euro area newly agree euro plus pact. the ecb support four goal pact, namely foster competitiveness employment, contribute sustainability public finance reinforce financial stability. but also insist euro plus pact must declarations. it must follow concrete action. the ecb therefore welcome fact european council last week call participate member state make reform commitment concrete, include specific timelines, enable easy measurement progress benchmarking. single market furthermore, let u forget euro area 17 country participate actively large single market 27 member country european union. the single market form integral part wide europe 2020 strategy smart, sustainable inclusive growth. the governance framework strategy underpin wide surveillance effort economic pillar emu. the first experience part so-called european semester approach final stages, european council’s endorsement propose recommendation individual member state last week. the eu single market offer unique business environment direct access 500 million potential business partners, employee consumer relatively high purchase power. the single market centre eu political priority quite time even protectionist tendencies. i, therefore, strongly support initiative aim re-launching single market address prevail structural challenge face eu economy. the single market bi central bankers’ speech 5 core union’s growth agenda. a widen deepen single market view opportunity raise “speed limit” economy, highly warrant aftermath impact financial crisis european economy. moreover, completion single market essential ingredient require quantum leap towards deep economic union commensurate degree economic integration interdependency already achieve monetary union. emu lead strengthen trade integration competition within single market enhance market access, reduce cost cross-border activity increase price transparency. at time, well-functioning single market pivotal smooth function emu. it allow swift market-based adjustment case shock facilitate correction economic imbalances. a well function single market also require proper design implementation financial sector policies. in respect, establishment new eu supervisory architecture introduce genuine macro-prudential supervision strengthen micro-prudential oversight eu level prerequisite enhance financial stability arrangements. the establishment european systemic risk board european supervisory authority important milestone provide appropriate incentive avoid excessive risk take financial sector promote level play field support beneficial financial integration within monetary union. establishment eu framework crisis management important complementary element new supervisory framework still need put place. conclusion this large agenda already. what would need emu long term? i sketch speech aachen early month element view would warrant consideration design longer-term vision europe. develop element detail would, however, topic another speech. lady gentlemen, i thank attention. bi central bankers’ speech 1 duvvuri subbarao: india global financial crisis learnt? text k r narayanan oration dr duvvuri subbarao, governor reserve bank india, south asia research centre australian national university, canberra, 23 june 2011. * * * thank invite deliver 2011 k r narayanan oration. it honour i attach lot value. president narayanan late president narayanan distinguish diplomat, repute parliamentarian, capable minister erudite scholar. bear bottom india’s social pyramid, rise occupy high office country asset hard work, integrity humility. ‘a work president’, describe himself, never allow dogma overwhelm belief convictions. president narayanan office 1997 2002, time globalization, experience current times, take root. at banquet host visit u president bill clinton new delhi march 2000, president narayanan remarked: “mr. president, recognise welcome fact world move inevitably towards one-world... but, us, globalization mean end history geography, lively excite diversity world.” this thoughtful remark. a much globalization may inevitable, history geography need destiny. if learn lesson experience, repeat mistakes. this indeed topic oration, tribute late president narayanan – seek lesson crisis go make good world us. be time different? by account 2008/09 crisis deep financial crisis times. it take devastate toll global output welfare. arguably, fundamental cause financial crisis – global imbalances, loose monetary policy high level leverage drive “irrational exuberance”. in respect crisis different. where crisis different, however, manifestation. most recent crisis occur individual emerge economy regions, were, core, traditional retail bank currency crises. the country trouble could rescue multilateral interventions; besides, advance country provide buff trade financial support. in contrast, crisis originate advance economy, unite states, hit core global financial system. with virtually buff fall back on, crisis rapidly engulf whole world. much dismay, emerge market economy soon pull whirlpool. how india hit crisis? india exception. we affect crisis. output growth average 9.5 per cent per annum three year period 2005/08 drop 6.8 per cent crisis year 2008/09. export grow 25 per cent 2005/08 decelerate 12.2 per cent crisis year (2008/09) decline 2.2 per cent 2009/10. in pre-crisis years, capital flow far excess current account deficit. in contrast, 2 bi central bankers’ speech crisis year, net capital flow significantly short current account deficit put downward pressure rupee. the exchange rate depreciate ` 39.37 per dollar january 2008 ` 51.23 per dollar march 2009. notwithstanding sound bank system relatively robust financial markets, india felt tremor tectonic shock global financial system. the first round effect come finance channel way sudden stop reversal capital flow consequent upon global deleveraging process. this jolt foreign exchange market well equity markets. almost simultaneously, credit market come pressure corporates, find external source fund dry up, turn domestic bank non-bank source credit. by far contagious route crisis transmission confidence channel. for week lehman collapse mid-september 2008, everyday news yet another storied institution crashing. in global scenario uncertainty, lack confidence advance country market transmit hiccup market too. the net result financial market – equity, debt, money foreign exchange market – come vary degree pressure. finally, transmission crisis real channel quite straightforward global recession follow financial crash result sharp decline export demand good services. why india hit crisis? there dismay india affect crisis, dismay arise mainly two counts. first, exposure bank toxic sub-prime asset marginal balance sheet activity limited, so, argument went, affect financial sector crisis originate causes. second, india’s growth drive domestic demand drop external demand, contended, cause small dent output growth. yet crisis hit us, ferociously think possible. the reason globalization: india integrate global system tend acknowledge. let illustrate point broadbrush numbers. india’s two way trade (merchandize export plus imports), proportion gdp, double past decade: 19.6 per cent 1998/99, year asian crisis, 40.7 per cent 2008/09. note global trade decline 11 per cent 2009 result crisis contrast robust average growth 8.6 per cent previous year 2004/07. such sharp collapse world trade impact export demand demonstrate trade integration quite deep. if trade integration deep, financial integration even deeper. a measure financial integration ratio total external transaction (gross current account flow plus gross capital account flows) gdp. this ratio double 44 per cent 1998/99 112 per cent 2008/09 evidence depth india’s financial integration. in sum, reason india affect crisis, despite mitigate factors, deepen trade financial integration world. manage globalization what experience crisis demonstrate clearly power globalization. globalization double edge sword; open incredible opportunity also pose immense challenges. india surely benefit open world also incur cost count. the challenge india, indeed emerge market economy (emes), really minimize cost maximize benefit globalization. bi central bankers’ speech 3 lesson crisis a lot write crisis important waste, learn lesson crisis apply schumpeterian creative destruction mode. some people have, however, question wisdom draw lesson even crisis fully behind us. when zhou enlai, former chinese prime minister, ask think french revolution, say early say. historian take long view may agree zhou enlai practical policy maker enjoy luxury. so, let use opportunity platform draw eight big picture lesson crisis. lesson 1: globalize world, decouple work the crisis challenge many beliefs, among casualty decouple hypothesis. the decouple hypothesis, intellectually fashionable crisis, hold even advance economy go downturn, emes would affect improve macroeconomic management, robust external reserve healthy bank sectors. yet crisis affect emes, admittedly different extents, bring question validity decouple hypothesis. some analyst argue outright dismissal decouple hypothesis suggest nuanced evaluation. recent imf research1 fact illustrate transmission distress advance economy emes take place three distinct phases. the first phase run time early sign crisis appear mid-2007 till lehman collapse september 2008. during period, growth performance emes outshine advance economy indicate decoupling. the second phase, start lehman collapse till first quarter 2009 one “recoupling” advance economy pull emes downturn. the third phase start second quarter 2009 emes start recover crisis ahead advance economy suggest shift decoupling. so, emes decouple advance economies? the answer necessarily nuanced. a useful way visualize decouple wake crisis distinguish “trend” “cycle” decoupling. “trend” decouple reflect widen gap trend rate growth emes advance economies. this evidently owe grow weight domestic factors, mainly consumption, emes’ growth process. however, give still significant integration two group countries, cycle still coupled. from “lessons” perspective, mean emes focus strengthen domestic driver demand institute automatic stabilizer buff cyclical shock advance economies. lesson 2: global imbalance need redress sake global stability no crisis complex simple single cause. in popular perception, collapse lehman brother mid-september 2008 remain mark trigger crisis. at one level may well true. indeed, i visualize future text book finance divide world “before lehman” “after lehman”. but probe deeper, learn heart crisis two root cause – build global imbalance development financial market last two decades. and receive wisdom today two root cause interconnected, financial market development sense drive global imbalances. 1 llaudes, ricardo, ferhan salman, mali chivakul, “the impact great recession emerge markets”. imf work paper 237, october 2010. 4 bi central bankers’ speech global macro imbalance get build large save current account surplus china much asia wake east asian crisis decade ago. these mirror large increase leverage consumption current account deficit us. in short, asia produce america consumed. between u consumption boom asian save glut, rag debate cause effect. regardless, bottom line one simply mirror two share symbiotic relationship. and imbalance build up? the answer lie globalization – globalization trade, labour finance. the world witness phenomenal expansion global trade last three decades; global trade proportion global gdp increase 34 per cent 1980 51 per cent 2007, crisis hit us.2 globalization finance even prolific, especially last decade. for world take together, ratio foreign asset foreign liability gdp rise 133 per cent 1994 300 per cent 2008.3 the impact globalization labour far striking. emerge asia add nearly three billion world’s pool labour integrate rest world last two decade thus hugely improve comparative advantage. together, three dimension globalization – trade, finance labour – help emerge asia multiply factor export advance economies. the result large persistent current account surplus asian economy correspond current account deficit import advance economies. the chain causation imbalance financial crisis interest although obvious. a asia accumulate save simultaneously maintain competitive exchange rates, save turn central bank reserves. central banks, turn, invest save large, diversify portfolio government bond advance economies. this turn drive risk free real interest rate historically low level trigger phenomenal credit expansion drop guard credit standards, erosion credit quality search yield, combine brew crisis explosive dimensions. it argue u feed refuse supply incipient demand liquidity late 1990s early 2000s, high interest rate could prevent borrow boom follow widespread deterioration financial standard subsequent melt down. but also would mean low growth u rest world. the short point even macroeconomic imbalance allow proliferate, necessary balance need global economic growth disruption follow unwind imbalances. so, go here? the g-20 actively engage challenge task redress structural imbalance global economy. at pittsburgh summit september 2009, g-20 leader agree “framework strong, sustainable balance growth” commit “mutual assessment process” (map) peer review country’s progress towards meet share objective underlie framework. recognize global imbalance narrow crisis start widen exit phase, drive mainly uneven recovery around world, g-20 resolve promote external sustainability focus next stage map entrust task framework work group (fwg). india privilege co-chairing, together canada, fwg manage task develop indicative guideline assess address persistent global imbalances. the fwg adopt two-stage approach: limit number indicator 2 calculation base imf direction trade statistics, june 2010. 3 calculation base imf balance payment year book, 2010. bi central bankers’ speech 5 guide initial assessment process, broad set – include qualitative one – use second stage inform in-depth external sustainability assessment. the success initiative critical redress problem global imbalances. lesson 3: global problem require global coordination the crisis demonstrate interconnectedness world trade, finance confidence channels. what originate bubble u house sector soon snowball crisis radiate two different way – first, geographical sense, u advance economy rest world; second, sectoral sense, house productive sectors. even country start douse fire own, soon realize effort vain global coordination necessary condition manage global crisis. from perspective, london g-20 summit april 2009 go history clear turn point leader world show extraordinary determination unity. sure, differences, debate discuss compromise make without erode end goal – end crisis. this result agree package measure domestic international component implement coordination, indeed synchronization necessary. the entire range crisis response measure – accommodative monetary stance, fiscal stimulus, debt deposit guarantees, capital injection, asset purchases, currency swap – derive vary degree g-20 package. now, exit crisis, concern apprehension vaunt unity g-20 show crisis dissipating. but might also tad unrealistic expect degree unity show manage crisis also show address “peace time” issues? the focus g-20 flesh agenda economic financial restructure national international level world prevent, rate minimize probability of, another crisis type go through. difference opinion, agenda broad, expected, may fact positive influence determine collectively optimal. the common thread run entire g-20 agenda need global cooperation solve press problem today. the crisis teach u country island economic financial disruption anywhere cause ripples, waves, everywhere. the crisis also teach u give deepen integration country global economic financial system, uncoordinated response lead bad outcome everyone. the global problem face today complex amenable easy solutions. many require significant often painful adjustment national level. because short term national interest conflict globally optimal solutions, quite understandable difference view within g-20. we must remember though world divide nation-states, natural constituency global economy. at time, global crisis show global economy entity important ever global coordination solve global problem critical. lesson 4: price stability macroeconomic stability guarantee financial stability the year crisis characterize steady growth low stable inflation advance economy rapid growth development emes. the call “great moderation” prompt grow consensus around view best practice monetary policy framework pursuit single target (price stability) mean single instrument (short term policy interest rate). the success great moderation 6 bi central bankers’ speech fortify argument price stability necessary (a nearly) sufficient condition economic growth financial stability. central banker believe discover holy grail. that sense triumph deflate unravel crisis. a global financial sector come brink collapse even midst period extraordinary price stability, become clear price stability necessarily guarantee financial stability. indeed experience crisis prompt even strong assertion – trade price stability financial stability, successful central bank price stability, likely imperil financial stability. the argument go follows. the extend period steady growth low stable inflation great moderation lull central bank complacency. only benefit hindsight clear prolong period price stability blindside policy maker cancer financial instability grow underbelly. a dominant issue wake crisis role central bank prevent asset price bubbles. the monetary stance study indifference asset price inflation stem famous greenspan orthodoxy summarize follows. first, asset price bubble hard identify real time basis, fundamental factor drive asset price directly observable. a central bank therefore second guess market. second, monetary policy blunt instrument counteract asset price booms. and third, central bank “clean mess” bubble bursts. the surmise therefore cost-benefit calculus activist monetary stance “leaning wind” clearly negative. the crisis dent credibility greenspan orthodoxy. the emerge view post-crisis prevent asset price build within remit central bank. opinion divided, however, whether central bank prevent asset bubble monetary policy action regulatory action. on one side, purist view question efficacy resort monetary tighten check speculative bubbles. oppose argument necessary condition speculative excess abundant liquidity, control liquidity within remit monetary policy first line defence “irrational exuberance”. no matter debate settles, clear, also disquiet lesson crisis price stability macroeconomic stability guarantee financial stability. lesson 5: microprudential regulation supervision need supplement macroprudential oversight the crisis clearly demonstrate collection healthy financial institution necessarily make healthy financial sector. this complex interconnection financial sector across banks, financial institutions, markets, geography problem part system rapidly transmit system, cascade across layer develop crisis. systemic safety also jeopardize procyclicality. a crisis demonstrated, strong collective tendency among financial entity overexpose type risk upturn become overly risk averse downturn. importantly, individual institutions, indeed microprudential oversight too, fail take account spillover impact action rest financial system them. this raise paradox fallacy composition. what good individual institution’s point view become disruptive, even destructive, institution act similar way. that bubble start u house sector snowball major crisis vivid illustration risk arise interconnectedness global financial system risk procyclicality. the lesson clearly much microprudential supervision bi central bankers’ speech 7 necessary, need supplement macroprudential oversight prevent systemic risk build up. macroprudential oversight require analytical sophistication good judgement. regulator need able analyze nature extent risk able make inform judgement type countercyclical buff must impose. both type i type ii error – impose buff early excessive caution delay imposition buff till late avert implosion – costly macroeconomic terms. lesson 6: capital control unavoidable, advisable certain circumstance a emes start recover crisis early advance economies, also begin exit crisis drive accommodative monetary stance ahead advance economies. this multi-speed recovery consequent differential exit trigger speculative capital flow emes result currency appreciation unrelated economic fundamentals. this pose complex policy management challenges. currency appreciation erode export competitiveness. intervention forex market prevent appreciation entail costs. if resultant liquidity leave unsterilized, could potentially fuel inflationary pressures. if resultant liquidity sterilized, put upward pressure interest rate hurt competitiveness, also, curious variation dutch disease, encourage flows. capital inflow far excess country’s absorptive capacity could pose problem currency appreciation. speculative flow look quick return potentially lead asset price build up. also, current juncture, one drive force behind harden commodity price recent month excess liquidity global system possibly trigger financialization commodities. quite unsurprisingly, old debate whether capital control legitimate policy option resurface again. this debate traditionally frown moderation. critic maintain capital control distortionary, largely ineffective, difficult implement, easy evade entail negative externalities. on hand, supporter capital control argue control preserve monetary policy autonomy, save sterilization cost tilt composition foreign liability toward long-term maturity ensure macroeconomic financial stability. the debate capital control resurface asian crisis mid-1990s, especially one root cause crisis open capital account east asian economies. however, asian economy recover quick order, regain export competitiveness start build external reserve self-insurance, debate pursue logical conclusion, orthodoxy capital control undesirable persisted. the recent crisis has, however, clear turn point worldview capital controls. notably, imf put policy note4 february 2010 reverse long hold orthodoxy capital control inadvisable always everywhere. the note refer certain “circumstances capital control legitimate component policy response surge capital flows”. the world bank5 asian development bank outlook – 2010 echo views. 4 ostry, jonathan d. others (2010), “capital inflows: the role controls”, imf staff position note, spn/10/04, february 19, 2010. 5 world bank: global monitor report 2009: a development emergency. washington dc 8 bi central bankers’ speech a useful way assess capital account management eme draw distinction “strategic” “tactical” controls. strategic control would involve define long term policy indicate inter se preference, hierarchy preference were, across different type capital flow control deploy operationalize policy. strategic control give stakeholder clear predictable framework rule make inform choice manage risks, give policy maker sufficient lever calibrate flows; essence define boundary play field. tactical controls, hand, introduce barrier play field itself. they deploy opportunistically stem surge inflow outflows. by nature, tactical control introduce new element uncertainty calculation domestic foreign stakeholders. india’s approach capital account management typically strategic. for example, explicitly express preference long term short term flow equity debt flows, use price base quantity base control operationalize policy. we have, course, periodically recalibrated element strategy pursuit capital account liberalization. an important lesson india’s experience even relatively large swing capital flow crisis, pressure use tactical control build strategic control provide automatic buffers. even debate emes manage excess capital flows, remember extent lumpy volatile flow spillover policy choice advance economies, manage capital flow treat exclusive problem emerge market economies. how burden share raise intellectual practical challenges. the intellectual challenge build good understand force drive capital flows, type policy instruments, include capital controls, work situations. the practical challenge need reach share understand framework cross border spillover domestic policy capital-originating countries, gamut policy response capital receive countries. lesson 7: economics physic a month crisis, queen happen london school economics ask perfectly sensible question: “how come none economist saw crisis coming”. the queen’s question resonate people around world felt let economics economists. a economist saw profession discredit reputation dented, economic crisis soon turn crisis economics. what go wrong economics? it seem far egregious fault economics, one lead astray, project like exact science. the charge economist suffer “physics envy” lead formulate elegant theory model – use sophisticate mathematics impressive quantitative finesse – delude world large model exactitude actually did. admittedly, limit sense may parallel economics physics. but similarity law mean similarity basic nature academic discipline. the fundamental difference physic economics physic deal physical universe govern immutable laws, beyond pale human behaviour. economics, contrast, social science whose law influence human behaviour. simply put, i cannot change mass electron matter i behave i change price derivative behaviour. the law physic universal space time. the law economics much function context. go back early example, mass electron bi central bankers’ speech 9 change whether world newton einstein. but world economics, firms, household government behave alter reign economic ideology time. to give another example, nothing absolute, example, save equal investment supply equal demand maintain classical economics something absolute energy lose equal energy gain enunciate classical physics. in natural sciences, progress two way street. it run empirical find theory way round. the famous michelson-morley experiment find velocity light constant lead theory relativity – example progression practice theory. in reverse direction, ferocious search way higgs boson – god particle – predict quantum theory example traverse theory practice. in economics, hand, human dimension paramount, progression necessarily one way, empirical find theory. there joke something work practice, economist run see work theory. actually, i don’t see joke; indeed way be. karl popper, far influential philosopher science twentieth century, propound good theory one give rise falsifiable hypotheses. by measure, einstein’s general theory good theory lead hypothesis curvature space force gravity indeed verify scientist observation make solar eclipse west african island sao tome principe. economics hand cannot stand scrutiny falsifiable hypothesis test since empirical result economics function context. the short point economics cannot lay claim immutability, universality, precision exactitude physics. take recent financial crisis. it one saw pressure build up. there respectable number economist warn perilous consequence build-up global imbalances, say simply unsustainable predict currency collapse. in event, system implode currency collapse melt financial system. we good able safeguard financial stability global national level remember economics social science real world outcome influence fundamental level human behaviour. lesson 8: sense economic history important prevent resolve financial crisis let finish last lesson large canvas – sense economic history important prevent resolve financial crises. in painstakingly research book, this time different: eight century financial folly, kenneth rogoff carmen reinhart argue every time crisis occur expert confront question could not, base past experience, see coming, would argue past experience guide circumstance changed. yet “this time different” argument hold. reinhart rogoff put forward impressive evidence show eight hundred years, financial crisis trace fundamental cause learn nothing one crisis another. if teach economics include study economic history, perhaps avoid repeat history, never mind farce tragedy. bi central bankers’ speech 1 philipp hildebrand: overview swiss global economy introductory remark mr philipp hildebrand, chairman govern board swiss national bank, half-yearly medium news conference, berne, 16 june 2011. * * * the swiss national bank (snb) maintain expansionary monetary policy. the target range three-month libor remain 0.0–0.75%, snb intend keep libor within low part target range

continue benefit robust international demand. however, margin export industry come increase pressure. for 2011, snb maintain forecast real growth swiss gdp around 2%. overall, however, downside risk predominate. these include, particular, debt problem euro area periphery. in addition, high deficit require several country various part world undertake fiscal consolidation measures, economic

singapore’s approach keynote address mr lim hng kiang, minister trade industry deputy chairman monetary authority singapore, 38th association bank singapore (abs) annual dinner, singapore, 28 june 2011. * * * introduction chairman, abs, council member abs, lady gentleman it pleasure evening. i last deliver keynote address 2007, prior global financial crisis. a economy recover, especially asia, easy forget close global financial system precipice. follow failure lehman brothers, solvency many well-known financial institution advance economy come question. weakness failure core bank system transmit almost sector countries. a global meltdown avert extraordinary action take central banks, government financial institution themselves. regulator globally benefit distance depth crisis reflect need do strengthen resilience financial system. ma likewise tonight, i would like explain mas’ approach reform regulation banking. post-crisis reflection singapore’s financial system withstand global financial crisis well. this happen chance. singapore bank were, whole, prudent le risky balance sheets. ma always require bank meet high prudential standards, exceed international norm several areas. this ensure adequate safeguard place and, turn, help maintain market confidence downturn. in annual assessment singapore last year, imf state “singapore’s strong supervision risk management system crucial safeguard financial stability global downturn.”1 although bank singapore relatively unscathed crisis, cannot complacent. over past 40 years, singapore evolve international financial centre, anchor strong local foreign banks. we small open economy, intricately connect global financial system. such openness connectivity strengthen diversity financial system, also make u vulnerable contagion risk external environment. locally-incorporated bank foreign branch significant exposure complex financial asset cause severe loss u.s. europe. despite this, immune ripple effect global spike risk aversion. our approach regulation allow financial sector grow, innovate, support need economy, without compromise safety soundness financial system whole. with context, let turn reforms. 1 international monetary fund, executive board assessment, 23 july 2010. bi central bankers’ speech 1 the emerge global regulatory paradigm follow wide-ranging discussion consultation, global regulatory community make progress strengthen resilience financial system. the basel committee bank supervision strengthen global minimum capital standard part basel iii framework. the financial stability board (“fsb”) release guideline reduce risk pose systemically-important financial institutions, “sifis”. ma welcome basel iii reforms. they strengthen resilience individual bank period stress, so, contribute bank sector stability. basel iii major step forward several areas: (i) first, strengthen capital requirement trade activities, off-balance sheet vehicles, securitisation, counterparty credit derivatives. (ii) second, improve quality capital, great focus common equity absorb losses. (iii) third, raise level capital bank hold absorb loss going-concern unwind scenarios. (iv) fourth, introduce international liquidity standard first time, make bank resilient short-term fund disruption longer-term liquidity mismatches. the fsb finalise recommendation global systemically important financial institutions, g-sifis. this comprise package measures, important quite clear:  first, g-sifis meet high capital requirements, basel iii minimums. this reflect great risk failure would pose financial system.  second, resolution framework established, ensure banks, however complex large, resolve efficient safe manner. such framework may involve simplification firm structure design “bail-in” mechanisms, creditor force absorb loss bank close failure2.  third, g-sifis face intensive supervisory oversight, guide enhance set core principle effective bank supervision. singapore’s regulatory approach many jurisdiction consider response fsb basel committee recommendations. mas’ regulatory approach guide three principles: (i) first, must maintain high standard financial regulation become associate singapore. maintain high regulatory standard completely compatible foster vibrant financial sector. be well-regulated, trust stable financial centre source advantage singapore. it provide confidence bank operate singapore customer transact bank here. 2 “bail-in” process bank debt fail firm forcibly convert equity. this intend make possible rapidly recapitalise bank continue business without equity injection taxpayers. 2 bi central bankers’ speech (ii) second, rule must risk-appropriate. international standard must sometimes enhance appropriate singapore’s context. they must target address well-defined risk concern could systemic implications. (iii) third, approach must sensitive impact industry. no new regulation costless. ma must weigh cost new regulation institution comply them, broad benefit regulation economy society. with principle mind, i outline mas’ approach issue i mention earlier. i first touch basel iii mean singapore’s capital adequacy requirements. after which, i share mas’ view current debate universal banking. capital requirement locally-incorporated bank ma review bank capital adequacy rules. we require singapore-incorporated bank meet basel iii early high standard. singapore-incorporated bank require meet basel iii minimum standard 1 january 2013, ahead basel committee’s january 2015 timeline. singapore bank well-capitalised good position adopt basel iii sooner 2015. moreover, long phase-in period provide basel committee ensure new requirement stall economic recovery country centre crisis. singapore’s situation different: recovery robust economy well pre-crisis levels. ma increase minimum level common equity locally-incorporated bank require hold. the experience country recent crisis show common equity effective capital instrument absorb loss write-downs. research do basel committee show bank fail require government capital injection crisis significantly low level common equity bank not. ma enhance quality regulatory capital bank follow ways: (i) there explicit common equity tier 1 capital adequacy requirement, set 6.5%. this fully phase 1 jan 2015. (ii) the tier 1 capital adequacy requirement increase 6% 8%, phase period. the total capital adequacy requirement remain unchanged 10%. (iii) in addition minimum requirements, capital conservation buffer3, set 2.5%, meet common equity tier 1. this phase 1 jan 2016 1 jan 2019. (iv) the new eligibility criterion regulatory capital also phase 1 jan 2014 1 jan 2018. with changes, locally-incorporated bank require meet capital requirement high minimum level basel iii. the requirement apply bank-group bank-solo levels. take account capital conservation buffer, locally- 3 the capital conservation buff basel iii requirement bank maintain capital buff use absorb loss period stress. constraint earn distribution dividends, share buyback discretionary bonus payment staff impose bank conservation buff breached. the close bank’s regulatory capital ratio approach minimum requirement, great constraint earn distributions. bi central bankers’ speech 3 incorporate bank maintain least 9% common equity tier 1, compare basel iii minimum 7%. let explain reason this. (i) first, basel iii minimum adequately take account systemic importance banks. each locally-incorporated bank systemically-important singapore substantial retail presence. together, account half total non-bank resident deposit loan singapore. hence, high capital level require strengthen ability absorb unexpected loss effectively crisis. this necessary protect depositors, reduce risk real economy, safeguard financial stability. the experience country centre crisis europe u.s. show total cost financial crisis economy public substantial. (ii) second, common equity tier 1 capital requirement significantly basel iii result large reduction economic output would beneficial reduce likelihood cost crisis. several empirical study confirm this. notably, basel committee’s assessment long-term economic impact basel iii economic cost go basel minimum still low cost arise bank crises. in decide level appropriate singapore, ma carefully weigh cost additional capital benefits. bank well-capitalised, prudently regulated, locate stable financial centre singapore, present attractive value proposition depositor investors. hold systemically-important bank high solvency standard reduce likelihood failure impact real economy one run difficulties. (iii) third, impact banks’ capital structure manageable. this is, part, due already high internal capital buff hold bank also due transition arrangement apply. in short, locally-incorporated bank good position meet high capital adequacy requirement emerge strong post-basel iii world. institutional structure bank one strand regulatory debate still ongoing relate whether reform bank structure help promote financial stability. there several dimension this. i focus dimension relevant singapore financial centre. this relate merit universal branch model compare subsidiary model retail banking. most foreign bank singapore operate universal branch model. branch undertake combination retail, commercial, investment bank activities, without need legally separate activities. some regulator prefer bank operate jurisdiction operate subsidiaries, separate retail wholesale activity different legal entities. ma long history permit universal branch model continue support it. the universal branch model provide significant efficiency benefit banks. it permit bank take advantage economy scale share management resource capital across business lines, addition pool risk across bank group. a branch rely capital parent bank borrow interbank market fund purposes. this may possible local subsidiary small capital base. a branch structure also give bank group great ability withstand idiosyncratic shock part group, excess liquidity capital one part group redeploy part need. this, course, provide shock large overwhelm group whole. 4 bi central bankers’ speech bi central bankers’ speech 5 during period severe stress, however, close linkage business function single, integrate entity make difficult isolate contain problems. the provision essential service branch domestic lend deposit-taking, well payment transactions, could disrupted. local depositor would expose possible contagion crisis confidence arise problem bank’s home market, problem relate wholesale bank activities. ma impose number regulatory requirement locally-incorporated bank protect depositors, include high capital adequacy requirement i mention early minimum paid-up capital $1.5 billion. however, qualify full bank (qfbs) foreign full bank operate branch accept retail deposit without capital singapore. mas’ approach closely supervise branches. they also require member deposit insurance scheme, provide safety net non-bank depositor insure deposit $50,000 per depositor per bank. there clear benefits, however, foreign bank large retail presence operate retail business locally-incorporated subsidiary. where bank corporate investment bank businesses, activity continue operate part exist branches. this allow bank continue benefit cost efficiency associate branch structure minimise change business models. moreover, conduct retail activity separate locally-incorporated entity, bank see local retail customer strongly commit local market long-term. international discussion topic ongoing ma monitor debate closely. conclusion to conclude, singapore build reputation credibility prudence last 40 years. our financial sector weather several crisis well. but cannot take granted. there continue risk challenge financial economic environment. the change capital adequacy requirement i outline tonight help keep bank system strong, preserve singapore’s reputation safe, open dynamic financial centre. bi central bankers’ speech 1 lim hng kiang: singapore’s key role asia open remark mr lim hng kiang, minister trade industry deputy chairman monetary authority singapore, 8th annual citi asia pacific investor conference 2011, singapore, 16 february 2011. * * * distinguish guests, lady gentlemen, 1. good morning warm welcome everyone today. it pleasure join 8th citi asia pacific investor conference. 2. this conference take place time global economic recovery pick pace. against backdrop, many opportunity explored. i confident conference provide excellent platform participant share idea build networks. 3. the world’s economic landscape re-shaped since recent global financial crisis. the recent crisis say bad since great depression 1930s. today, advance economy epicenter crisis still face headwind recovery. in unite states, economic recovery remain fragile two round quantitative ease measures. in euro-zone, concern sovereign debt yet subside. there still uncertainty horizon advance economies. 4. this time, asia forefront global recovery. asia’s resilience, build year since asian financial crisis, enable u weather crisis better. many asian economy rebound quickly strongly crisis. follow onset crisis, policymakers asia take prompt action stabilise economies, use measure fiscal stimulus. in singapore’s case, fiscal flexibility allow government introduce sgd$20.5 billion resilience package fy2009 budget help singaporean business household tide economic difficulties. this also help strengthen economy’s long term competitiveness. 5. start relatively strong position, asia’s role global economy become important continue build strengths. look ahead, asia’s economic prospect look promising, although region still risk external shocks. the imf estimate gdp growth asia settle sustainable 7 percent 2011. however, asia region remain inter-connected major economy trade financial linkages. therefore, asia insulate external shocks. but asian foreign policymakers quick respond. to reduce reliance exports, many asian country take measure rebalance economy towards domestic demand. the grow asian demand help support global economic recovery; long term, contribute growth global economy. 6. go forward, widely expect asia continue lead global recovery. investor confident asia’s prospect due sound economic fundamental fiscal strength. the boom asian economy present many investment opportunities. in particular, infrastructure finance likely major driver demand investments. the asian development bank estimate usd$8 trillion worth infrastructure spend need 10 year lead 2020 support asia’s growth. the demand capital investment drive growth asia’s real economy support development region’s capital markets. a investor continue invest asia, depth, accessibility efficiency asia’s capital market continue improve. 2 bi central bankers’ speech with proper balance, continue inflow funds, improvement capital market growth real economy create self-reinforcing virtuous circle. 7. along rise asia, singapore continue enhance position global-asia financial business hub. a well-connected international financial centre, singapore base global player tap opportunity offer rise asia. to that, build strength area trading, asset management infrastructure financing. we also continue emphasise importance strengthen risk management, enhance transparency, well build depth diversity offer financial product services. let cover area turn. 8. first, area strengthen risk management. in context capital markets, build necessary infrastructure help market participant good manage risks. there great concern counterparty risk since financial crisis. this fear counterparty default dent global trade interbank lend activities. to allow market participant good manage counterparty risks, singapore exchange launch new clear service otc financial derivative 2010. this first service asia. 10 international local bank since sign sgx clear otc financial derivatives, intention expand product suite go forward. this initiative also enhance role regional risk management centre. 9. in may last year, ma publish consultation paper amendment code collective investment scheme. among things, proposal introduce number measure address counterparty risks. for instance, ma propose manager may enter otc financial derivative transaction counterparties subject prudential supervision. if financial derivative transaction perform exchange clear house perform central counterparty role, counterparty risk take zero. ma publish response consultation paper due course. 10. singapore also key risk management hub commodity business. we asia’s lead otc commodity derivative trade hub, account 50% asia’s volume. there also confluence user supplier commodity risk management solution singapore. apart critical mass global commodity traders, many global bank also base asian commodity business singapore. these bank provide sophisticate risk management hedge service regional corporates. 11. let turn enhance transparency. sound corporate governance fundamental successful disclosure-based regime. the financial crisis highlight importance risk management oversight board level spark increase global discussion need good corporate governance practices. in december last year, ma publish response consultation feedback corporate governance regulation guidelines. the enhance rule guideline underscore important role play board oversee soundness financial institutions. 12. ma also promote improvement disclosure quality information available investors. since third quarter last year, financial institution require provide product highlight sheet offer investment product retail investors. this provide brief highlights, include overview product feature risks, apply product accompany prospectuses, include exchange trade funds, asset-backed security structure notes. since january 2010, real estate investment trust (reits) also require hold annual general meet (agms). these mandatory agms provide important channel communication reit manager investors. this also increase transparency raise accountability reit manager investors. bi central bankers’ speech 3 13. last least, remain commit build diversity singapore’s financial markets. we continue provide conducive business environment encourage innovation. on front, see increase diversity, term product offer well issuers. in area product offerings, example, see increase offer commodity-related financial products. the singapore commodity exchange launch robusta coffee future contract april last year. the singapore mercantile exchange launch august last year also provide platform trade diversify basket commodity include future option contract precious metals, agriculture commodity energy. we also replicate success real estate investment trust model infrastructure sector, add diversity capital markets. 14. on top increase diversity product offerings, also encourage increase diversity issuer come tap depth liquidity capital markets. last year, saw first russian debt issue singapore market vtb bank launch sing dollar eurobond here. this pave way highly rat russian issuer access markets. in area islamic finance, number international player also tap market shariah-compliant instruments. they include saudi arabia’s al rajhi group1 malaysia’s khazanah nasional2. in november last year, sabana also launch first shariah-compliant real estate investment trust singapore, also world’s large shariah-compliant reit. 15. singapore play key role gateway asia, facilitate capital investment flows. a regional financial hub, development singapore’s capital market reflect grow vibrancy, diversity, sophistication asia’s capital markets. 16. to conclude, let reiterate outlook asia positive. although region’s growth expect settle sustainable pace, asia remain forefront global recovery. despite face challenge large capital inflow inflation, i confident asia’s policy-makers make appropriate policy adjustment order achieve long term sustainable growth. 17. on note, i wish fruitful successful conference. thank you. 1 al rajhi group keppel t&t announce joint venture agreement establish asset management company manage world's first shariah-compliant data centre fund – securus data property fund. the fund's initial close achieve june 2010 us$100 million

midst demographic transition – way forward dinner talk mr ignazio visco, deputy director general member govern board bank italy, international pension workshop, jointly organize netspar cerp, moncalieri, 16–17 june 2011. * * * i would like thank giuseppe grande useful discussion help. lady gentlemen, good evening. i please today, opportunity share think global outlook pension systems. this international pension workshop – jointly organize netspar cerp – put together impressive list contribution field pension economics pension finance. the paper explore key issue forefront current policy debate. this evening, i would like offer think three topics: (i) the state pension system midst demographic transition; (ii) to-do list government industry participant ; (iii) long-term effectiveness fund private schemes, focus crucial role play strong sustainable growth need develop well-functioning annuity market pension payout. i. the challenge face pension system consider current condition pension systems, seem adjustment pay-as-you-go scheme demographic transition far completed, because: (1) population age continue; (2) advance economy require robust fiscal consolidation measures; (3) many country economic outlook weak time come. first, age process go on, dependency ratio continue rise. life expectancy lengthen come decades. accord un population division’s projections, oecd country 2010 2050 life expectancy age 65 increase 3.1 year men 3.6 year women. a second driver change pay-as-you-go arrangement fiscal consolidation. one main legacy global financial crisis unprecedented size fiscal deficit many advance economies. this lead several government phase fiscal consolidation programme short medium term. at stage, fiscal consolidation programme fairly well-defined, example, unite kingdom euro area, though still somewhat hazy unite state japan. cut pension outlay (e.g., increase retirement age, reduce benefit restriction early retirement schemes) announce number countries, measure important longer-term fiscal sustainability. age also affect fiscal sustainability rise health long-term care expenditures, something come realize lag compare pension expenditures. the third factor weak macroeconomic environment, low wage few job shrink revenue pension contributions. the recovery great recession expect gain momentum slowly continue unstable, indicate late downward revision growth prospect unite states. the recovery also unbalanced: advance economy lag behind emerging-market economies; global imbalance appear way reduced; several country household highly indebted. 2 bi central bankers’ speech nor medium-term outlook world economy much brighter. in advance economy public debt high. the pressure emerge market economy energy commodity market create upward risk inflation. labour market condition expect improve slowly concern structural unemployment might increase. geopolitical risk could remain high. if public pension sector yet woods, defined-benefit (db) pension scheme good shape. the demographic trend weak macroeconomic environment severe repercussion too. what’s more, db plan put pressure huge correction asset price trigger global financial crisis. the impact plunge share price index 2008 magnify sharp decline yield benchmark government bonds, provide backbone discount factor use value future liabilities. a result, since 2008 fund gap db plan widen significantly across board. accord oecd estimates, 2,000 publicly trade company headquarter 15 countries, median underfunding rate worsen one eighth 2007 one fourth 2009. since autumn 2010 situation likely improve slightly, owe low level interest rates. particular concern raise sustainability db pension plan public sector workers. there evidence number advance country plan produce potentially large net unfunded liabilities. in public sector, pension promise tend relatively generous (sometimes make low current earn relative private sector); countries, also partially fund pay directly government revenues, valuation disclosure may lack transparency. because trends, retirement-income system continue shift public pay-as-you-go scheme db plan defined-contribution (dc) pension schemes. in unite states, example, last decade percentage worker participate db plan decline 36 30 percent, dc plan member increase 50 54 percent. the rise importance dc arrangement imply investment risk longevity risk increasingly bear individual workers. over last decade, however, financial market return disappointing, global financial crisis 2007–09 deal blow balance accumulate many worker dc pension schemes. especially hard hit senior member near retirement. but risk dc scheme deliver low income replacement rate serious also young members. the disappoint performance dc scheme last decade likely sap employees’ confidence ability financial market provide adequate secure returns. where membership compulsory, may affect employees’ propensity join dc pension scheme pay pension contributions. the risk dc scheme provide low pension income compound reduction coverage public pensions. the possibility policy reversal cannot overlook either. in regard, tell country choice mandatory contribution fund dc pension scheme call question. ii. what i turn well-known policy response challenges. while is, i believe, wide consensus among academic expert practitioner need responses, obviously demand policymakers. but must clear delay design implementation could costly societies. first foremost, people encourage work longer. live long certainly positive development, especially good health (and take granted). but need resource enjoy long lives, mean income bi central bankers’ speech 3 jobs. there question, then, return g-20 define “strong, sustainable balance growth” fundamental objective economic policy. this help furnish accumulation fund necessary retirement, little question retirement age also go up. statutory pension age start rise number countries. however, accord oecd, five member country project gain life expectancy next four decade outstrip prospective increase retirement age. to insure financial sustainability pay-as-you-go schemes, possible measure include raise retirement age, introduce incentive late retirement, cut benefit index life expectancy (as done, example, notional define contribution systems). it could also helpful allow senior worker combine work pension income. in regard, worth recall evidence employment old worker reduce number job available young people. second, dc pension scheme deliver promises, view three top priorities: a) dc plan member must aware likely degree coverage provide retirement scheme. this crucial condition persuade worker increase retirement save help set target replacement rate accumulation plan. clear information expect replacement rate likely decline adverse investment scenario must provided. b) total cost plan member must reduced. a emphasized, among others, turner report middle last decade and, recently, squam lake work group financial regulation, charge may major impact final balance accrue plan member extend period time. cost reduce increase volume asset management, consequent economy scale, also stimulate competition among pension schemes. this may call various measures, include educate consumer effect charge pension fund returns; assure transparency comparability charge schemes; ease portability employer contribution schemes; intensify competition among financial institution manage pension funds. c) sound default option designed. while regulation dc plan take account characteristic national pension system whole (for example, share pension income provide dc plans), good practice would make enrolment dc plan automatic subject opt-out clause. moreover, default plan must carefully designed. in order encourage worker join (or opt out), default contribution rate could rather low initially rise gradually time. furthermore, default dc plan low fee diversify investment objectives, order ensure fair balance security yield invest retirement save financial instruments. these consideration also make clear performance dc pension scheme may affect workers’ degree financial literacy, highlight advance scientific research. a point 2005 g10 report age pension system reform, one policy challenge develop financial education programme “can help consumer avoid abuse fraud, improve investment choices, raise contribution private pension plans”. retirement-saving literacy programme address labour force thus important, although obviously must go hand-in-hand strong consumer protection. but develop sound, robust dc pillar enough ensure retirement income provide private pension adequate. in pure dc plans, member remain expose extreme financial market risks, see recent financial crisis. this serious risk, especially worker near retirement, may able will wait 4 bi central bankers’ speech full recovery financial markets. moreover, severe financial turmoil typically associate weak labour market old job seeker trouble find work may end retire early expect (rather delay retirement), low pension incomes. the importance extreme (financial counterparty) risk long-term financial contract demonstrate fact number country guarantee arrangement place protect benefit insolvency db plan sponsor; worker, move db plan dc plan imply abandon dual protection (the sponsor’s capital guarantee arrangement) favour protection all. this may call kind return guarantee dc plan member accumulation phase. available example include absolute return guarantee (as japan u states), guarantee return set pre-specified return, relative guarantee (as chile denmark), return tie industry average market benchmark. there evidence guarantee scheme minimum return set low negligible rate, return principal, surely withstand adverse financial market conditions. this consistent find research conduct bank italy, suggest order guarantee return insurance scheme cost-effective, credible, robust moral hazard, guarantee provide government fund properly risk-based premia. another important challenge face pension system give change nature labour markets. job mobility flexibility may hind accumulation retirement wealth. pension scheme allow fact worker may change job employer frequently past, also think way promote cross-border portability pension rights. issue vest period (implicit explicit) penalty fee regulate would important prevent kind predatory practice retirement savings. finally, pension fund industry may benefit greatly development retirement scheme emerging-market economies, economy also face le rapid population age come decades, pension system still develop especially fully-funded dimension. with current pace increase live standard emergence sizable middle class, vast potential demand retirement save vehicle economy would allow global financial industry generate important economy scale scope. at time, give sheer size potential save pools, competition among financial institution adequately promote risk excessive concentration market share properly countered. iii. ensure long-term effectiveness fund pension scheme but also two factor future considerably affect ability fund pension scheme meet goal provide pensioner adequate retirement income. the first crucial importance robust economic growth. the second design decumulation phase. both fund unfunded pension arrangement ultimately rely upon ability economic system create job allocate resource profitable investment opportunities. economic growth therefore fundamental determinant sustainability adequacy retirement system. however, highlight imf’s recent world economic outlook imf, advance economy potential output threaten remain considerably pre-crisis trends, unless financial structural policy significantly strengthened. partly result low potential growth advance countries, weight emerge market economy world output expect increase steadily come decades. in particular, asia expect great potential growth. accord recent projection asian development bank, 2010 2050 weight rise quarter global output 2010 least third bi central bankers’ speech 5 2050 pessimistic scenario, half current trend sustain convergence continue next forty years. if financial market well-developed, fund scheme make possible retirement wealth expand pace world economy. in order so, next decade asset allocation fund pension scheme gradually change geographical scope, order reflect rise weight asian latin american countries. it important observe matter keep investment return afloat take risks. a reckless chase high-yield asset around world would useless counterproductive. retirement save direct towards business activity may put world economy path strong sustainable growth. this raise number important issue global financial markets. on demand side, pension schemes’ trustee asset manager devote resource analysis emerge market economy contribution emerge market bond equities. moreover, extent geographical composition portfolio become key driver asset allocation, dc plan member also improve understand new investment opportunities. regulation, national international level, respond change need institutional investors. we ensure individual institutional investor accountable actions. a supply side financial markets, challenge face may even demanding. first, want ensure financial market keep track expansion asian rise economies, emerge market company good fundamental growth opportunity must access bond equity markets. if financial market emerge market economy limit capacity absorb foreign resources, capital inflow might fuel asset bubble even counterproductive economic growth economies. second, policy practice may differ across country depend institutional economic factors, uncertainty key policy areas, governance corporations, legal regulatory framework, enforceability contracts, tax burdens. finally, financial infrastructure advance emerge economy integrate global financial system, open foreign players, compliant international standard transparency. the last key priority need develop well-functioning annuity markets. in years’ time number pensioner payout instrument provide significant fraction retirement income bind increase, advance economy emerge develop economies. at moment, annuity market around world rather thin, except handful country private pension highly develop (such unite kingdom, switzerland, chile and, less extent, unite states). moreover, payout phase arrangement differ markedly across countries, term government intervention (through regulation taxation), instrument providers. policy action field target two broad objectives: choice payout instrument costs. the first goal develop product good protect risk materialize decumulation phase, namely inflation, longevity financial market risk. we think achieve inflation-protected stream income life retirement, also take account possibility people old age – spend health-care service – might increasingly able combine work pension income. on issue, repeatedly observed, adequate supply government inflation-linked ultra-long-term bond essential tool help financial institution offer inflation-linked annuity instrument serve pensioners’ needs. government also consider issue longevity bonds, provide financial institution guarantee extreme (financial longevity) risks. 6 bi central bankers’ speech the second broad policy goal would reduce price annuity similar instruments. in regard, main policy tool timely release accurate mortality tables, total population different subgroup population. improvement mortality table would help reduce adverse selection cost low premium aggregate longevity risk. foster instrument transparency comparability another useful option, would promote competition among annuity providers. iv. conclusion the adjustment pension system demographic transition complex process need close monitor continue unfold number year come. doubt viability public pay-as-you-go arrangement defined-benefit pension scheme persist. more importantly, grow concern ability defined-contribution pension scheme provide adequate income. some issue deal identify pension expert policymakers half decade ago more, far address part. at time, new issue come fore. i convince evidence gather far ongoing trends, industry practice policy – corroborate find dependable scientific literature – provide clear guideline ensure pension system fulfil mission give worker decent standard live retirement. member dc pension scheme must get sound information likely retirement income. the default option dc plan carefully designed. a first wave baby-boomers approach retirement, urgent develop market payout instruments. we promote competition among provider fund pension scheme annuities. we aware market-based arrangement may able cope extreme financial longevity risks. the centre gravity global pension fund industry increasingly shift towards asian emerging-market economies, term asset allocation business opportunities. to conclude, one favourite quote longevity risk lorenzo magnificent’s rhyme 500 year ago: “youth sweet well / but doth speed away / let gay / to-morrow, none tell” [trans. lorna de’ lucchi, 1922]. in world increase longevity population ageing, face risk expectation limit economic growth (and associate liquidity constraints) may reduce propensity save retirement make lorenzo’s hyperbolic discount appeal though illusionary alternative. but order oblige pay extremely high cost future – individuals, market participants, policymakers – must shun illusion. there alternative foster economic growth structural policies, maintain incentive retirement saving, facilitate supply long-term index financial instruments, properly design protect pay-out phase, upgrade regulatory supervisory framework. thank much attention. bi central bankers’ speech 1 mario draghi: open statement economic monetary affair committee european parliament open statement mr mario draghi, governor bank italy chairman financial stability board, candidate president european central bank, economic monetary affair committee european parliament, brussels, 14 june 2011. * * * i honour appear committee hearing, part process nomination presidency ecb. i trust read cv. what i want emphasize record professional experience financial matter central banker, long-standing commitment cause european construction. i serve member govern council general council european central bank since 2006, capacity governor bank italy. i believe able deliver positive results, although face exceptionally difficult challenges. i also take part many decision lead birth euro. in 1991, capacity director general italian treasury, i head italian delegation negotiate maastricht treaty. subsequently, i actively involve many step essential ensure italy’s adoption euro, particularly ambitious fiscal adjustment take place 1990s. i gain considerable experience prominent european international fora. here, let mention since april 2006 i chairman financial stability forum, become financial stability board (fsb) 2009. the fsb, bring together national international authority responsible financial stability international standard-setting bodies, coordinate work develop promote implementation effective regulatory supervisory financial sector policies. the detail information cv clarify long-standing professional academic experience economic, monetary bank matters. today, i would like concentrate introductory comment assessment experience emu main challenge i believe lie front us. ° ° ° let first say i honour consider candidate presidency ecb, i believe emu, euro centre, great success, success preserve sake citizen europe. let state none recent events, include global crisis, call fact question. the euro establish credible strong international currency, trade among euro-area country fostered, financial integration give enormous boost. price stability root conduct economic agents: twelve year euro, annual inflation area average 2 per cent, fully line definition price stability adopt govern council european central bank (ecb). this achievement noteworthy, consider headwind euro area weather, include substantial increase oil commodity price financial crisis. thank credibility gain years, eurosystem able keep inflation expectation steady crisis act speed flexibility demand 2 bi central bankers’ speech extraordinary circumstances. without emu, response different monetary policy could rapid decisive: would practically impossible achieve similar level coordination monetary field. this credibility must preserve i fully commit so. i believe root lie independence treaty grant ecb pursue mandate maintain price stability. i also firmly believe that, counterpart independence, ecb must ensure exercise responsibility high degree transparency accountability, first foremost towards citizen elect representative european parliament. i look forward pursue fruitful, frank open dialogue institution. we need responsible behaviour decision party involved, monetary, financial stability economic fields. ° ° ° start monetary policy, utmost importance recall credibility earn necessarily last forever; cannot take granted. an important challenge ecb manage exit still accommodative monetary policy stance phasing-out remain non-standard measures. the measure adopt ecb crucial restore orderly condition interbank markets, contain risk premia, preserve credit flow economy bad phase crisis. we avoid collapse financial system, support function transmission monetary policy economy and, ultimately, ensure price stability, thereby support european economy. however, measure nature temporary. there number sign normalisation money market access market-based finance bank euro area; recourse eurosystem operation declined. at time, concern sustainability public finance euro-area country lead strain number bank sector small number institution remain reliant central bank liquidity, account substantial share overall refinance volumes. the continue high degree uncertainty macroeconomic financial environment require careful assessment overall situation outlook. non-standard measure need phase extent long need support function transmission monetary policy economy; must make sure liquidity support economy maintain long appropriate; also sow seed future imbalance create addiction liquidity. at time, set policy rate must adjust aim deliver ecb’s mandate, – maintain price stability euro area medium term – pre-emptive manner, order avoid deterioration inflation expectations. it must fully clear neither sovereign debt crisis abnormal dependence bank central bank liquidity divert ecb pursue primary objective. ° ° ° secondly, challenge monetary policy come area financial stability. the financial crisis heighten emphasis financial stability raise number question relationship monetary policy. it show close interaction need macroeconomic macroprudential analyses, although also bring real trade-off objective price stability support ecb lend areas. bi central bankers’ speech 3 in respect, i believe synergy must exploit full, respective role responsibility must remain clearly distinct. monetary policy must keep focus preserve price stability medium term. a i mentioned, benefit sound monetary framework make – le – evident crisis. at time, monitor emergence monetary credit imbalance asset price development one important element robust monetary policy strategy; medium-term orientation also crucial. the ecb’s monetary policy strategy already go long way towards take concern account. however, monetary policy necessarily appropriate instrument deal credit asset price imbalances. the use macroprudential instrument target source financial exuberance may appropriate. the new european supervisory authority make important contribution respect. let remark ecb play important role european systemic risk board (esrb), provide logistical, analytical administrative support. an appropriate management interaction macroprudential monetary policy authority crucial success. the institutional arrangement adopt europe appear well-suited address problem may arise management monetary policy new macroprudential tools. it certainly important dialogue two body policy issue affect systemic risk. ° ° ° finally, let mention challenge construction europe itself. the sovereign debt crisis real test solidity european institution political europe whatever need ensure achievement economic monetary integration. the european surveillance national budgetary policy prove inadequate. for long time exceptionally favourable finance condition conceal difference member countries’ underlie condition economic policy absence really bind common rules. the global crisis accentuate investors’ perception risk reveal weakness architecture union. the exceptional response national government european authority limit risk contagion safeguard area’s financial stability. the financial support grant country great difficulty allow proceed adjustment shelter market volatility. it fiscal transfer country subject stringent conditions. there shortcut available: response debt crisis lie first foremost national policies, complete implementation adjustment plan agreed. solidarity among member country union must match sense responsibility compliance rules. look ahead, i believe step already take tackle weakness european architecture important. the proposal eu commission council reinforce surveillance budgetary policies. they make ambitious make procedure automatic shield arbitrary nature political negotiations. the european parliament important influence regard. the extension rule similar govern national budget surveillance macroeconomic imbalances, special consideration state member countries’ external accounts, also welcome development. 4 bi central bankers’ speech above all, structural reform aim boost economies’ competitiveness growth potential must top priority policy agenda, country hit debt crisis. in end, ultimate objective emu, measure success, ability promote growth economic social welfare. many matter direct responsibility ecb, ecb – i believe must continue – offer objective independent advice, base rigorous credible analysis. i hope continue exchange view issue future. bi central bankers’ speech 1 philipp hildebrand: the independence swiss national bank speech mr philipp hildebrand, chairman govern board swiss national bank, avenir suisse, zurich, 21 june 2011. * * * the speaker would like thank peter kuster support prepare paper. in addition, thank go rita kobel rohr helpful comment draw speech. be independence swiss national bank extensive stand outside reach democratic system base separation state powers, check balances? the topic central bank independence matter discussion beyond border switzerland. around world, debate start limit power, general, independence central banks, particular, case radical demand made.1 because many central bank find oblige resort large-scale unconventional measure financial crisis, surprise debate rag now. central bank indeed special institutions. they hold banknote-issuing monopoly provide domestic money market liquidity. consequently, never really short money. in switzerland, state confer banknote-issuing monopoly snb. this mean always requisite mean meet obligation swiss francs. however, stop make losses. a know, snb report large annual loss 2010. this due exchange rate loss foreign currency holdings. these increase substantially course foreign exchange market interventions, carry order counter deflationary threat identify us. the loss increase risk central bank balance sheet matter take seriously. the annual loss provoke critical remarks, particular regard independence ostensibly far-reaching powers. it understandable people question extensive measure take manage financial crisis. that part life democratic society. i therefore grateful opportunity present you, next minutes, think essence, boundary pitfall independence. i hope i able clarify one two misunderstand process. the reason snb independent happen suit member govern board, body responsible monetary policy. i assure would sometimes easy could accept instruction high body. what actually happen bear responsibility monetary policy decision take, take – typically – veil uncertainty. the reason independent good fulfil mandate. in words, independence purely mean high end. that end define article 5 national bank act pursue monetary policy serve interest country whole ensure price stability, take due account development economy. article 6 basis independence. under clause, explicitly prohibit seek accept instruction federal authorities. in words, oblige make decisions. 1 for instance, well-known u congressman – possibly future presidential candidate – go far call feed abolished. cf. paul, ron (2009), end fed, new york: hachette book group. 2 bi central bankers’ speech there good reason swiss legislator establish independence strongly. theory practical experience throughout world clear point. the independent central bank, good fulfil mandate. it much good chance ensure price stability thereby make contribution sustain economic development central bank independent.2 i plan overwhelm cite relevant literature.3 however, important reason put forward academic writer subject include difference legitimation, time horizon incentive politician central bankers. while politician legitimate popular election, central banker legitimate carry legal mandate best ability. political process often protracted, decision taken, result rapidly visible. available soon possible. by contrast, central banker able take decision quickly, result decision – whether good bad – may evident year later. it precisely lag often long credibility central banker essential. if central banker credible, economic entity trust them. a result, monetary policy effective. for instance, inflation rise due increase commodity prices, employee immediately ask high wage confident increase inflation temporary. thus independence necessary prerequisite central bank, order develop credibility require carry monetary policy. mind you, independence necessary – sufficient – prerequisite successful monetary policy. central bank independence monetary policy specifically swiss achievement. in many country help firmly establish inflation expectation long term. consequently, monetary policy react shock short-term, necessary. however, view certain characteristic swiss economy, independence snb appear particularly valuable. allow explain briefly, use experience financial crisis example. when extreme shock great financial crisis occur 2008–09, monetary policy position act rapidly. our well-developed social security system also fulfil role automatic stabiliser. discretionary fiscal policy, contrast, play relatively minor role. one reason federal system extensive decision-making power hand people. another extensive global integration openness swiss economy. this mean much impact fiscal programme design stimulate economy would felt abroad rather switzerland. there certainly positive side fact fiscal policy switzerland use actively, large extent, crisis management – evident think problem sovereign debt currently afflict countries. yet forget monetary policy bear lion’s share adjustment burden place. a i mention before, article 6 national bank act constitute foundation stone independence. however, principle snb independent central bank actually establish high level all, article 99 swiss constitution. this show importance attach independence snb constitutional 2 these find take account european monetary union founded. under maastricht treaty, country plan join union must independent

sovereign power. our independence comprise several dimension – function, institution, finance staff.4 i make point repeat fact must fulfil mandate without seek accept instruction either federal council federal assembly body. the snb institutionally independent legal entity right. it legal status special-statute joint-stock company. the financial dimension independence comprises, one hand, prohibition state financing. under article 11 national bank act, permit grant confederation loans. neither allow acquire government bond new issues. these provision strong defence fiscal policy bankroll central bank. on hand, take risk onto balance sheet regard absolutely necessary order fulfil mandate. in respect, lesson learn crisis that, good times, need ensure balance sheet robust possible, burden bad times. finally, term staff, independence express fact member snb executive body – govern board member deputy – appoint federal council fix comparatively long term six years.5 lady gentlemen, independence unlimited, however. first, absolute relate mandate. it swiss legislator charge u maintain price stability. incidentally, also apply mandate monetary policy core mandate, i talk today. the snb specify monetary policy mandate render measurable. a situation price stability prevail consumer price index (which calculate swiss federal office statistics, us) show average annual rate 2%. deflation also regard failure attain objective price stability. where independent choice mean fulfil mandate. under article 9 national bank act, may use great many instruments, needed. this broad flexibility within statutory legislation (which come force 2004) prove huge advantage crisis, also comparison central banks. for instance, quickly position issue debt certificate develop large market them. we use snb bill need money. they use absorb excess liquidity money market. second, independence unconditional. with privilege duty independent action come particular responsibility. and whoever bear responsibility democratic constitutional state must accountable actions, mean choose result achieved.6 consequently, article 7 national bank act, maintain regular exchange information federal council, snb federal council inform one another decision significant economic monetary impact. this important us, ensure familiar fiscal political framework within conduct monetary policy. nevertheless, body retain full 4 cf. also message revision national bank act 26 june 2002, ff 2002 6107 6109. 5 together possibility re-election, help set incentive member govern board way ensure long-term fulfilment statutory mandate also individual interest. 6 other society espouse comparable principles, “it cannot acceptable democratic society group unelected individual vest important responsibility without open full scrutiny accountability.” cf. speech give alan greenspan 5 december 1996 “'the challenge central bank democratic society,” washington d.c. also, “democratic principle demand that, agent government, central bank must accountable pursuit mandate goals, responsive public elect representative transparent policies.” cf. speech give ben bernanke 26 may 2010, “central bank independence, transparency accountability,” tokyo. 4 bi central bankers’ speech responsibility area.7 each year submit accountability report federal assembly, outline fulfil mandate. also, frequent occasion call upon provide full account action relevant parliamentary commissions. in addition, provide general public regular information assessment economic situation monetary policy – press release half-yearly medium conference immediately quarterly monetary policy assessments, speech interviews. in way ensure transparency. through legal status joint-stock company, also duty towards shareholder fulfil year, general meeting, within framework set national bank act. the canton – majority shareholder – well represent supervisory body operate matters, bank council. a see, special characteristic swiss system take account. federalism mirror composition bank council distribution shareholding – least – distribution profit. the swiss constitution national bank act provide snb’s profit pay confederation cantons. two-thirds accrue canton one-third confederation. however, distribution carry balance sheet snb’s result allow done. the robustness balance sheet, words, set aside provision currency reserves, take first priority distribution. this derive directly legislation. the appreciation swiss franc currency weaken balance sheet last year. in addition, volatile result may expect next year current size balance sheet uncertain situation capital markets. consequently, possibility distribution confederation canton suspend certain year cannot excluded. fiscal interest must take back seat come ensure long-term monetary policy freedom action independence. the govern board also genuinely swiss. the executive body consist three member equal right jointly carry task define article 46 national bank act bear joint responsibility them. first foremost, law describe task conceptional operational monetary policy decisions. the chairman special powers. consequently, responsibility shared. transparency accountability crucial, particularly time crisis, information need general public financial markets, well authorities, increase exponentially. we respond need. for instance, information central bank balance sheet item snb bill step up, news conference watch website. during course crisis, particular, time measure strengthen swiss financial system october 2008, number appearance govern board member parliamentary commission increase significantly.8 i would like hazard guess snb never transparent today. in respect, also stand well international comparison. 7 this also lay message revision national bank act regard art. 7 para. 1 nba (6191), “the snb’s decision-making autonomy must retain accountability would otherwise inevitably come conflict authority act independently instruction (under art. 6).” consequently, snb bear “sole responsibility mandate describe art. 5” federal council, turn, “is solely responsible economic decision fall within area responsibility.” 8 in 2010, member govern board appear 13 time parliamentary commissions. bi central bankers’ speech 5 however, central bank independence pitfalls. a latent threat independence can, principle, always say exist. this threat particularly great time crisis. consequently right important, recent crisis, central bank around world work closely governments. however, risk false expectation raise amongst politicians. central bank need remain firm concentrate monetary policy mandate. while necessary close government authority time emergency, crisis confined, little distance order. a i outline beginning, snb also take exceptional measure order fulfil mandate. in so, show prepare make use independence granted. what essential always guide solely mandate make decisions. at time, continually analyse development constantly draw conclusion view future actions. base this, snb continue use instrument judge best suit necessary fulfil mandate interest country whole, best ability. the snb must able continue exercise independence without fundamentally questioned. lady gentlemen, i show snb’s independence limit fulfil mandate entrust politicians, accountable mandate. the snb powerful. with precision swiss watchmaker, embed democratic institutions, constitutional state society nation.9 we aware high level responsibility attach mandate-related independence. that use independence grant prudence. 9 one predecessor describe snb as, “to extent”, “the fourth power land”, add comfort comment “this additional element within – generally speak – highly develop balance power switzerland, function well” (lusser, geldpolitik 1996). cf. lusser, markus (1996), geldpolitik, p. 100, zurich: verlag neue zürcher zeitung. bi central

although canadian financial system currently sound footing, bank judge that, largely external factors, risk stability remain elevate edge high since december. of five risk identify fsr, i would like concentrate three: – first, sovereign balance sheet remain strain many advance economies. fiscal strain euro-area periphery continue build despite continue effort affect country assistance international monetary fund european commission. whether sovereign credit event occurs, strain could trigger sharp repricing credit risk government high debt burdens, well generalize retrenchment risk-taking global markets, include market canada. – second, long period low interest rate globally may fuel excessive risk-taking. the search yield could cause risk underprice lead investor take exposure may able manage condition become le benign. our institution lull false sense security current low rates. – lastly, high level household indebtedness increase financial vulnerability canada. canadian indebted (relative income) american british. the bank estimate proportion canadian household would highly vulnerable adverse economic shock rise high level nine years, despite improve economic condition ongoing low level interest rates. this partly reflect fact increase aggregate household debt past decade drive household high debt levels. – there offsets. debt largely fix rate

spring meet the japan society monetary economics, tokyo, 28 may 2011. * * * i. introduction i honor invite today japan society monetary economics. it great significance discussion among academics, practitioner policymakers academic field, certainly true field monetary economics. a i work central bank long time, also place university while, i sincerely hope deepen intellectual interaction among academics, practitioner policymakers. today, viewpoint policymaker practitioner, i offer think title “money, government security a central bank.” since 2000s, global credit bubble ensue financial crisis mark strike event global finance. the course event bubble ensue crisis period shed new light interdependency confidence government, financial system central bank. during bubble period precede crisis, implicit government guarantee government-sponsored enterprise (gses) fannie mae freddie mac one cause residential bubble unite states. during crisis period failure lehman brothers, decisive action back confidence government require order end crisis. the u.s. european government force make large-scale capital injection guarantee financial institution restore confidence private financial institution stability financial system. the government also employ aggressive fiscal policy decisive macroeconomic measure escape sharp deep economic contractions. even crisis, confidence government remain important issue. since mid-2009, world economy gradually recovered, thus prevent deep depression, different path 1930s. however, confidence sovereign debt erode due deterioration fiscal balance. at present, greece european peripheral country hit severely deterioration fiscal balance result sovereign debt problems. those country face adverse feedback loop among sovereign risks, financial system real economy. although japan confront rise yield government securities, deterioration fiscal balance also severe. the issue confidence government relevant central bank. after failure lehman brothers, central bank advance countries, include japan, take unconventional policy measures. those measure pure monetary policy define liquidity provisioning. they included, less, quasi-fiscal policy elements. debate still go regard extent central bank pursue monetary policy, namely, relationship central bank government, relationship monetary fiscal policy. look back series events, i hope understand i choose topic money, government security central bank. bi central bankers’ speech 1 ii. interdependency confidence money government security i start talk two financial assets, money government security (slide 1). money play important role mean payment, unit account store value. the primary form money central bank money consist banknote issue central bank deposit central bank current accounts. in japan, balance central bank money 122 trillion yen march 2011. in addition, bank deposits, easily convertible central bank money, also function money. the outstanding balance bank deposit 1,024 trillion yen. the outstanding balance japanese government security 865 trillion yen. a government us security mean funding; central bank us instrument monetary control; investor include private financial institution use one primary financial asset investment. since government security are, many cases, regard risk-free asset whose credit risk negligible, yield government security often use benchmark rate price various financial instruments. both money government security merely piece paper represent liability issuers, i.e., central bank, private bank government. the debtor central bank money central bank, debtor bank deposit private banks, debtor government security government. although financial asset intrinsic value material themselves, regard valuable asset fulfill functions. that ultimately holder money government security confidence issuer debts. the importance confidence new topic; textbook monetary economics emphasize importance. governments, central bank private bank make best effort maintain confidence. government make effort maintain medium- long-term fiscal balances. central bank maintain stability price financial system conduct monetary policy, action lender last resort, financial supervision, others. private bank maintain capital base, manage various risks, provide credit intermediation payment services. my point today interdependency confidence. confidence issuer support issuer’s effort also fact confidence issuer maintain member society understand importance confidence other. now, i elaborate interdependency confidence. determination government underpin confidence private financial institution first, confidence bank deposit private banks, debt financial institutions, significantly affect confidence government well. the global financial crisis failure lehman brother demonstrate that. after failure, financial institution lose confidence other’s creditworthiness, interbank money market almost stop working. under circumstances, central bank act lender last resort aggressively provide fund order deal liquidity shortage financial institutions. although provision liquidity central bank extremely important crisis failure lehman brothers, alone enough restore stability financial system. that adverse feedback loop financial system real economy erode capital position financial institution thereby confidence solvency significantly. a central issue shift liquidity shortage problem capital shortage problem, government require inject public capital guarantee senior debt financial institution order 2 bi central bankers’ speech restore confidence private financial institutions. the amount public capital inject government unite states, unite kingdom, germany france recent global financial crisis reach equivalent 84 trillion yen.1 the experience suggest stability money financial system also depend confidence governments. support public underpin confidence government second, talk importance confidence government, i would like emphasize confidence government is, end, underpin support public. after global financial crisis, fiscal condition many country deteriorate seriously result decrease fiscal revenue associate downturn economic conditions, aggressive fiscal policy capital injection financial institutions. the international monetary fund (imf) report fiscal deficit advance economy g20 country 1.7 percent gdp 2007. the deficit rise 9.4 percent 2009 project high 8.0 percent 2011 (slide 2). the report note half increase outstanding public debt g20 advance economy due decrease fiscal revenues, nearly 20 percent increase due fiscal stimulus measure authorities’ support financial institutions.2 when fiscal condition deteriorate, confidence government’s ability repay debt declines. a i mention earlier, confidence private financial institution affect confidence government well. therefore, confidence government undermined, confidence private financial institution affect various channels. the channel include decline value government security hold, erosion ability fund due depreciation value collateral among others. real economic activity suffer rise fund rate difficulty obtain liquidity. a result, tax revenue decline confidence government’s ability repay debt weakened. in words, adverse feedback loop emerge among sovereign risk, financial system real economic activities. although cause sovereign debt problem european peripheral country vary country country, common nature problem adverse feedback loop. when private financial institution face financial crisis, government succeed stabilize economy financial system inject public capital conduct countercyclical fiscal policy. a prerequisite success government perceive secure future revenue cover current expenditure. if government perceive lack sufficient future revenue cover increase expenditure due public capital injection expansionary fiscal policy, effect policy measure may lessen, even worse, could adverse. the key success various aggressive policy measure emergency confidence government’s ability maintain sustainability medium- long-term fiscal balance. various aggressive policy government crisis become effective government “stock” confidence it. and substance stock is, end, support public maintain sustainability fiscal balance. a government able pursue fiscal policy regardless support public way wave magic wand. 1 the figure total amount public capital injection march 2010 unite states, unite kingdom, germany france. for details, see bank japan, “financial system report” (march 2010). 2 see imf, “fiscal monitor” (may 2010). bi central bankers’ speech 3 determination government support public underpin confidence central bank third, i would like emphasize confidence central bank maintain solely effort central bank. support understand government public importance confidence central bank also essential. since recent global financial crisis, central bank around world conduct unconventional monetary policy large scale.3 there universally-accepted definition “unconventional monetary policy,” “convention” vary country country. in case bank england, unconventional monetary policy mean large-scale purchase long-term government bond asset purchase programme. by contrast, bank japan conduct purchase long-term government bond nearly fifty years. in respect, purchase long-term government bond one “conventional monetary policy” measures. an unconventional monetary policy measure bank japan lehman shock purchase corporate bonds, commercial paper (cps), exchange-traded fund (etfs), real estate investment trust (reits), etc. in case fed, typical unconventional monetary policy measure purchase cps mortgage-backed securities. a i mention above, central bank act decisively maintain stability financial system wake recent financial crisis. in situation, confidence central bank prerequisite central bank take decisive actions. i explain point take expansion central bank’s balance sheet example. when financial system become unstable, demand liquidity increases. opportunity cost hold central bank money could negligible extremely low short-term interest rates. under condition, increase central bank money necessarily lead price hike. a matter fact, even though balance central bank current account monetary base increase markedly japan unite state recent years, inflation rate country rise (slide 3). however, crucial central bank capacity take necessary action promptly increase interest rate require due change economic conditions. if market participant public perceive central bank unable take prompt action “for reasons” needed, rampant inflation may follow amount money extremely large. “some reasons” include these. one would oppose increase interest rate grind concern capital loss government security hold private financial institution concern increase interest payment government securities. although argument exist time, argument tend heat outstanding balance government security large period low interest rate continue longer. confidence central bank form complicate manner, country design institutional arrangement deliberately central bank act carefully conduct policy order maintain confidence. i come back point detail later. iii. issue relate fiscal balance have talk interdependency confidence, let discus importance confidence light japan’s current fiscal condition. 3 a unconventional monetary policy take central bank failure lehman brothers, see monetary affair department, bank japan, “major central banks’ policy operation current financial crisis,” (july 2009, japanese). 4 bi central bankers’ speech japan’s current fiscal condition severe (slide 4). the outstanding amount gross financial liability government high 198 percent gdp. a japanese government, unlike major countries’ governments, large amount financial assets, observer argue net liability rather gross liability may adequate indicator true indebtedness japanese government. in term net financial liability government, japan still rank bad among develop country ratio 114 percent, high italy, 103 percent. in event, far japan experience currency crisis financial crisis trigger deterioration fiscal balance occur countries. though necessity sustainability fiscal balance generally well recognize japan, argument raise alarm risk associate deterioration fiscal balance sometimes regard cry wolf. that japanese government security issue smoothly year yield long-term japanese government bond (jgbs) stable low level spite deteriorate fiscal balance. no country perpetuate fiscal deficit. confidence government’s ability repay debt change non-linear fashion. the european sovereign debt problem start greece case point. in fall 2009, widen spread government security european peripheral country germany become evident (slide 5). in october 2009, spread 2 percent, suddenly widen dramatically remain high level currently 13.4 percent greece, 8.0 percent ireland 6.6 percent portugal. though macroeconomic condition change drastically since fall 2009 countries, market participants’ perception change substantially. yield jgbs stable low level 1.15 percent average fiscal 2010 (slide 6). one frequent question i get international meet yield jgbs stable low level despite severe fiscal condition. accord economic theory, quick answer expectation low growth rate low inflation rate. if compare past 10-years’ average nominal growth rates, sum japan’s real gdp growth inflation rate, 10-year jgb yields, witness follow similar path generally albeit small deviation (slide 6). the low stable jgb yield explicable many investor expect prevail past 10 year continue next 10 years. however, low growth inflation rate sufficient explain low yield jgbs. long-term interest rate determine expect growth rate expect inflation rate, also risk premium compensate uncertainties. thus, fully explain low yield jgbs, discus risk premium low. in regard, i point follow two. first, market participant believe japan ultimately ability work fiscal consolidation despite severe fiscal condition. second, confidence maintain bank japan’s conduct monetary policy focus achieve sustainable economic growth price stability. to put differently, confidence two point undermined, rise risk premium would raise yield jgbs. that clearly underscore responsibility government parliament formulate fiscal policy central bank conduct monetary policy. a i mention early confidence one entity underpin confidence entities, crucial entity recognize importance confidence entities. ultimately, confidence money government security underpin determination people recognize importance confidence. and, support public able exist comprehensive account government central bank, people’s understand situation base account. the future always full uncertainties, i see two tendency market participant public form expectation long-term future. first, may bi central bankers’ speech 5 tend think continue long period stay is. in context current japanese economy, may think yield long-term government bond continue stable low level future yield long time. second, change begin occur trigger, change remind big event past may think drastic change occur. market participant public may drastically change expectation trigger increase fiscal deficit event make market participant public think independence bank japan respected. then, may expect rampant inflation occur end. have mention two contradictory tendencies, i add quite difficult predict former tendency replace latter. what certain expectation change non-linear fashion. that principle authorities’ behavior clear. it vital fiscal authority work sustainability fiscal balance midium- long-run. the deterioration fiscal balance low increase expect future income households, especially working-age population, thus reduce current household expenditure. to make thing worse, confidence fiscal sustainability eroded, adverse feedback loop among fiscal balance, financial system real economy may exert negative impact economic activity, show sovereign debt problem european peripheral countries. iv. role central bank government security use government security money market operation principle central bank’s behavior must clear well fiscal authorities. let discus principle central bank’s behavior association government securities. first, let show fact relationship bank japan jgb market. the bank japan us jgbs conduct money market operation (slide 7). during one-year period april year, central bank money increase 20.7 trillion yen liability side bank japan’s balance sheet. correspondingly, jgbs increase 8.2 trillion yen asset side result outright purchase jgbs. to deal short-term fluctuation financial institutions’ demand reserves, bank conduct funds-supplying operation pool collateral. the operation bank extend loan financial institution pool collateral submit beforehand. during one-year period april year, loan increase 20.1 trillion yen jgbs account 80 percent collateral. it example jgbs play important role bank’s money market operations.4 apparently, bank proactive among central bank major country use government security money market operations. this way, bank japan us jgbs large scale conduct money market operations. in context, i would like stress goal central bank’s outright purchase jgbs satisfy demand secular growth currency conduct monetary policy, finance government debt stabilize yield long-term government bonds. if market participant regard central bank’s outright purchase jgbs mean government finance stabilization long-term jgb yields, resultant hike risk premium would raise yield long-term government bonds. if rise yield long-term government bond reflect improvement economic 4 for detail bank’s use jgbs conduct money market operations, see financial market department, bank japan, “money market operation fiscal 2010.” (may 2011). 6 bi central bankers’ speech conditions, rise yield natural desirable. however, rise yield long-term government bond reflect rise risk premium, exert negative impact real economy financial strength financial institutions. the bank make principle outright purchase jgbs clear. this principle, call “banknote principle,” work prevent uncertainty bank’s action raise risk premium thus exert negative impact economy finance. more specifically, bank keep total amount hold government bond outstanding amount banknote circulation. some criticize bank establish principle. however, central bank hold large amount government bond purchase government bond without make fundamental principle purchase clear, increase uncertainty would create risk premium lead rise yield long-term government bonds. in addition ceiling total hold government bonds, bank also make public amount purchase specific maturity segment well frequency purchase advance (slide 8). in 2009, bank increase amount bank’s outright purchase jgbs 1.8 trillion yen per month, is, 21.6 trillion yen per year. since then, bank keep ceiling. the average duration jgbs purchase bank 4 year 2010. if bank purchase jgbs current pace, lead bank hold 82 trillion yen jgbs, amount calculate multiply amount purchase per year average duration. the current outstanding amount banknote around 81 trillion yen. at present, outstanding amount jgbs hold bank 60 trillion yen le banknotes. however, bank continue purchase jgbs pace, outstanding amount jgbs reach banknotes. the outstanding amount banknote future cannot predict certainty depend income, interest rate degree stability financial system future. the bank think desirable economic financial stability bank continue purchase jgbs stable pace, base upon best possible forecast economic developments. underwrite government security bank japan now, i talk idea underwrite government security bank, occasionally advocate way fund new government spending. in many countries, law allow central bank directly underwrite government securities. in europe, underwrite prohibit law explicitly. in many country around world, include emerge economies, allowed, either. in japan, article 5 public finance act prohibit bank underwrite government securities. the principle prohibit central bank underwrite government security derive historical lessons. history show underwrite central bank introduced, often lead excess issuance money hence rampant inflation, even seem control initial phase. the excess issuance money resultant inflation destroy people’s life national economy. base upon conventional wisdom, introduction bank’s underwrite government security would damage confidence money. the damage would lead high long-term interest rate instability financial market. then, government might able issue debt primary market. the current condition auction japanese government security remain stable even recent great east japan earthquake. still, take account deteriorate fiscal condition japan, utmost importance maintain current stable condition primary government security market. bi central bankers’ speech 7 confidence money well-developed government security market part social infrastructure japanese economy. now, even important maintain confidence money government security international domestic grounds, give severe fiscal condition damage recent earthquake japanese economy. let add word bank’s bitter experience oft-quoted underwrite government bond early 1930s veteran finance minister korekiyo takahashi initiate it. though commentator refer episode time favor, necessarily recognize big difference financial economic condition time present (slide 9). first, condition financial market tight eve bank’s underwrite government bond early 1930s. the overnight call rate 6.6 percent december 1931, compare current level 0.07 percent. the long-term interest rate 5.9 percent december 1931, compare current level 1.14 percent. second, fiscal condition much good early 1930s 2011. the outstanding amount government security 47.6 percent gnp end december 1931, compare 181.9 percent gdp end march 2011. third, bank’s underwrite government bond early 1930s associate tight capital control early 1930s. by contrast, financial market economic activity much globalize now. under circumstances, misconduct monetary fiscal policy, lead deterioration confidence money, would affect long-term interest rate immediately. fourth, relative size domestic financial market small early 1930s today, government security market le developed. in 1920s early 1930s, government issue security mainly syndicate private financial institution deposit bureau ministry finance. a large part fund deposit bureau come postal savings. under condition, government lack effective measure issue large amount security promptly smoothly. during first several year mr. takahashi office, bank able sell underwrite government bond secondary market promptly. the amount bank’s hold government security grow significantly, hence monetary base not, either. by contrast, well-developed primary government security markets. even recent earthquake, government able issue security market smoothly, bid-to-cover ratio primary market remain unchanged. although commentator mention sharp depreciation japanese exchange rate early 1930s, exchange rate regime time quite different. after departure gold standard end 1931, yen depreciate overvalue level gold standard. by contrast, japan flexible exchange rate system today. a many know, mr. takahashi assassinate 1936 militarist try stop ever-growing demand military spending, course event lead eventual rampant inflation. i would argue introduction scheme bank’s underwrite government security pave way eventual balloon fiscal spending, precisely scheme lack check process market mechanism. we often use word “entrance” “exit” discus conduct monetary policy nowadays. in terminology, interpret “entrance” introduction 8 bi central bankers’ speech bank’s underwrite government bond early 1930s lead “exit” failure contain grow demand fiscal expenditure. in retrospect, note bank’s underwrite government bond start “temporary measure.”5 though mr. takahashi state issue government bond mean bank’s underwrite temporarily address diet session,6 history tell u temporary. today, central bank allow underwrite government security emerge economy well develop countries. underwrite government security central bank may eventually lead excess issuance money rampant inflation, devastate people’s life economic activity, even though may appear problem beginning. human prone temptations, time, human aware take preventive measure prohibit central banks’ underwrite government securities. we able improve fiscal balance simply create inflation (slide 10). inflation may cause increase tax revenue, data last twenty year japan shows, change fiscal revenue show significant correlation inflation. rather, fiscal revenue increase economy grow real terms. expenditure social security public work increase inflation. interest payment government debt also increase inflation, since long-term interest rate also go up, reflect inflation. in interest time, i get detail fiscal issues. what clear need review overall structure revenue expenditure order improve fiscal balance. also, high economic growth need improve fiscal balance. here, bear mind growth real term rather nominal term matters. it note view high nominal growth need improvement fiscal balance misleading. that view give false impression economic growth real term inflation would exert impact fiscal balance. the truth inflation per se improve fiscal balance. the crucial element improve fiscal balance steady effort toward high economic growth real terms. when high economic growth achieved, price may rise result. v. conclude remark now, time conclude speech. let first emphasize money financial system essential sustain economic growth, confidence important foundation money financial system perform roles. the start point obviously effort maintain confidence government, central bank private financial institutions, respectively. the government maintain fiscal balance medium- long-run. the central bank maintain stability price financial system conduct monetary policy lender-of-last-resort function. private financial institution provide payment settlement service credit intermediation function properly. those individual effort important, alone sufficient achieve stability money financial system. confidence private financial institution depend confidence government well. to maintain confidence government, achieve medium- long-term fiscal balance important precondition. support public also essential achieve fiscal balance. confidence government security 5 fukai, eigo, reflection seventy years, 1941 (in japanese). 6 “the address government debt policy fiscal 1933 budget,” january 21, 1933, plenary meeting, 64th diet, ministry finance, financial history showa era, vol.6 (1954, japanese). bi central bankers’ speech 9 underpin confidence central bank. confidence central bank may enhance government people respect central bank’s judgments, may erode not. in words, confidence money financial system interdependent other. confidence something like air; nobody doubt existence normal times. confidence may wane discontinuous manner unless make utmost effort maintain it. once confidence lost, impact economy enormous. confidence fragile. i start talk mention importance dialogue among academics, practitioner policymakers. let conclude sincerely hop we, member japan society monetary economics bank japan, cooperate promote understand society importance maintain confidence money financial system. thank you. 10 bi central bankers’ speech bi central bankers’ speech 11 12 bi central bankers’ speech bi central bankers’ speech 13 14 bi central bankers’ speech bi central bankers’ speech 15 nout wellink: look beyond current reform speech mr nout wellink, president netherlands bank chairman basel committee bank supervision, amsterdam financial forum, amsterdam, 17 june 2011. * * * the history the grand date back 1578, even establishment amsterdam stock exchange, old world. in course centuries, build the grand undergo quite architectural change additions. a consequence, become outdated, today provide great location amsterdam financial forum. it easy see parallel architecture site future global financial architecture, topic session. we need keep financial system regulation date well make quite change addition course time. my term governor come end. in two week time, i hand presidency dutch central bank successor, klaas knot. in last days, i go look back past 14 years. neither i focus go financial system today. instead, i share think future financial system. that future shape broad set new regulation address weakness expose financial crisis. in speech, i briefly highlight main element reforms. after that, i focus consequence financial system – intend unintended ones. look beyond current reforms, i also message regulator financial sector. key element current reform the financial system currently reformed. some new rule already fully effect, others phase still flesh out. for issues, approach differ per country. nonetheless, several key common element identified. i discus follow four: capital requirements, liquidity requirements, measure reduce excessive risk taking, resolution measures. capital requirement first key element. during crisis, turn bank insufficient buff withstand large losses. the basel iii framework therefore set tight capital standards. most importantly, require quality bank capital improved. a large part capital must consist common equity, loss absorb type. furthermore, bank increase size capital buffer. the new regulation involve high minimum capital ratio well heavy risk weight specific activities. for proprietary trading, cause large loss crisis, investment re-securitisations, complex relatively high-risk financial instrument, bank hold much large capital buffers. still, good times, risk may underestimated. therefore new regulation also set limit leverage regardless risk weights. to ensure build-up additional buff good time enhance capacity bank absorb loss bad times, basel iii framework introduce dynamic capital requirements. these come top minimum capital requirement must meet time banks. the dynamic buff consist two parts. one part, capital conservation buffer, relate build-up buff profit individual bank. the part, countercyclical buffer, relate condition economy large. this truly novelty: first time history, macroprudential element include international bank regulations. bi central bankers’ speech 1 on top minimum dynamic requirements, capital surcharge systemically important banks. this make bank whose failure would pose great threat financial system yet little bite safer. the second key element current reform concern liquidity requirements. these essential make financial system stable. liquidity maturity transformation core bank business provide large benefit economy. it enable household company earn interest save access time, provide essential long-term finance economy. however, excessive, maturity transformation create vulnerability market shock become source instability financial system. during crisis, insufficient management liquidity risk emerge major problem. even well-capitalised financial institution experience liquidity problem central bank need intervene, include unconventional measures, provide large scale finance thereby prevent escalation. therefore new liquidity requirements, introduce part basel iii framework, utmost importance. they require bank hold sufficient high quality liquid asset cover net cash outflow period 30 day stress scenario. in addition, set minimum requirement use long-term stable fund source finance long-term lending. together, measure help prevent excessive maturity transformation. give importance liquidity requirements, worry eu yet show clear commitment implement full, without reservations. next capital liquidity requirements, variety measure aim reduce excessive risk taking. these third element current reforms. for instance, us, volcker rule may impose direct restriction trade bank account. for bank base europe, excessive risk take discourage remuneration rules. these rule require trader significant risk-taking role receive part bonus form share delay several years. thus, high-risk trade result large losses, trader share losses. the fourth key element current reform consist resolution measures. the crisis show current regulatory tool large bank cannot allow fail, cost society would large. however, bank failure never fully prevent – even new rule capital liquidity measures. it therefore essential bank failure resolve minimal cost and, possible, without taxpayer support. resolution measure include preparation recovery resolution plans, live wills. these plan provide detail guidance emergency measure and, fail, orderly restructure bankruptcy. in addition, country discussion precautionary measure ring-fencing retail activities. regardless precise regulatory approach, make failure large international bank – however unlikely may – manageable event, bank may need change structure. unfortunately, near future, resolution framework remain focus national level, international resolution regime politically feasible. a consequence, resolution inhibit complex structure large banks, many consist thousand legal entity world interconnect variety financial arrangements. to able quickly restructure bank time crisis, interdependency must make transparent reduced. consequence financial system the current reform undoubtedly increase resilience financial institution enhance stability system whole. however, also broad consequence financial system. some consequence intended, others 2 bi central bankers’ speech unintended. look beyond current reforms, take year fully implemented, i say something outcomes. what follow refer financial system whole, specific country institutions. first, besides reduce risks, reform inevitably lead unintended risk shifting. the new regulation increase resilience discourage excessive risk take part financial sector, elsewhere financial risk likely grow larger. for instance, risk shift households. there already ongoing trend insurer provide le guarantee new life insurance policies. this largely drive lesson institutional investor learn previous crises, may well reinforce new regulations, solvency 2. a consequence, household bear financial market risks, even though may well equip deal risks. that unintended consequence. like crisis, risk may also shift unregulated entity form shadow bank system. maturity liquidity transformation take place within official bank system, also outside it. to extent, address current reforms. however, part financial innovation always aim circumvent exist regulations. an unintended likely outcome therefore time, risk shift yet unregulated areas. the response control innovation, closely monitor main vulnerability financial system adapt regulatory framework necessary. a second consequence financial system reform induce change business models. for bank insurers, activity investment become le attractive due current reforms. bank may move certain trade account, instance, require capital buff reduce return equity. under solvency 2, insurer may find unattractive continue invest complex structure products, high risk weight detail analysis require underlie assets. furthermore, retail deposit become favour source bank funding, consequence new liquidity requirements. these examples. such change business model merely side effects; necessary outcome current reforms. change business model fully intend consequence. if would significant change business models, would mean risk profile remain high potential threat stability financial system insufficiently addressed, need see tighten rules. the profound change business model probably result capital liquidity requirement measure reduce excessive risk taking. instead, profound impact come resolution measures. that effective resolution measure put end “too big fail” “too big save” status systemically important financial institutions. when loose status, large financial institution also loose important competitive advantage small le interconnect institutions. at present, systemically important bank enjoy implicit subsidy fund costs. this apparent credit ratings, instance. credit rat agency assign high rat large bank intrinsic financial strength would justify. the rat enhancement reflect probability government support large five notches. for small banks, enhancement low even zero, perceive small bank le likely receive government support get trouble. effective resolution measure thus eliminate support-related rat advantage low fund cost large banks. a capital surcharge systemically important bank fit reason compensate unfair benefit large. this fully intend consequence enhance economic efficiency market discipline. bi central bankers’ speech 3 but may unintended consequence too. ideally, government would agree international resolution framework, require international burden share case would support restructure cross-border bank. at present, realistic option. the alternative, national resolution regimes, imply degree autonomy domestic retail operation may necessary precondition effective resolution. this come cost. financial integration make financial market efficient, especially within common market like eu. it enable bank raise fund readily available invest fund generate large return, even another country. in addition, bank diversify risk combine retail investment banking. if economic benefit international universal bank operation cannot fully realised, would unintended indeed undesirable outcome. a third consequence current reform impact financial markets. we know sure impact almost sure direction changes. for instance, bank need attract stable long-term funding. at time, european insurers, important provider bank funding, show increase preference investment cover bond low capital requirement solvency 2. together range factors, give boost european cover bond markets. however, cannot sure large permanent change be. that many different factor work. some market participants, pension fund large investors, much le affect current reforms. they respond change market price may partly offset impact new regulations. this make overall impact financial market uncertain. it therefore important major new regulation phase gradually. the new liquidity measure bank provide example approach. they phase four seven year prevent large shock financial markets. in addition, subject observation period facilitate mitigation undesirable outcomes. a fourth consequence current reform financial system continue suffer important distortions. in words, incentive financial institution behave way public interest. of course, always case. the perfect world economists, without distortion friction kind, exist models. still, worth point important distortion current reform unable tackle. perhaps important distortion high leverage remain attractive financial corporation interest payment tax deductible. this make attractive company use debt finance le equity capital would desirable social point view. of course, distortion exist non-financial corporation well. yet financial sector troublesome, tax consideration effect fund choices, also stimulate design tax-driven financial products. such product may add little economic value, create leverage complexity, increase vulnerability financial system make difficult monitor. another distortion current reform uniform across countries. for example, country large financial sector, switzerland, require large bank hold capital international standard. furthermore, eu remuneration rule apply global operation bank headquarter europe u volcker rule apply global operation bank headquarter us. the lack uniformity unintended consequence bank operate abroad market, headquarter different countries, observe different rules. this cause unfair competition, induce arbitrage create complexity. however, resolution frameworks, political reality reforms, however desirable may be, pass national level. 4 bi central bankers’ speech bi central bankers’ speech 5 conclude remark look beyond current reforms, major change financial system, intend others unintended. regulator monitor consequence carefully respond see. risk shift away regulate tightly. regulator also need evaluate impact financial market effect market distortions. if detect emergence new vulnerabilities, rule need adjusted. furthermore, business model adapted. if large bank undergo substantial transformation, tighten bank regulation require produce intend outcome. one thing certain: beyond current reforms, reform necessary safeguard stability financial system. it take ten year develop basel ii framework. the current, profound reform take shape half period. future regulator continue trend make sure regulation financial system keep evolving, especially public concern global financial crisis fade away. and ideally, next round reform even harmonise international level, reduce unfair competition unproductive barrier financial integration. i also two message financial sector. first, within new regulatory framework, important financial institution continue strengthen risk assessments. to executive present here, i would say: responsibility well. second, risk shift financial innovation imply regulatory framework continue evolve never completed. therefore business model sufficiently flexible fine-tune current set regulations. you see today’s regulator quick determine pas necessary reforms. i confident also apply tomorrow’s regulators, continue make change addition future global financial architecture. k c chakrabarty: challenge opportunity trillion dollar economy address dr k c chakrabarty, deputy governor reserve bank india, associate chamber commerce

pleasure privilege national bank conclave theme “challenges opportunity trillion dollar economy”. a aware, indian economy reach trillion u dollar gdp milestone 2007 join country trillion dollar club, namely, us, uk, japan, germany, china, france, italy, spain, canada, brazil russia. in fact, period 1960 late 1980s, india’s gdp u dollar term double every nine years, average. since then, period double decline around 5 years, coincide initiation wide-ranging structural reforms. with india’s gdp current market price 2010–11 already place around u dollar 1.7 trillion, expect indian economy would cross u dollar 3.4 trillion mark 2015–16, i.e., well within span ensue (twelfth) five year plan. therefore, policy maker business leaders, think exploit opportunity prepare challenge manage multi-trillion dollar (and one trillion dollar) economy! although argue india catapult trillion dollar league 2007 account gdp valuation base sharply appreciate exchange rate result huge inflow foreign exchange, others consider emerge sign take-off could accelerate growth momentum go forward. last year, economist morgan stanley long-range forecaster predict india’s growth start outpace china’s within three five year continue fast rate large country next 20 25 years. hence, i believe, others too, indian economy set experience double digit growth come two three decades. while future growth outlook indian economy look promising, challenge make inclusive. at grassroots level, india continue poor le develop country spite year financial support provide government equity enhance distributional programme spectacular turnaround investment growth. accord plan commission report methodology estimation poverty issue 2009, india poverty head count ratio 37.2 per cent 2004–05 compare 45.3 per cent 1993–94. prima facie, slow pace reduction poverty due high population growth rate, large workforce still dependent agriculture illiteracy continue obstruct growth potential, paradigm disability nevertheless turn around win proposition also surely within realm possibility. in fact, many disadvantage indian economy face past already wan turn advantages. to illustrate, disadvantage plague bi central bankers’ speech 1 develop economy include india scarcity capital. this scarcity hind investment growth prospect economy past. this, however, long disadvantage. with country include india open door foreign investment, question long scarcity capital rate return pay capital. hence, capital long constraint era liberalization globalization able pay require return able attract capital flow economy especially form foreign direct investment. further, high population growth another disadvantage face many develop country make effort improve gdp per caput terms. however, emergence skill knowledge new engine economic growth, high population growth opportunity constraint. accord census 2011, 56.9 per cent india’s total population belong age group 15–59 years. importantly, 7.5 per cent population belong age category “60 year above”. this show india yet experience problem aging. further, predict india see sharp decline dependency ratio next thirty years, major demographic dividend india. moreover, estimate india’s demographic trend would remain favourable next three decade also remain good bric economies. we to, however, realise advantage transform high economic growth. in regard, appropriate intervention would require reap maximum benefit favourable demographic dividend invest education skill development. in union budget 2011–12, indian government allocate rs. 52,057

industry world extend fast cost-effective delivery product services, ensure affordability otherwise could not, simultaneously, ensure viability profitability producers. this positive spinoffs. if cost product service bring leverage technology, inflation also would come down. that would lead soft interest rate regime would enable sustainable growth. take cue example western hemisphere, india try become knowledge economy promote inclusive economic growth. the progress agrarian and/or industrial economy knowledge economy base ability acquire ownership knowledge use create improve good services. worker knowledge economy especially distinct far know doing, work do work. they also excel field knowledge often good job superiors. the respect knowledge worker lead desire outcome change management

enrollments, along improvement quality education. this may extremely important harvest fruit investment. in regard, enactment right child free compulsory education act, 2009 operationalisation article 21-a constitution india, expect address issue drop out, school children, quality education availability train teacher short medium term. further, proposal set national commission/council high education research prescribe academic quality advancement knowledge high educational institution consideration government. yet another well know problem mismatch quantity quality education. accord research publish observer research foundation (2010), india record 10.4 per cent increase number graduate engineer 2008 compare 9.9 per cent china, 5.9 per cent south korea, 3.9 per cent uk –1.0 per cent us. however, despite increasingly high number engineer graduate produce technical institute india, almost 30 per cent fresh graduate remain unemployed even one year graduation. in 2005, mckinsey-nasscom study indicate quarter india’s technical graduate 10–15 per cent general college graduate employable quality off-shore it bpo industries. further, nasscom estimate educational system produce nine half-literate graduate graduate passable quality, reflect low quality education. however, despite discount quality education, come number engineer per million people, india 214 south korea high number 1435. while japan 765 engineer per million people, china 340. the research also show doctorate degree le 1 per cent graduate engineer degree country. the percentage doctorate degree compare engineer degree much high countries, e.g., 9 per cent us, 10 per cent uk, 8 per cent germany 3 per cent south korea. compare indian institution well know international center study also

2011. * * * dear minister finances, dear mr. lennkh mr. hodell, dear mr. canacaris, dear lady gentlemen, today’s meet organise raiffeisen bank business community significant. firstly, show well-defined strategy raiffeisen group increase market share albania dialogue business partners. secondly, forum serve also platform generate development idea project national, not, regional importance. thirdly, i think today’s meet indicative maturity rise awareness bank system business community. personally, i would wish meet intensify future: also structured, orient towards constructive debate, involve entire system sector economy. in short, bank business need sit together best. dear lady gentlemen, we mid-2011 now, complex year term challenge objective reason owe international financial dynamic past 3–4 years. whilst economy post positive growth, continue operate potential. the international set fill uncertainty group advance economies, agricultural product raw material price remain high. despite last year’s narrow current deficit, albania’s external position remain constant structural weakness. the albanian bank system consider adapt commendably complex situation. i would like underline do immense amount work far. therefore, i take opportunity congratulate central local manage unit bank operate albania. during period, albanian bank system continue expand activity lend economy. financial soundness profitability indicator improve system’s activity capitalization good position. the bank sector remain main actor financial intermediation albania, whose finance continue rely mainly public deposits. the main problem bank system grow non-performing loan share, also reflect active policy bank albania enhance transparency banks’ balance sheets. credit risk remain primary risk bank sector. in response, bank sector establish adequate reserve fund buff major shock borrower repayment capacity market equilibrium. stress test support conclusion bank system resilience. the presence room business community bank system suggest refer need sincere cooperation mutual benefit. with exceptions, i think cooperation present operational certainly support particular country’s economic activity past years. the global financial crisis erupt late 2008 influence economy stiffen cooperation. on one hand, system find difficult liquidity situation, hand business find difficult access markets. with additional subjective reasons, outcome deterioration system’s loan portfolio companies’ liquidate capacity. consequently, 2009–2010 mark slowdown lend growth economy, reflect increase prudence, fully justify system, bi central bankers’ speech 1 2 bi central bankers’ speech business inability earn meritable new loan. the period coincide review balance portfolio restructuring, possible provisions, directly affect system’s financial performance. the bank albania play major role guardian country’s macroeconomic financial stability. macroprudence prevalent word communication market, authority public. we translate macroprudence need capital liquidity, increase bank system payment capacity. consequently, albanian bank sector experience contracting. the bank albania provide continue provide necessary liquidity bank system, stimulate market also entire economy. prudent policy timely legal regulation guarantee effective bank supervision enable satisfactory businesses’ access bank loans. actually, i would like point albanian bank system leave crisis healthy condition guarantee grow stability. our bank system, period, carry considerable amount work, serve consolidate bank’s position prior, crisis. hence, bank able use full lend potential. for truth’s sake, must underline late figure speak growth order 10 per cent annual terms, figure go unnoticed consider inadequate. i would suggest philosophy business community. for objective reasons, concept free money belong past. by i mean bank loan earned, mean unconditional honest cooperation within legal regulatory framework approve country’s authorities. of course, bank establish lend money, first foremost need bear mind public deposits’ stability important individual business loan bank portfolio. moreover, business community need recalibrate position relation recent development national global economy context. it must aim high productivity, primarily identify comparative advantage framework global changes. in regard, necessary adopt new business administration philosophy capacity build investment human resources, governance, internal control, financial legal expertise, risk management. besides legal relation, bank-client relation human relation, one trust. when business delay payment bank loan instalment, consider judgement bank bank delay payment mature interest business. dear lady gentlemen, on behalf bank albania, i would like invite community present event strengthen communication bridges, benefit also economy general. bi central bankers’ speech 1 svante öberg: economic condition wage formation speech mr svante öberg, first deputy governor sverige riksbank, national mediation office, stockholm, 16 june 2011. * * * the riksbank’s task maintain low stable level inflation. but development wage affect inflation inflation affect development wages. wage formation monetary policy consequently connected, and, consequently, riksbank monitor wage formation great attentiveness. the message speech today summarise two points:  wage formation work well since mid-1990s, assessment continue work well year ahead.  but wage increase slightly le approximately 3.5 per cent per year riksbank estimate april, inflation unemployment could lower, could interest rates. i start take look back wage formation last 40 years. follow this, i address economic condition wage formation year ahead. i base riksbank’s recent forecast sweden’s economy, april. a look back wage formation last 40 year wage formation work well 1970s 1980s follow “record years” 1960s, period weak development sweden’s economy begin mid-1970s. this partly result deterioration external condition wake oil crisis 1973. this give rise international recession. at time, fix exchange rate principle. have leave bretton wood fix exchange rate cooperation 1971, sweden join so-called currency snake 1973. this entail fix exchange rate d-mark particular. the idea wage price would increase line equivalent germany fix exchange rate would act “nominal anchor”. this strategy work. from mid-1970s early 1990s, inflation significantly high germany (see figure 1). wage also increase fast among competitor competitiveness swedish economy weakened. price clause wage agreement mean wage adjust upwards prevail rate inflation, wage clause agreement mean wage adjust upwards consequence other, yet unknown agreements. in way, price/wage spiral developed, expectation high inflation build wage agreements. at time, practice, much leave wage earners’ wallet high wage increases, “eaten up” high rate inflation. from mid-1970s, real wage develop poorly (see figure 2). sweden attempt mitigate impair competitiveness series devaluations. these devaluation mean competitiveness could temporarily strengthened. but long term, strategy unsustainable. expectation increase cost could compensate though devaluation weaken incentive restraint price wage formation. put rather simply, devaluation successful, price wage increase devaluation must return level among competitors. sweden never succeed 1970s 1980s. 2 bi central bankers’ speech the two large devaluation early 1980s follow deregulation credit market mid-1980s. this follow dramatic expansion credit rapidly increase property prices. this lead overheat swedish economy, property bubble eventually burst, and, subsequently, bank crisis early 1990s. follow increasingly persistent speculation new devaluation, fix exchange rate abandon november 1992. wage formation work well since mid-1990s since mid-1990s, condition strong development swedish economy improve significantly, compare 1970s 1980s. in particular, three important change take place. firstly, framework fiscal policy improved. after crisis large public finance deficit start 1990s, new fiscal policy framework established. this consist three parts: expenditure ceiling entail riksbank annually set upper limit nominal government expenditure next three years, surplus target require public finance surplus one per cent gdp economic cycle1 stipulation municipal county council budget may deficits. this framework work well. unlike many countries, sweden able enter recent financial crisis large public finance surplus. secondly, monetary policy regime changed. instead fix exchange rate, float exchange rate inflation target. after fix exchange rate abandon november 1992, riksbank decide january 1993 new “nominal anchor” form inflation target 2 per cent, apply 1995. the new monetary policy regime work significantly good old one fix exchange rate. inflation decrease considerably since 1970s 1980s (see figure 3). in addition, cost low average gdp growth previously. on contrary, since mid-1990s, gdp growth high 1970s 1980s. thirdly, perhaps widely-known, wage formation improve since mid-1990s. the change already start early 1990s. the rehnberg agreement 1991–1992 result significantly low agree wage previously – importantly – remove price wage clause agreements, thus contribute break price wage spiral. the industrial agreement 1997 another important change. the wage bargain round 1995 result relatively high wage increase 5 per cent per year follow two years. this result pressure government time social partner change wage formation negotiation. the industrial agreement exactly kind change. it assume manufacture sector, expose international competition, determine level wage increases. the agreement also mean rule conduct negotiations, example demand specify well ahead expiry agreement conclusion negotiation support mediators, so-called impartial chairman. there also similar, far-reaching, agreement sectors. the national mediation office, set 2000, another important change. a widely known, office’s task mediate labour dispute actively promote efficient wage formation. the active promotion efficient wage formation entails, among tasks, ensure wage formation permit strong growth employment. in 1 the surplus target originally 2 per cent gdp, late change 1 per cent, result eu decision start record premium pension fund save private save rather public saving. bi central bankers’ speech 3 addition, also responsible official wage statistics. i usually view national mediation office third party wage negotiations. the office ensure neutral arena party meet outside formal negotiations. the outcome wage earner also good term high real wage increases. virtually real wage increase take place 1970s 1980s. the wage increase agree upon wage bargain round 2007 high the two recent wage bargain round take place widely-differing circumstances. the wage bargain round 2007 take place crest economic boom, economic prospect also strong follow years, wage bargain round 2010 take place financial crisis deep recession. the wage bargain round 2007 work well economic perspective. the agree wage high. i quite optimistic ahead negotiations. my assessment could carry good order could result wage increase line riksbank’s inflation target. but result wage bargain round surprisingly negative. the centrally-agreed wage increase agreement period 2007 2009 almost 3 per cent per year, almost one percentage point high previous agreement period. inflation increase riksbank successively raise repo rate 3 per cent start 2007 4.75 per cent september 2008. in addition, financial crisis lead economic condition change radically agreement period. during autumn 2008, become obvious financial crisis would also hit swedish economy hard. the riksbank authority make comprehensive effort prevent swedish bank drag crisis. and, alleviate consequence crisis, riksbank rapidly low repo rate 0.25 per cent july 2009. even so, development become clearly bad expected. during 2009, gdp show great fall since second world war, unemployment rise almost 9 per cent end 2009. this reaffirm conclusion wage increase high. on average, wage increase 3.7 per cent year 2007 2009. the wage agree 2010 contribute towards prevent crisis deep sweden in many ways, wage bargain round 2010 direct opposite wage bargain round 2007. development mark financial crisis, result low wage agreement largely line riksbank’s forecasts. the crisis also mean common agreement period become two year instead three years, normal since 1995. the centrally-agreed wage increase calculate average 1.8 per cent per year 2010 2011. however, economic recovery significantly strong 2010 people expected. the growth gdp high 40 years. the labour market also develop expectations. among reasons, decline employment primarily concentrate manufacture sector, le labour-intensive many sectors. furthermore, so-called crisis agreement manufacture sector contribute towards dampen decrease employment. due low agree wage increases, wage bargain round 2010 probably contribute strong development swedish economy experience 2010 start 2011. accord present assessment, average increase hourly wage 2010 2011 2.8 per cent per year, 0.5 percentage point per year estimate wage bargain rounds. 4 bi central bankers’ speech but time, wage bargain round 2010 entail couple problem future developments. one problem date expiry various agreement become spread before. in manufacture sector, white-collar workers’ collective agreement expire september year, agreement blue-collar worker run end january 2012. this risk weaken standard-setting role manufacture industry. the social partner manufacture sector agree coordinate negotiation blue-collar white-collar worker new agreement ready november. this coordination improve prospect agreement within part economy expose international competition become normative future wage bargain rounds. this i believe positive part business sector expose international competition set standard part economy. this part economy clearly affect wage increase rapidly sweden compete successfully world market. this also hold true float exchange rate, inflation target important trade partner largely cannot assume weaken krona would restore competitiveness excessive wage increases. the remain problem agreement expire spring 2012, number month first agreements. this mean normative effect first agreement remain uncertain. among circumstances, depend level coordination negotiation employer employees. another problem teknikföretagen, employers’ organisation engineer industry, revoke industrial agreement last year. the industrial agreement important reason wage formation work well since mid-1990s. the revocation agreement one signatory mean future agreement become uncertain. this sort now, new propose industrial agreement accept party except swedish paper workers’ union. i view new industrial agreement success. it cement principle part business sector expose international competition play normative role wage bargain give impartial chairman strong role coordination within manufacture sector. it thus positive new industrial agreement. but reason remind experience wage bargain round 1995. the coordination demand swedish trade union confederation fail wage bargain rounds. the swedish paper workers’ union employers’ federation swedish forest industry first then, conclude relatively high agreement set level large part labour market. the result wage increase 5 per cent year 1996 1997, level altogether high relation inflation target weak employment situation. the economic condition wage formation year ahead i briefly present riksbank’s assessment economic development recent years. i refer recently publish forecast april. of course, quite lot happen since then, but, time, two month late don’t normally know great deal development two three year ahead. in event, publish update assessment monetary policy report july. the international recovery proceed good rate for world whole, expect see gdp growth 4 per cent per year next three years. this high growth rate historical perspective (see figure 4). but bi central bankers’ speech 5 development across world divided, weak growth take place develop economy strong growth emerge economies. the recovery unite state europe continue fairly moderate pace. in unite states, gdp back level crisis (see figure 5). but labour market yet recover. in euro area, seem likely take couple year gdp return level crisis. growth europe restrain fiscal problem several country tighten fiscal policy (see figure 5). in contrast, emerge economies, gdp growth strong. these country account almost half world’s gdp almost 70 per cent world’s growth year. china expect continue grow almost 10 per cent per year, india 8 per cent year ahead. in two bric countries, brazil russia, growth range 4–5 per cent expect (see table 1). difference around world also extensive term inflation. in unite state euro area, inflation rise recent years, primarily result rise energy commodity prices, underlie inflation exclude price still low. in bric countries, hand, inflation high, monetary policy country tighten avoid overheat (see table 2). however, also risk international developments. the great risk u sweden probably whether fiscal problem certain euro area country lead renew turbulence financial markets. greece, ireland portugal already receive assistance eu international monetary fund (imf), remain unclear whether greece, particular, able repay debts. furthermore, possibility spain may also encounter difficulty manage problem cannot rule out. naturally, outlook also affect political unease north africa middle east repercussion natural disaster japan, contagion effect yet limited. another risk strong growth world push price energy commodity beyond expectations. a significant part rise oil price since february ascribe uncertainty supply oil impact political unease north africa middle east. essentially, however, strong growth asia particular make commodity price increase. this may result high inflation low growth unite states, europe develop economies. the swedish economy remain strong the high rate growth sweden 2010 mean gdp return roughly level prior financial crisis. this year, expect gdp growth 4.6 per cent, while, next two years, expect growth average 2.4 per cent per year (see figure 6). employment increase rapidly. over last year, increase 120 000 jobs. this increase primarily take place service sector construction sector, impact severely crisis. new statistic manufacture sector, employment develop weakly since start crisis, also show employment increase company plan new recruitment. we expect employment continue grow relatively strongly come year (see figure 7). unemployment decrease rapidly. it fall one percentage point last year. our assessment unemployment continue decrease towards 6 per cent 2013 (see figure 8). 6 bi central bankers’ speech cpi inflation presently unusually high. this primarily connect circumstance phase interest rate increased. mortgage rate include cpi increase rate riksbank raise repo rate – or, recently, even slightly faster. we expect cpi inflation remain high year ahead (see figure 9).2 cpif inflation (the cpi fix interest rate) provide good view underlie inflationary pressure show inflation currently low. the effect rise energy price inflation far counteract strengthen krona. however, main reason low rate inflation weak development unit labour costs. productivity increase rapidly time rate increase hourly wage low. unit labour cost expect increase marginally present year, return normal rate increase end forecast period. inflation expectation important follow riksbank, particularly present situation difference cpi inflation various measure underlie inflation great. inflation expectation five year ahead far stable close 2 per cent. this indicate strong confidence riksbank’s ability meet inflation target long term. on hand, inflation expectation one two year ahead increase significantly last 12 months. however, largely consequence increase actual measure rate inflation (see figure 10). a matter concern ahead wage bargain round may wage expectation also largely seem consequence actual measure rate inflation. i shall return shortly. in light economic development, monetary policy aim successively increase repo rate towards normal level extremely low level reach crisis. in april, raise repo rate 0.25 percentage point sixth time row, 1.75 per cent. our assessment need continue raise repo rate order stabilise inflation level close inflation target 2 per cent avoid high level resource utilisation future (see figure 11). however, usual, would like add uncertainty concern future great interest rate path calculate forecast, promise. wage formation probably continue work well year ahead the condition good wage formation continue work well year ahead, since mid-1990s. this also assumption make riksbank’s forecast april. the rapid improvement labour market mean central agreement conclude autumn next year expect reach high level agreement conclude last year. wage increase central agreement (“wage drift”) also expect contribute towards slightly fast wage increases. the riksbank’s assessment overall hourly wage increase 3.5 per cent per year 2012–2013, compatible cpif inflation rate (inflation exclude interest rate changes) close 2 per cent end forecast period.3 but forecast uncertain. this also apply wage forecasts. it normally easy make good forecast development wage inflation. this probably partially because, time, small variation wage growth inflation, partially wage agreement provide important information future 2 see j. johansson, s. palmqvist c. selander, “the cpi increase rapidly cpif next years”, economic commentary no. 5, 2011, sverige riksbank. 3 hourly wage cost estimate increase hourly wage 0.2 per cent per year. for sake simplicity, i choose disregard difference. bi central bankers’ speech 7 wage growth. over last 14 years, riksbank average forecast error 0.4 percentage point spring forecast next year’s wages. however, error significantly large certain years. wage increase year ahead ultimately determine final agreement economic developments. there risk rapid improvement labour market push wage increase fast calculated. this apply agree wage wage agreement. there sign match labour market may deteriorated. labour market shortage increase rapidly, even though unemployment still relatively high (see figure 12). the beveridge curve, show connection unemployment vacancies, also indicate impair matching. on previous occasion vacancy rate current high level, unemployment 6 per cent. however, early draw far-reaching conclusions, normal cyclical phenomenon match become impair recovery recession (see figure 13). another risk i already mention high level cpi inflation may influence inflation wage expectations. even underlie cpif inflation low, cpi increase rapidly result interest rate increases. the forecast cpi inflation close 3 per cent next three years, probably continue high couple years. there thus risk high level cpi inflation push inflation wage expectations. wage expectation closely link inflation expectations, which, turn, largely determine inflation outcome – wage expectation increase recently (see figure 14).4 it important emphasise high level cpi inflation temporary effect. this delay consequence low level repo rate crisis. when first low repo rate sharply, cpi inflation negative least year. over last year, repo rate successively raised, instead contribute towards increase cpi inflation. a good measure inflationary pressure present provide cpif inflation. the wage growth rate influence inflation, unemployment interest rate in riksbank’s recent forecast, estimate hourly wage increase 3.5 per cent per year 2012 2013, correspond underlie cpif inflation close 2 per cent towards end forecast period. at time, unemployment fall 6 per cent end forecast period. the national institute economic research’s recent report wage formation, may year, present calculation impact size wage increase inflation employment. these indicate wage increase would limit 3 per cent per year 2012–2014 unemployment sustainably decrease 5 per cent, accordance government’s ambitions. i assume hear late today. the riksbank make similar calculation also indicate connection wage trends, inflation unemployment. the basic mechanism calculation high wage increase lead increase cost companies. if company wish retain profitability, choose raise price decrease personnel cost reduce employee numbers. the likely scenario combination measure adopted. inflation increase employment decrease. to meet 4 when interpret figure, may useful know prospera’s wage expectation systematically underestimate wage trend around 0.5 percentage points. 8 bi central bankers’ speech inflation target situation, riksbank would raise repo rate rapidly. this would dampen employment. however, result also depend reason high wage increases. if due strong development productivity, cost increase intensify effect inflation unemployment experienced. my assessment still wage increase slightly low approximately 3.5 per cent per year 2012 2013 riksbank estimate april forecast, inflation unemployment, also interest rates, could lower. this would preferable wide perspective welfare. it would also reduce risk increase energy commodity price rise inflation wage expectation push inflation beyond expectations. conclusion the riksbank party collective bargain process. it social partner conclude agreements. but monetary policy aim maintain low stable level inflation. this job make easy wage formation work well. the effective function wage formation since mid-1990s due improvement condition wage formation wage formation itself. the riksbank’s assessment wage formation continue work well year ahead. i therefore look ahead approach wage bargain round confidence. bi central bankers’ speech 9 10 bi central bankers’ speech bi central bankers’ speech 11 12 bi central bankers’ speech

conference “non-financial report risk management financial institution india” jointly organise giz, sidbi, global report initiative (gri), iim bangalore nextgen. i congratulate organiser choose theme importance non-financial report overall assessment company’s performance, risk-return trade steadily gain ground, globally india. conference help create awareness among financial service industry player importance benefit non-financial report (nfr). what sustainability report non-financial reporting? 2. i borrow topic address “non-financial reporting- what, why how- indian perspective” theme one conference sessions. let start reporting? well, broadly speaking, would agree structure way present information one performance. if information financial nature, financial position, profits, cash flow enterprise constitute financial report beneficial wide range user e.g. stakeholders, investors, regulators, etc. this bring u non-financial (nfr) sustainability report (sr) which, aware, practice measuring, disclose accountable internal external stakeholder organisational performance towards goal sustainable inclusive development. there general perception right time industrial revolution, economic development come cost environment bring large scale destruction nature growth process inclusive. due negative externality economic development, practice non-financial report start largely response pressure non-governmental organisation (ngos) civic society, claim many firm lack social environmental responsibility. it epitomise company’s financial health dependent much asset balance sheet movement profit loss account. non-financial report opportunity communicate open transparent way stakeholders. in non-financial reports, firm volunteer overview environmental social impact previous year. the information non-financial report contribute build company’s risk-return profile. why important? 3. to able truly appreciate importance non-financial reporting, step back time recollect parameter evaluation corporate performance change years. during initial phases, business organize sole proprietorship partnership firms, profit dominant indictor 2 bi central bankers’ speech

value create firm society whether value creation go endure nature. while forego true corporate, far bank concerned, since highly leverage institution deal public money public confidence, great responsibility value creation. a result, non-financial report extremely important financial institution bank relevance go increase time come. just financial report concern return risk-return trade-off, similarly, non-financial report also risk one create society. i also want draw fine distinction sustainability csr. while often term use inter-changeably, normally go name csr act philanthropy like donation, set educational facilities, health services, etc. part profit use that. but charity csr; charity sustainability. sustainability mean business undertake sustainable profitable manner, create undue pressure. have say that, sustainability report become relevant important today’s context social environmental concerns, because, globally, come realize goal growth profits, look inclusive growth. and, growth process equitable, cannot sustainable. if inclusive growth permanent agenda item growth process, sustainable. today, many world’s problem attribute lack inclusive growth. i would like participant conference debate inclusive growth agenda bring sustainability reporting. finally, report credible. it must audited. if make credible report systems, would meaningful. i would like forum also debate aspect improve standard non-financial reporting. how sustainable report do – report framework 4. study reveal structure report change substantially years. whereas 1990s, report focus environmental indicator only, today, report tend comprehensive bring together economic social well environmental data, triple line reporting. john elkington coin term “triple bottom line” describe social, environmental financial accounting, sustainable development think-tank, “sustainability”, release first survey benchmarking non-financial reporting. i would venture say that, maybe, coin new phrase “quadruple bottom line” report explicitly include inclusive development. but, report framework keep evolve one wait finality start report. 5. global report initiative (gri) global initiative standardize nfr institution adopt become de-facto standard internationally. gri long-term, multi-stakeholder, international process whose mission develop disseminate globally applicable sustainability report guidelines. these guideline voluntary use organization report economic, social environmental dimension activities, product services. the aim guideline assist report organization stakeholder articulate understand contribution report organisation sustainable development. 6. one widely use framework report sustainability global report initiative’s g3 guidelines. this framework use nearly 7500 report report sustainability worldwide 100 gri report publish bi central bankers’ speech 3 indian company far. these guideline also include sector supplement, specially focus financial service sector. the driver lever behind nfr 7. when analyse factor influence nfr trends, instructive differentiate driver levers. to good understand two concepts, helpful consider metaphor car. a lever mechanism employ induce action indirectly, example, press gas pedal. drivers, hand, direct forces, fuel set engine motion. the strategic management brand reputation seem far significant driver behind nfr institutions. further, another driver behind nfr stakeholder pressure company become transparent accountable environment social behaviour. thus, surprise publicly criticize sectors, particular chemical mining, display strong growth use nfr. pressure competitors, pressure ngos, respond pressure financial industry etc. seem driver behind nfr. 8. the role governments/regulators push nfr could one powerful lever also one controversial aspect international sustainability debates. while private sector oppose active government involvement, many ngo community general public see mandatory report rule way turn nfr mainstream practice. mandatory versus voluntary 9. in part world, nfr remain voluntary practice. so far, france country enact specific legislation require publicly list company produce non-financial report cover economic, social well environmental dimensions. various country mandate detail report specific industry sectors. additionally, stock exchange like south african stock exchange make nfr requirement list companies. a number stakeholder call sustainability report mandatory requirement aim increase corporate accountability, argument company generally report accord or, do, report incomplete rarely material stakeholder interests. 10. critic mandatory approach nfr maintain government regulation need area since: • other market-based driver exist provide sufficient incentive firm report. • push regulatory track lead host diverse national nfr regimes, thereby make international comparison non-financial report difficult (if impossible) add significant regulatory burden company operate across national borders. • the approach would allow continuous update improvement nfr framework since practice nfr still relatively young requirement legislative process effect change would result long delays. • innovation area nfr reduced. innovation likely occur company push high benchmark standard order produce superior report competition. in mandatory framework, completion far le likely. 4 bi central bankers’ speech advantage nfr 11. there multiple advantage report preparers report readers. the advantage report preparers are: • tool increase comparability reduce cost sustainability • brand reputation enhancement • differentiation market place • protection brand erosion due action supplier competitor • foster innovation order make process environment friendly. advantage report reader are: • useful benchmarking tool • corporate governance tool • avenue long-term dialogue report organisation. to sum

ongoing business integrity enhance investor stakeholder confidence. • help acquire national international list gain access otherwise restrict market • help attract finance transparent relationship credit providers, improve management system employee motivation customer satisfaction. bank financial institution nfr 12. bank finance institutions’ immediate environmental social impact relatively low impact deliver activity business rely financial institution – business loan investment portfolio. but paramount role ensure business borrow depend finance understand risk business may pose society follow sustainable agenda. so, despite relatively indirect nature environmental social impacts, bank need examine effect lend investment decisions. all business activity environmental social impact typically result substandard environmental social practices, including: • over-use wastage natural resource • environmental damage cause continue pollute activity • persistent damage cause past pollute practice • damage cause accident mishap • use environmentally sensitive material 13. all impact ramification business. the risk impact create legal, financial, reputational, bank increasingly accountable effect portfolio environment society. the cost incur business operate without regard environmental social issue include: bi central bankers’ speech 5 • pollution clean cost • fine • increase waste handle cost • cost damage asset reduce value • legal claim • regulatory delay • reduce public regard, reduce sale 14. the risk often get transfer financial institution include: • increase loan default • decrease value investment loss collateral due decrease asset value • liability damage arise negligent investment advice • loss reputation stand result association pollute businesses. position india 15. the level sustainability report india infancy still evolving. in india, various driver behind increase dialogue, discussion publication sustainability report – driver somewhat different part world. for example, pressure ngo sector low india compare countries. pressure originate rather increase involvement global business environment. many company issue csr corporate communication actively report social dimension well. one thing clear however, is, cannot sacrifice growth. if society survive, achieve double digit growth next several years. if bring environmental social concern cost growth, acceptable. what would change balance integrate concern keep overall inclusive growth agenda intact. it make sr palatable acceptable context. in indian context, relevant note begin make yes bank become member unite nation environment programme – finance initiative (unep fi), initiative promote integration environmental consideration aspect financial sector’s operation services. while sidbi release report per gri guidelines, indian bank begin consider report non-financial parameters. in international initiative sustainable development, corporate social responsibility non-financial report also, involvement banks, financial institutions, etc. peripheral nascent stage. 16. for institution india’s financial bank sector, one primary driver involvement activity social environmental sphere reputation branding. this fuel fact institution high visibility every business sector industry. moreover, emerge market india, finance project focus clean production, good corporate governance sustainable energy increasingly identify potential business opportunity financial institutions. furthermore, many financial institution also actively publicise philanthropic activity corporate social responsibility banner. all initiative point sector’s move toward financial institution bank brand reputation, make difference community operate well as, new risk management strategy reflect socio-environmental aspect investments. 17. there many reason change mindset. foremost increase globalization business. a indian company expand internationally acquire interest overseas, whilst time, rapid increase foreign investment 6 bi central bankers’ speech indian corporates, demand transparency “global audience” put pressure indian company start report sustainability issues. within india, also change mindset attitude stakeholder issue relate environmental social responsibility. recently, government face public protest pressure refuse entry foreign ship bring india decommissioning, contain large amount asbestos harmful substances. while general public opinion sustainability issue still evolving, company take first step expect intense public scrutiny, highlight need transparent report operations. another significant push factor role government stakeholder. india historically stringent law labour, environment, health safety. over past year government become increasingly proactive address enforcement. intense medium attention scrutiny corporate social responsibility also lead company take cognisance activity engagement stakeholders. report standard 18. while currently officially recognize guideline report standard sustainability report (by account regulatory bodies), increase trend amongst company publish variety information relate theme community, corporate social responsibility, environment, health safety. indian companies, therefore, present diversity content format overall umbrella sustainability reporting. traditionally, many organization public private sector practice sort corporate social responsibility programmes, report common practice. a survey conduct 2003 “partners in change” show 70 per cent participate company csr policy, nevertheless “good work”. however, past years, increase awareness activity csr field many company start report sustainability issues, albeit limit diverse formats. 19. many organization india certify environmental management systems, base iso 14001. consequently, data environmental indicator readily available many company start report issue environmental report also include health safety data. it initial phase company general start develop report format conform gri guidelines. in accordance global trends, indian company also start seek independent assurance sustainability reports. report environmental legislation 20. one fundamental feature india’s ancient philosophy always respect environment. the indian constitution amongst world contain specific provision environmental protection. state policy principle explicitly enunciate national commitment protect improve environment. the national environmental policy framework responsibility ministry environment forests. implementation undertake central pollution control board (cpcb) state pollution control board (spcb) central state level respectively. the department environment central level support spcbs. the environment (protection) act 1986, consider “umbrella act”, formulate protection improvement quality environment prevention, control abatement environmental pollution. the act also “enabling” law, articulate essential legislative policy environmental protection delegate wide power competent authority frame necessary rule regulations. bi central bankers’ speech 7 • in term act, cover organization submit annual “environmental audit report” (in prescribe format) relevant spcb. • report environmental statement include parameter water raw material consumption, pollution generate (along variation prescribe standards), quantity characteristic hazardous solid wastes, impact pollution control measure conservation natural resource cost production, additional investment proposal environmental protection. at stage, statement require audited. the legal requirement preparation submission help ensure data environmental measure collated, categorize analyse business cover legislation. many organization india start audit statement internally view improve environmental performance matter good practice. report company act 21. the company act india govern overall regulation company india include section disclosure report various aspect company operations. section 217 act stipulate board directors’ report (attached every balance-sheet table company annual general meeting) shall contain information conservation energy. the latter expect include: • energy conservation measure taken; • additional investment proposals, any, implement reduction consumption energy; • impact measure take reduction energy consumption consequent impact cost production goods; • total energy consumption energy consumption per unit production respect specify industries. report social matter 22. traditionally, thin line demarcation socially aware entrepreneurship philanthropy. business today become aware business case social responsibility limit act charity require internalization systemic expression. in 1980, tata steel release “report social audit committee” explore whether company fulfil objective contain article association regard social moral responsibility consumers, employees, shareholders, local community society. since then, growth consistent improvement quality report indian companies. discussion reveal sustainability report india often start voluntary initiative amidst limit pressure local ngos/civic society publish sustainability reports. report often produce use internal purposes. 23. the gri work confederation indian industry (cii) good understand indian context report way apply international framework standard domestically. the main challenge sustainability report india following: • lack specific sustainability/csr report legislation guidelines; • company find challenge report conduct business absence clear guidance base local conditions; 8 bi central bankers’ speech • follow early experimentation, effort need focus report standardized. typically, company tend report community initiative page annual report rather provide detail information internal practice issue transparency, risk, social environmental impacts; • synergizing social business interest need top priority. corporate philanthropy need transform realm core business corporate social responsibility. initiative rbi 24. recognise contribution financial institution include bank sustainable development consider crucial role play finance economic developmental activities, rbi draw attention bank role corporate social responsibility, sustainable development non-financial report circular date december 20, 2007. since loan management bank operational domain, bank exhort keep abreast development regard dovetail / modify business strategy light developments. apart this, even internal effort make day-to-day operation cleaner, green efficient help. however, remark earlier, position continue early stage development lot work need direction. 25. one key initiative rbi different regulator area sustainability report financial inclusion. sustainability integral part inclusive growth agenda. we try convey bank must objective financial inclusion. all bank advise prepare board approve financial inclusion plan. a follow bank-led inclusive growth agenda, must demonstrate commitment so. that give sustainability great depth penetration. now, whether make nfr mandatory – make part disclosure – engage attention. but, far direct bank sustainable growth important agenda banks, guideline issued. sustainability reporting-way forward bank financial institution 26. the progress sustainability report india slow, significant sound start made. the institute charter accountant india – account research foundation (icai arf) committee work new set rule csr and, cii develop green rat system indian companies. the pressure adopt sustainability intensify launch sustainable development fund index india crisil, s&p esg index. role society 27. the role society play nudge financial institution adopt nfr catalytic. a society, judge financial institutions’ performance, must appreciate contribution social responsibility. a illustration, best banks’ award given, financial parameter like crar, roa, roe, npa, etc. considered. but bank judge parameter like responsible ethical lending? how meet social responsibility? how fare serve poverty line people? how many customer served? what intermediation cost? what treatment meted small customers? be charge levy small customer exorbitant nature? do policy reduce carbon foot print? when aspect take consideration, society appreciate reward banks, expect reflect corporate performance? be factor take bi central bankers’ speech 9 account, recipient best bank award would, probably, different actual recipient today. 28. bank financial institution would benefit develop sustainability management report framework, covers, limit to, identification material issue risks, conduct stakeholder engagement well environment, health safety social (ehss) audits, map carbon footprint company’s operation develop sustainability reports. conclusion 29. to conclude, i congratulate nextgen gri organise conference provide important platform create awareness sensitise financial institution non-financial reporting. it concept whose time come transform movement. rbi encourage bank adopt great environmental social disclosure apart financial. but much happen front, although, inclusive agenda front, progress yet form part non-financial disclosures. in order make impact, bank need integrate concept inclusive growth risk management process assess performance, csr nfr business strategy. a society start reward judge performance financial institution social, environmental performance inclusive growth agenda, apart economic, financial institution would motivate voluntarily adopt nfr. i wish deliberation success. i hope issue i raise discuss conference action point emerge address further sustainable inclusive growth agenda, would look forward receive it. bi central bankers’ speech 1 jean-claude trichet: the euro area role global economy remark mr jean-claude trichet, president european central bank, upon reception 2011 global economy prize, kiel, 19 june 2011. * * * it privilege receive global prize today. i would like thank jury distinction, honour ecb staff. kiel long tradition openness. it forge close tie rest world, ever since join hanseatic league 1283. seven century later, kiel today part euro area, vast economic continent, globally open link many way rest world. it euro area role global economy i would like share think receive prize today. how characterize salient feature euro area role global economy? and challenge need address context? three key aspect deserve attention view. first, euro area amongst open large economy world. the euro area’s trade relation rest world grow appreciably since 1999, underscore euro area close shop. the euro area’s trade openness increase 9 percentage point first year euro, roughly one-quarter one-third output, notably result rapidly grow trade vibrant economies, new eu member state china. the euro area world’s large trade partner, european union itself, account 14% global export import 2010. economic monetary union foster trade. not inside euro area (+50% increase trade volume first year euro), even european union whole rest world (+80% period). the euro area also open financially, increasingly so. it international asset liability average around 170% gdp 2009, compare roughly 140% gdp u 90% gdp japan. a financial globalisation unfold last decade, euro area’s external asset liability grow tandem, roughly 80 percentage point gdp 1999 2009. the euro area vast continent 331 million citizens. by population size, comparable large economy develop world, namely unite states, population 310 million. in term economic output, euro area second unite states. it account 20% world output 2010, twice share japan (about 10% world output), somewhat le unite state (about one-quarter world output). second, euro stable credible currency. for 12 year now, european central bank –together national central banks– deliver expect deliver: price stability euro area whole medium-term, average annual inflation le 2%, close 2%. since kiel, let add germany average yearly inflation 1.5%, good result 12 year period last 50 years. 2 bi central bankers’ speech we thereby safeguard euro’s purchase power. this achieve despite several headwind european economy: oil price go up; internet bubble burst; violence war rag part world; start mid-2007 cope severe global financial crisis 60 years. take whole, euro area perform soundly also look macroeconomic indicators, compare large develop economies.  adjust difference population growth, per caput gdp growth euro area last decade almost unite states, 1% per year.  the dispersion real gdp growth rate across euro area country comparable equivalent dispersion across u.s. states. for instance, difference fast slowest-growing u.s. state markedly different order magnitude euro area countries.  overall employment euro area increase 14 million first twelve years, compare rise 8 million unite states.  and overall yearly public finance deficit euro area presently half unite state japan. the imf project indeed euro area’s fiscal deficit reach 4.4% gdp year, 10.8% gdp u.s. 10.0% japan. the euro’s international status outcome market forces. but one particular characteristic euro’s international role markedly regional strong economy close geographical institutional link euro area. the euro’s international role also display high degree stability. and available factual evidence suggest remain broadly unchanged since outbreak global financial crisis, particular. for instance, euro account 2010 one-quarter disclose foreign exchange reserve globally (against around 60% u dollar 4% yen). it also account one-quarter stock international debt security roughly 20% foreign exchange turnover. third, euro area balance current account. a such, euro area contribute global imbalances, one main challenge face global economy world community. it worth stress euro area relevant dimension consider vast single currency economic area common exchange rate monetary policy. and there, number clear: euro area current account balance average le 0.1% gdp 2005–2007 global crisis break out, accord imf figures. moreover, euro area current account still project fund broadly balance year next 2015. the picture different part world. a concern partial reduction induce crisis, global imbalance start widen again. this raise challenge international monetary financial cooperation. the euro area significant stake effective global re-balancing, notably sound domestic policy worldwide which, turn, would contribute global external stability. the global economy lot homework address challenges. people goodwill, inspire desire keep global economy “open, market-based, protective” surely need end. credit therefore give initiative global economy prize encourage press ahead direction. bi central bankers’ speech 1 jean-claude trichet: economic diversity side atlantic speech mr jean-claude trichet, president european central bank, u science po foundation annual benefit, new york, 16 june 2011. * * * lady gentlemen, it great pleasure speak tonight. the past year test time economy unite state europe. we face bad financial economic crisis since second world war. still today – side atlantic – deal consequence crisis – economic growth, employment government finances. the crisis also expose unite state europe number asymmetric shock – different part economy wide diversity experience. some country within euro area particular focus market attention moment result sovereign debt issues. some observer wonder diversity deal europe’s economic monetary union (emu), mean monetary policy whether variation economic condition aggravate product labour market rigidities. it often argue economic diversity heterogeneity significantly large europe unite states. we european central bank (ecb) look closely degree diversity two large, continental advance economy either side atlantic. and find comparison quite interesting. because show economic diversity within two currency area similar many ways. the analysis also show that, fact, large number respect two economy similarly diverse. i would like share key insight analysis tonight. i. economic diversity euro area unite state the unite state europe often compared. this quite natural. american european share common cultural legacy. but two economies, i speak economy euro area side, also similar. both similar size, term population term economic output. both closely integrate financial product markets. and single currency. let begin comparison economic indicator particularly close central banker’s heart: inflation. in historical terms, overall inflation low stable unite state euro area since late 1990s. the ecb aim inflation rate below, close to, 2% medium term. since inception euro, ecb achieve objective. annual inflation euro area 1.97% average first 12 years. importantly, standard deviation inflation across member euro area around 1%. and remain broadly stable similar level observe u metropolitan statistical areas. from standpoint price euro area broadly homogenous similar unite states. my second point comparison diverse unite state euro area term economic growth. the result similar inflation. first all, overall growth rate first twelve year euro actually quite similar 2 bi central bankers’ speech euro area us, adjust difference population growth. in euro area us, per caput growth 1% 1999–2010. a concern dispersion within economies, crisis, standard deviation growth rate around 2% euro area unite states. dispersion rise somewhat crisis currency area remain broadly line pre-crisis patterns.1 allow go one step compare source growth dispersion unite state euro area. both currency area include region experience significant boom-and-bust cycle past decade. both also contain region face significant structural challenge long-term nature. let start unite states. here, several state experience increase house price outpace national average wide margin. the steep house price increase probably contribute average growth states, owe strong positive contribution real estate, construction financial services. nevada, arizona, florida california good examples, average growth 1998 2006 exceed states. the sharp fall house price recent year turn boom bust. these state experience harsh recession among u states. at time, u state see long period average growth, particularly former manufacture powerhouse “great lakes” region. structural shift u economy towards service gradually reduce value add manufacture relative gdp. in decade financial crisis, growth rate state high concentration company manufacture industry information communication technology, michigan ohio, low u states. unsurprisingly, gdp growth region remain average crisis. the euro area also contain example two type regions. on one hand, country experience asymmetric boom-and-bust cycles. several euro area country high average growth pre-crisis years. for example, 2006, growth ireland high euro area economies, owe much large increase house prices. on hand, euro area country – portugal example – experience growth euro area average decade precede crisis. this typically consequence structural issue could tackle early determination. just year ago, group country include germany, label completely wrongly “sick man europe”. yet germany example big dividend reform structural adjustment make strategic priority implement sufficient patience. in short, effect crisis different economy euro area follow similar pattern unite states. the country euro area hit hard either large asset-bubble drive imbalance unwind structural problem leave unaddressed crisis. more specifically, ireland greece, particular, remain recession 2010. those country yet implement far reach structural reform also relatively low growth prospect crisis. these relatively low growth rate link 1 the 2010 data u region provisional estimate publish bureau economic analysis 7 june 2011. bi central bankers’ speech 3 deterioration competitiveness, drive persistent loss relative competitiveness, example average increase relative labour costs. again, problem isolate euro area. disregard recent country join euro area, dispersion unit labour cost similar euro area unite states, crisis. it worth note currency area include region persistently average unit labour cost growth. again leave aside recent country join euro area, greece, portugal ireland, particular, lose competitiveness vis-à-vis main trade partner euro area. germany, contrast, able low relative unit labour costs. there similar persistent loss gain competitiveness unite states. some state experience large persistent increase unit labour costs, currently exceed national average much 20%. other state gain competitiveness vis-à-vis national average past decade. in summary, economic heterogeneity euro area unite state broadly similar number measure past 12 years. ii. economic governance euro area but crisis show u reason complacency euro area. persistent loss competitiveness part individual member currency union lead build-up external internal imbalances. when unravel, cost affect economy large. they also spillover effect member currency union. in union, economic governance framework need prevent development individual member state endanger smooth function union. this particularly true currency union – contrast unite state – large federal budget balance severe asymmetric developments. for emu, economic governance framework devise 1990s correctly implement and, case, prove weak crisis. a i speak today, reform debate still progress. allow take minute outline reform require make europe’s institution economic governance commensurate monetary union. a may know, ecb take strong view need speed automaticity sanction mechanism. this particularly true stability growth pact, eu’s framework fiscal governance. but also case broad framework macroeconomic policy surveillance. the experience recent month vividly demonstrate importance timely correction internal external imbalances. but fast automatic sanction alone enough. the enforcement tool also need make effective. the macroeconomic surveillance framework, particular, need provide clear incentive sound policy member state impose financial sanction early stage. this also mean room discretion implementation surveillance framework. at time, requirement fiscal macroeconomic policy ambitious. to ensure none euro area member leave behind, bring national policy line membership currency union. 4 bi central bankers’ speech finally, implementation sound fiscal macroeconomic policy best ensure solidly anchor national level. an effective way achieve implement strong national budgetary framework member euro area. iii. conclusion let conclude. the european union euro area one side atlantic, unite state side share common heritage culture nature advance economies. they similar size. our economy also show remarkable resemblance diversity – among 50 state side atlantic among 17 euro area member side. this true euro area unite state crisis also reaction asymmetric shock crisis. therefore common challenge. that governing, best fashion possible, large similarly diversify economy regard economic feature member country states. this naturally do u federal institutional framework. we european need reform economic governance framework, i briefly outline tonight. here, would well heed word alexander hamilton, found father america’s economic political union. just hamilton call fellow americans, european call leader “learn think (more) continentally”. thank attention. bi central bankers’ speech 1 k c chakrabarty: connect dot address dr k c chakrabarty, deputy governor reserve bank india, 6th cii (confederation indian industry) bank tech summit 2011, mumbai, 28 june 2011. * * * shri n chandrasekaran, ceo & md, tata consultancy service ltd., shri praveen toshniwal, chairman, cii western region, mr robert lattimore, ed, price waterhouse cooper (pwc), shri dev ranjan mukherjee, head-cii gujarat state, distinguish guests, friend media, lady gentlemen. i thankful cii invite address participant 6th bank tech summit 2011. at outset, i would like congratulate cii pwc present report title “changing rule game technology” i hope report would provide insight several challenge technology seek address. technology change cultural business landscape beyond recognition. you would agree world organisation use transformative power technology create business value today, step-function growth tomorrow. and bank sector exception. you would wonder title speech relation banking. i take inspiration one quote steve job address student stanford university i quote: “you can’t connect dot look forward; connect look backwards. so trust…in something – gut, destiny, life whatever. this approach never let down, make difference life.” can inspire work towards “connecting dots” bank “space” create suitable business environment? my speech today divide three main parts. in first part, i would touch upon bank india changed/evolved years, perceive benefit technology usage complex role indian banker. in second part, i would speak driver next generation bank would touch upon analytics, technology (including disruptive ones) current possible trend technology use bank would emerge game changers. in third part, i would cover recent technological initiative reserve bank. part i introduction - genesis indian bank system the early 1980s instrumental introduction mechanisation computerisation indian banks. this period bank well rbi go slow mechanisation, carefully avoid use “computers” avoid resistance employee unions. however, critical period act icebreaker, lead slow steady move towards large scale technology adoption. over year technological innovation bank mean achieve broad reach term consumer bank continue inclusive growth, meet demand household businesses, movement “class” bank “mass” bank quick transmission information inexpensively conveniently. we move long way 2 bi central bankers’ speech age mechanization indian bank present age bank successfully experiment disruptive technologies. perceive benefit technology usage it expect technology adoption would enable bank sector integrate global financial markets, adopt international best practice ensure delivery superior customer service. it also envisage result great productivity, profitability, efficiency; fast service customer satisfaction; convenience flexibility; space cost savings. it presume robust reliable service would deliver customer low cost, well help bank make good decisions. it usage also expect result improve process integration flexibility, decrease operational exception climb management hierarchy, thus, free management time decision making. but happened? have bank able deliver expect deliver adoption technology? the answer question encouraging. often inhibit factor attribute would poor strategic alignment business it strategy, absence appropriate re-engineered business process delivery models, lack project ownership, poor risk management, ineffective resource management miss governance principles. also human resource bank drain do appropriate business process re-engineering implement it projects. further, bank lack possess business it plan leverage technology increase business profits. last least, bank use information mi decision support systems. complex role indian banker - manage financial inclusion crm the role indian banker challenging. at one end spectrum lie demand achieve financial inclusion nearly 50% country’s population yet cover formal system bank end lie task fulfill need exist customer. customer relationship management - complete picture a bank closely integrate technology strategy business strategy certainly hope reap benefit crm would help bank select reach target customer use right channels, understand value customer bank optimize service quality, “sense respond” customers’ need appropriate cross-selling up-selling tactic besides re-selling opportunities. bank realize need understand customer like never before. today’s customer expect – actually demand – treat individual consumer business depositor valuable bank ever before; failure communicate customer right time, right channel, right offer slowly wear away client base. further availability single view customer would also facilitate banks. the early realize accept issues, fast would able face competition counterparts. the need hour, therefore, awake alive need mass ensure benefit technology percolate even weak them. a say go “the strength chain determine weak link”. bi central bankers’ speech 3 strength chain - financial inclusion i sure gather banker need introduction financial inclusion. today, concept integral part every banker’s responsibility focus “inclusive growth”. with increase adoption technology banks, natural stakeholder expect benefit it. but fair fruit enjoy access afford it? this fact focus government – central bank commitment it-enabled financial inclusion. set financial inclusion technology fund well urge bank formulate board approve financial inclusion plan three year march 2013 initiative direction. besides resource strategic planning, next obvious focus area delivery model technology provide value. we need remember work towards bring nearly 400 million citizen formal fold bank sector. it open “no frill” accounts. a today, 75 million “no frill” account open hardly transaction them. bank need work towards provide full range financial service would need low cost, reliable, easy use secure technology backbone link 6 lakh village country next 4/5 years. the first priority get bank adopt core bank solution, include rrbs. next, multi-channel approach use handheld devices, mobiles, cards, micro-atms, branches, kiosk etc. used. however, ensure transaction put front-end device seamlessly integrate banks’ cbs. often multitude operational issue quote reason lag behind financial inclusion targets. till time complete technology integration take place fronts, bind area intermediate brick-and-mortar structure need place. even business correspondent issue arise regard supervision, customer grievance redressal etc. certain account issue regard also addressed. all operational issue many resolve bank begin look financial inclusion business opportunity rather obligation fulfill csr objective. one final observation i move part ii. bank realise business correspondent (bc) model succeed bcs first level contact customer compensate adequately see business opportunity. be happening? to mind answer negative. similarly regard msps (mobile service providers) act bcs report reach u still suggest true spirit co operation yet stabilise still try destabilise other. the entire world look experiment india i would urge get act together. part ii driver next generation bank - game changer the first decade century behind u it, see euphoria growth also despondency bring global financial crisis. we see technology alone cannot panacea evils. there serious responsibility thrust upon us, technology – next generation technology – able help u navigate way forward. some key driver would evolve game changer mention below. 4 bi central bankers’ speech identity management uidai emerge major game changer would transform management identity citizen digital mode. by usage, customer acquisition service dramatically improve. bank would, therefore, need innovate build system around uidai architecture deliver full range financial services. the requirement adhere know your customer (kyc) norm bank may become easy citizen acquire aadhar card. competition interalia, keen competition among bank also it solution provider bcs would necessitate devise unique business strategy demand bank industry develop robust next-generation architecture enable customer-centric it. thus competition would stand game changer. use analytics analytics hold key optimize performance, inform decisions, actionable insight trust information thus emerge game changer. by bring together relevant information organization, bank answer fundamental question as: what happening? why happening? what likely happen future? how plan future? bank use analytics big way business intelligence encompass simple query report mechanism improve decision-making, analytical application use data models, process workflow etc., financial performance strategy management comprise budget & plan scorecard advance analytics include data mining, predictive modelling, “what if” simulation etc. bank may also look carry “sentiment analysis” good understand internal customer data understand perception bank’s brand, product services, identify problem customer experience bank act efficiently effectively. plug weak link - prevention fraud bank hold powerful weapon predict prevent fraud – data hold rich trove information customers, transactions, account broad trend patterns. the effective use analysis data become game changer identify fraud patterns, anomaly common data point reveal association fraudulent account group fraud activity. bank must deploy powerful analytics available, consolidate data various fraud components, make use multilayered detection technology. after all, good business protect important asset bank i.e. customers. big data – big promise big data one recent technology trend catch up. this catch phrase encompass data, tools, platform analytics need turn large repository internal external data trends, statistic actionable information help take decisions. a cost fall new way correlate data devised, big data analytics may become commonplace thus surface game changer. bi central bankers’ speech 5 alternate channel - role social medium social medium blend technology social interaction co-creation value emerge another game changer. it one evolve channel might help bank generate insight customer attitude preferences, use inform market campaign help deliver good customer experiences. for banks, use social medium pro cons. one influencer drive thousand potential customer website. however, influencer spread dissatisfaction, cause erosion brand equity profitability. regardless, embrace social medium may choice bank now; though imperative. fortunately, social medium evolved, technology understand user networks. the myriad benefit come analyze social medium data include product service quality improvements, assess customer sentiment uncover fraud rings. bank tap root social medium mean community, enjoy success way return real value institutions. customer value innovation customer experience long sole domain branch. it exude everything do, customer demand good experience across bank. an emerge field customer experience behavioural research market area value innovation eventual game changer. innovation customer experience long choice necessity importantly competitive weapon. an innovation group network create across bank useful tool generate new ideas. here i recollect quote jeffrey immelt, ceo general electricon subject innovation i quote: “the source profit, reason invest company future ability innovate ability differentiate”. current possible future trend technology before i move part iii speech, i would like talk current trend technologies. it likely cloud compute would still remain medium-low priority. it estimate globally, emergence new technology back office virtualisation, mobile telephony service orient architecture (soa) reduce absolute spend it. you aware mobile telephony pervasive close 700 million subscriber ubiquitous. and therefore, mobile bank potential emerge game changer term costs, convenience, speed reach. business model banks, telecom operator stake holder need converge. all would stand major game changer future. part iii recent initiative take reserve bank area relate technology i would like draw attention recent initiative take reserve bank area relate technology. it vision reserve bank - 2011–17: the reserve bank release it vision document 2011–17. the major recommendation document relate transform rbi knowledge organisation, use it strategic resource, it governance environmental friendly initiative (including green computing). the vision document also set priority 6 bi central bankers’ speech commercial bank move forward core bank solution enhance use it area like mis, regulatory reporting, overall risk management, financial inclusion customer relationship management. it also dwell possible operational risk arise adopt technology bank sector could affect financial stability emphasize need internal controls, risk mitigation systems, fraud detection / prevention business continuity plans. although bank deploy technology transaction processing, analytical process bank still nascent stage. bank may work towards reap benefit technology term cost reduction, improve customer service effective flow information within bank regulator. step already initiate implement recommendation give vision document. automate data flow bank advise submit roadmap indicate return source directly system centralize repository without manual intervention submission reserve bank. it also decide prescribe quarterly monitor format bank advise certify list return internally generate it source system without manual intervention. next generation rtgs (ng-rtgs) the exist rtgs system, even upgrades, position handle increase volume due various limitation regard scalability, flexibility adaptability technological advancements. further, development globally regard feature functionalities. therefore decide replace application high level use late technology redefine business requirements. report work group information security, electronic banking, technology risk management cyber fraud the report examine various issue arise use information technology bank make recommendation nine broad area i.e. it governance, information security, be audit, it operations, it service outsourcing, cyber fraud, business continuity planning, customer awareness programme legal aspects. the objective report serve common minimum standard bank adopt well lay best practice bank safe sound bank environment. the final guideline respective area mention issue bank implementation. keep customer’s perspective mind, bank would need ensure implement solution exploit late available technology build applications/solutions ensure customer’s delight also proliferation bank services; albeit cost provide adequate security. have say this, i would caution bank unless keep simple, run risk lose customer base competitors. it also imperative redundancy alternate service delivery channel available customer. we need give think provide workable system early retain customer within fold bank system. development it also bring along whole set challenge deal with. these include rapid change technology, complexities, high costs, security data privacy issues, new law regulation inadequate train manpower. there need enhance governance it institute robust information security measure bank sector base extant international standard best practices. give instance cyber fraud bank recently, necessary improve control examine bi central bankers’ speech 7 need pro-active fraud risk assessment management process commercial banks. bank must also work towards ensure dissemination it security policy procedure relate parameter amongst operative functionary banks. summary how bank achieve enhance customer profitability? a bank take first step, consolidate streamline customer segment data. with accurate, segmented, easy-to-access data, analysis tool use develop strategy models, determine appropriate sale channels, calculate value measures, set target advance profitability customer segment individual customer. when process run smoothly, bank use business intelligence plan

ibrahimi, first deputy governor bank albania, forum business activity, governor manage board black sea trade development bank, tirana, 20 june 2011. * * * distinguish participants, it great pleasure take floor forum organize black sea trade development bank, time focus promotion development opportunity albania. allow say time hold forum coincide need ensure economy’s revival home, weather direct impact global economic financial crisis. the economy’s revival need become sustainable, promote development sector provide competitive advantage develop specific public policy take public-private investment partnership new level. allow dwell detail contribution financial system bank sector provide support valuable business projects. the development good financial position financial system general bank sector particular prerequisite carry successful financial intermediation activity. in fact, last decade, bank sector experience rapid development. well-known european bank group enter market, bring knowledge best technologies, well enhance competition interbank market. also, bank albanian capital expand network properly utilize advantage good recognition domestic market. a result active business development policies, bank sector experience steady growth deposit credit expansion. it suffice say end-2004, total loan account 7% gdp, today account approximately 40%. about two-thirds loan extend private sector, rest household individuals. in business sector, loan extend important fast-growing sectors, trade, services, transport construction. almost business loan extend private sector, though recently increase loan public sector’s project / investment registered. on hand, expand bank network good use new technology enable pursuit competitive policies, attract high number depositor provide valuable service citizens. deposit continue represent main source bank sector financing, element highlight stability. interest rate loan deposit reflect banks’ target financial indicators, monetary policy home country major currencies, well country risk margin. we deem period, interest rate appropriate sustainable development bank financial intermediation. during last 2–3 years, country’s economy affect global economic financial crisis. the public authority home commit support domestic economic development pursue stimulus fiscal monetary policies. in bank sector, global financial crisis appear mainly contract pace lend economy. throughout period, bank albania aim prevent deepen impact crisis conduct ease monetary policy supply interbank market necessary liquidity. during 2009 2010, bank albania low key interest rate 1.25 percentage points, 5%. also, major part 2009, bank benefit unlimited liquidity, interest rate equal key policy rate. in meantime, impact crisis, special regulatory act initiate 2 bi central bankers’ speech since 2006, bank albania aim limit risk arise bank activity, rapid foreign-currency lending, set high capital requirement expose banks. throughout period, communicate regularly public large, business bank industry, explain action discus challenge pose economic actors. we believe result action take public authority cooperation financial industry, bank sector successfully withstand impact global financial crises, remain sustainable maintain positive indicator financial intermediation. thus, 2010, bank sector credit growth, albeit low pre-crisis period, considerable, around 9%, central south-eastern european countries, negative. the deceleration credit growth, initially drive supply-side factors, mostly phenomenon attribute decline demand loans. a consequence weak expectation activity development, business decrease production capacity utilization, low investment objective demand loan. in spite weather direct impact crisis, important challenge lay ahead bank sector bank albania. first, performance credit quality monitor prudentially, aim timely identify non-performing loans, ass correctly accord possibility repayment pursue proper policies, order recover loan value within appropriate time. second, phase, necessary strengthen banks’ internal audit systems, relate credit risk also provide high standard management. third, bank ass expectation performance activity take measure strengthen capital position advance, case need. the bank albania deem period ahead albanian bank sector economy need determine pursue suitable development policies, include: set realistic development objectives; set competitive price bank product services; increase lend national currency. about overall economy, sustainable development ensured, relate mainly good control trade deficit, support sector actually contribute may contribute increase export country. public authority strengthen commitment develop non-bank financial market, gradually lead reduction economic dependence bank sector condition improve access finance high number private entities. in way, great opportunity would provide financial system finance project agricultural sector, high potential ensure competitive advantage albanian economy. allow conclude emphasize bank albania’s willingness contribute, policy monetary financial stability, maintain good climate sound development financial bank activity, condition great financial support business development country. i think forum make valuable contribution set concrete development policy projects, which, i believe black sea trade development bank offer support expertise. wish success proceed forum, i thank attention! bi central bankers’ speech 1 philip lowe: inflation – recent past future keynote address mr philip lowe, assistant governor (economic) reserve bank australia, banksa “trends” business luncheon, adelaide, 24 june 2011. * * * i would like thank patrick d’arcy, hugo gerard, christie lewis shalini shan assistance prepare talk. good afternoon. i would like thank banksa invitation speak adelaide today. it pleasure here. the topic i would like talk afternoon inflation, tie nicely main theme banksa’s quarterly bulletin release today. first, i talk detail distinct cycle underlie inflation see australia past six year so. after that, i discus lesson might take cycle, well broad lesson learn past two decade inflation target australia. the recent cycle inflation i would like start cycle underlie inflation begin mid 2000s (graph 1). graph 1 across range measures, cycle pronounce since introduction inflation target early 1990s. between 2005 september 2008, underlie inflation rise 2 percentage point around 2½ per cent 4½ per cent. then, since late 2008, underlie inflation steadily decline around 2¼ per cent year march 2011. a rba discuss late statement monetary policy, decline underlie inflation look run course gradual rise expect next couple 2 bi central bankers’ speech years. give this, timely look back review cause recent cycle lesson hold understand inflation process. before worth note cycle headline cpi inflation le obvious (graph 2). this largely reflect quarter-to-quarter volatility price fuel fruit & vegetables. this volatility especially pronounce recent years, partly effect cyclone larry yasi banana prices.1 this volatility also one reason often use various underlie measure assess ongoing inflation pressure economy. graph 2 at general level, fact underlie inflation pick 2005 2008, subsequently declined, hardly surprising. in period immediately prior north atlantic financial crisis, global commodity price rise strongly, unemployment rate australia fall low level three decade considerable pressure capacity economy. the result pick-up inflation. then slowdown occurred, pressure capacity ease global commodity price fell. again, surprisingly, result moderation inflation. what did, however, surprise u somewhat amplitude time cycle inflation. within rba, staff run number standard “workhorse” model base historical relationship help explain forecast inflation.2 while model consistent pick-up, moderation, inflation, difficulty explain amplitude recent cycle. this obvious graph 3 show average fit value four models, along trim mean measure underlie inflation. in mid 2008, example, underlie inflation around ¾ percentage point high explain average models, none model explain 1 there also considerable volatility price financial service due effect financial crisis. 2 for discussion model see norman d a richards (2010), “modelling inflation australia”, reserve bank australia research discussion paper no 2010-03. bi central bankers’ speech 3 underlie inflation reach 4½ per cent. in contrast, period 2005 2007, inflation mostly low explain models. graph 3 the general picture one get analysis underlie inflation australia slow pick suggest historical relationships, eventually pick up, quickly, large amount, suggest relationships. when look closely detail cpi, clear pattern largely account price services. this see graph 4 show inflation rate manufacture good cpi separately non-manufactured items. over past decade, movement price manufacture good reasonably well explain import prices, exchange rate labour costs. in comparison, period, historical relationship le well explain inflation rate non-manufactured items; model over-predicted inflation middle year decade late under-predicted inflation. 4 bi central bankers’ speech graph 4 this overall pattern surprisingly stable inflation year sharp pick-up evident rba’s inflation forecast period. in late 2006 early 2007, outcome underlie inflation surprisingly well contained. at time, others wonder whether something change significantly inflation process. but long that, inflation outcome turn considerably high expected. in fact, difference rba’s 18-month-ahead forecast underlie inflation actual outcome year september 2008 large inflation-targeting period. in try understand experience, three specific issue i would like touch on: evolution unit labour costs; impact housing-related cost cpi; role international factors. unit labour cost in long run, movement unit labour cost – i.e. average labour cost per unit output – important bear rate inflation. over inflation-targeting period, unit labour cost increase average annual rate 2.6 per cent cpi inflation rate average 2.7 per cent.3 the fact two number close one another accident. if profit share remain relatively steady time, average growth unit labour cost need consistent inflation target. of course, short run, link unit labour cost inflation nearly tight. in recent cycle, growth unit labour cost pick 2004 remain high late 2008 (graph 5). this result fast growth average labour cost slow growth productivity. 3 this calculation exclude estimate effect introduction gst price level, well interest charge include cpi prior september 1998. bi central bankers’ speech 5 graph 5 the pick-up labour cost middle year 2000s evident wide range measures. not lift annual wage increase labour market tightened, report many firm upgrade position effort retain attract staff, upgrade position attract high rate pay. some firm also increase bonus benefit pay staff. this increase labour cost coincide period slow growth labour productivity. since 2005, estimate labour productivity growth average le ½ per cent per year, compare average growth 2 per cent 1990s. the reason slowdown fully understood, although may partly result high commodity price allow low quality and/or costly mine developed. in case, productivity growth need pick live standard improve rate become accustom past two decades. this major challenge face private public sectors. look back recent cycle inflation, clear development unit labour cost significant role, contribute increase inflation decline. but provide partial explanation, alone cannot explain inflation pick sharply 2007 stable precede years. one possible explanation pattern threshold capacity utilisation cross cause inflation increase quickly. an alternative explanation short-run dynamic underlie inflation influence factor period. it difficult formally test two explanations, factor appear play significant role. of these, development house cost perhaps important. house cost inflation currently, housing-related cost – include rents, utility cost build new dwell – account around 20 per cent cpi, large share single group. broadly speaking, house component cpi show general pattern underlie inflation, although recent moderation le pronounce (graph 6). 6 bi central bankers’ speech graph 6 a couple factor important explain general pattern. the first large run-up australian house price drive adjustment low inflation end late 2003. when house boom come end, build cost inflation come growth rent subdue years. these outcome help hold overall inflation rate period. but 2007, cycle turned, build cost rise quickly growth rent accelerating. this fast growth rent reflect change balance demand supply rental market, strong population growth coincide relatively slow expansion supply. the second factor utility prices. during middle year 2000s utility price increase average rate 4 per cent, slightly low previous years. then 2007, utility price inflation accelerate sharply. the proximate cause regulatory decision allow double-digit price increases, partly help fund infrastructure investment, particularly distribution electricity. but deep cause low level investment previous years, mean capacity system distribute electricity keep pace growth demand, particularly hot weather.4 while development rent utility help explain particular dynamic inflation recent cycle, also demonstrate economy operate supply constraints, sort price – price labour – start rise quickly. international factor the third issue i would like touch role international factors. look headline inflation rate across country recent years, deal similarity movement (graph 7). many country asia north atlantic experience increase headline inflation rate 2007 2008 many experience 4 for details, see plumb m k davis (2010), “developments utility prices”, rba bulletin, december, pp 9–18. bi central bankers’ speech 7 decline late 2008 2009. this co-movement partly reflect large change global commodity price recent years. when global oil price go up, boost cpi almost countries, go financial crisis, lead cpi inflation fall almost everywhere. movement food price similar global effect. graph 7 in term underlie inflation, also see co-movement across country recent years, although somewhat le headline inflation (graph 8). when underlie inflation australia rising, equivalent measure underlie inflation unite states, exclusion-based measure core inflation asian countries.5 similarly, measure underlie inflation fell almost everywhere aftermath financial crisis, although dispersion recently. these common movement reflect correlation business cycle across countries, well flow-on effect large change global commodity price price wide range final good services. 5 trim mean measure underlie inflation available country asia. 8 bi central bankers’ speech graph 8 movement exchange rate also influence inflation outcome recent years. in particular, trend appreciation australian dollar 2002 help hold price many import manufacture goods. for example, price index household electrical appliance 8 per cent low nine year ago. over period, clothe price fall 10 per cent, price shoe 13 per cent price manchester 24 per cent. these large price declines. around trend appreciation exchange rate have, however, significant swings. in particular, large depreciation currency result financial crisis saw price many manufacture good increase 2009. these increase slow moderation underlie inflation period. more recently, subsequent appreciation currency lead quite large fall price many manufacture goods. overall though, swing exchange rate play relatively minor role explain recent cycle underlie inflation primarily drive domestic factors. some lesson so summarise, important lesson recent experience inflation respond change pressure capacity economy. when demand high relative economy’s capacity produce good services, cost labour raw material tend rise firms’ mark-ups tend increase. conversely, demand low relative economy’s capacity produce good services, pressure ease inflation tend fall. it also clear dynamic recent cycle inflation influence capacity pressure house market development utility prices. they also influence capacity pressure global market commodities. but factor alone fall well short fully explain cycle, upward pressure price 2008 widespread. at time, around three-quarters 90 individual item cpi increase fast average rate previous two decade (graph 9). bi central bankers’ speech 9 similarly, deceleration inflation since september 2008 widespread, price relatively item currently increase fast average rate. graph 9 look experience past six year whole, clear protract period above-average growth unit labour cost eventually lead high inflation compound variety capacity pressure economy. subsequently, slow unit labour cost downturn ease capacity pressure saw inflation moderate significantly. but look beyond recent cycle, past 20 year carry broad important lesson. and economy work good low stable inflation, monetary policy framework matters. in 1970s 1980s saw consequence high inflation rates. inflation erode value people’s hard-earned savings. it make long-term plan difficult. it add uncertainty. it distort investment decisions. and late 1980s show make leverage asset purchase easy path wealth hard work. the end result slow growth great economic volatility. high inflation also mean high interest rates. in 1980s, inflation rate average 8 per cent, mortgage rate average 13 per cent peak 17 per cent. in contrast, since 1993 inflation average little 2½ per cent mortgage rate average 7½ per cent. and volatility inflation interest rate also low inflation target regime. the clear lesson change average inflation rate ultimately lead change average interest rates, include mortgages. today, people take low inflation given, permanent part economic landscape. inflation expectation well anchor possibility rapid increase general price level something people worry about. this be. there enough uncertainty today’s world, without add uncertainty average rate inflation list. for reasons, broad community acceptance main contribution reserve bank make strong sustainable growth australian economy 10 bi central bankers’ speech maintain low stable inflation. in concrete terms, objective keep average rate inflation time somewhere 2 3 per cent. we achieve past two decades, one key build block australia’s strong economic performance. importantly, start flexible inflation target regime focus medium-term outcomes, ultimately matter household businesses. under framework, inflation below, above, 2–3 per cent range. the framework allow u respond one-off event large change world relative price way promote economic stability framework important anchor inflation expectations. look ahead, bank discuss recently, current environment particularly challenge one. in central scenario, look significant boom investment resource sector time overall economy relatively little spare capacity. while condition strong part economy, part find thing difficult either high exchange rate ongoing restraint household spend borrowing. and add complications, global commodity price undergo structural shift hundred million people asia enter global economy. it easy navigate way difficult environment. the new reality global economy improve australia’s medium-term prospects. at time though, cause considerable structural change economy lead difficulty number areas. a australia take advantage new opportunity manage process structural change task rba keep inflation low stable. by this, help promote sustainable growth job well economic financial stability. over past 20 years, low inflation key ingredient australia’s economic success maintain record help u meet challenge lie ahead. thank you. bi central bankers’ speech 1 thomas j jordan: financial stability report – potential risk action introductory remark mr thomas j jordan, vice chairman govern board swiss national bank, half-yearly medium news conference, berne, 16 june 2011. * * * in introductory remark today, i would like present important point recently publish financial stability report, consider potential risk financial stability identify action may needed. general economic financial condition swiss bank sector improve 2010. overall, global economic growth strong expect last year, despite expiry fiscal stimuli. in switzerland, too, economic development robust growth high international comparison. against background, profitability capital situation big bank improve further, remain good bank domestic focus. however, economic environment remain fragile, renewed, sharp deterioration next twelve month cannot rule out. in short term, prevail uncertainty primarily affect two big banks, still expose considerable credit market risk relative loss-absorbing capital. for domestically focus banks, contrast, risk largely medium-term nature, relate potential adverse development swiss real estate mortgage markets. in view risks, swiss bank ensure broad high-quality base loss-absorbing capital. for big banks, particular, crucial sufficient capital base lay soon possible, loss fully absorbed. the snb welcome fact that, 2010, big bank already take important first step regard, would like encourage keep pace capital expansion. the capitalisation domestically focus bank good historical standards. however, combination high interest rate risk exposure strong mortgage lend growth report number banks. in order bank bear risk medium term, important ensure capital base strong enough. i would like take close look situation two big banks, turn attention situation domestically focus banks. situation big bank compare 2009, two swiss big bank saw mark improvement profitability capital situation last year. in 2010, institution report combine net profit around chf 13 billion, oppose roughly chf 4 billion 2009. this positive development drive ubs, whose situation improve course last year. in addition, ubs credit suisse continue increase regulatory capital ratio (ratio tier 1 capital risk-weighted assets), already high international standards. moreover, financial strength rat also improved. accord rat agency assessments, big banks’ intrinsic financial soundness improve significantly last year. however, two aspect bear mind assess big banks’ situation: first, exposure credit market risk relative capital remain considerable. although credit quality abroad improve slightly, still remain historically low levels, particularly u europe. in view this, lower-than-expected economic growth deepen debt crisis europe could potentially lead deterioration creditworthiness individual countries. yet, big banks’ exposure sovereign debt 2 bi central bankers’ speech peripheral euro area country moderate. should debt problem already vulnerable international bank system sovereign become amplified, however, bank could face considerable losses. second, big banks’ economic capital situation le comfortable high regulatory capital ratio basel ii might suggest. a considerable portion institutions’ regulatory capital make capital component prove fully loss-absorbing recent crisis. these include, instance, defer tax assets, realise bank profitable, certain hybrid tier 1 capital instruments, become loss-absorbing event bankruptcy. thus, capital component long recognise basel iii phase 2019. the transition period grant bank give sufficient time meet new requirements. however, view risk exposure prevail uncertainty economic environment, crucial big bank build sufficient base loss-absorbing capital swiftly possible transition period. after adjust fully loss-absorbing components, big banks’ remain capital buff still thin light aforementioned risks. despite improvement, leverage ubs credit suisse still high international standards. take fully loss-absorbing capital account, average capital ratio big bank amount le 2% total assets. against background, big bank already make major stride towards expand loss-absorbing capital base. to end, credit suisse issue contingent convertible bond (cocos), ubs retain earnings. these important first step already significantly strengthen big banks’ loss-absorbing capital base. they also show big bank good position build necessary, additional capital buffer. situation domestically focus bank allow discus situation bank domestic focus. the capitalisation domestically focus bank almost unchanged comparison 2009. the short sharp recession switzerland 2009 noticeable impact last year either. write-down provision historical low. in long-term comparison, profit remain high level overall. likewise, capitalisation domestically focus bank hardly change 2010 remain good relation risk-weighted asset total assets. however, fact capitalisation high overall take account regulatory capital requirement fully capture certain risks. for example, interest rate risk credit risk associate potentially adverse development real estate mortgage market take account, partially account for. yet risk especially pronounce current environment. on one hand, interest rate risk domestically focus bank continue remain historically high level. since maturity mismatch asset liabilities, rise interest rate would result loss banks. the overall high level interest rate risk drive raiffeisen cantonal banks. on hand, credit risk domestically focus bank continue increase. this mortgage lend volume, closely link development real estate market, continue grow. the situation swiss real estate market deteriorate slightly since last year’s financial stability report published. even though vary widely, real estate price index suggest price also rise substantially 2010. there still indication general overvaluation base current price level, yet several indicator suggest overheat already become apparent owner-occupied apartment apartment bi central bankers’ speech 3 build segments. there also considerable regional differences, although sign that, already now, real estate price region long justify fundamentals. should real estate price continue rise current pace move away level justify fundamentals, significant price correction likely medium term. such price correction, together significant rise mortgage loan defaults, would pose threat financial stability. overall, however, uncertainty banks’ risk exposure. give uncertainty sign potentially adverse development real estate mortgage markets, need action many respects. therefore, snb finma already take first step intensify monitor mortgage market. for purpose, begin 2011, snb launch comprehensive quarterly survey banks. in survey, detail information collect key risk indicator loan-to-value ratio affordability criterion grant mortgage loans. the survey results, expect autumn year, contribute good analysis vulnerability swiss bank sector close exist gap data. moreover, detail analysis make extent bank combination high interest rate risk exposure high mortgage lend growth able bear risks. this mainly microprudential task, perform finma. furthermore, revision self-regulation guideline mortgage-backed loan swiss banker association might make substantial contribution prevent development significant imbalance real estate mortgage markets. it might worth consider inclusion quantitative “best practice” standard complement qualitative guidelines. ideally, microprudential supervision self-regulation prevent build-up systemic risk. should growth momentum currently observe mortgage lend real estate price continue, even accelerate, measure would considered. such measure countercyclical, thereby make preventive contribution financial stability. at best, snb’s monetary policy make minor contribution financial stability respect. first, monetary policy’s primary objective ensure price stability. second, monetary policy always affect economy whole. thus, effect cannot direct specific area economy. however, additional macroprudential tools, would much good suit target intervention currently disposal swiss authorities. in recent past, snb1 international monetary fund (imf)2 emphasise need action area. for reason, snb welcome federal department finance’s decision set commission expert draw proposal macroprudential oversight determine associate institutional responsibilities. 1 snb’s comment recommendation make business audit commission national council council states. 2 imf country report no. 11/115 within framework article iv consultation may 2011. jean-pierre danthine: market developments, swiss monetary policy foreign exchange reserve management introductory remark mr jean-pierre danthine, member govern board swiss national bank, half-yearly medium news conference, berne, 16 june 2011. * * * in remarks, i would like examine three topics. first, i comment development international financial markets. then i briefly address situation swiss franc money market implementation monetary policy. finally, i talk management foreign exchange reserves. development international financial market development international bond, share foreign exchange market mix and, before, characterise relatively high volatility. the relatively favourable global economic development fact balance sheet liquidity situation corporation outside financial industry relatively good – case good – shape positive effect. by contrast, balance sheet many government reflect consequence crisis measure increase structural debt problems. thus, recent quarters, financial market present mix picture. sign improvement prevail mood follow setback attributable serious impend challenges. at begin financial crisis, mainly concentrate corporations’ balance sheets. since then, market increasingly shift focus towards risk associate government debt. such fundamental change investor risk assessment influence price affect bonds. they also impact investment category and, therefore, i explain later, financial market general. allow begin address serious developments. the european sovereign debt crisis far over. in comparison last year, worsened. thus credit risk premia euro country large debt burden continue rise; compare previous year’s average value, risk premia approximately doubled. that debt problem euro area worsen apparent bond markets. on foreign exchange market, chf/eur exchange rate, particular, react strongly, attain new all-time high levels. since, time, u dollar still tend lower, chf/usd exchange rate also climb extreme levels. the weak dollar doubt robustness u economy wake diminish fiscal monetary policy stimuli, well worry u public debt. since swiss franc also record historical exchange rate currencies, value, real trade-weighted basis, well long-term level. investor appetite bond consider secure help push capital market yield us, german swiss ten-year government bond level last record december 2010 around 3% (us germany) 1.7% (switzerland). by contrast, risk premia bond particularly burden euro economy – namely greece, ireland portugal – continue rise. overall, risk premia certain european sovereign borrower remain high, latent threat contagion continue exist. in global equity commodity markets, mood recent quarter cautiously positive. in equity markets, gratify corporate result strongly supportive effect. in us, example, around two-thirds important corporation report good result expect market. in commodity markets, healthy economic condition – especially emerge country – assist continuation bi central bankers’ speech 1 upward movement, although here, too, price volatility remain high. however, also factor weigh markets, like political unrest north africa middle east, catastrophe japan and, finally, indication global economic slowdown markets. to summarise, situation international financial market present mix picture, despite fact economic development relatively favourable. this reflect fact burden inherit economic financial crisis continue significant. implementation monetary policy the financial crisis characterise least turbulence money market. while uncertainty international financial market persist, situation swiss franc money market ease last year, relax since begin 2011. the swiss franc money market still position structural liquidity surplus vis-à-vis swiss national bank (snb). consequently, focus liquidity-absorbing open market operations. currently, large proportion surplus swiss franc liquidity absorb snb bill amount around chf 110 billion daily repo auction (reverse repos) around chf 25 billion. the volume absorb increase recent months. consequently, total sight deposit domestic bank have, approximately chf 25 billion, remain almost unchanged. this significantly high level financial crisis. it exceed minimum reserve requirement many time over. a consequence, interest rate swiss franc money market still close zero. despite fact interest rate still low, volume activity secure swiss franc money market remain relatively high level. by contrast, volume trade unsecured swiss franc money market still markedly low pre-crisis level. the management three-month libor is, however, affect this, still guaranteed. the management foreign exchange reserve allow conclude word management foreign exchange reserves. first, let stress increase foreign exchange reserve 2009 2010 direct consequence monetary policy measures. it nothing pursuit investment goals. with interest rate close zero, snb create additional swiss franc liquidity foreign exchange market interventions. this prevent rise value swiss franc lead time would undesirable tighten monetary conditions. the foreign exchange reserve therefore surge around chf 50 billion end 2008 good chf 200 billion end 2010. a direct consequence much large balance sheet increase financial risk associate foreign exchange reserves. these risk materialise last 12 months, lead significant loss snb. they hold potential losses. just increase foreign exchange reserve determine demand monetary policy exceptional circumstance prevail 2009 2010, monetary policy consideration continue dictate action future. this means, particular, sell foreign exchange reserve (and buy swiss francs) option moment. monetary policy also dictate currency risk hedged. in effect, hedge exchange rate risk use derivative would equivalent buy swiss franc foreign exchange forward delivery. the effect hedge market thus comparable direct sale foreign currency. the option snb therefore 2 bi central bankers’ speech bi central bankers’ speech 3 diversify risk efficiently possible view limit exchange rate, credit concentration risk foreign currency investments. the snb already begin diversify investment late 1990s. the snb foreign currency investment considerably diversify many countries, many central bank invest foreign exchange reserve mainly u treasuries, is, public debt title dollars. while snb also hold large majority portfolio form government securities, also currently hold many 10% reserve equity 5% corporate bonds. in order limit credit risk, large majority public debt hold high (aaa) second-highest rat (aa). in effect, current allocation correspond 86% aaa-rated 13% aa-rated public debt holdings. the snb diversification strategy is, however, subject limits. these spring stringent requirement regard security liquidity investments. many investment market narrow, meet snb’s liquidity requirements. the snb’s investment universe – thus scope diversification – therefore limited. the bulk worldwide supply highly rat public debt instrument denominate euro u dollars. it thus due instrument available market large part foreign currency investment euro (55%) u dollar (25%). the remainder investment compose yen (10%), canadian dollar (4%), pound sterling (3%) currency (3%). finally, take general somewhat longer-term view, follow point noted. the snb’s currency reserve make foreign currency investment gold. in risk-averse environment, loss tend occur foreign currency investment profit gold, risk-friendly environment opposite true. consequently, diversification portfolio include gold foreign currency help stabilise earn entire risk cycle. bi central bankers’ speech 1 emsley tromp: towards regulatory framework utility sector curaçao – lesson international experience speech dr emsley tromp, president central bank curaçao sint maarten, occasion follow-up energy symposium theme “a regulatory framework, make good everybody”, willemstad, 18 may 2011. * * * lady gentleman good afternoon, it great deal pleasure i accept invitation address afternoon topic utility regulation. aside fact topic forefront national agenda time now, passion since academic years. indeed, topic doctoral dissertation 1985 was: “the impact regulation electric utility pricing: an econometric test ramsey pricing.” i develop apply econometric model capable estimate extent price deviate marginal cost price electric utility industry. this allow estimate magnitude potential efficiency gain derive move optimal set prices. it subsequently extend examine pattern inefficiency observe different regulatory environments. lady gentlemen, i ask though elaborate model review recent economic development implication topic hand. i however, expand issue utility price give importance price market economy guide allocation resource among alternative us achieve economic efficiency. thus, issue regulation substitute market force critical economic development hence economic growth. lady gentlemen, recent economic development curaçao cannot see isolation. give openness size economy, economic development largely reflection economic development main trade partners. a global economy estimate expand aftermath 2008 great recession, outlook growth region project improve. 2 bi central bankers’ speech while curaçao fare relatively well international financial economic crisis owe debt relief context constitutional arrangements, record contraction 2009. in 2010, economic growth estimate mere 0.2 percent. growth 2010 attribute upturn wholesale & retail trade financial service sector public sector. the expansion public sector due mainly outlay wage & salary good & services. activity wholesale & retail trade sector rose, reflect gain domestic tourist spending. by contrast, decrease manufacturing, construction, transport, storage & communication sector mitigate upturn wholesale & retail trade financial service sectors. the unfavorable development manufacture due mainly drop value add isla refinery due prolong shutdown refinery. also, activity ship repair industry shrank. construction investment activity also 2010, le 2009. meanwhile, curaçao’s real gdp project reach 0.3% 2011. the 2011 growth back domestic demand, owe gain private demand public investment. however, decline net foreign demand moderate somewhat increase domestic spending. inflationary pressure however lead development international oil food prices. it estimate headline inflation remain high historical standard consequence commodity price increase increase demand country china india. to insulate economy effects, important put place program look alternative energy sources. give topic conference, i think propitious underscore subject. lady gentlemen, last two decades, public finance netherlands antilles characterize structural deficit consequent build public debt. various attempt implement structural adjustment program achieve fiscal consolidation derail lead debt-to-gdp ratio 80%. to address imbalance give newly form country good start position, netherlands agree pay 70% outstanding public debt. a consequence, debt-to-gdp ratio reduce 35%. give debt relief, couple budgetary rule norm ensure balance budgets, fiscal situation curaçao characterize sound. the overall balance curaçao budget surplus naf.323.3 million 2010 estimate record surplus naf.3.2 million 2011. bi central bankers’ speech 3 the deficit current account balance payment widen 2010 compare 2009 due mainly decline net export good services. the latter relate increase import combine decline exports. the increase import ascribe high international average oil food prices. meanwhile, export dropped, result among things, decline re-exports freezone company particularly venezuela. also, fee refine operation curaçao drop significantly 2010 temporary shut-down refinery. furthermore, oil storage fee receive abroad contract result decline oil storage activities. in contrast, foreign exchange revenue tourism industry rose. 4 bi central bankers’ speech it note past couple years, deficit current account balance payment increase rapidly. this situation however mask recently implementation debt relief program result increase net current transfer abroad. without debt relief program, situation current account would bad moment. give importance utility sector economic performance curaçao, important price set mechanism adopt government provide necessary incentive structure maximize allocative efficiency. therefore, elaborate regulatory framework, important understand importance signal function price market economy apply complexity natural monopoly. lady gentlemen, major function price market economy guide allocation resource among alternative us achieve economic efficiency. in general, efficient outcome one where, reallocate available resources, one make good term preference without make someone else bad term preferences. under certain conditions, perfectly competitive market throughout economy achieve efficient allocation resources. situation however exist competitive market force likely allocate resource efficiently. for example, product produce technical condition give rise extensive scale economy relative size market, perfect competition result socially optimal allocation resources. the natural outcome competitive market force condition single firm dominate market. that is, competitor naturally attract market incapable survival even incumbent firm resort predatory measures. this condition refer natural monopoly. in sum, extensive scale economy lead market failure. this provide “economic logic” motivate government intervention marketplace and, particular, regulation price utility industry. in addition, freedom entry carry risk excessive duplication facility temporary competition best, firm increase scale low average cost rival ultimately “price market”. the existence one firm, leave unregulated, lead monopoly prices. to avoid “twin evils” wasteful competition market price exceed minimum long-run average cost, public regulation often use instead market competition. a possible flaw economic rationale government regulation notion natural monopoly provide logical basis monopoly prices. even though efficiency consideration dictate one firm exist natural monopoly industry, use form competitive bid force unregulated firm charge competitive price. the co-existence monopoly power monopoly structure possible cost negotiate differentially positive potential rival rival access necessary input market prices. franchise bid public utility services, however, likely encounter problem associate regulation. first, give long run nature asset employ public utilities, long run consideration important franchise bidding. write contract ensure reasonable performance contract life would costly. second, since possible incorporate every single detail explicitly contract, renegotiation time necessary. the necessity contract renegotiation imply franchise bid would come resemble conventional regulation. thus, extensive scale economy relative size market make monopoly natural outcome competitive market force – case market failure due economy scale. because market failure, price system long convey necessary information ensure efficiency. give assumption, unfettered market cannot rely upon produce outcome particular optimality properties. the alternative bi central bankers’ speech 5 government either regulate industry (public regulation) nationalize industry (public monopoly) nothing (laissez-faire). the usual normative prescription government regulation. substitute regulatory agency free market premise part belief regulatory agency can, relatively low cost, determine efficient set prices. hence, optimal price integral part discussion role government regulation. lady gentlemen, critical issue design rate structure establish rate-making criterion lead efficient outcome. if general criterion marginal cost pricing, socially efficient consumption production decision result marginal cost correct measure opportunity cost, is, value society’s forgo alternatives. set price equal marginal cost insure that, margin, value resource use produce give commodity value next-best alternative employment. however, rule follow absolutely events. marginal cost pricing, “a principle follow (only extent that) compatible desirable objective deviation great less magnitude desire conflict objective considered”. a conflict strict application marginal cost price arise technological assumption well-behaved production violate – example, existence economy scale. if economy scale throughout region possible industry outputs, marginal cost price yield negative profits. subsidize loss tax revenue generally help unless tax leaf marginal allocation decision unchanged. even then, subsidy may distort subsidize firm’s behavior lead excessively high cost production. because problem create economy scale, rate must guide set principle broad marginal cost pricing. in general, “guiding principles” design rate structure utility field are: (a) allow utility meet revenue requirement; (b) allocate cost service among customers; (c) provide incentive efficient consumption production. these first two principle discuss next. first, revenue requirement. lady gentlemen, revenue requirement define total number guilder require cover operate expenses, service debt, provide reasonable contribution toward fund expansion. determination revenue requirement usually first step regulatory process set price utilities. a test year first select order examine firm’s exist revenue costs. until recently, test year usually recent year historic account record available. recent inflation, however, force regulator give consumer price signal place great weight current cost. use future test year (that is, cost revenue projections) regulatory process common. once test year selected, firm’s operate expenses, annual depreciation, annual taxes, allow profit evaluated. the revenue requirement determine add items. the second guide principle cost allocation. cost allocation refer distribution cost among consumer classes. utility service produce different customer class use facilities. a result, difficult indentify separate marginal cost customer class large part cost common joint. however, utility produce different customer class variable proportions, separate marginal production cost identify increment total cost joint production process output one customer class increase one unit, hold output customer class fixed. various factor influence customer costs, include voltage differences, distance generation point consumption points, customer-density. recognition factor lead development cost allocation formula approximate actual cost customer class responsible. in addition simple, use cost allocation formula may reflect desire favor certain group term price 6 bi central bankers’ speech pay. cost allocation method broadly classify two groups: (1) peak allocation method (2) energy allocation methods. peak allocation method distribute cost responsibility various customer class basis proportionate share total demand place system. meanwhile, energy allocation method distribute cost various customer class base amount energy use serve class. in contrast peak allocation method, method take load factor consideration therefore benefit low-load factor customer. a see various way methodology price utility services. it easy clear cut sometimes one may want appear. this issue complicate one take consideration various interest group try make rate reflect objective consumer advocate, environmentalist industry lobbyists. lady gentlemen, 1984 public ownership utility company justify argument company natural monopolies. government own utility company possible prevent abuse market power private ownership, economy scale, competition industry would result inefficient duplication assets. in mid 1980s. change occur view. the focus become increase efficiency utility companies. in addition, grow realization considerable part activity carry utility company monopolistic characteristics, certain activity not. the latter could fact provide competitive environment. hence, utility industry part liberalize allow competition. in addition, ownership certain company transfer public private hands. regulation aim facilitate introduction competition “creating level play field”. the privatization uk energy sector 1980s trigger wave privatization attempt countries. although many country opt customize uk’s privatization principle fit specific circumstances, common denominator approach separation transmission distribution electricity production retail sale thereof. bi central bankers’ speech 7 however, liberalization energy market always lead low consumer prices, expected. accord certain studies, price might shift market segments, even increase compare prior liberalization. some study indicate energy price drop liberalization energy market, businesses. private consumers, contrast, end spend relatively energy bill. in california, consumer price rise follow liberalization energy market, number power outage increase substantially. accord energy market experts, liberalization guarantee low consumer prices. if private supplier retain possibility ration production cause shortages, influence price electricity favor anyway. hence, retain certain monopolistic powers, despite liberalization market. these development slow trend towards liberalization recent years, even spur call re-regulation liberalize energy market including: (1) the prevention market abuse case monopoly (2) the establishment regulation structure facilitate competition potentially competitive sectors. furthermore, independent regulatory agency establish execute tasks. a monopoly service provider, aqualectra subject economic regulation body responsibility regulate competition, control price protect consumer water electricity supply industry. in past, department economic affair use advice government tariff water electricity. this task fulfil bureau telecommunication post (bt&p). 8 bi central bankers’ speech lady gentlemen, i would like turn best practice evolve last several years. for effectively regulate water energy infrastructure service form regulation needed. best practice recent year point creation autonomous independent institutions. this possible political commitment facilitate development regulatory decision make power transfer government (minister) independent regulator, source regulatory contract expert panel. the commitment government shape constitutional legislative framework. the aim establish independent regulatory board encourage efficient, low-cost, reliable service provision, ensure financial viability facilitate new investments. furthermore, insulate tariff set political opportunism make decision transparent predictable. one constraint set independent regulatory agency institutional capacity. it often difficult find competent institution staff. in next sheet, i give overview status energy policy select caribbean countries. a number caribbean island already depoliticized decision make process institute regulators. bi central bankers’ speech 9 in barbados – often mirror caribbean island – regulatory body exist since middle last century. from 1955 till 2001 public utility board responsible regulation. on january 2nd, 2001, fair trade commission establish much broad mandate predecessor. it duty include among things: determine principles, rate standard service regulate service providers; monitor general business conduct; investigate possible breach act administers; educate inform business consumer requirement acts; take enforcement action needed. lady gentlemen, choose regulatory framework curaçao’s energy water sector easy task. however, draw upon international best practice experience neighbor caribbean island help u make right decisions. we must keep mind though best practice mean simply apply concept environment. we adapt specific circumstances. thank attention. bi central bankers’ speech 1 kiyohiko g nishimura: population ageing, macroeconomic crisis policy challenge speech mr kiyohiko g nishimura, deputy governor bank japan, 75th anniversary conference keynes’ general theory, university cambridge, cambridge, 20 june 2011. * * * 1. introduction: macroeconomic crisis long-run fundamental i honor thrill participate conference commemorate 75th anniversary publication keynes’ general theory. in particular, academic-turned-central banker, opportunity participate panel policy response macroeconomic crisis, great privilege. the task me, central banker, describe response central bank macroeconomic crisis 2008, especially “unconventional policies”. in addition, i hope add color discussion consequence financial crisis draw japanese experience, suggest long wind road post-crisis period. have set parameter presentation, i would like start presentation express uneasiness smugness i sense among commentator macro theory policy. very often, i hear worldwide asset market bubble result macroeconomic crisis 2008 due financial excess, therefore macroeconomic fundamental changed, either crisis, since. financial excess bubble year accumulate balance sheet leverage heavily, prevalence problem may become drag economic recovery time, eventually time heal wind everything back normal. in words, issue stake maintain financial stability, require economic theory policy supplement theoretical policy toolkits add measure check financial excess build control systemic damage bubble burst. lord keynes, lay foundation macro theory policy three-quarters century ago would certainly challenge view, attend conference. in fact, one year publication general theory, speech whose theme still resonate today, allude issue root uneasiness1. so let stand shoulder explain. there remarkable correlation asset market bubble cause macroeconomic crisis demographical changes. in figure 1.1 1.2, i show japan, unite states, spain ireland example country affect financial crisis2. in countries, formation bubble asset market seem coincide grow inverse dependency ratio, ratio work population non-working (dependent) population. meanwhile, bust asset market seem happen inverse dependency ratio decline noticeably. moreover, also seem exist relation asset market bubble demographical change international level, which, borrow lord keynes, could describe demographic consequence globalization. in past decades, 1 keynes, j. m., “some economic consequence decline population,” eugenics review, vol.19, april 1937, pp.13–17. 2 i present correlation elsewhere time ago (see nishimura, k. g., “this time may truly be different: balance sheet adjustment population ageing,” speech present 2011 aea annual meeting, denver, january 7, 2011). appendix update expand figures, show correlation use newly available data world population prospects. 2 bi central bankers’ speech non-market economy russia china fold global market economy. a consequence, work population “market-economy world,” consist largely so-called industrialize economies, expand dramatically, since aggregate work population china others much large industrialize economies. against background, witness truly global asset market boom, synchronously involve many regions, culminate crisis 2008. real property price across wide area globe surge nearly threefold within decade. the significant point u bubble experience coincide closely turn point demographic trends. such demographic perspective cast serious doubt view little change fundamental character global economy even crisis 2008. it form core argument presentation. the perspective direct u recognize fact midst balance sheet adjustment process worldwide financial bubble burst, time population ageing. this balance sheet adjustment past, take place population young growing. this balance sheet adjustment demography rapidly tilt toward old. with change (though gradual) demography, one long-run macroeconomic fundamentals, pre-crisis post-crisis era, macroeconomic policy challenge also likely change accordingly. in section 2, i consider acute impact demography asset prices. asset residential property company share store value enable transfer purchase power one period next, well productive resource create good services. i concentrate former characteristic assets, namely, role store value. a simple, rather mechanical overlap generation model suggest correlation residential property price inverse dependency ratio, fact find many country suffer financial crisis. when apply market-economy world whole, simple model also suggest globalization scale experience past decade likely produce unprecedented increase asset prices. moreover, example also suggest go-go age asset boom passed, age population imply rate return asset substantially small post-globalization era globalization era. in fact, even small pre-globalization era. in section 3, i begin examine process balance sheet adjustment burst bubble population ageing, juxtapose japan 1990s unite state 2000s. then, i summarize consequence severe, prolong balance sheet adjustment population ageing. i identify multi-faceted challenge central bank may face consequence carry balance sheet adjustment population ageing. there i explain unconventional policy tackle problems, take bank japan’s effort example. in final section, i give think population issue tradition cambridge, especially respect technological innovation. 2. background financial crisis: population age globalization population growth longevity 1955 let first examine change characteristic population dynamics. table 2.1 show population growth estimate select country select years, base recent unite nation population figures. a illustration, i take unite states, unite kingdom, germany, france, italy japan comprise develop area market-economy world. i take china russia represent former communist country become incorporate market-economy world. in table, represent bi central bankers’ speech 3 emerge area market-economy world. table 2.2 depict population longevity countries. these table illustrate three facts. first, look country’s population growth longevity, see simultaneous decline population growth increase longevity. this imply many country face sizable increase working-age population certain point time, population begin age rapidly, exception, least country table. second, compare size emerge population developed, huge impact globalization immediately apparent. in 2005, emerge area twice populous developed. this table illustrate big jump “market-economy world population” emerge incorporate market-economy world. a apparent, china factor drive dynamics. third, however, incorporation emerge area globalization help halt population age market-economy world. population growth emerge area actually expect low develop area. conceptual framework: simple overlapping-generation model pure store value although age population may sizable effect economy, current sophisticate mainstream model particularly suit examine impact brute force demographic factors, globalization ageing, asset price store value.3 to tackle demographic factor squarely, i take extreme simplicity. specifically, i use skeleton form overlap generation model, one type asset intrinsic value, serf pure store value. a familiar overlap generation model introductory economic theory, i assume people live two periods, young old point time. the young produce one unit non-storable consumption goods, sole good world. there one type asset, call pure-store-of-value (psv) assets. they yield nothing thus intrinsic value, store value world. that is, psv asset mean save, transfer purchase power one period next. the quantity psv asset fix constant time. people accumulate psv asset exchange consumption good produce young, trade consumption good old. to make analysis even transparent mechanical, i make extreme assumption young constrain consume save. thus, unlike usual overlap generation models, utility maximization young: young produce consumption goods, trade old get psv assets, save next period. in economy, one market, consumption good produce young trade psv asset possess old. the supply consumption good equal number young people, since one young person produce one unit consumption good and, assumption, consume it. the supply psv asset 3 these sophisticate model (e.g., dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models), popular workhorse macroeconomic analysis, typically assume life-long utility-maximizing representative agent live infinitely (or sophisticate settings, decease probabilistically constant proportion) endow ability form true-model-consistent macro econometric model economy rest world exogenously given. because settings, easy analyze effect unexpected incorporation market-economy world former communist country huge populations, subsequent rapid age market-world population, is, increase old proportion population. 4 bi central bankers’ speech possess old people fix definition. thus, purchase power psv assets, price psv asset term consumption good is: price psv asset = (number young) divide (quantity assets) since quantity psv asset fixed, change number young determine change price psv assets. consequently, psv asset price inflation rate is: psv asset price inflation rate = (ratio young old population) – 1 this model admittedly simplistic: specifically, strip consumption save decision (optimization), capital stock (including human capital), technological progress. more realistic model may bring smooth generational consumption/ rate-of-return path capital stock formation, on4. however, demographic factor explain simple example brute forceful, seem unlikely incorporation inter-temporal optimization adjustment process would completely undermine basic results. close economy: inverse dependency ratio “boom bust” property market let apply model real world. asset residential commercial property, equity even art object essentially “long-term store value,” is, mean transfer purchase power present immediate well distant future. and among long-term store value, residential property usually popular many country various reason include preferential tax treatment. so model reasonable explanatory power, expect movement real residential property prices5 coincide inverse dependency ratio (i.e., ratio working-age (15–60) population rest), correspond ratio young work population old non-working dependent population simple olg model, abstract child-age population. figure 2.1 show real land price japan (national average, purposes) juxtapose inverse dependency ratio 1955 date. this figure shows, firstly, relative abundance young people coincide sharply high property prices. secondly, contrast, relative abundance old people seem lead low property prices. it note decline property price greatly aggravate balance sheet adjustment japanese corporations, explain later. the u case illustrate figure 2.2. in unite state also, increase inverse dependency ratio seem coincide property bubble. after bubble burst 2007, property price seem follow long run movement inverse dependency ratio, although would premature draw conclusion moment. how european experience? figure 2.3 show situation ireland. a sharp ascent property price coincide increase inverse dependency ratio, see free fall. this free fall suggest painful adjustment coming. spain show figure 2.4. again, sharp increase property price coincide increase inverse dependency ratio, price declined. germany, bubble 2008, 4 if young constrain save, face inter-temporal optimization consumption allocation. introductory economic theory tell u case may multiple equilibria. however, thrust follow argument generic likely carry multiple equilibria. 5 more precisely speaking, model imply generation-to-generation real asset price inflation determine inverse dependency ratio. this mean current generation-period real asset price high previous inverse dependency ratio increase previous generation-period. typically, one generation-period consider 25 year longer. thus, order relationship hold within long generation-period, expect positive correlation real property price slow-moving inverse dependency ratio. bi central bankers’ speech 5 show figure 2.5, property price movement depict 1995, data available. in contrast ireland spain, property price germany already begin decline 2010, coincide population age country experience time. recovery property market previous peak seem far away age society. globalization: exuberance stagnation global asset market let consider effect asset price globalization, particular marketization6 former communist country market-economy world. to this, apply simple overlap generation model described, market-economy world one big economy. thus, i ignore productivity difference regions, immigration emigration, uncertainty, particular, exchange rate adjustments. i illustrate possible impact globalization use numerical example table 2.3, base unite nation population estimate table 2.1. to make analysis simple possible, i take 25 year one-generation period postulate overlap generation model describe before. we consider three periods: cold war (period 1, represent 1955), pre-globalization (period 2, 1980), globalization (period 3, 2005). also, simplify analysis add realistic flavor, take population number respective year table 2.1 young population.7 these two assumption lead figure table 2.3. i also assume quantity psv asset fix at, say, 100 million market-economy world. suppose cold war pre-globalization period (periods 1 2), market-economy world consist solely develop area six industrialize economies, show table 2.1. then, period 1, market-economy-world young population develop area, 473 million. the old population cold war period develop area, whole posse 100 million psv assets. the young population trade 473 million unit consumption good 100 million psv asset old population possesses. consequently, price psv asset 4.73 unit consumption good period 1. a similar situation hold true pre-globalization period, price psv asset 5.90 unit consumption goods. consequently, asset price inflation rate pre-globalization period 0.89% per annum. then, consider globalization. the emerge area (that is, russia china) incorporate market-economy world globalization period (period 3). i assume throughout fix exchange rate develop area emerge one. thus, one free worldwide market consumption good trade psv assets. like young develop area, young emerge area produce one unit consumption goods, sell old obtain psv asset retirement. the old exist develop area worldwide consumption good market, since old emerge area psv asset cannot buy consumption good worldwide market. the old emerge area therefore ignore follow analysis. (they assume outside market-economy world.) the young population market-economy world sum develop emerge area, 2.14 billion. the young population region want trade consumption good 2.14 billion unit 100 million psv assets. 6 merriam-webster’s online dictionary define marketization “the act process enter into, participate in, introduce free market economy.” 7 this simplify assumption overstate actual young population, qualitatively affect follow analysis. 6 bi central bankers’ speech consequently, price psv asset 21.4 unit consumption good globalization period (period 3), huge increase 5.90 previous period. the price psv asset nearly four time high globalization period (period 3) pre-globalization period (period 2), lead asset price inflation 5.28% per annum. the number young people market-economy world, save future retirement, increase substantially period globalization. thus, global “savings glut,” lead substantial asset price inflation globally. in example table 2.3, asset price inflation rate accelerate substantially, 0.89% 5.28% annually twenty-five years. what happen boom over? let extend table 2.3 include post-globalization period, table 2.4. here post-globalization period represent 2030, population figure unite nation population estimate give table 2.1. if look period 4, post-globalization period, see market-economy world population grow 0.28% annually 2005 2030. under simplify assumption, young population market-economy world produce 2.29 billion unit consumption goods, 100 million psv assets. this mean price asset 22.9 unit consumption good post-globalization period, mean asset price inflation decelerate quite sharply. the asset price inflation post-globalization period mere 0.28%. in fact, rate low even 0.89% pre-globalization period. sum so far, i suggest brute force compositional change population might background asset market bubble subsequent bust, especially cause global macroeconomic crisis 2008 after. to close section, i would like draw two observation exercise. first, i suggest demographic factor cause crisis, point favorable demographic background (increasing inverse dependency ratio) might fertile grind excessive optimism lead many economic agent take highly leverage position multiply returns. by token, eventual sharp reversal ratio make resolution accumulate financial excess particularly difficult, result prolonged, severe balance-sheet adjustment follow crisis, still way. second, aftermath globalization likely imply substantial slowdown asset price inflation, ultimately rate return assets. moreover, post-globalization-period rate return noticeably low even pre-globalization period, increase population ageing. 3. post-crisis world: multifaceted challenge unconventional policy severe prolong balance sheet adjustment population age let consider post-crisis world. in order determine effect balance sheet adjustment burst bubble, i first clarify leverage bubble periods. in japan, corporate sector, especially small medium-sized firms, first time gain access large bank so-called financial liberalization. the corporate sector’s loan-to-gdp ratio increase 29 percentage point ten year bubble burst 1991. in unite states, household sector leveraged, especially housing. the household sector’s house loans-to-disposable bi central bankers’ speech 7 income ratio jump 39 percentage point ten year bubble burst 2007.8 these sector interest-sensitive thus constitute “transmission gears” ordinary monetary transmission mechanism period bubble burst. that is, leverage sector sensitive policy rate reduction business cycles. however, bubble burst, leverage sector become insensitive policy rate reduction, acute balance sheet adjustments. large legacy shortfall must compensate current profit income, period period, process slow painful. this lead least breakdown ordinary monetary transmission mechanism policy rate change. what long-term consequence severe prolong balance sheet adjustment population ageing? three adverse consequence identified. long-term consequence 1: decline mobility/flexibility first, mobility declines, words, economy become “inflexible”. since de-leveraging firm household pay back debt “moving” current position, often stick “underwater” property. population age strengthen tendency. in case japan, de-leveraging take place corporate sector, thus firm become le mobile industry regions. in unite states, household sector de-leveraging, thus household mobility reduced. figure 3.1 depict decline entrepreneurial mobility japan. this figure show creation destruction enterprise pre-bubble (1981–1986), bubble (1987–1991), post-bubble (1992–1996). it see figure creation new enterprise sharply reduce bubble burst 1991. in contrast, increase rate destruction relatively mild. these two imply “sticky industry structure,” tendency hang past. decline mobility find household sector unite states. figure 3.2 show change householder mobility rate 2005 2009. a sharp decline find across age groups. since change renters, sharp decline suggest house crash reduce householder mobility rates.9 long-term consequence 2: loss non-tangible/human capital the second consequence severe prolong balance sheet adjustment loss non-tangible human capital. de-leveraging firm household suffer long under-utilization under-employment tend lose non-tangible human capital. in japan, observe especially small medium-sized enterprises: loss entrepreneurship, loss human network skilled manufacturing, loss access technological advances. in unite states, long-term unemployed underemployed risk lose human capital. 8 see figure 2.1 2.2 in: nishimura, k. g., “this time may truly be different: balance sheet adjustment population ageing,” speech prepare panel “the future monetary policy” 2011 american economic association annual meeting, denver, january 7, 2011. 9 it debate recently whether negative equity homeowner significantly influence mobility unite states. (see, example, schulhofer-wohl, s., “negative equity doe not reduce homeowners’ mobility,” work paper 682. december 2010, federal reserve bank minneapolis.) however, result base past data yet conclusive, since past, negative equity relatively rare, idiosyncratic phenomenon. new data include period 2008 need answer question. 8 bi central bankers’ speech long-term consequence 3: problem financial intermediation the third consequence severe prolong balance sheet adjustment deterioration financial institutions’ efficient function financial intermediaries. this acutely observe japan several year bubble burst: pile-up non-performing loan seem lead breakdown “market selection mechanism” around 1997. figure 3.3 show result large-scale panel analysis japanese firms, total factor productivity exit survive firm compared. survival fit basic premise natural selection mechanism. thus, market mechanism work well, productivity successful survive firm high fail hence exit firms, least average. in figure, shade area show case productivity fail thus exit firm high survive firms, anomaly. in fact, shade area rather exceptional time. however, look period 1996–97, period financial crisis, see many shade area indicate productive firm exit many industries. this strongly suggest breakdown natural selection mechanism. post-crisis reality so, post-crisis reality look like consequence acute balance sheet adjustment population age take effect? some post-crisis reality see japanese situation 2000s. (1) decline prospect growth investment return first, growth prospect decline. average real gdp growth japan fell 5% 4 % 70 80s, around 1% 90 2000s. this imply expect rate return investment 2000s low, especially small medium-sized firm depend domestic demand. in contrast, money (bank deposits) become relatively attractive store value, give price-stability pledge central bank. ironically, lead apparent breakdown historically-proven quantity-theoretic relationship real activity money stock.10 moreover, policy rate low, long risk-free rates, judge historical standards. conventional monetary policy overnight policy rate effective before, mean economy vulnerable downside shock. the change macroeconomic also microeconomic structural. the demand structure shift homogenous, mass market young, segment heterogeneous market old. thus, continue focus young may entail ever-declining demand overcapacity, could miss opportunity exploit potential demand old. here microeconomic structural failure firm bank accommodate new demand may macroeconomic consequence well. in many discussion past two decades, dramatic decline growth investment prospect often attribute supposedly unique nature japanese economy, whatever may be. however, demographic factor outline previous section indeed shape future, decline prospect growth investment return may global relevance. 10 the quantity-theoretic relationship presuppose non-interest-bearing money dominate positive rate-of-returns asset store value. however, price stable expect risk-adjusted return investment low, clear rate dominance asset money may long hold. bi central bankers’ speech 9 (2) coordination failure financial system second, sign coordination failure. banks’ lend sluggish, partly inadequate function expert relationship bankers. here vicious circle seem working. to begin with, bank lack expertise ass investment new fields, suffer problem non-performing loan under-investment loan officers’ human capital. consequently bank lend. this mean new investment new enterprise cannot get funding, thus new market falter. then, bank miss opportunity accumulate new expertise, bring right back start point vicious circle. another coordination failure find capital markets, form excessive risk aversion. fear unknown unknowns, investor shun invest risky securities. their market become thin vulnerable non-fundamental shocks. this mean become prone turn unknown unknowns, thus original fear self-fulfilling. these two type coordination failure financial market result apparent lack “animal spirits”. (3) piling-up public debt third, see piling-up government debt. this partly result substitution public debt private debt process balance sheet adjustment, partly due substitution public demand private demand period decline growth. accord oecd’s economic outlook, japan’s general government gross financial liability-to-gdp ratio 2010 198%, compare 93% unite states. however, also note that, low long-term rates, government net debt interest payments-to-gdp 1.2% japan, compare 1.7% unite states. three challenge unconventional policy let examine challenge central bank face post-crisis world. the first challenge “cycle stabilization”: ensure return sustainable growth price stability, policy rate near zero longer-term risk-free rate also low compare historical average. the second challenge enhance growth trend, strengthen foundation growth. in words, challenge raise long-term growth prospects, especially domestically-oriented growth. this do solve coordination failure bank capital market describe above. the third challenge avoid cause problem national debt management. we design execute carefully measure cope first second challenge, take appropriate account current national debt situation explain before, well general economic conditions. to tackle first second challenges, many central bank introduce unconventional policies, differ region region depend particular problem face. here example, i explain bank japan’s recent attempt unconventional policies, namely, comprehensive monetary ease (cme) october 2010, growth foundation strengthen facility (gfsf) june year. to meet challenge cycle stabilization, first part cme change guidance policy rate 0.1% range 0 0.1%, make clear bank’s virtually zero-interest rate policy (vzirp). for second part cme, bank clarify policy duration commitment: bank continue vzirp judge price stability sight basis policy board members’ understand price stability. with policy board members’ announce forecast two year ahead, similar “forecast targeting” though specific numbers. 10 bi central bankers’ speech the third part cme asset purchase program, also design meet cycle stabilization challenge. the first half asset purchase program aim influence downward longer-term risk-free rates. that is, outright purchase jgbs remain maturity 1–2 year t-bill reduce term-premiums risk-free rates. the scheme provide 3- 6-month fund overnight rate already institute aim low rate long overnight rate, continue include program. these unconventional, consider natural extension conventional monetary policy policy rate changes. however, second half asset purchase program truly unconventional, bank purchase risky asset buy before: bbb-rated corporate bonds, a-2 cps. it also purchase etf j-reits directly market. the purchase design act catalyst induce investment risky assets, thus help solve coordination failure i describe earlier. in words, aim break another vicious circle capital markets, cause excessive risk aversion. when grave anxiety future economy, so-called knightian uncertainty, tendency aversion risky asset stock real estate become “excessive” demand asset declines, result risk premium asset remain high.11 this excessive “flight quality” may greatly impede economic activity.12 meanwhile, possibility knightian uncertainty increases, demand concentrate asset whose risk consider simple small, thereby low risk premium assets. this know “flight simplicity,” different flight quality. whatever name has, excessive flight simplicity also distort market. in cases, possibility central bank’s purchase risky asset lead play role “catalyst” alleviate tendency excessive flight quality simplicity. to tackle second, “trend-enhancement” challenge, strengthen growth potential, bank japan institute growth foundation strengthen facility (gfsf) form preferential fund-provisioning support financial institutions’ initiative lend invest new growth areas. it make clear bank japan participate financial institution determine investment project fund use gfsf. thus, gfsf design catalyst induce bank find new firm new investment project perceive growth areas. in way, gfsf target solve coordination failure financial system mention earlier, break vicious circle lend result new market thus demand lend start with. recently bank japan expand gfsf include new function promote effective lend methods. bank japan play central role financial intermediation, small company particular rely bank funding. in high growth era, japanese bank respond strong demand funds, use “expert eye” monitor closely business performance company examine ability meet repayment obligations. however, hard process dispose 11 here, order facilitate understanding, i intentionally informally use term “excessive” risk aversion represent “(knightian) uncertainty aversion” “ambiguity aversion” conventional risk aversion. for survey literature knightian uncertainty/ambiguity, see gilboa, i., m. marinacci, “ambiguity bayesian paradigm”, mimeo., april 12, 2011. 12 for reference, please see (1) nishimura, k.g., h. ozaki, “search knightian uncertainty”, journal economic theory, 119 (2004), 299–333.and (2) nishimura, k.g., h. ozaki, “irreversible investment knightian uncertainty,” journal economic theory, 136 (2007), 668–694. bi central bankers’ speech 11 non-performing loan 1990s, bank begin rely heavily credit protection measure form real estate collateral personal guarantees. unfortunately, increase reliance real estate collateral personal guarantee weaken banks’ ability monitor client firms. the value real estate personal asset pledge bank collateral bear direct relation change client firm’s business cash flow. thus, risk financial institution may overlook change cash flow borrower’s core business suddenly face business failure. moreover, great emphasis protection real estate personal asset collateral make loan officer focus loan company long business history abundant assets, rather provide fund new company new business areas. take problem consideration, bank japan decide use gfsf facility promote lend method rely real estate collateral personal guarantees. when implement measure cope cycle stability trend-enhancing challenges, important take appropriate account third challenge, avoid cause problem national debt management. specifically, crucial avoid create impression “monetization” government debt. otherwise, large scale purchase jgbs may lead substantial last ratchet long-term rates, would pose serious problem economic recovery financial position government. take point consideration, bank japan already purchase 22 trillion yen jgbs annually, beside asset purchase program. by token, careful possibility asset purchase may lead capital losses, could tarnish credibility central bank. 4. conclude remarks: keynes, population age innovation let return i start presentation. a i mention introduction, keynes who, eugenics review speech, place population center stage macroeconomic policy framework general theory. while malthusian tradition, grow population inadequate food production fee major issue, keynes concern decline population inadequate capital investment full employment. life expectancy particularly long time keynes malthus, population age issue all. moreover, rapid technological innovation least partially solve problem face time. the problem face stem population change, different twist. here composition population changed, induce large swing asset price store value. with background, witness asset price bubble collapse spectacularly countries, leave u severe balance-sheet problem diminish expectation investment returns. one may ask question: can problem also solve technological innovation, keynes malthus? if so, need particularly worry present stagnation. i answer, i would like make three remark possibility present technological innovation. first, age society might impose unique challenge technological innovation. when population grow rapidly, past, demand young always dominate old. thus, successful technological progress tendency youth-oriented quantity-oriented. in contrast, population age rapidly, demand old dominate market. the characteristic technology demand old may differ substantially demand young, current youth-oriented technological progress may prove value create before. 12 bi central bankers’ speech second, age world imply substantial fall asset returns, would induce curtailment new investment, lead worsen economic conditions. to prevent investment shrink further, might need new source investment, base high private returns. it note many socially desirable project carry low private rate return, urban renewal projects, might crowd age high private returns. to counter possible shortfall private investment, might oblige adopt form public-private partnership mobilize innovation-based projects.13 third, age world, financial need old population often different risk return profile exist assets. we would need financial innovation, one form technological innovation. specifically, securitization might helpful tailor financial product particular need old population. however, recent experience securitized product market show need care design securitization, ensure necessary regulation adequate oversight prospective practitioner schemes. now time stop here. thank kind attention. 13 some year ago, i propose scheme elsewhere purpose call socially-oriented investment trusts. see: nishimura, k. g., m. saito, “on alternative aggregate demand policy revitalize

bi central bankers’ speech 1 glenford ysaguirre: from global financial crisis robust regulatory framework resilient financial system feature address mr glenford ysaguirre, governor central bank belize, caribbean group bank supervisor xxix annual conference, san pedro town, 16 june 2011. * * * a pleasant good morning mr. cleviston haynes – cgbs chair; representative association supervisor bank america (asba), office supervisor currency (occ), u department treasury, federal deposit insurance corporation (fdic); member cgbs; participant this, twenty-ninth annual cgbs conference. lady gentlemen, let join staff welcome belize the, warm, friendly scenic location san pedro, ambergris caye. it indeed pleasure opportunity address gather today. i understand heavy agenda intent brief stray script often wont. a lead entity charge supervision financial sector, carry enormous responsibility one ought take lightly. today, i see work cgbs one shin example regional institution seem afflict that, oh common familiar malady i call caricom malaise. this common condition meet lot, talk lot, agree lot, debate lot, resolve damn lot. let give example: take attempt get member adopt single draft model bank act across region. while unanimously agree almost six year ago, languish suspension formal acceptance jurisdiction yet forthcoming explanation protraction. but, purpose today dwell negative, rather plant idea whose time i think come. i hope pique interest sufficiently forgive departure normal feature address format. the theme today’s conference fit timely: “from global financial crisis robust regulatory framework resilient financial systems” i like theme forward look perfect consonance idea i propose. this theme say must engross business analyze past l forget look ahead toward unchartered water must yet traverse. i think three one half year meet conference fatigue overload hind-sight wisdom offer perfect explanation 2008 global financial crisis none saw coming. the irony u saw come 2008 crisis busy analyze crisis one. now, fact caribbean go relatively unscathed global financial crisis, except clico baico experiences, mean indication good prepared; view mere lucky happenstance need address future. i sure caricom head government june 2009 meet georgetown, guyana near miss catastrophe squarely rearview mirror agree urgency put place strong framework regional financial stability. citing, among things, clico baico experiences, task committee central bank governor prepare proposal creation regional architecture financial stability final consideration council finance plan (cofap). the mandate accelerate construction robust regional financial stability framework. 2 bi central bankers’ speech the committee central bank governor set task diligently. first, secure fund inter-american development bank regional financial risk assessment project aegis caribbean centre money finance (the ccmf). then, three-day workshop regional regulatory stakeholder hold port spain, trinidad 3 5 march 2011 discus requirement action need develop framework agree outline term reference plan implementation financial architecture support regional financial stability. from accounts, workshop well attend yield several recommendation governance operational structure regional financial stability board. however, progress project recently stall governor remain fundamentally odds major recommendations, particular: • the recommendation ccmf become central report body financial stability; • the legality regional regulator share sensitive confidential information non-regulatory body outside members’ jurisdictions; • the methodology approach regional financial risk assessment project. on matter ccmf serve central report facility, question appropriateness, ability capacity manage task: • doe necessary financial human resources? • do require expertise, bear mind research institution? • how issue legality confidentiality resolved? from recent discussion exchange governor 27 may 2011 governors’ caucus hold bridgetown, barbados appear anywhere near resolve issue sub-committee governor appoint specifically look issues, among others. so, i task supervision department make feature address, issue governor still hotly debate i become fearful important project may also fall victim dread caricom malaise. it dawn cgbs ccmf may salvation ideal rescue vehicle project. in 1983, caricom central bank governor envisage need entity spearhead enhancement regional bank supervision practice line internationally accept standards. hence, birth cgbs, institution charge chart way forward supervisor maintain above-board practice equilibrium regulate financial sector across caricom region. since cgbs grow accomplish much, i mention earlier, one caricom institution actually produce real work true spirit mean regional integration. it obvious choice central report facility home financial stability project; financial stability review fall naturally within bailiwick. what i say time come legally establish cgbs caricom’s supranational financial regulatory authority. such structure cgbs would eliminate concern governor appropriateness ccmf role particular concern legality regional information sharing. presently, conduct cgbs member towards guide protocol base mutual respect trust. there members’ handbook recently sign memorandum understand regional cooperation though none legally binding. in absence proper legal authority, real enforcement disciplinary mechanism bi central bankers’ speech 3 must rely solely peer pressure moral suasion compliance rule engagement. while structure may adequate prosperous discipline times, indication already severely test today’s crisis prone environment. the time thus come cgbs take even substantive role. it must give authoritative muscle order fulfill mandate establish regional conformity international principle best practices. the truth u already recognize need recently request cgbs establish form mechanism resolve conflict dispute may arise members. accordingly, i would like propose cgbs consider, among things: 1. establish formal legal entity bylaws, memorandum article association member must legally financially subscribe. this would provide substantial finance since almost every jurisdiction caribbean member cgbs. 2. establish permanent secretariat dedicate staff. this accomplish u either agree merge subsume financially embattle ccmf. this move would reduce need regional central bank finance two separate institution provide cgbs permanent staff capable handle macro-prudential requirement financial stability review. currently, caricom member participate cgbs whereas dwindle handful subscribe ccmf. 3. establish condition entry exit country member body. this would promote discipline behavior throughout region facilitate orderly progress adopt international best practices. 4. establish mechanism impose sanction member non-compliance agree standards. 5. establish implementation plan basel ii across region establishment financial stability board members, 6. establish council deliberate dispute members. while venture would require much acuity, uncharted water must traverse. i confident doable; natural progression cgbs idea whose time come. have make pitch, lady gentlemen, i must respectfully take leave allow get business day. but i go i would welcome think feedback propose new role cgbs i intend present suggestion committee governor consideration. lastly, please allow thank time patience wish productive successful conference. enjoy

philadelphia, society business economist annual conference, london, england, 9 june 2011. * * * the view express today necessarily federal reserve system fomc. introduction good morning. thank opportunity speak society. a business economists, well aware extraordinary economic time live. a financial crisis arguably bad global recession post-war era challenge policymakers u.s. abroad. in many nations, monetary fiscal authority undertake extraordinary action mitigate damage, hard hit countries, recession trough pass moderate recovery underway. yet action take leave legacy huge government budget deficits, short-term interest rate record lows, central bank balance sheet unprecedented magnitudes. even economy recover, policymakers face daunt challenge try unwind extraordinary action rebuild confidence credibility monetary policy frameworks. today i would like discus outlook u.s. economy think way begin normalization u.s. monetary policy. i believe several step federal reserve take ensure successful exit period extraordinary accommodation, include take page bank england’s book announce explicit numerical goal inflation. a always, remark reflect view necessarily represent view federal reserve board colleague federal open market committee. economic outlook let begin update u.s. economy. we nearly two year moderate, sustain recovery financial crisis bad economic downturn since great depression. in fourth quarter last year, level real gdp finally pass pre-recession peak, 7½ million few workers, reflection strong productivity growth. this year’s first-quarter gdp growth, 2 percent, somewhat disappointing. but i believe weakness likely prove temporary soft patch underlie fundamental remain place economy resume grow moderate pace second half year, strengthen bite next year. such soft patch uncommon. indeed, last year experience bump road. yet, i describe summer doldrums, economy pick momentum give u 3 percent growth full year. i think slow growth early part year similarly influence number temporary factors. in particular, severe weather, uncertainty surround aftermath disaster japan, political event middle east north africa, high food energy prices, weigh growth. oil commodity price increase supply chain disruption devastation japan may carryover second quarter, i believe loss momentum likely transitory. bi central bankers’ speech 1 of course, drama play congress debt spend provide yet another source uncertainty economy. progress arena would undoubtedly improve confidence go forward reduce uncertainty. monetary policy cannot view substitute sound fiscal policies. a i argue many time past, monetary policy silver bullet many would like think is. it cannot solve economic ills, attempt quite dangerous economic stability.1 i anticipate moderate above-trend growth around 3 3½ percent remainder year next. the overall strength sector offset persistent weakness others, recovery sustain broad-based continues. improvement household balance sheet good labor market condition support moderate growth consumer spending. solid growth corporate earn support continue healthy advance business spend equipment software. housing, however, likely remain weak spot u.s. economy, flat slightly fall price little new construction. outside recent supply disruption auto industry, i anticipate growth manufacture remain source optimism. the philadelphia fed’s business outlook survey manufacturer prove year useful barometer national trend manufacturing. in april may, measure current activity saw pull-back high number february march, number show activity manufacture sector continue expand. moreover, survey’s indicator future activity, measure firms’ expectation activity six month now, also signal continue expansion. consumer spending, make 70 percent gdp u.s., also increasing. like gdp, real consumption surpass previous peak appear grow moderate pace. household continue pay debt rebuild net worth destroy recession. high energy food price drag recent consumer spending. but important gas price health economy strength consumer spend job growth. so let turn labor markets. labor market overall, condition labor market continue gradually improve. but path smooth one robust one might like. in may, nonfarm payroll expand 54,000 jobs, grow 232,000 job april 194,000 march. the u.s. economy add 780,000 job since first year. the private sector manage increase payroll 900,000, government employment shrinking, thus drag net hire 800,000. may’s uptick unemployment rate 9.1 percent bite disappointing, even that, unemployment rate fall 0.7 percent since last november. despite modest improvement labor market conditions, million american remain unemployed. so long way go. but economy strengthen year, i expect business continue add payrolls. with continue growth employment, i expect see modest decline unemployment rate, 8½ percent end year, range 7 7½ percent end 2012. 1 see charles plosser, “the scope responsibility monetary policy,” federal reserve bank philadelphia annual report 2010. 2 bi central bankers’ speech inflation inflation rise recent month price energy commodity surged. these price extremely volatile late, despite recent retrenchment, remain considerably level six month ago, feed embark plan purchase $600 billion long-term u.s. treasuries. while headline inflation rise markedly, le increase so-called core measure inflation, exclude food energy prices, even noticeably period. there sign firm become good able pas along increase cost customers. for example, response special question business outlook survey february, 56 percent manufacturer say already put price increases. nearly 60 percent respondent say plan increase price next three months. our survey’s price pay index, indicator firms’ input costs, high level past six months. and price receive index, indicator price firm charge customers, turn positive last fall continue suggest firm likely test price power. in may survey, 20 percent report high price goods, 3 percent report price reductions. a commodity price stabilize, headline inflation come back down. however, i see inflation risk u.s. clearly upside. in environment accommodative monetary policy, key keep commodity price increase pass good service create general inflation ensure longer-run inflation expectation stay anchored. so far, seem mostly case. but, course, expectation well-anchored not. so somewhat trouble expectation inflation medium long term move much are. it suggest public market may much confidence fed’s ability, willingness, deliver price stability mandate. when think oil price inflation, must keep mind inflation monetary phenomenon. in look back great inflation 1970s, learn high oil price per se, easy monetary policy response high oil price cause rise general inflation. accommodative monetary policy allow large increase oil price pass along form general increase prices. a happened, people firm begin expect high inflation – lose confidence central bank would keep inflation check – expectation influence decisions, make much hard reverse rise tide inflation. thus, key lesson 1970s credibility central bank’s commitment maintain price stability must preserved. once credibility lost, difficult regain, economic outcome bad result. my colleague i fomc commit ensure happen again. yet must will talk commitment. we must will act – is, undertake necessary difficult policy ensure medium- longer-run inflation expectation remain stable credibility remain intact. this include take right action right time exit extreme accommodative policy place. normalization monetary policy during last three years, federal reserve, like many central bank around world, take extraordinary action mitigate impact financial crisis support return economic growth. our traditional instrument monetary policy, federal fund rate, near zero two half years. the fed’s balance sheet grow threefold, nearly $900 billion crisis $2.7 trillion today, asset composition shift significantly mostly short- bi central bankers’ speech 3 medium-term treasury longer-term treasuries, mortgage-backed security (mbs), agency debt. a economy recovers, must normalize monetary policy framework. some people question whether federal reserve tool exit extraordinary positions. we do. but question feed central banker it, right time right pace. how central bank manage exit extraordinary policy key preserve credibility public’s confidence institutions. our success cop challenge least difficult perhaps important future economic well-being action crisis. of course, exact way policy normalize vary central bank central bank. i focus discussion u.s. element i believe critical fed. yet principle guide think matter important apply broadly range policy discussions. i want stress three key element normalization effort. the first clearly define mean normalization policy framework. the second develop systematic credible plan policy conduct achieve normalization. the third effectively communicate market public intend policy framework plan get there. i believe, part communications, federal reserve would well adopt explicit numerical inflation goal, bank england many central bank do. this type clarity reduce uncertainty limit discretion may lead great instability. let discus three element exit. for u.s., i believe normalization return framework federal fund rate fomc’s primary policy instrument fed’s balance sheet compose predominantly short- medium-term treasury securities, crisis. this mean feed need sell asset balance sheet shrink volume excess reserve level allow federal fund rate trade interest rate feed pay excess reserve fed’s primary credit rate, lend rate feed charge discount window loans. this framework generally refer corridor system fairly common among central bank around world, include bank england ecb. a i mentioned, fed’s balance sheet currently three time large crisis compose longer-term treasury longer-term mortgage-backed security house agency debt. normalization require return composition fed’s portfolio predominantly treasury significantly short duration. in view, central bank business allocate credit specific sector economy, housing. that credit allocation rest market fiscal authority choose intervene, central bank. by mingle monetary fiscal policies, federal reserve put risk independence monetary policy therefore desirable economic outcome capable delivering. we make clear public normalization monetary policy mean return federal fund rate primary policy instrument mean much small balance sheet, dominate treasury securities. policymakers also develop articulate coherent credible plan normalization. in late march, i propose systematic, rule-based approach would involve fed’s sell asset portfolio increase policy rate, pace sale dependent state economy. the plan would get u back normal operate environment timely manner, fed’s balance sheet reduce size would allow federal fund rate primary policy instrument. an alternative plan might set balance sheet something like pre-determined glide path would shrink balance sheet steadily time. in general, change path would face high threshold. 4 bi central bankers’ speech perhaps important detail approach exit establishment – communication – systematic plan so. of course, monetary policy always dependent evolution economy, articulate conduct policy transition normal policy framework, reduce uncertainty contribute stability. indeed, transparency always important ingredient sound monetary policymaking, exit period extraordinary policy, even important. give large amount liquidity present u.s. bank system, reasonable public concern inflation. a normalize policy framework, we, policymakers, need ensure public’s expectation inflation remain stable. the majority monetary economist central banks, include bank england, consider form inflation target best practice. it time feed adopt practice, i advocate nearly 20 years. some argue federal reserve single mandate price stability central bank do, set explicit inflation objective. i disagree. the u.s. congress set fed’s mandate conduct monetary policy “promote effectively goal maximum employment, stable prices, moderate long-term interest rates.” adopt inflation objective mean control inflation expense economic stability. on contrary, economists, included, agree focus price stability effective way monetary policy promote part mandate. moreover, commit state goal keep inflation low stable help reduce market uncertainty enhance credibility accountability central bank. during transition accommodative policy stance normal operate environment, especially important public confidence fed’s commitment manner let inflation accelerate. thus, view, would opportune time feed commit explicit numerical inflation objective. it noteworthy within last year so, public discussion u.s. swing concern u.s. might face period sustain deflation concern monetary policy rise commodity price could produce higher-than-desired inflation. these swing public concern indicate much uncertainty lookout inflation. we seek ensure translate lack confidence feed maintain price stability. a work exit period extreme monetary accommodation way neither lead high inflation risk undermine recovery, public’s confidence fed’s commitment price stability crucial. for reason, would highly desirable federal reserve publicly commit clear explicit inflation objective. while inflation target panacea challenge face monetary policymakers, important element credible program monetary economic stability. conclusion in summary, forecast economy continue expand moderate pace inflation move back current level oil price stabilize. despite weakness first quarter, i expect annual growth 3 3½ percent remainder year next. a economy strengthens, prospect labor market continue improve, unemployment rate descend 7 7½ percent end 2012. a economy evolves, federal reserve remain commit long-run statutory goal price stability maximum employment. we must carefully watch signal inflation alter expectation ensure monetary policy stay ahead curve. a bi central bankers’ speech 5 6 bi central bankers’ speech move forward time change, clear communication regard action objective utmost importance. i believe successful exit period extraordinary accommodation nontraditional policy communicate systematic plan describe head get there. such plan would strengthen fomc adopt explicit numerical objective inflation, would help ensure inflation expectation remain well anchored. zeti akhtar aziz: innovative finance transformation speech dr zeti akhtar aziz, governor central bank malaysia, langkawi international dialogue 2011: innovative finance transformation, putrajaya, 19 june 2011. * * * the world transforming. our motivation accelerate pace transformation ensure able effectively participate new economic financial environment, process, maximize potential performance. central well function financial system right financial policies. the recent financial crisis develop world show thing go wrong financial system, consequence catastrophic. instead create wealth – destroy wealth, instead generate employment – result job losses, instead facilitate economic progress – derail growth development. it great honour pleasure speak 2011 langkawi international dialogue innovative finance transformation. the overarch objective economic transformation surely generate sustainable balance growth, improve live standards, create employment opportunity achieve inclusive development. this decade however see innovative finance several develop economy fuel excessive level leverage result deeply indebted private public sectors, turn become highly destabilize financial system economies. the challenge u financial system develop regulate pitfall avoid time remain dynamic innovative push frontier gain progress aspire. while innovation remain essential economic progress, need within context strong governance sound risk management practices. positive innovation make enormous contribution economic performance. the financial system deliver essential financial service would cater financial need sector economy – households, small medium enterprises, include micro enterprise corporate sector. the financial system also take account fundamental change take place global economy grow participation emerge economy global economy. a become interlinked, financial system also need become internationalize facilitate reinforce trend. the role financial system essentially effectively intermediate meaningfully mobilize fund include across border channel productive economic activity. such intermediation must firmly anchor align objective generate sustainable balance growth, raise standard living, create employment promote development. with clarity role financial system importance link economy, range financial solution offer need meet highly differentiate change requirements. for households, financial system provide mean optimally spread income consumption life cycle. accumulate wealth via saving, investment borrow initial years, de-accumulating wealth late years, pension product annuity scheme retirement. this particularly important population matures. the absence product impose tremendous burden government fiscal position overall standard living. the malaysian experience encourage diversity financial product offer ensure need segment population met. this includes, basic bank product negligible cost low income groups, wide range bi central bankers’ speech 1 savings, investment protection product middle income group high income groups, wealth management comprehensive advisory services. in area financing, key priority country finance promote home ownership. this meet important basic need society encourage wealth accumulation among households. malaysia approach initially establish cagamas, national mortgage corporation, enable bank source long-term fund match long-term house loans. the national mortgage corporation continue evolve promote secondary market house loan via securitization mitigate risk mortgage finance provision mortgage insurance. a recent innovative arrangement introduce year risk-sharing arrangement government bank provide opportunity low income young segment population home thus accumulate wealth early age. another important form wealth accumulation collective investment scheme unit trusts. the pool save provide economy scale, access professional investment managers, well diversify investment portfolio. in malaysia, initially promote establishment government sponsor national save scheme (amanah saham nasional). participation average household pave way growth private unit trust industry. the formation national save scheme also contribute development institutional investor base malaysia able mobilize substantial volume savings. the mobilization fund provide potential fund business corporate sector project finance include infrastructure development. a smes micro enterprise form majority business enterprise countries, contribute significantly gdp, employment wealth creation, efficient access finance critical. the malaysian experience address establishment credit guarantee corporation assist viable smes inadequate track record access finance provide guarantee credit enhancement sme financing. the credit evaluation carry banks, cgc. for country sme-credit evaluation skill scarce, centralisation expertise use arrangement would able facilitate bank build capacity. there also wide range innovative financial product service support agenda. a highly successful programme malaysia rm2 billion sme assistance guarantee scheme establish february 2009 ensure viable smes adversely impact economic slowdown would continue access financing. under scheme, smes able obtain finance 80% guarantee cover provide credit guarantee corporation. the cost guarantee bear central bank. this scheme assist 10,000 smes sector economy sustain business preserve employment. venture capital private equity fund require provide early stage finance innovative smes. due highly specialise focus funds, common fund-of-funds establish pool mechanism purpose risk diversification. however, success form finance depend much enable environment term availability talent well deep relatively well develop equity market early stage investor “exit”. finally, micro finance important provide access fund micro enterprises. there many highly innovative scheme achieve outreach, include mobile bank agent banking. critical success finance price accessibility. the world see different degree success financing. critical success enable environment equal attention accorded. this include institutional arrangements, business model financing, regulation policy supervisory oversight. this ensure sustainability form financing. 2 bi central bankers’ speech another important segment business corporate sector. establish corporates require efficient source finance expansion well advisory service maximise enterprise value. a deep liquid bond market good information flow modern infrastructure allow efficient price corporate issuance – short term commercial paper support liquidity work capital, long term bond project financing. treasury service also important manage fund large corporation achieve high return well access risk management hedge instrument manage foreign exchange, commodity price form market risk. a economy develop, government need increasingly shift driver growth towards facilitate role promote private sector driver growth. malaysia leverage comparative advantage public private sector public private partnership infrastructure projects. the objective optimise cost efficiency sustainability finance model, enhance financial viability infrastructure project. this achieve risk transfer party best manage risks. hence, public sector provide regulatory risk guarantee incentive ensure adequate demand, whilst private sector raise finance well technical expertise. this model successfully implement big highway concessionaire malaysia. plus operate maintain 973km expressway peninsular malaysia, stretch border thailand singapore link major city west coast peninsular malaysia. finance infrastructure development equally important implication fiscal position. to structure competitive efficient finance stage infrastructure project schedule, several option consider – include direct fund budget, issuance long-term government bonds, issuance long-term government-guaranteed bonds, securitization work completed, issuance long-term bond back government’s undertake make defer payments. the actual fund mix adopt need base government’s fiscal position economic conditions. by adopt mix strategy overall duration project, government optimise fund costs. another major area finance challenge develop emerge economy health care. the structure healthcare provision require balance socialise element avoid market failure largely privately drive system (e.g. experience us) inefficiency fully public system (e.g. several european countries). social health insurance scheme base earn contribution mean fund source become complementary source fund public sector. such institutional arrangement provide high quality basic healthcare population whilst private health insurance complementary role provide high level care mean absorb costs. in develop financial sector deliver innovative finance economic transformation throughout different phase development require several support elements. these include: a. have strong financial institution resilient withstand economic cycle; b. establishment credit information system; c. development domestic bond market finance large investment public private sectors. this include necessary infrastructure facilitate function bond market; d. have talent pool financial service industry; e. financial literacy advance aggressively; f. effective structure ensure sufficient supervisory oversight ensure soundness stability financial system; bi central bankers’ speech 3 4 bi central bankers’ speech g. mechanism resolution debt problem include public private sector; h. potential leverage technology. this particular enhance distribution channel outreach; i. consumer protection framework need place; j. surveillance mechanism need place. finally, i would like discus importance islamic finance important mode finance economic transformation. islamic finance require financial transaction support underlie productive economic activity generate legitimate income wealth. this give rise close link financial transaction productive flows. therefore, growth islamic financial asset generally line growth underlie economic activities, thereby ensure financial system always ground real economy. other inherent feature arise risk share also contribute stability integrity islamic finance. thus, islamic finance, embrace entirety, supportive sustainable economic growth. islamic finance offer extensive range innovative financial product service consumer financing, asset wealth management islamic insurance capital markets. the sukuk market become highly competitive fundraise option large scale project infrastructure development. with annual growth rate 40 percent, sukuk instrument fast emerge attractive new asset class investors, evolve become prefer finance capital raise option issuers. in malaysia, sukuk market account fifty percent bond market, draw participation corporates also wide range international corporation multilateral agencies. in malaysia, comprehensive islamic financial system operate parallel conventional financial system. this internationalize enhance interlinkages emerge economy traditional markets. the emerge economy key driver economic transformation next decades, within across border result integrate global economy. it therefore imperative effort increase ensure collaboration share experience common good. the langkawi international dialogue continue important platform exchange great honour opportunity today. thank you. bi central bankers’ speech 1 erkki liikanen: economic monetary union – lesson recent crisis speech mr erkki liikanen, governor bank finland, european economics financial centre (eefc), distinguish speaker seminar, london, 16 june 2011. * * * it special pleasure speak london i thank professor scobie kind invitation. the bank finland close contact city long time. actually, celebrate 150 year relationship, since 1861 bank finland first open correspondent account london bank, n.m. rothschild & sons. a special relationship exist also national central bank two countries, bank finland bank england. this recently highlight governor, mervyn king, speak 200th anniversary conference bank finland helsinki last month (yes, bank finland turn 200 year). i impress hear governor king actually go old lady’s archive find interest evidence close relationship two central bank already 1920’s 1930’s. that time risto ryti, well know anglophile governor bank finland. governor ryti travel regularly london get know well british counterpart, famous montagu norman. a particularly vivid example governor king’s find letter governor ryti cameron cobbold, bank official late governor, date 18th june 1935, discuss forthcoming visit cobbold another official, humphrey mynors, finland. ryti wrote: “i shall great pleasure receive mr mynors bank finland i shall arrive 4 july 11:00 a.m. countryside, i spend summer holiday time. permit invite mr mynors luncheon bank arrival. i propose we, discuss matter mutual interest, start little trip nice place south finland, i shall arrange fish possibility summer enjoyment mr mynors might interested”. on letter handwritten comment mr cobbold mr mynors “this sound like real central bank cooperation! what summer sports?” to mr mynors respond say “does mean bring mosquito net?” at time innocent letter, world gradually recover great depression, bad financial disaster century. that recovery undermine surge global protectionism grow political instability europe towards end 1930’s. the fledgling attempt international economic policy cooperation league nation new bank international settlement effective enough solve problems. much change since letter write 76 year ago. however, recover global economic financial crisis. this time, economic cooperation, especially central banks, enable u prevent crisis develop spiral deflation depression. however, know, situation continue difficult even precarious. the foundation sustainable recovery far ready much need done. my topic today economy euro area. i propose discus current state emu challenge prospects. i approach topic perspective central banker. thus i start monetary policy – core central bank’s 2 bi central bankers’ speech responsibility – move broad issue financial market budgetary economic policy. monetary policy evaluation by measure judge performance emu? when monetary union designed, important concern ensure stability value money. the stability deutsche mark monetary policy bundesbank important role-models construction whole euro area, even central bank elsewhere. there strong consensus common currency stable deutsche mark been. at time maastricht treaty sign february 1992, signatory know german inflation rate previous 10 year 2.4 % per annum average. this admirable stability desire whole monetary union. how do respect? the ecb adopt target price stability: inflation le close 2 % medium term. this objective achieved. a mr. trichet able note, twelve year emu, average inflation rate euro area 1.97 % per annum. so, judge primary objective, say common currency disappoint expectation 1992. it must emphasize price stability also maintain relatively well recent financial crisis. in early phase crisis, imminent danger financial collapse ensue deflation. to keep monetary situation control, ecb complement interest rate policy variety unconventional non-standard measures. these improve liquidity bank system bond markets. the measure included, among things, much discuss bond purchase so-called security market programme. these action judge results. the euro remain strong, financial meltdown avoided, inflation expectation remain consistent ecb’s price stability objective. so, crisis last year crisis euro currency. the currency remain stable, also strong international context. this achievement remarkable, mean cause complacency. present challenge monetary policy in area monetary policy, fundamental task ensure euro area citizen economy put trust euro, also future. in task, two major challenges. the first challenge worldwide rapid increase price raw material energy. this quickly reflect inflation statistics, monetary policy cannot much stop it. but monetary policy must ensure cost impulse raw material price trigger second-round effect domestic costs. in order avoid second-round effects, crucial keep inflation expectation well anchor ecb’s price stability objective. this trust. ecb policy support communication must inspire public trust price stability. the firmly inflation expectation stabilized, good monetary policy support recovery euro area economy. bi central bankers’ speech 3 communication really effective monetary policy life commitment price stability. and independence ecb important. central bank independence key success bundesbank, key success ecb, must key future success. the second acute challenge emu economic divergence across euro area. some country grow well move towards satisfactory economic equilibrium. in others, economic situation still fragile show little, any, sign improvement. in respect, situation clearly difficult first ten year euro. in sense course, economic divergence among euro area country beyond reach ecb. monetary policy formulate whole area 331 million people. and equally deserve price stability, task ecb. however, problem grow economic divergence serious emu whole therefore, matter concern also ecb. the monetary union work well sufficient convergence economic policy economic performance across euro area countries. the financial system let turn monetary policy financial system: is, bank financial markets. the good health bank system important condition sustainable economic recovery. this case throughout world, also euro area. perhaps task especially urgent euro area, uncertainty regard health bank aggravate negative effect economic imbalance divergence area. a clear strengthen banks’ capital base long overdue. this task primarily shareholder weak banks, refrain take dividend inject capital needed. in cases, government investment bank equity may also necessary. come finland, i understand well political problem involve clean bank system. in 1990’s, finnish bank crisis, finnish government support asset management company handle banks’ problem assets, amount one point reach 10 per cent gdp. most money late recovered, meantime taxpayer furious. the public frustration cost bank crisis forget country. despite short-term discomfort entails, resolution bank problem necessary u move forward last recovery. on one hand, recapitalization weak viable bank necessary restore confidence. on hand, well-managed closure unprofitable bank necessary, distort market viable banks. another challenge improve bank practice bank culture. reform bank regulation part change. apart strict capital requirements, new regulatory framework also gradually develop strict standard bank liquidity. the risk make long-term commitment excessively volatile fund amply reveal recent crisis. i regard improve regulation absolute necessity experience last four years. at time, must acknowledge regulation alone enough. 4 bi central bankers’ speech therefore, ongoing reform really aim change culture banking. bank must renounce excessive adventurism last decade develop stability culture own, citizen see bank engine solid economic progress rather conduit short-term speculation. macroprudential policy one key lesson late global financial crisis central bank – authority – need pay much attention financial stability macroprudential oversight. new institution central bank play key role create identify systemic risk take appropriate action. example institute include european systemic risk board (esrb) eu, financial policy committee (fpc) within bank england financial stability oversight council (fsoc) unite states. macroprudential policy still formative phase. but clear new tool need develop order complement traditional instrument monetary policy. these tool pertain capital standards, lend practices, liquidity management credit institutions. and tool must work relation change financial market situation, prevent development excessive systemic risk contagion. the recent financial crisis painfully show quickly financial crisis spread national border world integrate financial market systems. because ever-deepening financial integration, financial cycle likely highly correlate across country also future. in world, successful macroprudential policy country entail positive externality form reduce financial risk countries. conversely, err side inaction produce negative externality countries, financial problem spread across national currency borders. i argue absence effective international coordination, national policymakers likely fail internalize positive externalities. this could lead national macroprudential policy overly passive dangerously weak prevent future global financial crises. let elaborate bite idea. consider strong upturn international financial cycle, asset price climb rapidly, leverage increase excessively price risk decline simultaneously many country interconnect financial markets. this scenario course resemble development year precede late global financial crisis. to prevent risk materialize systemic crisis, national authority tighten macroprudential policy possibly economic policies. now, consider decision-making problem macroprudential authority body individual country. this authority may find difficult tighten national macroprudential policy two reasons. first, well know problem “taking punch bowl away middle party”. it point political difficulty likely even bad macroprudential context term monetary policy: least constituency dislike inflation, probably none dislike intoxicate feel get rich asset price climb higher. second, i mention earlier, country tighten macroprudential policy isolation would internalize part financial stability benefit macroprudential tighten bear perceive cost term loss competitiveness financial industry. this may lead first-mover disadvantage problem, country bi central bankers’ speech 5 will first tighten macroprudential policy unless know country commit same. unless properly addressed, disincentive pursuance active national macroprudential policy may lead bad equilibrium, global macroprudential policy become stick overly passive stance. this imply identification effective macroprudential instrument – formidable task – guarantee instrument use efficiently. what avoid bad equilibrium? i three suggestions. first, relieve extensive political pressure take action, try best develop improve rules-based macroprudential policy. instrument dynamic loan loss provision use spain capital conservation buff basel iii framework, could work automatic stabiliser require continuous discretionary policy decisions. the countercyclical capital buff requirement include basel iii framework also include rules-based element, national authority advise use indicator develop basel committee benchmark national buff decisions. economist bank finland do preliminary analysis feasibility rules-based loan-to-value requirements. i urge research community intensify effort develop simple robust rules-based macroprudential instruments. second, national macroprudential authority need sufficiently robust mandates, independence legitimacy make discretionary macroprudential policy decisions. efficient macroprudential action highly unpopular. the cost action immediate whereas benefit become visible period years. the weak macroprudential authorities, likely bow intense political pressure intervene systemic risk mounting. third, need adequate international coordination national macroprudential policies. in eu, european systemic risk board take coordinate role. we must remember eu country part it; governor vote member supervisor present meetings. without doubt, difficult task. the esrb strike right balance direct recommendation macroprudential policy individual authority make collective recommendation large group authorities. individual recommendation may effective alleviate first-mover coordination problem may, worst, regard national authority accusation fail job properly. in case, response may defensive rather constructive. collective recommendations, turn, would largely remove stigma relate individually target recommendation may blunt hence le appropriate deal localize problems. find workable solution trade-off one key challenge esrb come years. government finance economic policy finally, let turn even broad category current challenges, challenge economic policy. when monetary union plan europe, much debate degree economic convergence country necessary form monetary union. some people think high degree economic convergence necessary precondition, whereas others argue membership monetary union necessity hold would perforce bring necessary adjustment convergence. 6 bi central bankers’ speech because insistence germany others, emphasis place economic convergence monetary union established: reasonable entry criterion set membership union, members’ behaviour regulate stability growth pact. now know emphasis convergence carry enough force. shake steep recession 2008, several country get unexpectedly danger zone. now, need even tight economic convergence, need good economic governance within emu. the “euro plus” pact recently sign european council step right direction. the challenge economic crisis pose economic policy emu twofold. first, government finance problem country must stabilized. this take tough measures, – expenditure control, tax increases, sale government asset – take time. second, need tight convergence competitiveness member country emu. the convergence competitiveness need get problem country grow again, return finance clearly sustainable trajectory. a regard stabilization problem countries, necessary support stabilization programme via temporary finance partner countries, imf. i believe support necessary order buy time adjustment, avoid risky illiquidity situation, possibility contagion. at time, important understand finance temporary. moreover, loan make strict conditionality, importantly context adjustment programme restore market confidence medium term. we must strengthen economic governance mechanism euro area minimize risk additional crisis government finance future. i especially welcome initiative fiscal norms. these nationally implement norm could help “internalize” fiscal discipline country render matter le issue eu police countries’ current fiscal actions. in finnish case, example, good experience medium-term budgetary frameworks. this system make easy follow plan fiscal policy resist one-off pressure increase government spending. and even finnish system budgetary framework develop further, course. i add point i see financial support arrangement greece, ireland, portugal step lead “transfer union”. transfer union would mean one-way subsidy government cover governemts’ deficits. this would consistent underlie principle eu. a mr. trichet put it, “it fully recognise economic union must one country wisely follow virtuous economic path rewarded, pursue unsustainable policy internalize cost actions.” i fully endorse view. politics we move well area politics. let say word country context. finland political spotlight recently. this happen financial support portugal become focus electoral campaign parliamentary election april. party sense – fear – voter would easily accept continue support operation stabilize finance weak euro area countries, issue become heated. there even worry finland would prevent eu support portugal. bi central bankers’ speech 7 this happen although euro enjoy relatively strong support finland. accord eurobarometer survey conduct last november, 78% finn support common currency le 20% negative it. and course, finn much positive euro scandinavian nations, instance. for finland, join monetary union mean two things: seat table decision made, promise stable money. we want avoid repetition traumatic currency bank crisis 1990’s. we put trust euro guarantor monetary stability. after fiscal crisis erupt year ago greece, support provide country country difficulty, sense disillusionment finland. people remember finland exert huge effort put house order economic crisis early 1990’s, qualify monetary union. have go that, many people ask, support others apparently follow commonly agree rules? and responsibility bank investor carelessly underestimate risk involve lend countries? we may understand reason frustration. but i one accept narrowly nationalistic anti-eu undertone sometimes accompany expression frustration. responsible politician every european country use leadership ensure idea constructive participation prevail temptation nationalistic approach. political fragmentation would weaken prospect recovery would make considerably difficult solve challenge economic monetary union. conclude comment i want conclude remark outlook euro area. the begin year encourage term average growth. the year-on-year growth rate, 2.5 per cent, high see since onset last recession. however, positive early phase year dim fact growth differential country continue large inflation exceed expectations. look ahead, i expect recovery continue. still, many reason uncertainty economic outlook large usual. accord eurosystem staff projection publish week ago, gdp growth 2011 range 1.5 2.3 per cent. that wide range. next year’s forecast range even wider, 0.6 2.8 per cent. part uncertainty regard growth prospect emanate global economic situation. the growth world economy show continue momentum appear increasingly self-sustained. this help euro area export course positive factor. on hand, global expansion demand largely base emerge economies, many run full capacity face risk overheating. this fact make situation somewhat precarious, balance growth pattern world economy would clearly good stability. the rapid growth emerge economy also one cause high energy prices. the high cost energy raw material hurt euro area recovery eat real income thus weigh private consumption. in way, energy-intensive nature present global growth risk euro area. mostly energy, inflation euro area project stay 2 per cent threshold 2011. the range eurosystem staff projection 2.5 2.7 per cent. for 2012, inflationary pressure project weaken. ultimately, responsibility monetary policy ensure moderation take place. 8 bi central bankers’ speech the higher-than-expected consumer price inflation pose risk growth well. one relate danger wage inflation. presently, euro area recovery drive mainly export private investment. however, energy price transmit high wage demands, profitability competitiveness euro area economy weaken, would hurt export investment. in addition global factors, internal tension within euro area economy continue major source uncertainty growth. in current situation, disruption work financial market might easily spill real economy, depress demand good services, damage bank hurt government budgets. even usually, growth euro area cannot take granted. it highly conditional success economic policy, bring balance economic landscape within emu. the policy agenda i review talk large one. it also difficult agenda, least must realize cooperative effort eu euro area governments. while policy maker market observer well aware difficulties, i think also aware stake. therefore, i confident challenge face emu successfully tackle foundation gradually lay sustainable growth europe. thank attention. miguel fernández ordóñez: presentation 2010 annual report testimony mr miguel fernández ordóñez, governor bank spain, parliamentary committee economic financial affairs, occasion presentation 2010 annual report, madrid, 21 june 2011. * * * lady gentlemen, i appear today occasion presentation 2010 annual report. a case last year i give testimony, circumstance surround u remain complicated. it would overstate case say crucial crossroad future economic monetary union anchor recovery spain. the crisis break summer 2007 go various phase bring major consequence bear. a year back, committee, i speak event shake euro area spring 2010, emergence sovereign debt crisis, response authority approval financial assistance programme greece, first step towards reform euro area governance mechanisms. the effect crisis spanish economy serious, economic policy respond ambitious fiscal adjustment plan, fresh impetus financial restructure process launch structural reform various fields. set serious circumstance face spain, may say right approach chosen, initiative adopt help mitigate risk materialised. despite favourable change course, situation twelve month remain complex, european perspective domestic standpoint spanish economy. the european sovereign debt crisis serious episode impact euro area since single currency founded. it nature difficulty tackle have, moreover, highlight shortcoming institutional framework euro. these include notably insufficient degree fiscal discipline impose stability growth pact, absence mechanism check build-up macroeconomic imbalance lack tool manage crisis situation witnessed. yet must also acknowledge significant progress recent month three areas. there various legislative initiative reinforce stability growth pact, establish arrangement prevention correction macroeconomic (other fiscal) imbalance and, finally, address crisis situation so-called european stability mechanism. but beyond necessary reform economic governance euro, difficult position irish, portuguese and, all, greek economy must redressed. tension peak outcome situation may important consequence euro area whole. it often acknowledge european construction forge overcome recurrent episode crisis, project always emerge strengthened. let u hope true time european authorities’ decision rise challenge. the spanish economy particularly affect sovereign debt crisis greek irish economy resort adjustment programmes. conversely, happen portugal april year, impact less, despite close economic, trade financial tie country. this due set measure bi central bankers’ speech 1 adopt previously speed approval reform thus tackle confidence problems. in event, spanish economy remain scrutiny markets, continue demand unjustifiably high level sovereign risk premia. in past week witness effect cause recent discussion europe potential participation private sector bail-out greek economy, doubt resurface seriousness spain’s commitment push outstanding reforms. the spread sovereign debt crisis spain ultimately due presence country certain factor vulnerability result imbalance build previous upturn. and compound factor emerge crisis, high unemployment rate burgeon budget deficit. the main imbalance accumulate phase strong growth attributable sharp expansion demand give rise substantial increase private-sector debt, excess real estate sector, price cost increase tend crowd domestic output favour imports, systematically raise external deficit. the unfold economic crisis complicate situation. firstly, give rise severe job destruction, result shortcoming work labour market. at 21%, unemployment level highlight need reform institutional framework market; figure also raise doubt spanish economy’s capacity restore potential growth ensure sustainability public finances. in respect, rapid fiscal deterioration one factor increase country’s exposure euro area debt crisis. our start point healthy one, budget surplus 2007 low public debt ratio. but deterioration sharp that, space scarcely two years, deficit climb 11% gdp debt move delicate dynamic financial market begin worry expansionary deviation public finance countries. in climate nervousness, high level private-sector debt, need balance-sheet write-down financial sector difficulty economy face grow sufficiently high level weigh perception sustainability public finances. moreover, bank system, negotiate first wave international financial crisis without excessive difficulties, come big problem main element underlie macroeconomic crisis begin felt banks. combine tighten finance condition credit institution raise fund abroad, result prevail instability financial markets. face circumstances, vital firmly show matter could turn around spain bind follow path instability countries. to this, change economic policy stance last spring essential, since demonstrate willingness react redress imbalances. give source tensions, priority right trajectory public finances. to end, ambitious fiscal consolidation plan approve may last year. it bring forward bulk adjustment make year 2010 2011. in parallel, patent press need tackle labour market shortcoming hamper absorption unemployment adjustment economy. hence labour market reform launched. finally, financial field, restructure initiate year early accelerate overhaul save bank sector. thank measures, recovery spanish economy remain track, although continue slow pace, due need undertake unavoidable adjustments. in respect, weight real estate activity output continue decline external deficit also corrected. there significant progress inflation, due influence temporary factors, rise vat 2 bi central bankers’ speech july last year hike oil commodity prices. once effect work through, inflation fall come months, although happen vital second-round effect come about, would harm economy’s competitiveness. write-down balance sheet non-financial corporation household continued, slight decline outstanding balance credit extend agents. in case non-financial corporations, behaviour differ across productive sectors, modest increase finance company real estate development construction. in case households, deleveraging doubt slower, insofar bulk household debt mortgage loan extend long terms, whereby repayment gradual. adjustment imbalance economy vital order soundly underpin medium long-term growth, although short run, balance-sheet write-down general government sector, credit institution household firm may check take-off spending. fortunately, sluggishness domestic demand offset buoyancy external demand. the thrust export substantial continue so, whereby attain gain competitiveness vital. this key variable make adjustment imbalance compatible firm dynamic recovery. if combination adjustment growth successfully take root, spanish economy could see private-sector deleveraging, stabilise public finance restructure bank system lead increase confidence, soft financial condition and, sum, improve economic outlook would boost investment employment. the role economic policy remain pivotal steer adjustment process. in case fiscal policy, measure adopt last spring mark start point. but substantial challenge lie ahead determination require define specify measure allow public finance resume stable path. in short run, deficit target 2011 ambitious, entail reduction 3 pp gdp 6%. but, time, compliance crucial view financial markets’ extreme sensitivity course public finances. a great effort need but, much stake, vital prevent deviation target arise and, so, necessary measure must immediately implement correct them, government undertake do. to see task through, level government must involved. this begin regional governments, must firmly redress budgetary positions, connection strict arrangement authorisation indebtedness may prove helpful. another confidence-building factor would great transparency regional government budgetary information. true, significant headway recently make area. but, dispel doubt state regional finances, would important see regular publication figure regional government whole particular region, periodicity, degree detail, lag accessibility state figures. the heavy deterioration general government deficit crisis advises, moreover, adopt measure achieve balance budgetary performance upturn recessions. here, government announcement include budgetary stability law rule whereby general government spend may exceed medium-term growth rate spanish economy positive. this rule would immediately applicable central local government, adoption regional government would also pursued. fiscal sustainability also need economy swiftly restore dynamism achieve high potential rate, since fundamental mean finance public spend increase population age inevitably go lead. the propose pension bi central bankers’ speech 3 system reform submit government january year also key step towards curb costs. the financial market understand reform strengthen fiscal sustainability, would advisable set proposal form legislation soon possible. further, sustainability reform refer specified, procedure place ensure time pension growth sustainable path. on financial front, headway restructure bank sector make 2010 2011 date. the significant regulatory step creation, 2009, fund orderly restructure bank sector (frob). the frob prove useful pave way merger integration process save bank sector, highly fragmented. a result, number institution sector fall relatively quickly 45 18. in operation receive fund frob, institution concern submit restructure plan envisage reduction number office operate expenses. other major step bank system restructure reform legal regime govern save banks, approve last summer. and recently, february year,

authorise inject capital need case bank cannot meet new requirement resort markets. this recapitalisation strategy encourage entry private investor save bank require time effort concerned. but offer clear advantage medium long term regard cost taxpayer and, all, soundness durability new projects, compare nationalisation use countries, problem differ necessary pursue beforehand strategy base rationalisation weak institution attain gain efficiency, size governance. recapitalisation move ahead term timeframe envisage royal decree-law 2/2011. on 11 march, banco de españa publish capital need institution comply legislation. most commercial bank half spanish save bank meet requirement lay down. follow collapse one integration projects, 13 institution – commercial bank save bank – need

participate integration process good capitalise institution. finally, remain four save bank increase capital meet new requirement choose frob primary option. the institution opt tap markets, whether ipo private investor take stake capital, currently immerse process associate strategy. in case save bank resort frob recapitalise, business recapitalisation plan analysed, valuation institution

capital meet new requirements. 4 bi central bankers’ speech the banco de españa consider capital requirement lay royal decree-law 2/2011 sufficient ensure soundness spanish bank system, likely macroeconomic scenario, also harsh scenario unlikely occur. a known, analyst estimate capital need bank system may great future, assumption strong deterioration spanish economy. in respect, stress test conduct european level show extent bank need capital withstand extreme scenario envisage tests. if, result tests, certain spanish bank evidence additional capital need could cover bank resort market means, frob would provide fund required, envisage royal decree. in event, even highly pessimistic scenario spanish economy, use public fund recapitalise institution would entail relatively moderate increase outstanding balance spanish public debt. the restructure recapitalisation bank system accompany significant drive write balance sheet spanish deposit institution which, since january 2008, recognise assume asset impairment loss total €96 billion, equivalent 9% gdp. lastly, i like stress progress make transparency significant role tool played. in particular, i remind europe-wide coordinate stress test conduct last year subject spain substantially high coverage countries. indeed, result save bank list commercial bank published. consequently, analyst public large information need evaluate ass situation even small spanish institutions, something cannot do countries. moreover, banco de españa require institution publish detail exposure trouble assets, along volume wholesale

requirement public. transparency useful tool financial system restructure help dispel doubt soundness spanish bank sector, enable public opinion good understand need overhaul save bank sector, encourage manager attendant authority promptly undertake necessary restructure process. the spanish economy face considerable challenges, i review today. but press task undoubtedly lie labour market, work evidence singular trait compare countries. in time crisis present, trait lead adjustment come essentially job destruction and, even boom times, unemployment rate hold unjustifiably high level. to reduce high unemployment rapidly generate job again, must draw institutional legal framework close model develop countries, allow great flexibility use labour factor great degree worker protection. in fact, within euro, key variable recovery spanish economy competitiveness. and without far-reaching reform institutions, difficult spanish economy promptly attain reasonable rate sustain growth. on 10 june government approve decree-law provide improvement regulation collective bargaining. foreseeably, passage parliament, great power extend worker employer that, mutual agreement, may decide believe suitable enhance productivity competitiveness companies. the positive effect great flexibility labour market would reinforce if, moreover, measure take increase competition market good services. bi central bankers’ speech 5 6 bi central bankers’ speech in sum, juncture achieve right monetary fiscal stance successfully manage economic policy pivotal future spanish economy. the course european sovereign debt crisis take determinant paramount importance. but whatever scenario role economic policy remain fundamental overcome inefficiency highlighted, redress lack confidence hamper raise cost external funding, keep spanish economy safe incident might occur european arena. bi central bankers’ speech 1 andreas dombret: reform global financial system open lecture dr andreas dombret, member executive board deutsche bundesbank, generation forum, eltville, 16 june 2011. * * * 1. introduction lady gentlemen, the reform global financial system limelight next two day lecture debates. i ask kick discussion present you, brief, bundesbank’s point view ongoing regulatory reform process. what already achieved, key issue still need tackled? 2. regulatory reform – achieved? the global financial crisis keep u extremely busy 4 year now. look back, little doubt inadequate regulatory framework one important cause crisis. thus, imperative learn right lesson minimise likelihood future crisis close regulatory loophole mend weakness come surface. significant progress already make regard. therefore, i restrict mention two key measures. firstly, new capital liquidity standard bank sector, commonly know basel iii, finally endorse g20 meet last november seoul. capital requirement rise considerably term quantity quality. moreover, first-time introduction global liquidity standard bolster banks’ liquidity cushions, thereby address possibility contagion via money market excessive maturity transformation. all all, new rule significantly strengthen resilience financial institutions. secondly, relate basel iii, substantial progress also make tackle problem deal systemically important financial institutions, call sifis short. a know, strike feature sifis insolvency regard virtually intolerable – particularly large, complex interconnected. or perform specific function cannot readily assume market participants. back seoul summit last year, g20 accept comprehensive framework address sifi problem put forward financial stability board. work specify framework’s individual recommendation currently pursue matter urgency. the final framework spell detail next g20 summit, take place cannes november year. 3. what remain done? notwithstanding progress already made, still long way go make international financial system watertight. in follow remarks, i would like point three aspect regulatory reform accompany u come months. firstly, indispensable finalise, implement without delay, fsb framework deal sifis. secondly, introduce internationally compatible restructure resolution regime financial institution allow exit market orderly 2 bi central bankers’ speech fashion without cause breakdown system. and finally, must identify so-called shadow bank system expose supervision. let briefly discus three area detail. 3.1 deal sifis a already mentioned, fsb currently finalise recommendation deal sifis. one difficulty lie accurately identify sifis base criterion size, interconnectedness, substitutability complexity. i would like promote rather pragmatic approach towards solve problem: we start institution indisputably global systemic relevance. i expect group 25 30 bank – less. the composition group surely change time. a experience gained, might late extend framework appropriate manner sifis, include financial institution domestic relevance, financial market infrastructures, insurance company non-bank financial institutions. central fsb concept systemic capital surcharge sifis go well beyond requirement mandatory basel iii. such capital add-on merely improve resilience sifi, word reduce probability failure. they surely also suitable instrument put price tag implicit guarantee sifis deem enjoy. formal decision yet take exact application modality sifi surcharge, especially size. nevertheless, i expect end day amount additional capital require sifi relate systemic importance likelihood lie somewhere two three percent. what also still discuss choice capital instrument acceptable surcharge. common equity surely appear natural choice additional charge. but i think instrument full loss absorb capacity deserve careful consideration. for instance, contingent capital – word debt convert equity certain stress trigger hit – afford loss absorbency needed. we bear mind contingent capital still largely uncharted territory. it might necessary conduct research gather practical experience untried untested instruments, especially market implication contingent capital associate net financial stability implications. nevertheless, contingent capital, properly designed, likely represent major step forward provide additional loss absorbency. let’s realise contingent capital part basel iii communiqué.1 therefore, bundesbank continue favour include contingent capital sifi package. 3.2 introduce restructure resolution regime closely relate sifis second issue, namely need appropriate restructure resolution regime financial sector. let’s realise never fully prevent individual institution go bankrupt. failure part parcel market economy. but financial institution fail must allow drag entire system them. unfortunately, many country general insolvency law prove inadequate crisis. hence clearly need special mechanism allow orderly restructure resolution financial institutions. a strong resolution regime make failure credible option thus reduce moral hazard. 1 see also basel committee bank supervision, group governor head supervision announce high global minimum capital standards, 12 september 2010. bi central bankers’ speech 3 in regard, significant progress already make national level. for instance, germany so-called restructure act come effect begin year. it element include significant extension supervisory powers, especially possibility transfer financial asset distress bank private bank public bridge bank. remain part wind insolvency proceedings, necessary. to reduce financial burden public sector future crises, act provide restructure fund finance levy bank sector. despite positive feature german restructure act represent largely uncharted legal territory certain limit bank significant cross border business involved. this another reason need internationally harmonise resolution mechanisms. while progress national level remarkable many countries, obstacle effective cross-border resolution remain. thus, one main task come month establish ensure mutual compatibility different national restructure resolution mechanisms. yet bear mind orderly resolution financial institution truly active global level may possible certain degree. at european level least, propose european commission legislation, due summer, look represent major step forward. 3.3 let’s overlook shadow bank system the third regulatory challenge i want address necessity extend reform effort beyond bank system. the strict rule impose bank via basel iii rule sifis entail realistic danger activity shift le regulate areas. therefore, imperative u good illuminate fringe financial system. in words, must closely monitor regulate commonly refer shadow bank system. whether market participant classify belong shadow bank system depend much institutional type activities. at behest g20, fsb currently explore way mean monitor regulate shadow bank system. it recently define term shadow bank “credit intermediation involve entity activity outside regular bank system”.2 this rather broad definition involve non-banks special purpose vehicle money market funds, also hedge funds. the fsb present set recommendation g20 autumn year. what already obvious today need significantly enhance transparency impose appropriate registration requirement well report obligation part financial system. yet good monitor enough. to reduce systemic risk, good regulation shadow bank system necessary too. this could do either directly, regulate activity actor shadow bank system themselves. or indirectly, regulate banks’ interaction shadow bank system. 4 need international cooperation let close emphasise urgent need international cooperation. more 4 year outbreak crisis, crossroads. our cooperation 2 see fsb, shadow banking: scoping issues, a background note financial stability board, 12 april 2011. 4 bi central bankers’ speech come month decide whether new rule financial system internationally compatible bring uneven level play field, lead regulatory arbitrage. at end day, globally consistent implementation transposition adopt key reform national law counts. while heterogeneous national structure make imperative maintain certain degree flexibility reform financial regulation, must ensure individual country game system benefit financial institutions. financial centres, vie good position among themselves, must circumstance permit engage activity expense financial stability, least give ever close interconnectedness global financial system. individual country seek advantage water down, reluctantly implement internationally agree reforms. to avoid beggar-thy-neighbour policies, transparency, peer pressure close monitor progress implement agree standard measure essential. 5. conclusion lady gentlemen, to sum up: a number crucial reform measure design secure financial stability already approve way. yet important task still lie ahead. above all, need • find solution sifi problem; • ensure financial institution resolve without drag whole system; • identify shadow bank system expose supervision. in this, must strike right balance pay sufficient attention peculiarity national financial system ensure international level play field. thank attention! bi central bankers’ speech 1 subir gokarn: financial stability welcome remark dr subir gokarn, deputy governor reserve bank india, saarcfinance governors’ symposium, kumarakom, kerala, 10 june 2011. * * * governor dr. subbarao, distinguish governors, dr. reddy, mr. caruana, mr. ninan, mrs. thorat, deputy governors, guest saarc central bank friends. on behalf reserve bank india, i extend warm welcome saarcfinance governor’s symposium 2011 theme financial stability. just refresh memories, last governor symposium organize u dr. reddy 2005 mumbai deal theme “communications policy central banks”. financial stability indeed appropriate theme meeting. the recent financial crisis also term “the great recession” clearly bring financial stability centrestage public policymaking. the global financial crisis sweep economic financial system across world last three year shake belief near truths. one, question premise price stability financial stability complementary. rather financial stability jeopardize even environment price stability macroeconomic stability. two, impossible imagine sustain growth without financial stability. any disruption financial system anywhere world potential affect real economy country also elsewhere. we see domestic global financial stability mutually exclusive domains. with increase financial globalization, grow realisation this, extent transmission disruption recent financial turmoil different channels, namely finance, trade confidence channel unthinkable crisis. it also come unpleasant revelation even country contribute immediate cause crisis bear brunt unwholesome international financial climate. hence, domestic financial stability cannot become realistic goal absence conducive global environment. three, two-speed recovery, accompany widen global economic imbalance centre new configuration risks. these visible variety front – sovereign debt risks, financial fragility, search yield, relate stress emerging-market economy foreign exchange markets. hence, current environment, financial stability view term lesson crisis, also term future risk challenges. there is, thus, clear recognition importance financial stability policy. however, several question arisen, still answers. we may attempt address least them. i would like highlight prominent ones. first, increase number central bank start include financial stability policy mandate along price stability, need consider whether financial stability shift implicit variable explicit variable economic policy. a recent imf survey (december 2010) point out, although financial stability formal mandate countries, definition financial stability informal almost 80 per cent respondents. if financial stability make explicit objective central banks, search operational definition measurment financial stability come forefront. 2 bi central bankers’ speech in context, important recognise financial stability, difficult enough define, even difficult measure. though theoretically one would prefer composite indicator financial stability (threshold benchmark values) individual variable indicator financial system stability, practical terms, assessment financial stability revolve around monitor several indicator convey health institutions, market infrastructure. consider construction single aggregate measure financial stability difficult task give complex nature financial systems, would useful appropriate template methodology key indicators. a initial step, imf december 2010 conduct stock-take survey international experience financial stability evolve macroprudential policy framework cover 63 country european central bank also include g20 country subject mandatory financial sector assessment program (fsap). second, appropriate role central bank maintain financial stability relationship relevant body intensify new arrangement put place several country plan others. under reform financial stability framework, allocation responsibility respect financial stability instrument manage stability still rigorously debate worldwide. third, financial stability mandate central bank may implication monetary policy well. although predominant focus price stability may yield low stable inflation term price good services, low return commodity/service produce sector could divert search yield financial sector. this call question pre-crisis consensus best practice monetary policy framework one characterise “a single target” (i.e., price stability) “a single instrument” (i.e., short-term policy interest rate). the financial stability mandate governance arrangement central bank must compatible monetary policy responsibilities. fourth, widely recognise analysis micro-prudential lens make policymakers prone ignore implication systemic stability financial market imperfections, include stem information frictions, moral hazard implicit too-big-to-fail firm outside regulatory purview negative externality firm too-interconnected-to-fail failed. while supplement micro-prudential approach macro-prudential approach, role central bank regard need design take account synergy conflict assignment function various policy agencies. fifth, financial regulatory reform spearhead international level g20 aim increase resilience global financial system. in process, international best practice trajectory shift upwards introduction basel iii reforms. nevertheless, come country specific implementation internationally consistent manner, several practical challenges. any substantial adjustment financial sector tandem international prescription saarc economy might implication steady state growth individual economy well trade financial cooperation within region. further, many country still recover crisis new imposition may disrupt this. moreover, unlike develop economies, saarc economy also need factor inter-linkages growth socio-economic outcomes. even small decline growth may magnitudinally wide repercussion growth critically link inter-regional equity poverty. hence region need calibrate time magnitude adjust global new normal. sixth, saarc countries, different stage development may feature financial sector pose challenge stability system advance economies. for example, important ensure crucial goal financial literacy financial inclusion ignore overdrive financial stability. in india, newly create fsdc include financial bi central bankers’ speech 3 literacy inclusion mandate apart macroprudential financial stability responsibilities. against backdrop, let introduce format conference. we cover conference theme two special talk two technical sessions. we begin key note address governor dr.subbarao follow presentation two guest

development albania 2010 speech mr ardian fullani, governor bank albania, parliament present annual report bank albania, tirana, 9 june 2011. * * * dear madam speaker, dear member parliament, it pleasure today present bank albania’s opinion economic monetary development past year. pursuant legal requirement institutional commitment enhance central bank’s transparency responsibility, presentation i share main highlight bank albania’s activity 2010. this activity, entire spectrum, aim fulfil mission legal obligations, reflect parliament’s recommendation 2010. let begin presentation brief overview conclusions. during 2010, albanian economy experience overall positive performance. the economic activity post growth, macroeconomic stability financial health indicator improved. economic growth reflect mainly foreign demand albanian product services, affirming, all, dynamism private sector. it also support sustain macroeconomic environment, downward risk premia improve liquidity indicators. in particular, reflect development financial real sector economy, well monetary policy, consumer price inflation remain line 2010 target. also, year:  the economy’s external position improved;  the ratio budget deficit public debt gdp dropped;  financial stability consolidated;  financial intermediation expand further;  interest rate risk premium financial market decreased. on hand, 2010’s development underline need continue intensify structural reforms, pre-requisites sustainable long-term economic growth. first, new agenda structural reform aim establish requisite balance sustainable growth long run. great orientation albania’s economy export overall high competitiveness product international domestic market dictate need continue structural reform macro- microeconomic levels. second, macroeconomic stability consolidation require work future. the great lesson recent global financial crisis teach u prevention good cure. maintain country’s internal external balance require development decision-making architecture macroeconomic coordination, well economy market supervisory regulatory mechanisms. analytical forecast decision-making skill public private economic agent also improved. 2 bi central bankers’ speech third, ensure country’s financial stability require coordinate action supervisory regulatory institutions, great attention private agent market. a sustainable financial system, orient new long-term horizon prudential risks, serf channel save competitive sector economy. * * * in following, i would like address above-listed topic details, focus key point bank albania’s work. 1. economic financial development 2010 accord instat data, albanian economy estimate grow 3.9 % year. compare 2009, economic growth balance term sectorial distribution demand components. during 2010, albanian economy characterise gradual improvement aggregate demand consolidation macroeconomic stability. economic development follow price stability, public debt current account deficit narrowed. economic growth rely mainly foreign demand increase albanian exports, domestic demand sluggish. the latter decelerate due public finance consolidation budget deficit reduction 2010, consumer spend private investment affect insecurity future presence spare capacities. fiscal policy orient towards fiscal consolidation 2010, follow stimulate nature 2009. fiscal consolidation accelerate especially 2010 h2, follow approval revise budget. this consolidation present both, income expenditure sides. budget revenue increase 8.4% y-o-y, reflect economic growth, expansion taxpayers’ base, privatisation receipts. on hand, budget expenditure decrease 4.5%, attributable reduction government capital expenditures. budget deficit 2010 settle around 3.0% gdp, reduce 52% compare year earlier. this deficit fund mainly issue domestic debt instruments. however, deficit finance novelty 2010, issue first albanian eurobond. it issue, eur 300 million, meet part public sector’s need foreign currency accompany reduction domestic borrowing. current account deficit narrow 21.5% 2010, 11.9% gdp. this reflect augment private public sector savings. increase export result invigorate foreign demand, depreciate exchange rate improvement trade term period also contribute it. notwithstanding improvement record 2010, current account deficit remain high. a continuously stated, bank albania deem compilation structural policy dampen external economy misbalance priority. net flow capital financial account record decline 11.2% 2010, lead current account deficit finance 87.5%. exclude privatisations, foreign direct investment estimate 9.3% gdp constitute main source foreign finance albanian economy. foreign reserve increase eur 178.8 million stock eur 1.9 billion may cover 4.8 month good service import. positive development external sector economy, primarily owe expansion export foreign currency inflow eurobond, contribute generation contain pressure foreign exchange market. from macroeconomic viewpoint, bi central bankers’ speech 3 relative exchange rate stability year reflect new equilibrium foreign currency demand supply. in sectorial terms, albanian economy development rely chiefly growth industry service sectors, construction sector continue contract 2010. industry service sector benefited, great extent, respectively, foreign demand structural shift domestic demand short-term consumption goods. in short- mid-term horizon, sector expect remain main support pillar albanian economy. agriculture, important sector albanian economy, mark positive performance 2010. even so, base broad concentration country’s population great potential development, increase sector’s productivity remain long-term priority. money financial market monetary development past year line performance real sector economy, reflect simultaneously fully restore confidence financial system, improve supply demand ratio financial market prudent liquidity management policy bank albania. expansion monetary stock 10.6% average comply economy’s demand money trigger inflationary tendency economy. deposit gdp ratio 64.2% end-year, high level prior deposit withdrawal. in addition, profile deposit time structure reflect high preference saving, characterise shift long maturity-term deposits. ease lend term 2010 h2, stimulate measure take bank albania, decrease uncertainty risk premium follow gradual credit growth. private sector loan portfolio expand 10% 2010, principally influence foreign-currency credit growth. this performance reflect prudential bank policy loan portfolio quality economic agents’ moderate demand loan. in general, lend continue suffer lack demand realistic, qualitative valuable business plan crediting. restoration confidence financial system, macroeconomic stabilisation, regulatory supervisory measure take bank albania lead stabilisation improvement bank system capitalisation, liquidity profitability indicators. 2. inflation monetary policy annual consumer price inflation average 3.6% 2010, remain within bank albania’s target band. inflationary pressure concentrate 2010 h1, mostly trigger rise administer prices. average annual inflation 2010 h1 3.9%. in follow two quarters, relative stabilisation exchange rate low inflationary pressure domestic demand contribute average inflation rate convergence around bank albania’s target. negative output gap generate contain inflationary pressure throughout 2010, thus balance national currency depreciation effect international market price rise. the prospect future show albanian economy expect operate potential even medium-term, put downward pressure inflation. a i highlight earlier, 2010, bank albania’s monetary policy implement macroeconomic environment positive growth rates, contain inflationary pressure anchor inflation expectations. this environment lead retain stimulate monetary policy stance conduct since 2009. it trigger downward interest rate complete even stimulate effect exchange rate depreciation. 4 bi central bankers’ speech low interest rate favour rise domestic consumption investments, whereas depreciate exchange rate support growth albanian exports. reduction fiscal stimulus 2010 h2 expand space monetary policy conduct. in july 2010, bank albania low key interest rate 0.25 percentage points, historic low 5.0%. improvement bank system liquidity condition weak public sector demand money support transmission ease policy segment financial market last month 2010. in parallel, bank albania supply financial market require liquidity support financial intermediation. aim adopt advance model central banking, particularly, convergence euro-system practices, bank albania change form operational objective. since june 2010, liquidity management operation orient target short-term interbank interest rate minimize volatility. * * * the bank system supervision function another important aspect central bank duties. 3. bank supervision financial stability year 2010 characterise increase bank system activity, improve bank soundness profitability indicators, well good capitalisation system. on hand, bank system characterise increase non-performing loan portfolio, reflect also active policy bank albania term enhance transparency bank balance sheets. bank system development the bank sector continue remain main actor financial intermediation albania. at end-2010, bank system asset double compare year earlier, account 81% gdp. the bank system continue finance mainly public deposit focus lend private sector. on hand, economy’s below-potential growth depreciate exchange rate contribute increase non-performing loans, 14% total loans. however, indicator’s growth rate decelerate 2010. capital adequacy ratio remain satisfactory levels, 15.4%, obviously high 12% benchmark set forth regulatory framework. the system’s shareholder equity increase 10% 2010. credit risk remain main risk bank sector. in response risk, bank sector create adequate provision weather big shock borrowers’ solvency market equilibria. bank system supervision in early 2010, bank albania change bank supervision organisational framework, orient relate directly risk associate financial activity. in parallel, bank albania re-conceptualised supervision focus strategy accordance risk pose albania’s bank financial system. transparency publication information bank financial product service focus supervision 2010. encourage enhancement private financial agents’ transparency also reflect amendment make regulatory framework year. bi central bankers’ speech 5 high commission fee bank product service sensitive issue address past year constitute priority upcoming period. the bank albania, analyses, play key role discussion matter, aim tackle timely duly. also, issue relate anti-money laundering, transparency compliance prudential regulation important part supervisory process 2010. in view strengthen supervisory process bank institutions, bank albania sign number cooperation agreement central bank region european ones, parent bank headquarters. strengthen supervisory regulatory framework in 2010, bank albania finalise draft several new regulation amend regulation bank supervision. this process aim compliance basel committee standard eu directives, take account international best practice albanian bank system developments. new regulatory act key amendment actual act bank supervision approve 2010 are:  regulation “on management risk open foreign exchange positions”;  regulation “on risk management activity non-bank institutions”;  guideline “on conservatorship liquidation banks”. * * * besides main aspect bank albania’s work, monetary policy bank supervision regulation, bank albania’s activity also focus fulfilment legal obligation institutional commitments. spar details, i would like emphasize bank albania do great job 2010 for:  develop sophisticate payment system;  support integration process country, accordance scope activity;  enhance communication public, essential instrument foster transparency central bank independence;  further develop monetary statistic external sector economy;  strengthen research capacity, support analysis decision-making. all activity serve financial system development support free market economy albania. a detail analysis find annual report * * * dear madam speaker, dear member parliament, turn back analysis economic financial development country, crisis, i would like highlight structural weakness albanian economy 6 bi central bankers’ speech accompany throughout transition: high current account deficit still low degree economy’s competitiveness global markets. today live global world, integrate capital, product labour markets. a develop country, albania face (and continue face) rise competition, region also beyond it. in opinion, long-term sustain development country reduction structural weaknesses, imply necessarily increase competitiveness albanian economy. ongoing structural reform drive ambitious goal realistic time horizon. structural reform aim create attractive climate foreign domestic investments, encourage employment growth welfare, providing:  a sustainable macroeconomic environment;  an efficient reliable financial system;  a legal, complete transparent functional framework;  a modern infrastructure;  a qualify competitive workforce term cost;  a clear perspective fast integration european union, open way convergence funds. fulfilment criterion require joint commitment, bank albania play role. personally, i remain convince increase effectiveness reform light this, would enable albania make qualitative step towards integration. in conclusion, allow remind that, besides bank albania’s annual report, bank albania’s financial statement balance sheet, certify auditors, submitted. thank attention bi central bankers’ speech 1 lorenzo bini smaghi: intervention sverige riksbank conference “monetary policy era fiscal stress” intervention mr lorenzo bini smaghi, member executive board european central bank, panel “challenges monetary fiscal policy”, sverige riksbank conference “monetary policy era fiscal stress”, stockholm, 17 june 2011. * * * it pleasure contribute sverige riksbank conference entitle “monetary policy era fiscal stress”. the subject indeed topical – global – one. not europe around world, crisis progressively acquire fiscal dimension may u number year come. against background, may useful briefly look back relationship monetary policy fiscal policies, stress particular challenge monetary policy may face environment sharply rise fiscal deficit debt. come ecb, i course primarily focus euro area experience lessons. if, simple one-country setting, sovereign debt become unsustainable, central bank always retain option – theory partly practice – monetise debt. the short-term implication monetisation sovereign credit risk replace inflation exchange rate risk. in words, currency country long consider good store value, either domestically externally. none constitute feasible scenario euro area, characterise unique combination centralise monetary policy-making largely decentralised, albeit closely coordinated, fiscal policy-making. this one-monetary-policy-and-many- fiscal-policies approach heart institutional arrangement govern interaction monetary fiscal policy euro area. importantly, treaty specifically exclude “fiscal dominance last resort”, due prohibition monetary financing. so implication this? rule possibility monetise sovereign debt turn rule inflation exchange rate risks. however, exclude possibility monetise debt bailouts countries, risk sovereign default could arise. furthermore, type risk may emerge financial market rather disruptive way, least compare risks, inflation exchange rate risks. the reason twofold. first, inflation risk may take time materialise factor in, even central bank monetise debt. second, financial market may find easy manage hedge inflation currency risk sovereign risk. the separation monetary fiscal policy may create non-linearities even multiple equilibrium price credit risk, turn may fuel self-fulfilling expectation precipitate crises. give role government bond play advance economies’ financial markets, instability may impair transmission monetary policy. this may justify target action central bank push market towards stable equilibrium. in general, lack fiscal dominance exposure sovereign risk promote overall good fiscal policies. this certainly case euro area countries. fiscal consolidation start already 2010, euro area general government deficit-to-gdp ratio debt-to-gdp ratio reach around 6% 85% respectively. this compare deficit 11.2% debt 92% us, deficit 9.5% debt 220.3% japan, deficit 10.4% uk debt 80%. further improvement fiscal situation euro area member expect current year, 2 bi central bankers’ speech euro area average come slightly 4%. the euro area debt-to-gdp ratio expect stabilise 2013 come thereafter. in euro area three country face severe problem regard market access. overall three country account 6% euro area gdp. i elaborate three cases, fact emerge midst bad economic financial crisis since world war ii. the solution three case entail specific role play fiscal authority respective countries, fiscal authority country support adjustment programme country ecb. some commentator say crisis strong coordination monetary fiscal policy desirable, even come expense reduce independence monetary policy. the opposite actually true. especially crisis responsibility monetary policy fiscal policy remain quite separate. the reason precisely crisis fiscal authority try push central bank towards solve fiscal problem inflation tax. however, central bank protect pressure statute rule adopt conduct monetary policy. in case ecb, rule specify lend sound institution appropriate collateral. the appropriateness collateral depend particular whether country stress follow rigorously imf/eu adjustment programme track regain market access. the soundness institutions, assess primarily supervisors, also key principle. it ensure adjustment programme envisage sufficient fund recapitalization bank system. these rule principle apply central bank ultimately protect taxpayer prevent monetary policy misuse bail insolvent governments. they constrain action central bank, also give sufficient flexibility react event crisis. there doubt rule cause frustration would instead like shift responsibility solve crisis entirely central bank, even crisis fiscal origin. it quite paradoxical people criticise ecb take many risk financial crisis also criticise oppose form debt restructuring. this group even suggest ecb stand ready accept, debt restructuring, signature default-rated government collateral. how contradiction possible? in view possible analysis partial rationale unclear. let give couple examples. one reason debt restructure – often make theoretical economist – help financial market function good eliminate moral hazard. the problem view totally omit broad impact markets. try eliminate moral hazard middle systemic crisis like shoot foot. think it: failure lehman brother make market work better, worse? do reduce moral hazard? another reason private sector involvement (psi) minimise taxpayer’s contribution penalise bad investments. this reason even le economically sound. lehman brothers’ failure prove psi apply wrong way, taxpayer end pay more. short-term speculative investor benefit perverse form psi, long term investor punished. that doesn’t sound clever me. have clear objective, case ecb price stability, help u consistent implement policy best interest taxpayers, give inflation ultimately tax. bi central bankers’ speech 3 the architecture euro area – clearly divide responsibility single monetary policy many national fiscal policy – offer strong protection taxpayers: treaty stability growth pact intend ensure sound fiscal policy guarantee independence eurosystem’s monetary policy. some strengthen institutional framework underlie stability growth pact need order avoid repetition problem currently experiencing. progress achieved, although much would hoped. however, look back, encourage note that, face difficult choices, political authority euro area always decide move forward, towards great integration solid foundation economic monetary union. the trialogue commission, council european parliament try finalize agreement strengthen fiscal discipline euro area, time next week’s ecofin council european parliament plenary meetings. the parliament ask reverse qualify majority council vote commission recommendation member state clearly unsound budgetary policy already preventive arm pact. this see member state reduction sovereignty rather way good protect negative impact undisciplined policy diverge countries. it also good protect euro. i hope council show courage leadership important endeavour. thank attention. bi central bankers’ speech 1 jean-claude trichet: interview the time interview mr jean-claude trichet, president european central bank, the times, conduct mr sam fleming 13 june 2011 publish 16 june 2011. * * * the times: there two camps: one

60 years. it could even bad crisis since world war i, central bank government take tough bold decisions. have public authority acted, would avoid major depression. i absolutely convince that. what reflect upon europe different important discussion reflection take place u japan. be sustainable long term path previous business model? it seem big advance economy – include uk – avoid embark strategic reflection global crisis. it surprise euro area, one big advance economies, reflect business model, governance measure reinforce resilience. what important bird’s eye view euro area give element rather encourage often perceived: euro area whole le indebted far le deficit yearly basis u japan. our current account balanced, growth rather encourage since recovery start third quarter 2009. a regard growth job creation, compare u le growth per caput create job since 1999. but time complacency respect. the big issue address strengthen surveillance economic policy member states. these economic policy important single currency area – fiscal policy one hand macroeconomic policies, include indicator imbalance competitiveness, hand. “economic union” improve considerably. that said, regard “monetary union”, twelve year launch single currency, i say euro there, credible maintain price stability even good expect almost observers. annual average inflation past 12 year le 2%, close 2%. this good euro area country last 50 years. a stable currency euro undoubtedly success. but greece, portugal, ireland even extent spain look say success germany northern europe deal change public services, unemployment levels, euro doesn’t feel like success. you judge euro area whole. i fully agree improve interaction national economic policy number domain surveillance centre; clear. it’s absolutely clear country like greece, example, long period growth largely artificial, boost unsustainable fiscal expansion. in case, correction period necessary bring economy back sustainable path. it clear large economy, also single currency area, extremely important prevent divergence dimension drive distortions. we aware issue inherent virtually vast continental economies. 2 bi central bankers’ speech a lot central bank emphasise fragility recovery, yet time ecb tighten policy. why different position between, example, feed bank england one side ecb other? it comment monetary policies. what i would say case important continue anchor solidly inflation expectations. we consider anchor important element way go crisis; avoid materialisation inflation risk normal time but, exceptionally difficult time since intensification crisis 2008, also materialisation deflationary risks. we word barack obama last week importance crisis well-handled, say well handle could serious consequence u economy. would share view? i particular comment president unite state said. what i would say important take appropriate bold decision cope private sector crisis, draw lesson financial crisis far financial regulation concerned, fully aware challenge address financial crisis public signatures. we ease idea heat crisis, country call spend much possible, embark deficit much possible. i believe tension observe europe today part much global phenomenon, namely pressure sovereign signature advance economies. the current tension euro area sovereign therefore euro area issue, also european aspect global aspect. in comparison emerge economies, advance economy cope real challenge regard fiscal policies. the projection suggest greek obligation official sector could couple outweigh greek obligation private sector. that underlie germany say private sector involvement. do accept logic? the position govern council, public, take decision domain. it first executive branch see want do. we tell embark compulsory way deal issue advisable. we tell anything would create credit event selective default default advisable. in case decision, take appropriate decision far eurosystem concerned, line statutory obligations. but again, say clearly avoid compulsion, credit event, selective default default. our position clear. do think compromise possible this? no comment. there story week ago greece consider withdrawal euro. ha anyone official position ever raise possibility? no. and likewise ireland portugal? correct. what would say would consequence thing? it work assumption anybody considers. you bailout fatigue germany austerity fatigue greece. do worry strain situation put compact democratic leader populations? bi central bankers’ speech 3 we live democracy fully respect functioning. it call ever communicate clearly possible people element situation economic financial diagnosis. it true countries, include adjustment programme contribute finance programmes. the aachen speech talk common european finance ministry: seem would eu27 idea. do worry like britain would see threat sovereignty? i mention explicitly would long-term perspective, call change treaty base assumption that, certain moment history, european would decide create new kind confederation sovereign nations. i say clearly today. we know today do. it would day tomorrow. for that, depend entirely people europe will. perhaps day tomorrow question also; see britain’s destiny join euro one day even seem unlikely today? i always say uk much welcome euro area depend entirely uk government people. it simple that. that said, even without uk 331m people, order magnitude us. again, uk welcome depend entirely uk decide. in case, i sure uk european country heart europe, means. doe latin american debt crisis offer lesson one? what strike see virtually country economy large problem past decade draw lesson problem become much resilient advance economy occasion last crisis 2007–08. for advance economy now, financial sector reform important make sector much resilient, also take account extremely unlikely democracy would put second time 27% gdp taxpayer risk table. it likely decision-making process democracy would allow u avoid another great depression exactly kind challenge. you author 3pc limit maastricht criterion and, confirm european parliament, even emphasise importance get fiscal side right. no one listened. why listen time? they pay high price practice benign neglect. we preach desert long period time. if i message today, would governments, euro area, particularly euro area, take fiscal policy very, seriously. not fiscal policy also monitor competitive indicators, monitor unit labour costs. the big lesson emerge read early experience join ecb role franc fort. how important benefit france evidently receive policy influence way approach job ecb? i france fervent advocate i call number colleague “competitive disinflation”: say inflation successive depreciation currency devaluation country don’t win strategy lose strategy. that main message “competitive disinflation”. i hear say europe face whole crisis competitiveness, vis-à-vis china instance. what germany succeed much west hasn’t, china provide huge wake-up call west. 4 bi central bankers’ speech you formidable challenge come emerge markets. the crisis reveal lot weakness advance economy accept reflect that. all advance economies, us, euro area, uk, single market eu-27, clearly major new challenge, adjust important role china, india, latin america emerge country global economy. the fact review business model obvious. a lot attention warrant appropriate flexibility economies. structural reform absolutely necessary. education, science research & development key success factors. the progressive diminish phd science technology many advance economy good sign. the growth catching-up emerge world exactly want world war two. it call u adapt permanently, perhaps rapidly would like. one impact rise emerge economy strain put resources. this also go put lot strain central bankers: central banker respond via monetary policy could secular long-term increase price raw materials? globalisation janus double face. you one hand formidable challenge volatile oil commodity prices. on hand formidable disinflationary trend manufacture goods, produce low prices. we deal simultaneous trend complex accelerate change relative prices. it formidable challenge central bank world, advance economy course. that something i trust central bank medium term vigilant, attentive. in long run, i tend optimistic. i train scientist beginning. i trust find technological way get rid incredible dependency fossil energy large number mineral commodities. it absolute must world, environment civilisation. i therefore trust deliver. what plan retire ecb? i plan. i see end mandate. at present moment i still close five month ahead quite lot challenge obviously. bi central bankers’ speech 1 deepak mohanty: indian economy – progress prospect speech mr deepak mohanty, executive director reserve bank india, harvard business school, boston, 27 september 2011. * * * the assistance provide dhritidyuti bose abhiman da acknowledged. it honour privilege speak harvard distinguish audience. i thank professor benjamin friedman professor tarun khanna opportunity. i speak indian economy. india home 1.21 billion people, 17.4 per cent global population. however, account 2.4 per cent world gdp u dollar term 5.5 per cent purchase power parity (ppp) terms. hence, exist huge potential catch up. the global welfare link progress india reflect keen global interest india. but, india seem inspire disappoint time. this reflect various comment indian economy. yasheng huang tarun khanna much debate article july 2003 issue foreign policy observed: “can india surpass china? this long silly question”. the july 23rd 2011 issue the economist observed; “twenty year ago say yardstick india measure potential. on measure, much do.” a fledgling democracy, india’s economic experiment plan development hold example many aspire low-income country 1950s. while country race ahead development process, india lag behind. this evident fact take 40 long year 1950–51 india’s real per caput gdp double 1990–91. but, 1991–92 define moment india’s modern economic history severe balance payment (bop) crisis prompt far reach economic reforms, unlock growth potential. a result, 15 years, india’s per caput income double 2006–07. if current pace growth maintained, india’s per caput income could double 2017–18, 10 year time. while acceleration india’s recent economic growth noteworthy, maintain pace, doubt, challenging. against background, i propose highlight key policy reform since 1991–92, review economic progress make far conclude reflection policy challenge way forward. policy reform post-1991 macroeconomic crisis 1991 mark turn point india’s economic history two reasons. first, fiscal deficit drive external payment crisis dip foreign exchange reserve us$ 1 billion july 1991 draw crisis resolution strategy restore macroeconomic stability. sharp correction fiscal deficit-gdp ratio reduce monetisation deficit contribute towards restore macroeconomic balance mid-1990s. the reduce dependence fisc monetisation enable reserve bank india reduce statutory pre-emption fund banks, thereby free resource private sector. second, simultaneously effort make towards wide range structural reform encompass area trade, exchange rate management, industry, public finance financial sector. an abide objective respect industrial policy measure since create competitive environment improve productivity efficiency. new industrial policy foster competition abolish monopoly restrictions, terminate phase manufacture programmes, free foreign direct investment import foreign technology de-reservation sector hitherto reserve public sector. these 2 bi central bankers’ speech measure create favourable environment industry upgrade technology build-up capacity import order cater grow domestic external demand. at present, five industry licensing, mainly account environmental, health, safety strategic considerations. only two industry reserve public sector, viz, atomic energy railway transport. reservation industrial product small scale sector still linger issue. however, definition small scale industry (ssi) change facilitate modernisation 20 item reserve manufacture small scale sector. foreign direct investment (fdi) 100 per cent allow automatic route sectors, exceptions. the infrastructure sector throw open private sector. consider large requirement fund infrastructure, 100 per cent fdi allow infrastructure sectors. there extend tax holiday enterprise engage business development, operation, maintenance infrastructure facilities. the emphasis public-private partnership (ppp) one prefer mode infrastructure project implementation. comprehensive fiscal reform cover tax reforms, restructure public sector undertake improve fiscal-monetary coordination eventually carry reform forward rule base fiscal consolidation path 2004–05, interrupt global financial crisis 2008–09. reduction custom duty year reflect india’s commitment towards converge towards asean level medium-term. the monetary policy framework associate operate procedure monetary policy india evolve time change underlie macroeconomic structure development financial markets. a landmark development abolition system automatic monetisation fiscal deficit april 1997, provide instrument independence reserve bank india conduct monetary policy. this, combine introduction auction system government securities, enable reserve bank switch direct indirect instrument monetary control. with open economy deregulation financial sector, stability money demand function become suspect. the reserve bank, therefore, switch monetary target framework, adopt mid-1980s, multiple indicator approach. under approach, various indicator rate return different markets, movement currency, credit, fiscal position, trade, capital flows, inflation rate, exchange rate, refinance transaction foreign exchange – available high frequency basis – juxtapose output data draw policy perspectives. this approach continue evolve presently augment version, wherein forward look indicator draw reserve bank’s industrial outlook survey, capacity utilisation survey, professional forecasters’ survey inflation expectation survey use macroeconomic assessment. the operate procedure monetary policy also undergo change overnight interest rate emerge operate target monetary policy. in financial sector, objective provide operational flexibility functional autonomy bank financial institution could allocate resource efficiently. some important initiative financial sector were: reduction statutory preemption release great fund commercial lending, interest rate deregulation enable price discovery, allow new private sector bank create competitive environment, dilution government hold public sector bank institution prudential norm capital adequacy, income recognition, asset classification, provision exposure norm strengthen health bank system besides improve transparency disclosure standards. the development financial market regard critical prerequisite improve operational effectiveness transmission monetary policy. during first phase financial sector reforms, various structural rigidity eased, bi central bankers’ speech 3 increase participation financial market well develop strengthen inter-linkages amongst market segments, foster competition. the focus various reform measure financial market ensure adequate liquidity various segment market spectrum, develop regulatory, legal, institutional technological infrastructure orderly function market activity. in second phase reforms, sophisticate financial instrument introduced. further, issue relate stability financial market receive priority policy agenda. the key objective external reform move open trade regime correct implicit anti-export bias. moreover, great recognition need view trade policies, exchange rate policy industrial policy integrate manner. in pursuance this, administer exchange rate regime give way flexible market-determined system. the exchange rate since guide underlie demand supply condition broad principle careful monitor management exchange rate flexibility, without fix preannounced target band. the trade policy reform comprise withdrawal quantitative restriction export imports, phase system import license low level dispersion nominal tariff bring par east asian economies. the peak custom tariff rate progressively bring 150 per cent 1991–92 10 per cent 2008–09. the liberalization restriction various external transaction lead current account convertibility article viii article agreement imf 1994. with respect capital account liberalization, india embark gradual well sequence open capital account. the active capital account management framework base preference non-debt create capital inflow like foreign direct investment foreign portfolio investment. the capital account virtually free non-residents resident corporates restriction financial institution high restriction resident individuals. economic progress post-1991 the initiation economic reform 1990s saw india gradually break free low growth trap euphemistically call “hindu growth rate” 3.5 per cent per annum. real gdp growth average 5.7 per cent per annum 1990s, accelerate 7.3 per cent per annum 2000s. a feature growth acceleration period growth rate industry service increase agriculture fell. this notable technological breakthrough “green revolution” mid-1960s saw sharp increase yield cereal production particularly northern part india. by 1990s, momentum “green revolution” die down. consequently, yield increase 2000s much low experience even 1990s. notably, decade 2000s encompass inflexion point growth trajectory annual average gdp growth 9 per cent 5-year period 2004–08. growth sub-sectors economy, include agriculture, accelerate period. however, growth process interrupt global financial crisis. subsequently, average growth slow 7.8 per cent 2009–11 noticeable slow agriculture industry. the growth dynamic alter structure indian economy decline share agriculture 28.4 per cent 1990s 15 per cent 2009–11. there correspond gain share services, include construction, 52 per cent 65 per cent period. what is, however, concern share industry remain unchanged around 20 per cent gdp. this suggest india’s growth acceleration last two decade dominate service sector. 4 bi central bankers’ speech the pace average annual industrial growth nevertheless pick 5.7 per cent 1990s 9 per cent 2004–08 interrupt global financial crisis (table 1). while share industry gdp remain stagnant, noteworthy structural transformation manufacture period. a process restructuring, gross value add organize manufacture increase 8 per cent per annum current prices, employment fell 1.5 per cent per annum 1995–2003. subsequently, 2004–09 gross value add growth accelerate 20 per cent per annum current prices; significantly, employment also increase 7.5 per cent per annum. with work participation rate 39.2 per cent, india workforce 400 million 2009–10. of this, 53 per cent agriculture rest 47 per cent non-agricultural activity. while bulk employment agriculture despite shrink share, noteworthy feature employment structure first time absolute workforce agriculture decline latter half 2000s (table 2). the overall unemployment rate economy also decline 8.3 per cent 2004–05 6.6 per cent 2009–10. not surprisingly, growth acceleration accompany sharp pick-up rate growth gross fix capital formation double annual average 7.2 per cent 1990s 15.7 per cent high growth phase 2004–08. it, however, drop significantly post-crisis period 5.8 per cent (table 1). bi central bankers’ speech 5 the structure indian economy also undergo change period term openness. the stereotypical view india close economy bear openness indian economy increase rapidly. export import good service double 23 per cent gdp 1990s 50 per cent recent period 2009–11. if trade flow consider alongside capital flows, rise openness (measured current receipt payment plus capital receipt payments) dramatic 42 per cent gdp 1990s 107 per cent recent period (table 3) empirical evidence suggest increase openness indian economy, trade industrial cycle get synchronise global business cycle. the high growth phase 2004–08 accompany sharp increase export import well capital inflows. net capital inflow percentage gdp double 2.2 per cent 1990s 4.6 per cent gdp 2004–08. subsequently, growth rate trade capital inflow moderate follow global financial crisis. the openness indian economy accompany improvement india’s external position debt gdp ratio fell 29 per cent 1990s 19 per cent recent period. the debt service ratio also decline 25 per cent 5 per cent period (table 4). the openness capital account result two-way movement capital sharp pick-up india’s outward fdi since mid-2000s (table 5). uptrend outward fdi mainly reflect large overseas acquisition deal indian corporates gain market share reap economy scale amidst progressive liberalisation external payment regime. 6 bi central bankers’ speech gradual improvement also observe fiscal position fiscal deficit moderate sharply high growth phase 2004–08, also coincide period switch rule base fiscal consolidation process. in fact, high growth phase 2004–08 saw primary surplus centre enhance debt sustainability. the deficit indicators, however, deteriorate recent period follow crisis induce fiscal expansion (table 6). the average save rate also show substantial increase 23 per cent gdp 1990s 31 per cent 2000s peak save rate 33 per cent achieve high growth phase 2004–08. fiscal consolidation help lift overall save rate public sector save rise significantly. the efficiency capital utilisation also improve incremental capital output ratio (icor) decline 3.7 high growth phase 2004–08 5 1990s. subsequently, however, capital efficiency decline post-crisis period (table 7). bi central bankers’ speech 7 the high growth achieve environment price stability headline wholesale price index (wpi) inflation drop annual average 5.5 per cent 2000s 8.1 per cent 1990s. there also similar drop consumer price inflation. subsequently, however, post-crisis period inflation trend reverse headline wpi inflation average 7 per cent consumer price inflation cross double digit 2009–11. the uptick food price inflation particularly sharp 2009–11 (table 8). during period, financial deepen indian economy also increased: broad money (m3) gdp ratio rise average 50 per cent 1990s 85 per cent recent period 2009–11. credit penetration, measure credit gdp ratio, also increase 21 per cent gdp 50 per cent period. the high growth phase 2004–08 accompany acceleration growth bank credit private sector 27 per cent per annum 15 per cent 1990s. however, high growth phase 2004–08, average increase m3 remain contain aid price stability. this make possible due deceleration banks’ investment government security 13 per cent per annum 2004–08 21 per cent 1990s. fiscal consolidation open space private credit expansion without exert much additional pressure monetary expansion (table 9). policy challenge the draft approach paper twelfth five year plan (2012–17) release august 2011 target annual gdp growth rate 9 per cent. this challenge unattainable. why? because india already achieve average growth rate 9 per cent 2004–08 interrupt global financial crisis. subsequently, average growth drop one percentage point 7.8 per cent 2009–11. in 2011–12, terminal year eleventh plan, growth expect 8 bi central bankers’ speech 8 per cent. hence, growth raise additional percentage point per annum challenge require conducive global environment policy reform home. while several task addressed, i focus six key issues. first, india raise agricultural productivity diversify agriculture fee population. the food entitlement increase public employment guarantee programme (mgnrega) guarantee 100 day employment one member family rural areas. this also give good bargain power labour consequently overall wage rate go raise demand food. while country currently sufficient foodgrains stocks, yet self-sufficient pulse oilseeds. further, demand protein base product like meat, egg, milk fish well fruit vegetable increase substantially rise income. the demand-supply mismatch case item result rise prices. there is, therefore, need another technological breakthrough give fresh impetus agriculture. at time, great emphasis place management supply chain investment rural infrastructure. the annual growth agriculture raise least 4 per cent current trend growth rate around 3 per cent. second, fact 53 per cent overall work force still engage agricultural sector – whose share gdp shrink considerably – worrisome. a substantial part labour force eject agriculture improve productivity agriculture also overall economy. it unconceivable absorb gainfully service sector. hence, industrial employment expand also relative contribution industry. this need focus attention see share industry overall gdp stagnate last two decades. in direction, government take major policy initiative create national manufacture investment zone (nmiz) increase sectoral share manufacture gdp 25 per cent 2022 double current employment level sector. good physical infrastructure, progressive exit policy, structure support clean green technologies, appropriate investment incentives, business friendly approval mechanism cornerstone new initiative. third, support industrialization increase economic activity, need step investment infrastructure. the assessment plan commission suggest investment `45 trillion (us $ 1 trillion) twelfth plan (2012–17). give large requirement long-term funds, finance infrastructure would big challenge. besides budgetary support, bulk fund emanate banks. however, channel domestic foreign financial save scale infrastructure require develop domestic private corporate debt market. apart need substantial financial outlay infrastructure, several non-financing constraints: particularly land acquisition delay need address avoid time cost overruns. fourth, need government revert rule-based pre-crisis fiscal consolidation path without compromise quality fiscal correction. this necessary obviate risk twin deficit raise overall save rate. this require reform tax structure ensure revenue buoyancy great focus quality expenditure emphasis reduction subsidy. in regard, major reform pipeline introduction integrate good service tax (gst) centre state reduce cascade effect improve tax compliance operationalisation direct tax code (dtc), improve allocative efficiency equity direct taxes. fifth, credit market have, historically, play crucial role sustain growth efficient intermediation fund saver investors. although india well-diversified financial system, several measure financial inclusion take recent past, credit penetration continue relatively low comparison several develop emerge market economies. the extent financial exclusion bi central bankers’ speech 9 stagger around 61 per cent population deposit account 10 per cent population credit account. the reserve bank embark plan make available basic bank service habitation population 2000 2012 combination brick mortar branch system business correspondent (bcs). accelerate economic growth depend access formal finance bulk population great credit penetration. sixth, empirical evidence suggest threshold level inflation range 4–6 per cent. hence, without bring inflation current level difficult sustain high level growth. this require great monetary-fiscal coordination alleviation supply constraints, particularly agriculture. conclusion envision india’s emergence major economic power world, dr. manmohan singh union budget 1991–92 speech launch wide range economic reform quote victor hugo’s saying, “no power earth stop idea whose time come”. ever since, look back india launch wide range structural reform make significant economic progress past two decades. india’s industrial environment become competitive open, infrastructural gap seek bridge public-private initiative domestic foreign source funding, current account become fully convertible capital account virtually free non-residents. the policy environment become enable rule-based commitment fiscal policy considerable instrument independence operation monetary policy. a statutory preemption reduce interest rate deregulated, bank gain operational autonomy commercial lending. a result, india’s per caput income, take four decade double 1991, double thereafter 15 year likely double 10 year 2017–18. if india could maintain current pace growth lift million poverty enrich global economy. while india come long way, maintain current pace would challenge require continue reform efforts. bi central bankers’ speech 1 prasarn trairatvorakul: overview global economy

speech dr jens weidmann, president deutsche bundesbank, american council germany, washington dc, 26 september 2011. * * * 1. introduction lady gentleman i would like thank american council germany give opportunity speak today. the american council germany found 1952 order encourage reconciliation understand germany north america follow two world war first half twentieth century. to day, objective enhance transatlantic understanding. this still important experience fast significant changes. the headwind generate global financial crisis still felt side atlantic rethink old certainty underway. in situation, crucial exchange ideas, re-examine perception one another foster mutual understanding. with mind, i would like talk germany’s role global economy, which, course, closely connect role member european monetary union. one thing people often associate germany export strength. and export sector certainly traditionally play important role german economy. however, german economy always perform solidly now. the past two decade see change pattern germany’s economic performance, major structural weakness follow boom reunification arduous ultimately successful process reform year followed. a popular individual german export product globally, germany sometimes face reproach export strength come expense global stability. critic either imply germany promote imbalance global level within euro area do bolster global demand. a i outline detail speech, difficult ultimately successful adjustment germany undergo past enable serve important buff global demand crisis indispensable anchor stability within emu, throughout crisis subsequent recovery. in order clarify points, i concentrate follow three aspects:  first, i shed light underlie factor behind persistent divergence price competitiveness within euro area, which, together past fiscal profligacy, large part responsible problem face today. in particular, i illustrate member state whose competitiveness deteriorate substantially since monetary union manage take advantage it.  second, i describe germany’s economic performance crisis recovery. in particular, i show germany serve import buff economic downturn follow financial crisis. now many country struggle recovery, dynamic upswing germany provide important impetus rest europe.  finally, i turn challenge european sovereign debt crisis pose germany. consider germany provide large part fiscal contribution euro area country refinance problems, confidence germany’s solvency vitally important current situation. germany therefore 2 bi central bankers’ speech set example implement sound fiscal policy within euro area. however, alone sufficient resolve sovereign debt crisis. to secure long-run stability within emu, significantly strong incentive sound public finance indispensible. 2. intra-emu divergence what critic actually mind talk germany’s export strength existence current account surplus contrast current account deficit emu member state country around world. i would like emphasise neither current account surplus current account deficit bad thing per se. current account surplus reflect net foreign lend current account deficit net foreign borrowing, depend circumstances, appropriate give country. for country decline working-age population, example, quite reasonable resident save money future invest share abroad. by compensate shrink income future, money save today allow consumption smooth time. conversely, country undergo catch-up process need finance investment might will promise borrower foreign funds. consequently, proper assessment take close look underlie driver current account surplus euro-area country current account deficit others. one worry development divergence current account balance mostly go hand hand divergence price competitiveness. whereas germany, surplus country, able improve price competitiveness significantly since launch euro, current account deficit greece, spain portugal less extent ireland accompany significant loss price competitiveness: the low interest rate bring monetary union inflowing capital partly fuel unsustainable developments, excessive credit dynamic real estate bubble spain excessive fiscal spend greece. the result domestic boom exist labour market rigidity lead large wage increase well excess productivity growth, trigger loss price competitiveness thereby impair export performance. current account deficit therefore ultimately symptom country live beyond means. the deficit decline ambitious often painful adjustment undertake bring economy back sustainable track. what germany? at first sight, germany’s gain price competitiveness since monetary union seem quite large. however, important bear mind increase follow period rather weak economic performance 1990s germany’s reunification boom. the recent competitiveness gain result impulse export consequence painful necessary ultimately successful adjustment process. an important part process restructure corporate sector, significantly enhance profitability firms. in addition, major long overdue policy reforms, namely labour market reforms, fiscal consolidation adjustment social security systems. consequently, contrast surplus countries, germany’s current account surplus certainly cause policy intervention aim boost exports. instead, result market-driven adjustment external pressure well overdue structural reforms. it true restructure process foster emergence current account surplus put strain domestic consumption. a restructure process temporary, however, german current account surplus expect reach pre-crisis level soon again. in addition, germany’s experience provide reassurance country face need restore competitiveness: structural reform initiate necessary adjustment pay end – thank reforms, german economy much strong year precede crisis before. bi central bankers’ speech 3 3. economic spillover crisis recovery not least reason, germany able serve anchor stability within emu throughout crisis well current recovery. because export strength, german economy affect particularly strongly global economic downturn trigger financial crisis. however, shock hit german economy phase structural strength temporary, negative effect contained. from today’s perspective know germany weather economic crisis comparatively well. the labour market weakly affect firm export sector choose reduce work time staff layoffs, whereas domestic economy le affect even continue increase employment. now unemployment rate even low crisis. in addition, germany profit previous consolidation efforts. the almost balance fiscal budget begin crisis allow scope implement sizeable fiscal stimulus programmes. a consequence, private consumption remain robust throughout crisis, explain germany able serve important buff world demand height financial crisis. in fact, huge downturn german economy largely drive decline exports: two third downswing attribute negative contribution foreign trade. have experience disproportionately strong decline crisis, export germany also benefit disproportionately revival global economic activity. so far, germany undergo sound process recovery. economic activity almost return pre-crisis level output gap closed, indicate recovery process advance stage. the recovery also broader-based past cycles. the positive labour market situation improve real wage income expectation private household support growth consumption, already resilient throughout crisis. and even though spillover effect growth germany country comparatively low, germany still serf important transmitter impulse global demand eu member states. most recently, german economic outlook dampen high overall uncertainty, especially regard development european sovereign debt crisis. but expect economic activity remain robust third quarter, even though expectation winter month subject considerable risks, prove soft patch. nevertheless, heighten danger financial market turmoil affect real economy. thus, crucial find prompt consistent political answer sovereign debt crisis order reduce downside risks. 4. fiscal discipline european sovereign debt crisis in addition robust economic conditions, germany anchor stability within emu high level confidence sustainability public finance well financial support country within emu currently lack confidence. while germany profit public finance comparatively good shape begin crisis, economic downturn necessary rescue measure bank crisis put serious strain national budget. the debt ratio increase 19 pp 84% gdp 2007 2010, mostly due support financial sector. give experience sovereign debt crisis, imperative sustain confidence public finances. this require credible consolidation effort kind commitment future steps. the debt brake, germany enshrine constitution, principally good mean achieve objective, legally bind politician obtain sound public finances. germany therefore set important example within emu i welcome aspiration france, spain, portugal italy follow example. this acknowledgement 4 bi central bankers’ speech importance sound fiscal policy. however, effectiveness national debt brake depend specific design case germany condition debt brake apply accord rules. a important effective national debt brake are, sufficient solve current sovereign debt crisis within euro area. to achieve this, need effective policy framework meet requirement stem unique nature emu. emu monetary union sovereign states, federal state common budget. this fundamental difference compare example unite states. it mean euro area country decide independently fiscal policy, high indebtedness one country affect member state effect common monetary policy. this harbour danger weaken incentive sound public finance individual country long carry full burden high sovereign debt themselves. ultimately, could even translate pressure monetary policy ease burden high public debt, example expansionary monetary policy use central banks’ balance sheet shift burden among member states. in order correct adverse effects, european monetary union found stability-oriented policy framework. this framework include legal provision preclude monetary finance governments, strict fiscal rule lay stability growth pact “no bail-out” clause, which, ensure country ultimately bear consequence fiscal policy, indispensable prerequisite sound public finance within euro area. the severity sovereign debt crisis member state imminent risk contagion member states, however, threaten financial stability within european monetary union whole. the european council therefore agree financial assistance grant country severe refinance problems, substantial part provide germany. this financial support intend buy time affect country conduct necessary structural reform implement consolidation measure order regain market participants’ confidence soundness public finance competitiveness. the assistance therefore bind adjustment programmes, recipient country fulfil. however, reduction interest payment financial aid weaken incentive country adjustment programme re-establish sound public finance via fiscal economic reform return capital market. furthermore, conditionality support measure loosen recent decision july 21st. this weaken underlie principle european monetary union country bear full consequence fiscal policy. contrary actually need order overcome sovereign debt crisis, risk see propensity excessive deficit rise even future. germany’s debate way forward crisis therefore motivate serious concern stability monetary union. we able regain stability within emu without re-establishing credibility framework. a fundamental political decision therefore needed: either exist policy framework emu change fundamentally incentive sound fiscal policy strengthen within exist framework. the first option would imply emu member state abandon substantial part national sovereignty fiscal policy would therefore require fundamental legal change european possibly also national level. the second option require return fundamental principle monetary union, member state bear consequence fiscal policy decisions. either option would sustainable economic point view. however, combine element options, ie share risk unsound fiscal policy retain national sovereignty fiscal policy, condemn failure. it would undermine incentive sound fiscal economic policy even further, thus achieve opposite stabilise monetary union. ultimately, approach would also credible financial market inconsistency raise doubt public political support. bi central bankers’ speech 5 5. conclusion let conclude speech germany’s role global economy caveats. in spite rather favourable performance crisis, germany face major challenges, overcome euro area’s sovereign debt crisis pressing. in addition, level public debt rise substantially throughout crisis. consequently, consider increase fiscal burden cause age society shrink working-age population, consolidation major task germany, too. it indispensable ensure long-term sustainability public finances. but unlike emu member states, germany still relatively favourable position. this combine fact germany continue important economic player despite global shift economic weight due, least, painful ultimately rather successful structural reform undertake past. it would short-sighted rely solely achievements. but could well serve encouragement reform-minded policymakers countries. and fact reforms, include emphasis fiscal soundness, contribute revitalise german economy increase resilience cause concern complaint. instead, see good news – germany, also emu global economy. bi central bankers’ speech 1 ravi menon: singapore’s approach regulation capital market keynote address mr ravi menon, manage director monetary authority singapore, thomson reuters 2nd pan-asian regulatory summit, singapore, 28 september 2011. * * * what capital market do? distinguish guests, lady gentlemen, good morning. and guest abroad, welcome singapore. two thousand year ago, ancient rome, enterprise contract government build temple collect taxes. the enterprise fund venture sell ownership equity stake form share readily transferable among romans. later, italian city state source fund citizen form bond finance wars, merchant seek finance individual procure good vessel sail ever increase distances. over time, market develop enable holder bond equity sell hold interest buyers. thus bear – call – capital markets. since early day imperial rome, capital market spread far wide across globe. but fundamental function capital market remain unchanged – allocate capital need transfer risk able bear it. it ability capital market efficiently mobilise financial resource make possible large investment need industrial revolution 18th century, risk capital fund global internet revolution recently. like markets, capital market prone volatility demand supply fluctuate. but unlike markets, turbulence capital market far wide consequence rest economy. from wall street crash 1929 global financial crisis 2008, see dislocation capital market devastate effect financial stability, economic growth, welfare citizens. capital market must therefore regulated, way unduly undermine efficiency effectiveness. this morning, i want share singapore’s approach regulation capital markets. why regulate capital market we think capital market ecosystem comprise four key components:  one, issuer – issue security raise capital;  two, investor – invest securities;  three, intermediary – advise issuer investor facilitate trade securities;  four, infrastructure – platform system security traded. each component ecosystem prone market failure – hence need regulate.  first, information asymmetry issuers/intermediaries investors, investor may unable make inform judgment financial products. 2 bi central bankers’ speech  second, principal-agent problem, intermediary may act best interest clients, investor issuers.  third, investor sometimes prone herd behavior, exaggerate price movement thereby precipitate market instability.  fourth, issuer intermediary take much risk liability cannot manage, loss confidence market instability.  fifth, critical infrastructure may fail, lead market instability. the purpose regulate capital market safeguard interest investors, ensure risk keep acceptable level, promote efficient price discovery, maintain confidence market. in singapore, regulatory framework capital market underpin security future act (sfa) financial adviser act (faa). consumer invest product deal entity regulate framework enjoy safeguard provide laws. together, sfa faa cover four component capital market ecosystem. issuer – dissemination material information let begin issuers. a key tenet capital market regulation relevant information transmit efficiently price formation discovery. like reputable regulators, ma impose stringent rule require issuer security disclose disseminate material information. we conduct ongoing surveillance market practice undertake rigorous enforcement action ensure compliance. disclosure the sfa require exchange develop rule reliable unhindered price formation discovery. first, disclosure must ongoing. post-listing, material information likely affect market price must disseminate timely organise manner. for example, company make acquisition likely material impact share price must immediately announce website singapore exchange. second, disclosure must accessible all. list company prohibit disclose material information individual selective basis. these disclosure requirement complement singapore’s statutory provision market manipulation insider trading. enforcement …. limitation issuer investor alike must confidence grind rule adhere transact markets. constant surveillance strict enforcement therefore critical. ma take serious view false statement omission material information mislead market. we hesitate impose stiff penalty issuer make mislead statement initial public offerings, ipos. but regulator totally prevent fraud misconduct. take instance experience s-chips, chinese company list sgx. many reputable company add breadth equity capital market. but not. since 2006, account irregularity outright fraud discover 14 company list sgx. most case come light auditor unable confirm companies’ cash account receivables. the counter suspend pending investigation special auditors, investor bear losses. i still get bi central bankers’ speech 3 letter investor lose money shares. i understand frustrations. many ask ma bring full force law bear wrongdoers. let state position categorically: ma leave stone unturned take rigorous action break laws. but real challenge fraud perpetrate party outside jurisdiction. cross-border investigation enforcement intrinsically difficult. singapore alone face challenge international listings. co-operation among security regulator enforcement agency different jurisdiction therefore critical. we cannot eliminate fraud. but must ensure company bring market good quality. sgx must rigorous evaluate suitability list applicant admit them. other stakeholder must play part too.  first, director company seek list must exercise adequate oversight internal control ensure veracity information disclosed.  second, ipo adviser legal professional responsibility conduct proper due diligence bring company public. they must healthy dose skepticism, never place commercial interest need ensure company suitable public listing. ma hesitate take adviser task poor due diligence work. if regulators, issuers, adviser job well, reduce likelihood poor quality company gain access markets. investor – safeguard interest this bring second component capital market ecosystem – investors. well-informed empower investor core well function capital market. investor lose confidence market disclosure mislead sell practice irresponsible. safeguard interest investors, particularly retail investors, therefore key focus ma regulation. but objective balance need investor take ownership investment decisions. a regulatory approach require issuer intermediary bear risk loss work. if investor expect loss always make good, moral hazard encourage reckless investing. ma safeguard interest investor five ways:  first, demand stringent disclosure information issuers;  second, require transparency information disclosed;  third, set standard intermediary sell investment product provide quality financial advice;  fourth, promote investor education, investor empower make inform decisions.  fifth, provide affordable accessible dispute resolution mechanism investor feel aggrieve investment process. let take aspect turn. 4 bi central bankers’ speech disclosure there nothing like disclosure instill market discipline. in word u supreme court justice louis brandeis, “sunlight say best disinfectants; electric light efficient policeman”. disclosure shin light see make inform decisions. investor entitle accurate timely disclosure material information ass risk reward investment. disclosure work investor understand every word disclosed. disclosure work facilitate scrutiny expert market; professional scrutiny act check issuer help inform broad investor base. take example ipo prospectus. it typically run hundred pages, detail description company’s business operations, competitive environment, governance practices, risk exposures, mention full set financial statements. most retail investor cannot easily digest information. but scrutiny prospectus analyst institutional investor help bring light significant weakness company. have say that, i must acknowledge great disclosure always improve understand investment products. while material relevant information must disclosed, tendency disclosure voluminous legalistic – often make purpose limit legal liability rather facilitate understand retail investors. ma therefore seek ensure information disclose adequate also transparent. transparency ma sharpen focus provide investor information clear concise manner aid understanding. early year, introduce new regulatory requirement product highlight sheet accompany offer investment product come prospectuses. it purpose convey key risk product information plain language simple question-and-answer format. let give example. in one recent prospectus, right investor cancel subscription within seven day spell two rather technical paragraph use total 170 words. in product highlight sheet, point make two simple sentences. financial advice the third aspect investor protection provision sound financial advice intermediary sell investment products. the fair deal guideline issue ma require intermediary conduct internal assessment ensure new product launch sale suitable target investor base. intermediary must also ensure representative competency understand explain product feature customers. ma introduce new rule require intermediary ass customers’ investment knowledge experience invest complex products. the rule come effect january 2012. where investor posse requisite knowledge experience, intermediary must provide appropriate advice. investor choose heed advice insist buy product assess unsuitable must take responsibility decision. this approach recognise investors’ capacity understand complex product uneven, respect right invest see fit. bi central bankers’ speech 5 over last two years, ma conduct survey inspection ass intermediaries’ delivery fair deal outcomes. we use find fine-tune guideline fair dealing. while ma take step ensure financial advisory industry able help investor make inform decisions, best way instill discipline industry investor demand good advice. singapore’s invest public seek good financial adviser prepare even advise buy unsuitable product. they prepare pay fee advice. investor education even best disclosure transparency, investor make inform decision knowledge skill so. this bring fourth area investor protection – education. the centerpiece singapore’s investor education effort moneysense national financial programme. it launch 2003 raise consumer understand basic money management, financial planning, investment products. through various seminar medium initiatives, moneysense reach large segment population since launch. in last year alone, moneysense event attract close 100,000 attendee medium initiative reach two million people. these event conduct industry practitioners, academics, investor advocates. to-date, money sense publish 230 educational article website media. more 30 consumer guide issue available online. while make steady progress, much need done. most singaporean sound save habit generally responsible manage credit, many still good understand common investment products. every month, ma receives, average, 10 complaint public involve sale investment products. i read many letters. sure enough, indeed case inadequate disclosure mis-selling, financial institution concern remedy. but others customer fail exercise basic due diligence. these painful letter read:  investor attract headline return purchase product without read product documentation;  investor willingly sign blank sheet product assessment form without realise buying;  investor insist buy risky product even though advise product suitable them. it difficult help case like these. ma continue explore way equip investor core financial capabilities. we currently study feasibility establish financial literacy institute complement exist moneysense initiative talk workshop reach large segment population. we also reach students, schools. the objective much instill technical expertise investment products, inculcate good money habit young age – prudent, alert risks, clear objective investing. 6 bi central bankers’ speech dispute resolution even well-informed consumers, occasional dispute sell investment product inevitable. hence final area investor protection provide affordable accessible dispute resolution mechanism aggrieve investors. ma set clear expectation financial institution must establish robust process resolve customer grievance independently, effectively, promptly. we also expect financial institution investigate rectify issue relate widespread complaint particular product sell practice. this dispute resolution mechanism within financial institution effective party dispute act fairly. financial institution must police relationship manager enforce internal guidelines. recently, alert case financial institution try salvage reputation deny relationship manager recommend highly risky investment product elderly retiree low risk tolerance. this acceptable. ma take firm action financial institution behaviour. on hand, investor make unreasonable demand expect financial institution accede them. for instance, consumer demand bank accept mobile text instruction reverse transaction message send day transaction executed. where dispute cannot resolve financial institution’s internal processes, investor approach independent financial industry dispute resolution centre (“fidrec”). fidrec provide access independent affordable dispute resolution process mediation adjudication. this provide consumer low-cost alternative litigation. fidrec award bind financial institution, investor choose reject award pursue option recourse. intermediary – safety market conduct i turn next key component capital market ecosystem – intermediaries. the objective regulation respect capital market intermediary twofold: safety soundness, market conduct. safety soundness we want intermediary safe sound, interest preserve systemic stability. intermediary connect various part capital market ecosystem. they stand buyer sellers, underwrite risks, act counterparties risk transfers, participate member clear houses. the failure major intermediary transmit risk across system, cause severe market disruption undermine confidence. l forget, lehman brother principally security firm, bank. ma regulation cannot rule failure intermediary. but seek ensure orderly winding-down process. the segregation customers’ fund intermediary’s fund key feature regulatory regime. unlike bank freely deploy deposit collect, capital market intermediary require segregate customers’ asset monies. this act safeguard customers’ fund intermediary fail. fund manager require appoint independent custodian fund valuation firms, subject regular audits. bi central bankers’ speech 7 market conduct the second regulatory outcome expect intermediary fair conduct. trade give false mislead appearance market activity, action rig price security futures, prohibit law severely deal with. ma work closely commercial affair department take enforcement action range civil penalty criminal action. last year saw fruition mas’ first civil penalty court action. we secure civil penalty fund manager find high court window-dress portfolio create false appearance relate price one component shares. the fund manager ceo order pay civil penalty s$250,000 mas, well cost court action. the decision uphold court appeal. the assistance sought, obtained, foreign counterpart vital success case. similarly, ma stand ready assist international counterpart enforcement efforts. early year, australian authority successfully prosecute former fund manager australian bank insider trading. ma refer case australian security investment commission (asic) provide ongoing assistance asic’s investigations. infrastructure – sound stable the final component capital market ecosystem infrastructure support trade security futures. capital market participant trade either multilateral basis organise exchanges, bilaterally over-the-counter otc. exchange the singapore exchange singapore mercantile exchange operate systemically-important security future market singapore. they constitute critical infrastructure must function properly preserve stability efficiency. our law require exchange maintain sufficient financial, human system resources, framework process manage risks, regulate supervise participants. otc derivative the otc derivative space traditionally preserve sophisticate financial institution well place ass negotiate trade among themselves. these financial institution regulate ma risk associate otc derivative position take account respective regulatory framework institutions. otc derivatives, unlike standardise counterpart future markets, enable customise hedge risks. properly employed, confer significant benefit financial intermediation process hence wide economy. for example, interest rate swap enable company convert float rate loan fixed-rate loans. company large capital investment long horizon, airlines, ship company infrastructure builders, rely interest rate hedge tool manage financial risks. but rapid growth otc derivative globally, weakness market structure contribute build-up systemic risk. we saw global financial crisis. the interconnectedness otc derivative market participant limit transparency counterparty risk trigger rapid contagion. under stress market conditions, potentially threaten stability financial system. 8 bi central bankers’ speech the g20 call change improve transparency mitigate risk otc derivative markets. the financial stability board make recommendation four key thrusts. singapore fully commit implement recommendations. the first thrust standardise derivative contracts. ma work singapore foreign exchange market committee encourage standardisation derivative products. the committee formulate code conduct financial institution operate otc market. the second thrust reform mandate central clear standardise contracts. central clear mitigate systemic risk multilateral net ensure failure counterparty affect participants. since 2006, sgx operate clear facility otc derivatives, cover derivative contract commodities, energy freight. it start clear interest rate swap november last year, clear foreign exchange forward end year. but comprehensive implementation central clear without challenge. we need determine carefully product mandatory central clearing, particularly employ commercial end-users. the cost clear potentially increase hedge cost, cause cut-back need investment increase unhedged positions. we also need mindful central clear remove counter-party risks, add concentration risks. it therefore critical central clear platform subject robust supervision ensure manage risk effectively. to extent platform operate across geographical borders, appropriate arrangement cooperation among national supervisor must place. the third thrust move derivative trade platform appropriate. this help improve price transparency. singapore major centre exchange-traded derivative asia. we well place move derivative trade organise platforms, extent would take account local context, product characteristic participant profiles. the fourth thrust report trades. mandatory trade report enhance supervision derivative market address information gaps. for effective, regulator need timely access relevant data aggregated. this require cross-border supervisory cooperation data access harmonisation report requirement standards. but national concern lead jurisdiction set trade repositories, could make data aggregation challenging. ma assess need local repository appropriate regulatory regime avoid duplication. in recent months, notion quarter tight regulation propose otc derivative u eu, activity flow centre asia purportedly le tightly regulated. this mistaken. lead centre asia – like singapore, hong kong, australia – much part g20 initiative room regulatory arbitrage. ma fully engage otc work fsb, international organisation security commissions, committee payment system settlements. we fully implement otc derivative reform agenda. there must consistency implementation across jurisdictions, cannot precise equivalence. the otc derivative landscape asia singapore differ considerably u europe. we small market le complex derivative instruments. we consider implement g20 reform effectively take account enforcement issue characteristic markets. ma consult industry proposal otc derivative market reform end year. we aim meet g20 target implement reform end-2012. bi central bankers’ speech 9 conclusion – share responsibility let conclude. in regulate capital markets, deal particular industry particular type institution. we try create condition within essentially ecosystem, risk manage economic benefit sustained. but benefit cannot achieve regulation alone. a winston churchill put it, “if ten thousand regulation destroy respect law”. there limit far regulation go without undermine compliance, mention efficiency innovation. all component capital market ecosystem must play part. a well-functioning capital market share responsibility. if stakeholder part well, fair efficient capital market everyone confidence in, also make singapore competitive vibrant financial hub asia. thank attention. bi central bankers’ speech 1 ben s bernanke: lesson emerge market economy source sustain growth speech mr ben s bernanke, chairman board governor federal reserve system, cleveland clinic “ideas tomorrow” series, cleveland, ohio, 28 september 2011. * * * good afternoon. i please participate cleveland clinic’s “ideas tomorrow” series. my public remark often concern short-run economic developments, important place shorter-term development context powerful long-term trend shape global economy. of trends, surely one important rapid sustain economic growth achieve emerge market economies. today, measure least, develop emerge market economy account one-half global economic activity, substantially le one-third 1980.1 today i discus experience emerge market teach u source economic growth conclude think prospect future growth critical part global economy. among emerge market economies, asian “growth miracle” is, course, conspicuous success story, case china particularly dramatic. over past three decades, growth chinese output per person average roughly 9 percent year, put per caput output 13 time high 1980. the economy korea, another east asian success story, expanded, average, good 6 percent annual rate past 30 years. growth latin america moderate, continent make substantial economic progress well, notably term low inflation great economic stability. more recently, pace recovery emerge market economy global financial crisis impressive. in short, past decade emerge market economy make significant stride raise live standards. hundred million people benefit progress, many million lift poverty.2 to sure, gap advance economy remain substantial, narrow significantly. these development raise question: how emerge market economy achieve strong result recent decades? the answer complex, course, i scratch surface issue today; i hope lay key theme provide food thought. foster growth develop economies: washington consensus ironically, rapid growth emerge market economy reflect part low level development began. in economic-growth derby, contrast type 1 base gross domestic product (gdp) data international monetary fund (imf), valuation country’s gdp base purchase power parity exchange rates. the emerge market develop economy group use include imf’s classification newly industrialize asian economies. there consensus definition emerge economies, contrast develop economies, generally speaking, emerge market economy define economy low- middle-income category advance rapidly integrate global capital product markets. emerge economy account rise share develop emerge economy global output, focus speech. 2 accord data world bank development indicators, 2011, 500 million few people live $1.25 day poverty line 2005 25 year earlier. 2 bi central bankers’ speech competitions, start far behind advantages. for example, else equal, domestic foreign investor attract high return receive investment capital relatively scarce, generally case poor countries. in 19th century, unite state draw capital world finance railroad construction; although investment pay off, overall help generate enormous increase wealth reduce transport cost foster economic integration within north american continent. similarly, emerge market economy recent decade attract substantial foreign investment new manufacture capacity, part take advantage low labor costs. develop country also advantage able import adapt production technology already use advance economies. and, indeed, empirical study find tendency country start behind grow fast begin high incomes.3 however, much national regional variation growth rate explain initial economic conditions. notably, emerge asian economy tend outperform, relative would predict base solely level income per person, say, 30 year ago. and poor countries, include number africa, continue grow relatively slowly. so factor – economic policy – differentiate successful performer le successful? a classic attempt generalize policy best promote economic growth development, useful start point discussion, so-called washington consensus, articulate economist john williamson 1990.4 write latin america, williamson outline list 10 broad policy promote economic development judge commanding, time wrote, substantial support economist policymakers. because view influential major institution like world bank locate washington, set policy dub washington consensus. williamson’s original list recommendation usefully divide three categories: first, step increase macroeconomic stability, reduce fiscal deficit (which cause high inflation many countries), broaden tax base, reallocate government resource build human physical capital; second, action increase role market economy, privatization public assets, appropriate deregulation, liberalization trade, interest rates, capital flows; third, effort strengthen institution promote investment, business formation, growth, particularly enhance property right rule law. aspect washington consensus stir considerable controversy past two decades.5 williamson view consensus attempt synthesize conventional wisdom economist policymakers time, roadmap comprehensive strategy development. i introduce framework 3 the idea level output per caput tend converge across countries, turn imply country initially poor tend grow fastest, know research literature “absolute convergence.” a sophisticate variant idea “conditional convergence,” hold convergence across country hold control appropriately factor affect long-run level output country, domestic save rate rate population growth. empirical analysis generally find somewhat mix evidence absolute convergence fairly robust support conditional convergence. see, example, barro sala-i-martin (2004) durlauf, johnson, temple (2005). rodrik (2011) others argue recently absolute convergence hold disaggregated level manufacture sector. 4 williamson initially articulate washington consensus speech 1989, first write version appear williamson (1990). see also williamson (2004) view various interpretation give recommendations. 5 example critique washington consensus include burki perry (1998), rodrik (2006), birdsall others (2010). bi central bankers’ speech 3 nice summary prevail view 20 year ago, time dramatic growth emerge market still lay several year future. by compare current view describe williamson 1990, accept many, may learn something idea hold modify refute recent events. i take turn three group policy make washington consensus. the first group recommendations, i noted, comprise policy aim increase macroeconomic stability. in case little controversy. abundant evidence link fiscal discipline, low inflation, stable macroeconomic policy environment stronger, longer-term growth emerge advance economies.6 in particular, many emerge market economy 1990s emulate success advance economy 1980s control inflation. over years, emerge market economy also improve fiscal management point fiscal position often favorable advance economies. improvement macroeconomic management particularly strike latin america, large budget deficit high inflation rate produce costly swing economic activity previous decades. brazil, example, suffer hyperinflation 1986 1994, several year inflation well excess 500 percent, maintain average annual inflation rate 5 percent since 2006, (not coincidentally) reduce ratio budget deficit gross domestic product. discipline macroeconomic policy also support growth emerge market foster domestic savings, stimulate capital investment (including foreign direct investment), reduce risk financial instability. the second group recommendation list williamson emphasize need great reliance markets: free economy privatization, deregulation, liberalization. the basic idea hold pretty well; observer today would agree carefully manage liberalization – substitution market bureaucratic control economy – necessary sustain growth. for example, trade liberalization measures, reduction tariff removal control export imports, key element growth strategy number fast-growing emerge market economies, include china.7 openness inflow foreign direct investment help many emerge economy import foreign management technique technology well attract foreign capital. more generally, great use market improve allocation resources, create incentive efficient form production, encourage entrepreneurship innovation. however, i discus moment, experience also show success reform program may depend crucially transition great market orientation managed, particular market reform sequenced, issue washington consensus largely silent. the third part washington consensus focus strengthen property right rule law – example, effective enforcement contracts. the evidence suggest factor important development.8 for example, inability establish clear title land build inhibit entrepreneurship investment 6 fischer (1993) easterly (2001) document poor growth associate high inflation, large budget deficits, distort foreign exchange markets. durlauf, kourtellos, tan (2008), emphasize technique take account model uncertainty, also find considerable support importance stable macroeconomic policies. fatas mihov (2009) establish stability policy relevant robust determinant cross-country difference growth. easterly levine (1997) link much plight africa macroeconomic instability. 7 see, example, chapter 5 world bank (2005). early study document importance trade openness growth include sachs warner (1995, 1997) frankel romer (1999). 8 for example, kaufmann others (2002) provide evidence link economic development presence institution promote rule law. 4 bi central bankers’ speech poor countries. on hand, critic fault washington consensus pay insufficient attention role economic growth much broad range institutional factor property right alone – standardize account conventions, political accountability, control corruption, bankruptcy laws, capable transparent regulatory agencies, example.9 moreover, washington consensus provide little specific advice create sustain strong institutional framework, touch variety institutional arrangement – central bank independence one familiar example – show promote economic stability growth.10 amend washington consensus overall, key element washington consensus appear well support basic economic logic successful application number countries. however, experience past two decade also suggest lesson augment modify think know economic development 1990. i highlight three specific lessons. first, implementation washington consensus recommendation important straightforward practice. in particular, i allude earlier, sequence reform matters. for example, develop countries, follow principle liberalization deregulation, remove control inflow foreign capital, foreign investor respond pour funds. however, bank system associate regulatory supervisory agency country always well prepare manage capital inflows. consequently, foreign capital badly invested, turn contribute emerging-market financial crises, like mexico emerge asia 1990s. this experience suggest measure strengthen bank bank regulation put place domestic market open capital flow abroad. similarly, dismantle control domestic financial industry prove counterproductive important complementary factor – effective bank supervision, availability bank manager train market-based lending, consumer familiarity financial product credit card – absent. for example, korea experience mini financial crisis early 2003, result massive run-up household debt. in wake policy change liberalize increase competition domestic financial markets, credit card debt korea share gross domestic product triple 1999 2002, average number credit card every adult country rise 1 3. korea’s consumers, lenders, regulator little experience credit cards, institutional arrangement share data consumer credit, include credit reports, inadequate. not surprisingly, least retrospect, delinquency rate soared, put solvency number country’s major financial institution risk. the broad lesson institutional arrangements, range account rule regulatory framework tax-compliance tools, must sufficiently develop ensure reform successful. fortunately, even absence clear consensus best sequence implement reforms, many country successfully promote growth slow pragmatic continue process liberalization. 9 burki perry (1998) rodrik (2006) among argue washington consensus sufficiently emphasize development institutions. 10 on lack specific advice create proper institutional framework, see, example, rodrik (2011). on benefit central bank independence, see, example, alesina summer (1993) cukierman others (2002). bi central bankers’ speech 5 a second important lesson past two decade involve pivotal role technology economic development. for emerge market economies, tend lag behind technological sophistication, rapid gain productivity achieve adapt state-of-the-art technology already develop advance economy rather develop technology scratch. but successful import technology happen automatically without preparation. for example, strong educational system produce increasingly skilled workforce prove crucial climb technological ladder. in unite states, substantial increase educational attainment begin 20th century period follow world war ii instrumental drive economic growth.11 in emerge market world, india’s information technology (it) service industry thrive large part country’s large supply well-educated, english-speaking workers. and high education matters. encourage basic level literacy critical well. promise program emerge market countries, brazil mexico, provide modest amount money poor family (generally women) condition child attend school regularly receive basic health care. the evidence suggest program enhance quality economy’s labor forcewhile address social goal reduce gender income inequality. many emerge market economy also harness international trade engine technical progress. openness trade allow country import state-of-the-art capital goods, vigorous international competition increase efficiency domestic firm facilitate transfer skill knowledge. international trade also help shift economy away basic agriculture toward manufacturing, substantial benefit average productivity. these benefit trade openness require large trade surpluses, way, willingness engage integrate global economy. notably, korea run current account deficit much “growth miracle” phase. a third important lesson come sharp focus, fully appreciate washington consensus, involve capacity draw economy scale accelerate pace technical progress economic growth. economy scale refer efficiency gain achieve industry production run large scale. these gain may arise nature technology involve – as, example, steel manufacturing.12 but case also arise need develop critical mass skilled worker specialize suppliers. it coincidence many high-tech firm locate near california’s silicon valley north carolina’s research triangle; firm benefit ability draw sufficiently large pool skilled labor resources, share idea information mutually beneficial ways.13 a single, isolate firm would likely productive. thus, scale economy arise development knowledge centers, like research universities, build large-scale infrastructure, like national highway system.14 for example, india’s it industry cluster certain regions, bangalore, 11 research goldin katz (2001) emphasize importance u.s. high school system drive country’s growth first decade 20th century. the state-supported university system educational subsidy g.i. bill boost educational attainment growth world war ii. (see, example, altschuler blumin (2009).) it note increase share public budget devote education advocate washington consensus. 12 in case call “natural monopolies.” 13 this idea whereby economy scale continuously exploit share idea “learning-by-doing” one source call “endogenous growth” economics literature. see, example, romer (1986) lucas (1988). while idea “natural monopolies” well understand time washington consensus come out, “endogenous growth” literature infancy. 14 see, example, barro (1990). 6 bi central bankers’ speech around successful high-quality institute technology country. moreover, recent research suggest growth information technology activity india increase return school significantly increase primary school enrollment area call center located.15 encourage international trade also help country capture benefit scale. for many emerge market economies, domestic market large enough support amount production need achieve efficiency gains. access global market enable production expand level economy scale could fully exploited. additional efficiency sometimes gain country specialize particular stage good’s production. they import part component country use produce new products, may process assemble still countries. at stage, production world market rather domestic producer consumer alone. many asian economy interlink network vertical supply chains; china often refer endpoint global supply chain assembly many good complete ship consumer around world. the existence economy scale may, circumstances, also create rationale target government intervention economy – words, industrial policy. the premise industrial policy large-scale industry may able get grind without government support protection, give substantial start-up cost existence more-efficient competitor countries. indeed, government support certain industry seem play role several best-performing emerge market economies, include china korea.16 but intervention double-edged swords. the experience many decade tell u industrial policy far sure-fire development strategy, require government adept pick winners. one example, role government intervention promote ethanol production brazil, illustrate vagary industrial policies. after introduce mid- late 1970s, several year program generally view failure. more recently, however, sustain upward trend world oil price turn ethanol production brazil profitable venture.17 but many cases, similar intervention fail crowd development other, potentially profitable industries. lesson implication future what implication draw longer-term prospect growth emerge market economies? notwithstanding recent impressive growth, output per person emerge market economy generally remain much low advance economies. this fact suggest emerge market economy able maintain relatively high growth rate year come, continue catch advance economies. but time, emerge market country become wealthy technologically sophisticated, gradually lose advantage start behind. even continue strong policies, growth slow return capital investment diminish profitable opportunity exploited.18 for example, time, rise wage manufacture make production investment china 15 see oster millet (2011). 16 rodrik (2010), example, discus china’s case. 17 after 1989, ethanol subsidy brazil removed, form indirect government support maintained. 18 recent research eichengreen others (2011) draw cross-country evidence show pace country’s economic growth tend slow level real per caput income cross certain threshold. bi central bankers’ speech 7 east asian nation le attractive. also, technological progress slow process import foreign technology reach limits, force great reliance innovation emerge country themselves. resource environmental constraints, well age populations, also slow economic growth. but many ways, slowdown growth inevitable result progress – culmination successful catch process – respect view consequence success, failure. many emerge market also challenge reliance trade drive growth. a i discussed, international trade many benefits. however, generate trade surplus suppress domestic demand defeat ultimate purpose economic growth – improve lot country’s citizens. large persistent imbalance trade also inconsistent, long run, global economic financial stability. of course, advance economies, like unite states, need part well reduce global imbalances, i note numerous occasion before. in fact, emerge market economy account large grow share global activity, many long view small, open economy whose action little effect neighbors. with increase size influence come great responsibility. in response new reality, many international institution restructure recent year give increase voice emerge market economies. for example, group twenty (which significant emerge market representation) largely supplant group seven premier global forum economic financial policy matters, emerge market economy give increase power set policy international monetary fund. these forum use advance economy emerge economy alike meet respective responsibility global economy spirit cooperation. so, lesson draw washington consensus and, generally, experience dynamic emerge market economy past decades? ultimately, principle john williamson enumerate two decade ago much recommend them. macroeconomic stability, increase reliance market forces, strong political economic institution important sustainable growth. however, experience perspective past 20 years, see williamson’s recommendation complete. reform must sequence implement appropriately desire effects. and successful development framework must take account activity adaptation advance technology harness economy scale often critical economic growth depend host institutional conditions, educate workforce, fully effective. indeed, advance economy like unite state would well re-learn lesson experience emerge market economies, importance discipline fiscal policies, benefit open trade, need encourage private capital formation undertake necessary public investments, high return education promote technological advances, importance regulatory framework encourage entrepreneurship innovation maintain financial stability. a advance economy look way enhance longer-term growth, re-reading williamson’s original washington consensus, combine close attention experience successful emerge market economies, could pay significant dividends. reference alesina, alberto, lawrence h. summer (1993). “central bank independence macroeconomic performance: some comparative evidence,” journal money, credit banking, vol. 25 (2), pp. 151–62. altschuler, glenn c., stuart m. blumin (2009). the gi bill: a new deal veterans. new york: oxford university press. 8 bi central bankers’ speech barro, robert j.

(1883), “anton martin schweigaards barndom og ungdom” (anton martin schweigaard’s early years), p.t. mallings boghandels forlag 2 bi central bankers’ speech unilateral stabilisation krone various currencies. since 2001, objective monetary policy low stable inflation. rather stabilise value money indirectly exchange rate target, aim attain direct objective believe monetary policy achieve time. the operational target monetary policy annual consumer price inflation close 2½ per cent time. monetary policy shall also contribute stabilise output employment. in respect, inflation target flexible. the inflation target symmetrical – important avoid inflation rate low inflation rate high. the inflation target provide economic agent anchor inflation expectations. decision concern save investment base assumption inflation norway around 2½ per cent time. norge bank’s instrument meet inflation target key policy rate, interest rate banks’ deposit norge bank. this interest rate form basis banks’ lend deposit rates. bi central bankers’ speech 3 the bank’ monetary policy assessment decision must base knowledge obtain interaction within norwegian economy interest rate interacts. but need methodical apparatus structure knowledge. like central banks, norge bank us economic model aid monetary policy analysis. economic model help u interpret historical developments, make forecast future analyse effect interest rate. for economic model relevant, must fit intend purpose. a model use aid make interest rate decision require different attribute base different principle model example seek provide optimal near-term inflation output forecasts. in chart, time axis divide three: short term, medium term long term. there sharp divide line horizons. nonetheless, time horizon impose various requirement economic theory model purposes. the starting-point analysis important. current statistic anecdotal information serve basis provide indication economy evolve present. but information set uncertain. statistic publish lag often revised. data different source provide different picture situation hand. statistical model provide u good support help distinguish news noise data. they capture time series property data correlation many case able produce good forecast development month ahead. there certain similarity project development norwegian economy come month forecast weather. meteorologist observe average forecast large number model generally produce accurate forecasts. to project consumer price inflation come quarters, bank develop system average forecast 170 different statistical models, intend project inflation norwegian economy near term.3 the model weight determine basis historical accuracy continually adjust model good predictive power give great weight 3 the model group three classes: factor models, indicator model var models. the model within class may contain different variable variant one another. for detail discussion, see aastveit, k.a, k. gerdrup, a.s. jore (2011) “short-term forecast gdp inflation real time: norge bank’s system average models”, staff memo 9/2011, norge bank 4 bi central bankers’ speech subsequent round. the bank similar system include almost 250 model forecast mainland gdp. the projection system model extend four quarter ahead time publish regular interval bank’s website. we call apparatus sam (system average models). for projection slightly long horizons, bank part company weather forecasters. while meteorologist unlikely influence weather predictions, norge bank’s interest rate set actually influence economic development medium term. this place particular demand system analysis involve demand sole purpose make forecasts. norge bank develop norwegian economy model (nemo), use aid draw one-year-ahead four-year-ahead forecasts. nemo model analyse fluctuation norwegian economy around long-term trend. in medium term, economy may period deviate substantially trend, refer cyclical fluctuations. when fluctuation subside, must assume economy move towards equilibrium. the long-term trend determine monetary policy, assumption regard technological development supply labour capital. when set interest rate, give weight current situation outlook two three year ahead. the statistical model help u understand current situation, equilibrium property frame analysis. nemo describe interest rate set bring economy current starting-point back long-term equilibrium path. a support tool make monetary policy decisions, model apparatus thus particularly relevant. i come back main feature nemo later. a i mention earlier, norge bank operate formal monetary policy mandate. the bank’s objective stabilise inflation provide economy nominal anchor. a minimum, economic model use support interest rate decision base assumption monetary policy steer inflation. economic agent expect look ahead make consumption investment decisions. it current economic policy likely matter them, also expect future. expectation must therefore incorporate play role monetary policy model. bi central bankers’ speech 5 many economist previously hold view unemployment could reduce accept slightly high inflation time. monetary policy orient accordingly inflation accelerate many countries, without sustain decline unemployment. it turn bring rise inflation control involve substantial real economic costs. in past 20 years, inflation consistently low stable. economic growth high, higher, since inflation come low level, compare year inflation high time double-digit levels. for model relevant build long-term relationship believe valid consistent data. for example, model’s relationship describe interest rate works, line relevant empirical observation norwegian economy. it also considerable importance u economic mechanism model understandable easy communicate. the model apparatus function useful tool, internal process ahead monetary policy meet norge bank’s external communication. 6 bi central bankers’ speech a model never able provide exhaustive description reality. in 1979, british statistician george box stated: “essentially, model wrong, useful”. model help identify key drive force ensure valid line reason consistency time. this enable model play important role analytical basis interest rate setting. at time, must use common sense experience evaluate model-based result supplement result professional judgement. in respect, bank pragmatic attitude regard use models. before i discus norge bank’s suite model great detail, i would like look key macroeconomic variable interaction. study fundamental statistical relationship provide important insight function economy. along theoretical foundation, insight one important build block good analytical apparatus implement monetary policy. let begin take look relationship output inflation. in recent years, consumer price inflation (cpi) fluctuate 0 3 per cent. mainland gdp growth also fluctuated, give rise economic cycles. the chart show development two variable measure deviation long-term trend growth, word “inflation gap” “output gap”.4 when output gap positive, 4 the gap express deviation estimate trend seasonally adjust figure mainland gdp cpi adjust tax change exclude energy product (cpi-ate), respectively. the trend estimate use hodrick prescott (hp) filter quarterly data λ=40000. the output gap analysis technical estimate fully correspond output gap norge bank’s monetary policy report. bi central bankers’ speech 7 economy usually upturn, economy downturn gap negative. the blue line chart show gdp growth markedly high trend growth latter half 1990s period 2003 2008, rise somewhat slowly period follow financial crisis. when development output compare inflation, pattern emerges. a pickup gdp growth consistently occur 4–5 quarter rise inflation.5 while chart say nothing causality, turn point gdp growth seem fairly reliable lead indicator turn point inflation. the path change output inflation pass labour market, among others. we see economic growth pick up, unemployment6 decline one two quarter thereafter. the relationship “output gap” “unemployment gap” fairly strong. this useful observation gdp figure publish considerable lag often subject revision, unemployment data publish end month revised. if uncertainty gdp figure – often may – fall unemployment indication recovery economic growth. labour market developments, turn, affect wage growth, illustrate blue line chart. high unemployment result low wage growth, vice versa. the chart show period fall unemployment, wage growth7 move fairly rapidly. change unemployment appear fairly immediate impact wage growth. 5 the correlation two data series high output gap defer 4–5 quarter future. 6 unemployment measure accord lf 7 mainland hourly wage growth quarterly national account 8 bi central bankers’ speech not unexpectedly, also close statistical relationship wage growth rise price domestically produce goods. it appear take one year change wage growth fee inflation. such observation data provide picture interrelationship economy, say little causality interest rate fee economy. correlation nevertheless interest background analytical tool use interest rate setting. historically, interest rate set response various development shocks. in respect, interest rate endogenous variable, say dependent economic variables. the relationship interest rate key variable history also influence shift monetary policy objectives. let u look two different situations. in first, unexpected sharp rise inflation. in response, interest rate could raise bring inflation again, curb growth household corporate consumption investment. in second, sudden sharp pickup demand good services. the interest rate might raise case order prevent inflation rise late stage. in historical data, high interest rate go hand hand low growth high growth. it demand identify effect interest rate change study historical data series. trygve haavelmo, nobel prize winner former professor department economics, call problem identification. bi central bankers’ speech 9 in order analyse effect interest rate, need analytical apparatus take account interdependency interest rate variable want analyse. a simple approach involve use vector autoregressive (var) model. you may come across type model statistic economics courses. the var model i go present include mainland gdp, interest rate, krone exchange rate inflation.8 all variable function lag value variables. the system equation estimate historical data. to estimate model, relationship variable predetermine line economic theory. for example, assumption make concern sequence different variable affect one another. a common approach analyse effect interest rate model endogenously determine apply exogenous impulse shock interest rate. this mean interest rate raise response factor explain historically variable model. the effect rise interest rate depend variable include model, model’s structure estimation period. on one hand, result robust use long time-series estimation. on hand, historical change monetary policy regime influence results. it may therefore great interest confine estimation period to, instance, period inflation target – past ten years. 8 consumer price inflation adjust tax change exclude energy product (cpi-ate) 10 bi central bankers’ speech the chart show effect interest rate increase output inflation time 11 var models. these model differ estimate data slightly different time periods. in estimation use data present, start estimation different point time 1986 1996. in analysis, interest rate raise 1 percentage point, is, interest rate shock applied. thereafter model take interest rate gradually fall back, line model’s estimate reaction pattern. in course couple years, interest rate return start point.9 a chart shows, degree spread result considerable. if draw fan chart, confidence intervals, around model, would become clear uncertainty even great spread alone indicates. the result must therefore interpret caution. if nevertheless draw conclusion basis, must interest rate increase dampen gdp growth course subsequent year – else equal. somewhat ahead, inflation also recede. a interest rate return normal, gdp growth inflation pick again. our macroeconomic model nemo precise theoretical construction var models. nemo dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (dsge) model, many feature similar correspond model central banks. it describe behaviour household firms. economic agent forward-looking make decision expectation significance. there three economic agents: households, firm central bank. household demand good supply labour. they ass much spend relative save much work subject budget constraints. firm decide much produce set price maximise profits, give expect price input factor labour capital. these key mechanism microeconomic theory. the long-term growth potential economy determine technological developments. there long-term trade inflation unemployment. a price wage respond lag, monetary policy can, however, influence demand, output employment short medium term. in light mechanisms, nemo call new keynesian model, keynesian property short medium term classical property long term. you learn type model macroeconomics course method estimate model econometrics, although perhaps reach master’s level. 9 thereafter interest rate fall slightly start point period. bi central bankers’ speech 11 before i show interest rate work nemo compare result var model, i would like show monetary policy model model nemo. in model, central bank’s objective steer inflation. the interest rate set stabilise inflation 2.5 per cent somewhat ahead weight also give stabilise development output. in cases, change interest rate enable objective meet time. but situation also arise interest rate change cannot bring inflation back target without output move wrong direction. then, trade-off must make objective attain take longer. the central bank’s objective formalise loss function. the loss function can, somewhat simplified, illustrate follows: in equation, π denote inflation, π * inflation target x output gap. the loss function include deviation output potential output deviation inflation inflation target. the deviation enter loss function quadratically, central bank’s “loss” – disadvantage – increase large deviation target either way. the trade stabilise inflation close target avoid fluctuation output employment express parameter λ. the low λ is, great weight give central bank stabilise inflation. if λ equal zero, consideration set aside, λ great zero expression system flexible inflation targeting. in nemo, interest rate set view minimise overall “loss” express loss function. consideration give effect interest rate inflation output interaction. the chart simplify illustration model. the 12 bi central bankers’ speech economic relationship illustrate simple new keynesian model, become familiar course studies.10 nemo empirical model, say estimate norwegian data. in order see monetary policy work nemo, increase interest rate extent var models. a indicate red line chart, nemo provide description monetary policy broadly consistent derive var models,11 spite different principle model based. overall, appear one percentage point increase interest rate dampen output growth ½ percentage point inflation around ¼ percentage point. the effect interest rate increase gdp reach maximum one year, maximum effect inflation occur lag close two years. 10 see alstadheim, ragna et.al (2010), “monetary policy analysis practice”, norge bank staff memo 11/2010 11 the estimation base one percentage point increase interest rate, follow gradual reduction line response pattern model bi central bankers’ speech 13 the monetary policy report, norge bank publish three time year, include discussion key trend analysis interest rate path ahead. the model i describe key support tools. but model never able tell u exactly interest rate set. the ultimate assessment is, mentioned, result norge bank’s professional judgement also capture consideration sufficiently take account models. a such, model tool. but, model nemo useful tool analyse development interest rate setting. it help u interpret understand dynamic norwegian economy help u achieve consistency monetary policy response pattern. the chart show forecast inflation output gap june report (2/11). the output gap assume increase somewhat ahead, downturn wake financial crisis follow mild upturn. the low level inflation would gradually move target. the interest rate path present june indicate interest rate would gradually raise towards normal level next years. this conditional economic outlook present time. our forecast provide expression consider baseline path. but forecast uncertain, illustrate fan chart. our interest rate forecast unconditional promise, signal set interest rate development norwegian economy line projections. 14 bi central bankers’ speech the bank’s monetary policy report also present alternative scenario norwegian economy. if development broadly line expectations, economic agent expect interest rate set line project norge bank. if condition change, case august, norge bank naturally adapt monetary policy stance light new economic prospects. through summer, dramatic fall stock exchange political unrest make headlines. there prospect low economic growth many countries. in u many country europe, public debt high fiscal deficit substantial. at time, measure reduce deficit short term also dampen activity. some economist fear renew economic setback u financial market characterise turbulence uncertainty. the u eu authority face demand decision-making processes. in us, political party people divide view taxation exercise central government authority, reflect example absence measure strengthen central government

years. measure put place. the eu country establish joint fund provide loan country debt problems. the ecb intervene support purchase government bonds. these measure limit scope duration intend replace permanent resolution mechanism implemented. the political authority may still, time, find suitable permanent solutions, europe us. but road ahead may bumpy long. the norwegian economy robust. government finance sound, bank solid, unemployment low economy grow fairly solid pace. at time, must acknowledge influence turbulence weak prospect internationally. norway open economy. norwegian firm affect demand slow fund become difficult. monetary policy respond rapidly change outlook, example reflect norge bank’s decision keep key policy rate unchanged august monetary policy meeting. bi central bankers’ speech 15 early week, swiss national bank decide announce minimum exchange rate swiss franc euro owe substantial appreciation swiss franc. interest rate inflation switzerland close zero growth low. accord swiss national bank, appreciation could result recession deflationary developments. measure therefore introduce prevent developments. the norwegian krone appreciate sharply announcement. a krone strong time result inflation low growth weak. in case, monetary policy measure taken. in norway, key policy rate relevant instrument. the norwegian krone market small international standards. this mean krone exchange rate fluctuate considerably time international turbulence. this also case day foreign exchange market participant decide shift krone positions. the exit may prove narrow many investor decide withdraw time. i begin lecture schweigaard’s childhood experience family surrender gold silver establishment norge bank. this experience cannot give much confidence public institutions. a adult, professor economics national politician, schweigaard become trendsetter area monetary policy conduct. schweigaard’s fundamental view base “empirical methods” rather “empty speculation” idealism.12 this still apply monetary policy. theoretically anchor model improve method quantify empirically provide good basis conduct effective economic policy, take board apply develop model analytical apparatus norge bank. knowledge relationship norwegian economy, conjunction professional judgement, provide good platform. thank attention good luck studies! 12

bankers’ speech 1 duvvuri subbarao: monetary policy dilemma – reserve bank india perspective comment dr duvvuri subbarao, governor reserve bank india, stern school business, new york university, 26 september 2011. * * * 1. i value opportunity speak stern school academic community interest central bank issues. over last decade, profile central bank go up. first, great moderation – period extraordinary benign macroeconomic environment globally, characterize steady growth advance economy accelerate growth emerge economies, low stable inflation around. central bank take credit this, believe discover holy grail declare victory. 2. that sense triumph dent crisis central bank come blame policy action get world crisis. even so, central bank battle crisis frontlines regain lose reputation act quickly, decisively, require concert, stabilize global economy hurtle towards collapse. over last months, fear double-dip recession resurfaced, government advance country lock policy logjam balance short-term fiscal stimulus long term fiscal consolidation. this willy-nilly push central bank fore monetary stimulus bear burden first, cases, possibly line defence recession. 3. the crisis intellectual challenge many ways. it test armoury instrument available central bank limit policy force. it also reopen question think answer renew debate think settled. my experience real world problem complex fit template solution text books. i want use opportunity provide communicate complexity dilemma real world policy making, i perspective reserve bank india (rbi). what appropriate monetary policy response complex growth-inflation dynamics? 4. india recover crisis sooner even emerge economies, inflation catch u sooner elsewhere. inflation, measure wholesale price index (wpi), actually go negative territory brief period mid-2009, start rise late 2009, remain around 9–10 per cent since january 2010 reflect supply demand pressures. supply pressure stem elevate domestic food price rise global price oil commodities. the source demand pressure economy low per caput income recover sharply crisis. the supply pressure demand pressure collide trigger wide inflationary process. 5. in response inflationary pressures, reserve bank begin reverse accommodative monetary policy early october 2009. we criticize anti-inflationary stance, ironically two different directions. from one side, criticize hawkish inflation. the argument inflation drive largely supply shocks, particularly, since mid-2010, high oil commodity prices, monetary policy respond inflation. we end hurt growth. the criticism side reserve bank soft inflation, baby step approach follow – 2 increase policy interest rate 25 bp time – deterrent enough, persistence inflation result delay response. both critique cannot obviously right time. let offer response process explain rationale anti-inflationary stance. monetary policy hawkish 6. my response dive follows. admittedly, monetary policy best suit contain inflationary pressure stem aggregate demand side. in case, policy prescription clear. if inflation high, tighten monetary policy; inflation low, loosen monetary policy. monetary policy option face supply shock le straight forward. whether monetary policy effective deal supply shock therefore matter academic debate policy contention. 7. the conventional wisdom inflation expectation well anchored, monetary policy need react supply shocks. this premise base two assumptions; first supply shock purely temporary, second supply shock one drive inflation. these assumption always hold. in real world, oftentimes supply shock lead permanent trend upward shift prices. also, sometimes, demand pressure combine supply shock stoke inflationary pressures. 8. a good illustration first assumption – mean revert supply shock – hold come world price oil trend long period basis. international crude oil price record annual average increase around 17 per cent 2000s modest increase 2 per cent 1990s decline 3 per cent 1980s. this obviously outcome structural change supply demand oil. monetary policy recognize underlie trend respond them. if look upon trend pure transient supply shock ignore them, run risk destabilize inflation expectations. 9. and second assumption – supply shock usually act alone stoke inflation. the shift driver inflation india past year half offer good illustration. the increase global commodity price coincide rapidly rise demand home. gdp grow 8.5 per cent last year (2010/11), fast trend growth rate estimate order 8 per cent. in environment rapid growth high capacity utilization, corporates regain price power able pas increase input price high output price thus fuel generalize inflationary pressures. 10. similar dynamic play food front. rise incomes, especially rural areas, result shift dietary habit away cereal toward protein-based foods. this structural change monetary policy mislead treat one-off supply shock. give high share food various consumer price index (46%–70%), persistent supply pressure food front fuel inflation expectations; face grow demand pressures, rise inflation expectation trigger wage-price spiral. recent report real wage rural labour go markedly suggest wage-price spiral may already way. 11. to summarize, inflation experience last nearly twenty month result combination supply shock trend impact price well demand pressures. give nature inflation driver combine impact, clearly significant role monetary policy combat inflation. our monetary policy stance guide understanding, aim restrain demand anchor inflation expectations. the argument critic monetary policy role inflation result import commodity price would valid increase commodity price pure transient supply shock demand pressures. that clearly case india. bi central bankers’ speech 3 monetary tighten hurt growth 12. another argument make line criticism monetary policy tighten hurt growth. i believe much nuanced evaluation policy stance necessary. evidence empirical research suggest relationship growth inflation non-linear. at low inflation stable inflation expectations, trade-off growth inflation. but certain threshold level inflation, relationship reverses, trade-off disappears, high inflation actually start take toll growth. estimate reserve bank use different methodology put threshold level inflation range 4%–6%. with wpi inflation rule 9 per cent, way past threshold. at high level, inflation unambiguously inimical growth; sap investor confidence erode medium term growth prospects. the reserve bank’s monetary tighten accordingly gear towards safeguard medium term growth even mean sacrifice near term growth. monetary policy behind curve 13. now let turn criticism opposite side – reserve bank slow close monetary spigots, “baby step” approach inadequate tame inflationary pressures, tighten aggressively lately make lose time. 14. this criticism fail appreciate context – nature domestic inflation global uncertainty – operating. the calibration monetary tighten guide change driver inflation course fiscal year 2010/11. early year, inflation pressure origin food prices, accordingly monetary policy response aim contain spillover risk non-food inflation. note policy rate go historically low level crisis, abrupt adjustment would disrupt market. our judgement, therefore, tighten do gradually, small steps, allow time bank private sector adjust high interest rate environment. 15. the inflation scenario change start august 2010 global commodity price surge high anticipated. global oil price come pressure start january 2011 political development middle east north-africa. also, i indicate earlier, narrow output gap, producer able pas high input price high output price lead inflationary pressure get generalize evidence increase non-food manufacture product inflation 5.3 per cent per cent august 2010 8.5 per cent march 2011. we respond change underlie driver inflation tighten aggressively start may 2011. 16. the second factor relevant “behind curve” debate also contend uncertain global recovery. even talk spring shoot april 2010, optimism last; soon thereafter, greek sovereign debt crisis unemployment concern u revive concern pace shape global recovery. these uncertainty increase nature size time pass euro area sovereign debt problem spread prove intractable, u recovery stall japanese economy assault unprecedented natural disaster. our “baby step” approach 2010 accordingly delicate balance act support recovery home amidst grow global uncertainty contain inflation pressures. 17. if factor reckon with, “behind-the-curve” argument lose potency. start march 2010, far raise policy interest rate (the repo rate) 350 bp. the effective tighten even more, 500 bp, operational policy rate shift reverse repo rate (absorption mode) repo rate (infusion mode). 4 18. in offer response criticism monetary policy stance sides, endeavour communicate every monetary policy action involve complex judgement. the supply shock confront real world different pure text book versions; oftentimes coincide rise demand pressures. we balance growth-inflation concerns. on top that, monetary policy action need forward look even face external uncertainty. this essence dilemma monetary policy decisions. how justify liquidity injection midst tighten cycle? 19. the conventional tool monetary policy control volume money (liquidity) price money (policy interest rate). typically expansionary stance would involve ease rate volume, conversely, contractionary stance would involve tighten them. occasionally, arise situation price volume instrument deploy opposite direction – example, inject liquidity amidst rate tighten cycle – call cautious judgement extra effort communication. 20. in understand motive force liquidity adjustment central bank, must note grow economy require central bank inject primary liquidity meet requirement currency credit. this injection come expansion reserve (base) money. in first instance, liquidity injection happen overnight borrow bank liquidity adjustment facility (laf). if liquidity shortage durable nature, central bank need meet need outright open market operation (omos) buy government securities. 21. a progress monetary tighten 2010, laf window shift surplus (absorption) mode deficit (injection) mode. this consistent anti-inflationary stance since deficit liquidity situation would improve monetary transmission. we also indicate clearly would endeavour reserve bank maintain absorption injection laf window ± 1 per cent net demand time liability (ndtl) banks. however, towards second half 2010, systemic liquidity tighten push injection laf window beyond 1 per cent ndtl. this owe combination structural one-off factors. recognize deficit systemic liquidity durable nature, reserve bank conduct outright omos inject liquidity durable nature. 22. this liquidity injection omos happen time tighten policy rate combat inflation. these seemingly contrarian actions, many observer may see conflict incoherent. we realize communication challenge – explain market remain commit bring inflation down, action inject liquidity inconsistent anti-inflation stance, continue hold liquidity deficit mode monetary tighten cycle, inject liquidity ease “excessive deficit” order ensure flow credit productive purpose choked. 23. inform market participant course understand rationale actions. but recognize importance communicate rationale large public. if people get confuse policy signal believe thereby central bank’s commitment inflation control credible, inflation expectation would get unhinge would erode effectiveness anti-inflation strategy. we, therefore, go extra mile communicate rationale non-technical level. bi central bankers’ speech 5 forward guidance: transparent can/should central bank be? 24. receive wisdom today successful monetary policy matter effective calibration overnight interest rates, also shape market expectation way interest rates, inflation income likely evolve way forward. among important instrument use central bank purpose “forward guidance” give monetary policy statements. 25. the practice give forward guidance vary across central banks. by far explicit bank canada which, give uncertainty crisis, give definite timeframe would keep overnight rate “current” level, subject course outlook inflation. the ecb traditionally le explicit grind policy commitment possible uncertain macro environment. the u feed credible record use forward guidance shape manage expectations. for two year since crisis, feed guide market say “economic condition likely warrant exceptionally low level federal fund rate extend period”. in recent statement august 9, 2011, feed quantify “extended period” “at least mid-2013”, thereby give definitive time frame market participant plan. the feed evidently expect reduce uncertainty, least one dimension (time dimension), forward guidance help stimulate demand. 26. give forward guidance always necessarily positive sum game. central bank face several dilemmas. the first exactly conditionality surround guidance worded. it cannot vague lose content value; hand, cannot precise central bank become prisoner word lose flexibility deviate guidance underlie circumstance change. a second, related, dilemma ensure market correctly appreciate conditionality interpret guidance irrevocable commitment. 27. start early 2010, keep best practice, reserve bank begin give forward guidance. and expected, confront classic communication dilemma. let illustrate. in first quarter review july 2011, said: “going forward, monetary policy stance depend evolve inflation trajectory, turn, determine trend domestic growth global commodity prices. a change stance motivate sign sustainable downturn inflation.” 28. simultaneously, also note stance monetary policy “manage risk growth fall significantly trend”. 29. read two statement together, analyst criticize guidance lack precision; specifically, question like, “what trend growth rate” “how much deviation trend would rbi tolerate”. this valid criticism question relevant. with trend growth rate, post-crisis, estimate 8 per cent, balance policy stance would shift growth fell consistently substantially rate. but shift stance also function behaviour external internal driver inflation. what say response criticism therefore define precisely “what significantly trend” ex-ante difficult, ambiguity guidance deliberate unavoidable. 30. central whole issue forward guidance central bank handicap external uncertainty control. the crisis bring dilemma sharp focus. on one hand, central bank want use instrumentality forward guidance manage expectations, even outcomes; hand, cannot precise enough external uncertainty. how communicate monetary policy benefit-cost balance positive yet another dilemma central banks. 6 should monetary policy respond asset prices? 31. among many question throw crisis one role central bank deal asset price bubbles. the broadly accept theology crisis – although view – greenspan orthodoxy summarize follows. first, asset price bubble hard identify real time, fundamental factor drive asset price directly observable. a central bank therefore second guess market. second, monetary policy blunt instrument counteract asset price booms. and third, central bank “clean mess” bubble bursts. the surmise therefore cost-benefit calculus activist monetary stance “leaning wind” clearly negative. in words, job central banker remove punch bowl matter party get wild. 32. the crisis dent credibility greenspan orthodoxy. the emerge view post-crisis central bank cannot remain indifferent asset price bubbles. however, throw debate role central bank role might affect responsibilities, indeed autonomy. the debate still fluid conclusive answers. nevertheless, help crystallize view guide way forward. let discus them. 33. a much pre-crisis orthodoxy deploy monetary policy aid asset price management lose potency, reservation persist efficacy. the essence argument typical monetary policy action raise policy interest rate small step 25–50 basis point help contain surge asset prices. on hand, monetary policy action aggressive enough deter asset price build take heavy toll real economy. a consensus build around view appropriate way address asset price macroprudential instruments, either independently conjunction monetary policy. indeed, macroprudential instrument heart basel 3 package agree upon last year. 34. macroprudential policy neat concept throw host problem operation. the tool macroprudential policy capital norms, countercyclical buff risk weight fall within domain regulation. but also consistency monetary stance macroprudential policy. doe mean central bank also responsibility bank regulation? if hand, responsibility distribute across different agencies, platform protocol coordination? what role government? 35. indeed, post-crisis trend entrust macroprudential supervision central banks, central bank already responsibility, define explicitly. while could synergy that, also question potential conflict interest when, example, macroeconomic situation may require tight monetary policy, central bank may demur tighten may raise concern stability bank system. some people argue though potential conflict monetary policy macroprudential policy exaggerated. in entrust responsibility macroprudential supervision, broadly financial stability, central banks, concern also responsibility, might impact prize autonomy central banks. this apprehension arise macroprudential decision entail great element subjective judgement monetary policy decisions, case, open scope interference outside. 36. my attempt give flavour many complex question throw issue central bank responsibility asset price management, indeed broadly financial stability. the scope lecture permit detail assessment debate. but let give reserve bank perspective this. bi central bankers’ speech 7 37. the reserve bank traditionally much broad mandate, include responsibility development functions, typical advance economy central banks. our experience regard simultaneously manage monetary policy macroprudential policy positive, indeed synergistic. asset price trend one many variable take account monetary policy calibration. we use conventional monetary policy instrument policy interest rate demand pressure across board. on hand, demand pressure confine specific sectors, find efficient use macroprudential instrument risk weight provision norm put sand wheel credit flow sectors. we also use macroprudential instrument symmetrically – tighten time excess demand as, example, year crisis, ease time slacken demand, example, part crisis response. 38. even macroprudential policy become talk town post-crisis, deploy require careful judgement. in order make judgement, central bank ascertain asset price build drive “excessive leverage” price build across board confine specific sectors. by far important thing remember deploy macroprudential policy that, benefit hindsight, conservative policy look safe. but excessive conservatism order prepare ride potential crisis could thwart financial innovation progress. it balance prevent instability promote innovation central bank learn manage. and especially important emerge market economy like india responsibility central bank market development, though explicit, nonetheless quite important. how monetary policy manage interface fiscal policy? 39. the seventy odd year since great depression saw famous rivalry fiscal monetary policy influence. for much period, almost across develop world, keynesian theology ruled, fiscal policy dominate monetary policy remain subservient that. the stagflation 1970s, influential monetarist view friedman et al apparent success supply side policy tame inflation prompt shift think away full body keynesianism. also important theoretical analysis discretion vs. rule set monetary policy. together, theoretical advance empirical evidence allow monetary policy wean away fiscal dominance central bank start assert autonomy. 40. even advantage apolitical monetary authority effective counterpoise politically drive fiscal policy become evident, democratic compulsion make fiscal discipline increasingly difficult. to get around this, start 1990s, several country voluntarily enact fiscal responsibility laws. the law impose limit fiscal deficits/public debt one hand prohibit primary finance fiscal deficit central bank other. this institutional framework allow operational independence central bank conduct monetary policy within rule-based regime successful keep inflation low. 41. the rule base fiscal regime unravel crisis government central bank implement expansionary policy close coordination. while coordination crisis question except extreme purists, recovery period, several fundamental concern resurfacing. at heart concern whether monetary policy become hostage fiscal compulsions? the specific debate vary basic issue similar. in us, debate trade-off short-term fiscal stimulus long-term fiscal consolidation. in euro area, question share benefit monetary union without share responsibility fiscal union. the question around are: be central bank force beyond comfort zone maintain expansionary monetary stance compensate 8 fiscal laxity? aren’t call unconventional monetary action thinly veil fiscal measures? aren’t central banks, process, compromise basic commitment price stability? be central bank become vulnerable political pressures? be autonomy risk? the answer question shape current big issue settled. 42. a many economies, india too, monetary policy dominate fiscal consideration 1970s 1980s. large grow fiscal deficit end finance reserve bank. this lead desire growth base money money supply ultimately reflect high inflation. like economies, put place fiscal responsibility legislation – fiscal responsibility budget management (frbm) act, 2003 – ceiling deficit debt ratio provision prohibit primary finance government debt central bank. these provision facilitate fiscal consolidation 2003–08 afford reserve bank necessary flexibility implement monetary policy aim low stable inflation. 43. like elsewhere world, monetary fiscal policy ease india response crisis. in particular, mean interrupt fiscal consolidation process enjoin frbm act. a india emerge crisis, government adopt revise road map fiscal consolidation recommend thirteenth finance commission. nevertheless, meet road map target go formidable challenge. the quantum non-discretionary expenditure (salaries, pensions, interest payments) large cannot adjust easily, rate short-term. by far large component discretionary expenditure subsidy – food, fertilizer petroleum products. in reduce subsidies, inevitably tension democratic compulsion economic virtue. even government pursue quantitative target, also mindful quality fiscal adjustment – prune unproductive expenditure increase productive expenditure necessary raise potential output economy. 44. a i said, reserve bank battle inflation last twenty months. monetary tightening, well known, work restrain demand. in much fiscal stance supportive demand, monetary stance aggressive otherwise. for monetary policy supportive growth, necessary fiscal consolidation take root firmly. 45. the dilemma monetary policy india thus somewhat different advance economies. the dilemma advance economy central bank whether monetary policy keep accommodative necessary offset fiscal contraction. in contrast, dilemma reserve bank whether monetary policy tighten much fiscal demand. conclusion 46. in remark today, i try present dilemma confront monetary policy management. all central bank confront these, difference extent timing. i try give reserve bank perspective these. the message i try convey template answer real life policy issues. analysis important, judgement crucial. i believe two way communication central practitioner central bank scholar help sharpen analysis judgement. bi central bankers’ speech 1 tiff macklem: manage risk new global economic landscape remark mr tiff macklem, senior deputy governor bank canada, national insurance conference canada, vancouver, british columbia, 27 september 2011. * * * it great pleasure speak vancouver annual national insurance conference canada. few industry know personal, economic financial impact disaster – “extreme events” insurance expert like call them. and know risk management. today i want talk topic – extreme event private public risk management wake. this morning discuss earthquake insurance. earthquakes, like natural disaster – tsunamis, hurricane ice storm come mind – entirely exogenous, extreme event – act god, will. they preventable, although impact reduce build resilience timely effective disaster response. your industry, course, play vital role help household business mitigate consequence natural disasters. other extreme event endogenous – manmade. the recent financial crisis fall category. the crisis begin august 2007 explode autumn 2008 self-inflicted. the financial system fragile failed. we still paying. we pay many year come. the global recession follow financial crisis deep since great depression. and today, two year shape weak recovery since great depression. this new economic financial landscape find in. and may le desire, terribly surprising. the lesson history recession follow financial crisis big normal recessions. on average, loss output recession financial crisis two three time loss normal recession. output fall recession financial crisis. normally, deep recession, sharp recovery. not recovery financial crises. recovery financial crisis slower. typically, take output twice long return pre-recession level financial crisis normal recovery, output permanently low compare pre-crisis growth trajectory. the essential reason legacy financial crisis lot debt, pay debt act drag anchor economy take many year break free from. if forget lesson history, recent economic financial data provide reminder world awash debt, repair balance sheet banks, household government take years. in canada, weather crisis good advance economies. our recession, sharp, shallow short many, internal impediment recovery. our bank among strong world, best fiscal situation among g-7. nonetheless, anemic u.s. recovery, well persistently strong canadian dollar elevate global risks, weigh growth here. this new, modest global economic landscape implication number issues. i develop three head sovereign risk, shift economic centre gravity, low long. i say word private risk management new landscape, well public policy priority necessary sustain recovery support financial stability. 2 bi central bankers’ speech sovereign risk let start sovereign risk. the immediate issue europe: i don’t need tell audience fiscal financial strain europe acute. widen sovereign spread expand group euro-area country bond challenge fiscal sustainability countries. the leading-edge consequence buildup fund pressure european banks. most see fund cost rise sharply, access financial market curtail equity trade historic low relative value assets. these challenge compound impossibility currency adjustment within monetary union. without option devaluation, prolong deflationary adjustment require country must restore competitiveness. while situation europe immediate, need agree measure restore fiscal sustainability unite state japan le important. increase uncertainty ability political process deliver need adjustment reflect recent sovereign downgrades. these fiscal challenge manageable political sound execution, long large debt need refinanced, sovereign remain vulnerable change global growth investor sentiment. this present fundamentally new landscape government debt long consider risk-free asset many advance countries. give central role government liability financial system, prolong concern sovereign risk could profound implication function financial system. in particular, role government bond benchmark broad array financial asset price likely eroded. shift economic centre gravity a second consequence weak recovery advance country acceleration shift economic centre gravity emerge markets. this new trend, turbocharged. the growth differential advance emerge economy widen sharply. emerging-market economy account close 80 per cent global growth – one-third start millennium. improve economic management emerge market increase potential growth reduce riskiness. and portfolio underweight emerging-market exposure, increase allocation emerge market potential boost return without take excessive risk. of course, emerging-market economy represent homogeneous asset class. they offer high range volatility opportunity investor must take account. large capital inflow sudden outflow present challenge emerge market investor alike. in particular, risk large inflow could fuel asset-price bubbles. a reallocation 5 per cent advanced-economy portfolio emerge market translate potential flow $1.6 trillion, eight time portfolio equity flow emerge markets. this considerable shock. the robust growth emerge economy welcome source strength global economy. with strong growth, however, come risk overheating, follow abrupt correction. for investors, exit could crowded. these risk private investor public authority need manage. bi central bankers’ speech 3 low long the last feature new economic landscape i want address low long. with weak recovery unite state europe tentative hand-off public stimulus private demand, policy interest rate reasonably expect remain normal time come. while provide need stimulus, prolong period unusually low rate could contribute excessive risk taking. they cloud assessment financial risks, induce search yield delay balance-sheet adjustments. low long special concern insurance company pension fund guarantee return benefits. you make promise need keep. and reduce yield asset raise net present value liabilities, sustain period low interest rate make guarantee hard fulfill. to address potential shortfalls, investor may move fund risky asset pick yield. in first half 2011, saw significant expansion variety risky exposure offer high return – volatility – include asset high-yield bonds, leverage loans, emerging-market equity debt, commodities. the sign grow risk tolerance financial market evident data issuance, price flow across range markets, financial instrument risky complex structure returning. with dramatic fall-off risk appetite recent weeks, investor shift search yield search safety. this send price risky asset sharply low safe-haven asset record highs. indeed, world high sovereign debt, weak growth low-for-long-induced search yield, impact new information tend magnified. for investors, mean contend volatility. in short, legacy crisis treacherous economic landscape put premium private sector risk management public sector risk mitigation. let say word both. strengthen private sector risk management for long-term investor, fundamental shift required, think return target consider appetite risk measure manage risk desire risk tolerance. the experience crisis provide clear lesson risk measurement management, point need good tool risk assessment, good information system information sharing, improve governance compensation practices, good communication. to ass risk extreme event like major earthquake, insurance expert rely short span data would few, any, major earthquake sample. yet, financial risk manager routinely use tool value-at-risk model use relatively short window recent data ass likelihood financial loss. to measure financial risk accurately, need good tool capture tail event mitigate procyclicality. in particular, need draw long span data complement standard tool methods, stress tests, allow risk manager explore implication extreme events. good information system help firm measure risk identify vulnerabilities. the financial crisis expose need perform due diligence respect new product instruments. a crucial lesson crisis avoid embed leverage, extremely difficult measure. we must able measure quantify risks, risk need understand consider across business lines. this mean develop limit control absorb amount risk firm take put place reliable enforcement mechanisms. 4 bi central bankers’ speech sound governance fundamental ensure appropriate investment risk management application principles. board must involve establish level risk tolerance oversee risk management. director need question growth rate business ass whether control keep risk business resilient shocks. this require board member expertise banking, insurance risk management. board also play important role ensure compensation system part integrate risk-management strategy. tie bonus short-term profit without adequate consideration long-term risk recipe excessive risk taking. the financial stability board develop principle compensation practice align compensation prudent risk taking. implementation must system-wide professional firm level play field. finally, financial firms, credit-rating agency financial adviser need good job communicate suitability products, inherent risks, clients. this require good plain language disclosure. it also require improve financial literacy improvement consumer protection. this share responsibility private public sector – much learn method effective. public policy priority sound risk management make best situation hand; mitigate risk improve situation. and much public policy do. while lesson history recovery financial crisis disappointingly gradual bumpy, future preordained. public policy critical role play secure recovery promote financial stability. there doubt timely concert action g-20 country 2008–09 inject considerable monetary fiscal stimulus avert much bad disaster. but, today, uncertainty willingness policy-makers respond become part problem. this need change. european authority must move decisively contain sovereign debt crisis. this start deliver fiscal austerity key country full implementation announce measure make european financial stability facility flexible. but required. the immediate priority provide fund backstop vulnerable european sovereign size scale problem comprehensive capital plan european banks. in opinion, do use exist european resource efficiently. these step must complement governance reform credible fiscal arrangement within european monetary union. in advance countries, priority must agree credible, concrete executable plan restore fiscal sustainability consistent commitment make last year’s g-20 leader summit toronto. in many emerging-market economies, great exchange rate flexibility necessary good manage demand pressure inflationary risks, facilitate global rebalancing demand. great exchange rate flexibility unite state china require help recovery former control inflation latter. finally, advance emerge country alike must implement agree financial sector regulatory reform build resilient financial system good serf need household businesses. in face difficult external environment, bank canada continue support canada’s economic expansion keep inflation low, stable predictable. bi central bankers’ speech 5 since crisis erupt four year ago, bank demonstrate nimbleness conduct monetary policy. we react quickly forcefully downturn. a canadian recovery progressed, emphasize would prudent respect possible withdrawal degree monetary stimulus. conclusion i must conclude. recovery financial crisis feel like convalescence. for private sector investors, fundamental sound portfolio management changed, economic landscape has. sovereign debt long risk-free asset, shift economic centre gravity emerging-market economy accelerated, low-for-long interest rate change behaviour strain business models. the private sector bear much responsibility excess heart 2008–09 financial crisis. risk management strengthened, adapt new realities. public policy critical role play mitigate systemic macroeconomic risks. more action need contain sovereign risks, promote rebalancing global demand implement financial regulatory reform. the distant horizon new landscape bright. get take time, move steadfastly right direction get u safely. thank you. bi central bankers’ speech 1 josé de gregorio: chile’s late monetary policy report presentation mr josé de gregorio, governor central bank chile, monetary policy report honorable senate republic, santiago de chile, 7 september 2011. * * * the monetary policy report september 2011 find http://www.bcentral.cl. introduction mr.

domestic output gap – i.e., difference actual trend growth – year ago expect occur course 2011, take place first part year. the unemployment rate fall rapidly historic average. inflation, meanwhile,

monetary policy interest rate (mpr) stand within range consider normal. however, event 2008 still cast shadow world economic outlook. despite time elapse economic financial measure adopt economic

eurozone member u.s., prompt new episode financial stress early august, still another one day ago. the world economy go extremely complex situation. certainly, chile tool soften impact adverse external conditions. but say time past, cannot immune happen outside borders. we mitigate effects, cannot avoid altogether. therefore, external situation likely repercussion economy and, consequently, monetary policy conduct. a i mentioned, august meet board withdraw tighten bias mpr communicate previous minutes, reflect behavior market interest rates. the baseline scenario i present moment assume world economy grow le anticipate three month ago. first-half output figure pretty 2 bi central bankers’ speech weak develop world. recent financial turmoil could aggravate second half year. develop economies’ household continue tighten belt order reduce massive debts, but, turn, deleveraging process restrain growth domestic demand employment, prolong balance sheet vulnerability. in addition, fiscal position economy deteriorate several year fiscal deficit. remedy situation call substantial adjustment public finances. some could do medium term, instance unite states, others need immediate action, case emerge european economies. in moment weak private demand, adjustment could postpone much expect recovery even further. add monetary policy interest rate all-time lows, capacity central bank increase stimulus also limited. in short, tool traditionally use boost growth little room maneuver develop world. another source risk increasingly debate possibility develop economies, especially u.s., endure long time slow growth. excessive private debts, particularly households, public debt, combine weak labor markets, determinant assessment. this could shape similar situation japan burst house bubble late 1980s, give way period stagnation see end. although believe unlikely scenario, consequence global economy could severe. amidst conditions, emerge economy continue grow strongly. the risk overheat saw month back diminished, partly action adopt economic policy and, especially, monetary measures. there still risks, however. for one, obvious develop economy continue lag, external demand face emerge world fall, hurt growth potential. although current scenario dynamism certain degree decouple expected, cannot go indefinitely. give weakness domestic demand develop countries, rely export grow resolve global imbalances. this put pressure emerge economies’ exchange rate external accounts. this one element see past year, parity dollar post great appreciation last decade (figure 2). so far, chilean economy able withstand challenge, risk pressure intensify still latent. the real exchange rate rise announce intervention early year, level near average past 15 20 year (figure 3). among policy emerge economy use mitigate impact currency adoption foreign exchange measures. these take variety forms, include foreign currency purchase implementation administrative measures. in chile, early january, announce program reserve accumulation 12 billion dollars, complete course year. this equivalent 5 gdp points, large since first half 1990s (figure 4). to date, already make purchase amount somewhat 8.5 billion u.s. dollars. this program serf two purposes. the first, emphasize announcement, transitorily attenuate appreciation peso. this allow productive sector make necessary adjustment within context pressure could remain long time. the program effect peso. without intervention, would appreciate further. however, prove evidence, communication highlighted, take kind measure grant permanent solution. the solution must necessarily come improvement competitiveness productivity. the second purpose program strengthen international liquidity position. this mean tool deal external turbulences. all available evidence show strong international reserve position help protect economy financial shock come abroad, turn reduce risk premium economy. in present bi central bankers’ speech 3 conjuncture, level reserve pursue program set u good foot case major global disruption. hold reserve tantamount insurance policy. during good times, bear cost associate differential yield foreign liquid safe assets, cost domestic liability finance them. however, episode global recession financial stress, available reserve permit cushion impact shock cost country’s external finance provide increase flexibility economic policy mitigate effect domestic economy. fluctuation international value peso cause significant volatility account results, see recent years. in good times, peso tend appreciate, generate account loss net worth measure peso due effect reserve revaluation. but time global slowdown increase financial stress, opposite occurs, peso depreciation great net worth book (figure 5). a typical yearly account senate, report present evolution bank’s balance sheet prospect next year. in baseline scenario, gap external internal interest rate remains, expect profitability asset continue fall short cost liabilities. although foresee deterioration bank’s equity, continue negative. the recent increase international reserve negative effect results, favor intangible benefit strengthen liquidity position. however, say announce intervention program, level international reserve reach end year close limit absorb equity position. still, net worth – originate mainly costly financial crisis 1980s – obstacle bank conduct monetary policy independence flexibility. to sum up, face complex external scenario. doubt unfold affect chilean economy advise act prudence, board convince country good stand deal it. in baseline scenario i present moment, assume effect external scenario limited, chilean economy grow close trend, inflation near target. now i describe factor shape baseline scenario implication risk i mentioned. macroeconomic scenario in chile, dynamism output demand moderate second quarter, although somewhat le forecast june. inflation, meanwhile, slightly expectation month earlier. headline y-o-y inflation hover around 3 percent, annual growth rate core measure remain contain (figure 6). the inflation outlook characterize limit transmission food price local market. similarly, propagation price increase good fuel price line projections. a i say ago, external scenario bring important news, materialization risk consider last quarters. this, couple prospect slow growth develop economy concern debt spread central europe, significant impact global financial markets. the sovereign spread several eurozone members, like premium banks, all-time high (figure 7). asset price see substantial changes, worth note decline interest rate long-term t-bonds several develop economy act safe havens. stock exchange drop significantly global level (figure 8). to added, less extent, strengthen dollar currencies, strong appreciation gold swiss franc, also use safe havens. finally, 4 bi central bankers’ speech worth mention decline commodity prices, exception agricultural good and, again, gold (figure 9). domestically, variable local financial market felt external turmoil. the stock exchange experience significant setback interest rate treasury central bank document fall sharply (figure 10). the money interbank market continue operate normally, liquidity condition dollar peso unaffected increase interbank premium develop markets. the peso, swings, stand close level statistical cutoff june’s report. in light developments, output figure second quarter advance indicator third – still weak develop economy – , baseline scenario revise downward 0.2 percentage point world growth estimate 2011, half percentage point one next year (table 1). the big change u.s., where, aside low growth see thus far, incidence foreseeable fiscal adjustment approval high limit public borrowing. growth eurozone still expect slow. also, foresee weaken develop world impact emerge economy which, case, continue outperform develop counterparts. this project world growth forecast low consensus, close report probably reflect full effect current financial turmoil. nonetheless, incoming report investment bank carry significant downward correction develop economies, line assumption make baseline scenario. a i said, concern overheat emerge world consequence inflation subsided. adjustment already make monetary policy several economies, weaken global economy, recent drop commodity price behind assessment. so, several country already suspend cycle policy rate increase and, general, market expectation adjust expect flatten rate. in develop economies, likely monetary policy hold – possibly even intensify – current degree expansiveness time. the federal reserve announce intention keep feed fund rate minimum least mid-2013 (figure 11). all fact combine result external impulse chilean economy receive come quarter mild previously estimated. on one hand, worsen global performance negative impact trade partners’ economies. however, continue grow 2000–2007 average. the change composition weight group countries, emerge economy – especially china – sharply increase share, explain result. while 2000 emerge economy weigh le one third group chile’s trade partners, expect close one half 2011 (figure 12). on hand, drop term trade expected. this last projection base copper price us$3.7 per pound 2012 us$3.5 2013, wti oil price average around us$90 per barrel 2012–2013 (table 2). in scenario reduce external impulse, chilean economy forecast grow range 6.25% 6.75% year, line june’s projections. up second quarter, output grow trend expectation june report; consumption slow strong expansion much foreseen; labor market continue give sign tight financial condition still favorable, credit show increase growth rate (figure 13). our present scenario foresee domestic demand grow 9.1% year, forecast last report. this reflect impact increase gross fix capital formation first half, especially machinery & equipment, well great inventory accumulation. compare june, projection assume fast convergence output demand bi central bankers’ speech 5 second half year. july’s output figure, although influence specific development mine sector, reflect trend. the big impact change external condition visible gdp growth 2012. for then, baseline scenario assume gdp grow 4.25% 5.25% range (table 3). the slowdown year respond number factors. first convergence expansion figure consistent trend growth, board continue estimate around 5 percent. such convergence reflect normalization durable component aggregate demand mpr. moreover, effect low basis comparison associate earthquake tsunami 2010 – influence first-half growth figure – disappear. there also reduce impulse abroad see come quarters, i already mentioned. we also assume fiscal balance converge structural deficit 1 percent gdp towards end current administration, announce authority conformity fiscal accountability law. this change external condition also trigger significant change inflation outlook, especially short run. in baseline scenario, increase y-o-y cpi inflation towards end year le forecast june, mainly respond low price fuels. accordingly, year’s end, cpi inflation 3.3 percent instead 4 percent estimate june. go forward, inflation remain close target third quarter 2013, time mark end projection horizon (figure 14). private inflation expectation revise direction point cpi inflation somewhat 3 percent end year, line target thereafter (figure 15). such trend inflation base several assumptions. a i said, economy grow around trend come quarters; real exchange rate remain fairly stable, range believe consistent long-term fundamentals; labor cost grow line inflation target. regard monetary policy, mpr reach range consider normal. unlike prediction month ago, think mpr would raise further, change macroeconomic scenario lead great dispersion private expectations. even so, baseline scenario us work assumption that, short run, mpr stay today (figure 16). a usual, scenario reflect event believe likely occur information hand report’s statistical cutoff date. there risk that, materialized, shape different macroeconomic scenario one describe here. on occasion, thorough evaluation alternative scenarios, board estimate risk balance downward bias output, unbiased inflation. a i mention first, main risk complex global economic situation. it cannot rule recent episode could happen intensify, affect financial system confidence economic agents. the little room maneuver monetary fiscal policy develop world complicate response scenario. another part external risk associate develop countries’ growth beyond projection horizon. the forecast baseline scenario le market consensus, even strong foresee impact cannot rule out. doubt persist strength recovery develop economies, still possibility economies’ potential growth drop aftereffect crisis. such occurrence could consequence level interest rates, speed leverage problem resolved, growth emerge economies. in scenario, world economy grow le past. 6 bi central bankers’ speech nor rule scenario postponement monetary policy rate increase develop economy lack dynamism could lead investor hunt good return emerge economies. this would trigger resurgence capital flow towards latter, complicate macroeconomic policy-making. internally, risk center persistently strong output demand. although economy evolve predicted, moderation soft expected, labor market still tight – various source casuistic information report difficulty pressure labor market – rate credit expansion increased. it possible that, beyond tension external scenario, chilean economy continue grow trend, lead inflationary pressure incompatible inflation target. there doubt risk important, monetary policy necessary tool mitigate potential impact worse-than-expected external scenarios, show recent past. now allow remark wrap presentation. final remark the external scenario complex, economy resilient effect great recession. in 2009, combination significant fiscal monetary impulse avert bad effect global crisis. thus, couple quarter uncertainty sweep entire world hit economy special force, recover great vigor. even aftermath earthquake tsunami february 2010, chile rapidly return path sustain growth, unprecedented recovery employment, unwavering strength. all within context low inflation, despite international price shocks. monetary policy give practical proof act flexibility determination, resolute attenuate effect external cycle economy. a i said, three year outbreak crisis still endure consequences. chance are, reverberation continue longer. the task monetary policy preserve necessary capacity react difficult times, capacity display withdraw stimulus package due time prevent costly adjustment later. the board continue fulfill legal mandate safeguard price stability normal function payment system. accordingly, reaffirm commitment conduct monetary policy flexibility, order project inflation stand 3 percent policy horizon. an environment low inflation improve households’ welfare, particularly le capable protect rise prices. furthermore, keep inflation low stable permit soften fluctuation output employment, contribute people’s well-being. chile must continue path growth ensure continual progress live standard inhabitants. the world, include country, live decisive moment. develop country must make costly, complex, yet unavoidable adjustments. the experience develop world confirm need safeguard macroeconomic balances, public private, well strong, well regulate financial system. the fragility financial system fiscal account develop economy cause recoil live standard could compromise growth ability long while. bi central

bankers’ speech 1 jens weidmann: the crisis challenge euro area speech dr jens weidmann, president deutsche bundesbank, verband d familienunternehmer (association family enterprises), cologne, 13 september 2011. * * * 1 introduction lady gentleman i would like thank much invite event cologne. a may know, i spend number year study university bonn. it i get know appreciate rhineland region, i’m always please opportunity return – even though subject i’m discus even extremely challenging. more three year onset bank crisis, year sovereign debt crisis first come head spring 2010, financial market people across globe still scrutinise situation euro area. a political effort undertake solve urgent problem associate sovereign debt crisis alleviate symptoms, danger many people lose confidence decision-makers, agreement institutions. people germany – elsewhere – worry currency. and i take concern seriously. however, must forget eurosystem boast remarkable success fulfil mandate. the euro’s record internal external value stability comparable deutsche mark. along single currency’s economic political significance, must forget fact discuss current crisis. a president bundesbank member ecb’s govern council, core task safeguard euro’s long-term stability. credibly fulfil mandate provide justification central bank independence; also lie heart public confidence single currency. maintain confidence euro requires, among steps, construction sustainable bridge short-term crisis measure credible stability-oriented framework monetary union. there need institutional framework offer clear, coherent outlook provide incentive individual party act reliably sustainably. have outlook place make easy allay short-term difficulty ease current tensions. this broad framework need european monetary union; i would like look closely details. the sovereign debt crisis has, without question, euro’s big test date. the financial crisis reveal major fiscal macroeconomic imbalance countries. at time, unearth weakness fundamental framework monetary union actual implementation. the fact almost everyone – include u – underestimate huge challenge create increase complexity integration financial market sure play important role developments. first foremost, extensive consolidation reform measure need implement country experience difficulty order restore confidence stability public finances, re-establish competitiveness ensure healthy national financial system. the first step towards achieve already taken. in areas, however, long road ahead. in addition, comprehensive change must make financial market regulation supervision make financial system resilient. the resolution expect g20 summit cannes another important step towards objective. 2 bi central bankers’ speech moreover – main focus speech today – institutional framework monetary union must adjust achieve right balance responsibility individual countries, liability monitoring. my great concern current lack coherent outlook area. the step announced, already taken, shift balance framework direction sustainable long term. this threaten substantially harm public stand euro. in principle, i think two economically sustainable approach design stability-oriented monetary union future. the first would return found principle system agree treaties, still essentially applies; would entail european rule national fiscal policy, country retain fundamental fiscal policy independence, apply bail-out principle financial market discipline fiscal policy. despite comment contrary, i still believe possible successfully stabilise consolidate framework. the approach would embark upon major shift entail fundamental change federal structure eu. this would involve transfer national responsibilities, particularly borrow incur debt, eu. i believe political leader need take prompt decision two route take. the middle road communitising liability whilst retain independent national fiscal policy threaten derail inconsistency. it would endanger survival stability-oriented monetary union, thus also european integration achieve thus far. 2 sound public finance crucial precondition stability-oriented monetary union the current crisis europe cause small part imbalance fiscal economic policy member states, which, combination financial market crisis, trigger current sovereign debt crisis. the combination single monetary policy decentralise fiscal economic policy – issue already central debate monetary union found – thus prove flaw european monetary union. the coordinate mechanism design address weakness clearly inadequate. sound public finance always paramount importance internal external stability currency – monetary union national government retain sovereignty fiscal policy. the incentive individual member state incur debt even high union; sovereign debt rise one country, negative repercussion pass member states. the risk entail already clearly identify european monetary union established, rule fiscal monetary policy lay maastricht treaty. these rule aim shield monetary policy unsound fiscal policy. however, one factor underestimate monetary union founded: risk contagion mean difficult member state deny assistance country fault thus force bear cost risk result misguide fiscal policy. this therefore lead conflict fully apply no-bail-out principle safeguard financial market stability short term. indeed, successful monetary union, ie integrate real economy financial markets, great possible contagion effects. 3 the exist legal framework monetary union the founder monetary union essentially aware importance sound public finances. they therefore impose set rule euro area aim prevent kind imbalance emerge possible correct necessary. bi central bankers’ speech 3 because temptation i already outline decision-makers misuse monetary policy , stipulate monetary policy would independent charge safeguard price stability euro area whole. in euro area’s single monetary policy, finance government deficit individual member state prohibited. a well inflation risk arise overly expansionary monetary policy would entail, another important reason prohibit finance monetary union individual member state retain fiscal policy sovereignty. by support individual member state via central bank balance sheet, monetary policy would redistribute financial burden taxpayer different countries. if assistance individual country consider essential exceptional override reasons, threat financial stability, must generally provide fiscal policy, responsibility national government parliaments. the recent rule germany’s federal constitutional count probably base reasoning. monetary policy monetary union therefore differ crucially purely national monetary policy, unite state unite kingdom, danger shunt risk result unsound public finance taxpayer different country order avoid jeopardise financial stability. there still large degree national fiscal autonomy within european monetary union. the principle subsidiarity firmly enshrine current legal framework national parliament last word fiscal budgetary policy decisions. this true revenue expenditure and, particular, borrowing. the maastricht treaty stability growth pact design impose effective limit government borrow restrict sovereign debt non-critical level avoid last deficits. however, public often little awareness fiscal rule beyond two threshold figure 3% annual deficit 60% debt level (both relation gross domestic product). in fact, rule comprehensive – including, example, objective achieve close-to-balance budget medium term. 4 the run-up crisis despite existence framework substantial success achieve consolidate public finance convergence phase euro introduced, sovereign debt effectively contain subsequent phase – quite opposite, fact. look run-up crisis reveals, all, lack political implement rules, circumvent even actively bend way avoid sanctions. one major back door get around rule fact majority vote among member state require key point excessive deficit procedure order progress. otmar issing describe scenario rather colourfully “sinners sit judgement fellow sinners”, indeed encourage strategic voting. in many cases, member state consequently fail achieve fundamental budgetary objective pre-crisis borrow far high would rule apply consistently. another aggravate factor weakness commission, guardian treaties, confrontation member states. in countries, number failure – many summarise “a loss competitiveness”, “asset price bubbles” “excessive lending” – play crucial role run-up crisis. it would take long discus issue detail speech. however, remember initially neither national decision-makers, european bodies, financial market participant appear recognise extent escalate problems. the preventative mechanism risk provision insufficient. when imbalance corrected, place substantial additional pressure countries’ government budget financial systems. we must draw lesson future experiences, too. 4 bi central bankers’ speech 5 route sustainable institutional framework monetary union a complement short-term crisis measures, crucial structure institutional framework european monetary union stable, inspire confidence ultimately lend credibility short-term crisis management. i would like look two possible route achieve detail. 5.1 strengthen exist legal framework the current debt crisis several euro-area country reveal inadequacy exist procedure prevent resolve crises. in response, numerous adjustment since make framework monetary union. some adjustment yet specify detail approve national parliaments. they aim change fundamental principle monetary union. in particular, expressly reaffirm bail-out principle, thus make clear individual member state bear responsibility fiscal policy decision investor investment decisions. a short-term crisis measure, european financial stability facility (or efsf) european financial stability mechanism (or efsm) create summer 2010 greece grant bilateral assistance loans. recent decision specify efsf expand substantially. assistance grant ireland portugal via efsf, recently signal greece may grant additional aid. another package reform aim prevent future crisis amend stability growth pact (or sgp), introduce procedure prevent correct macroeconomic imbalance adopt euro plus pact (or epp). furthermore, emergency situation preventative mechanism suffice, permanent crisis resolution mechanism (called european stability mechanism, esm) set avert danger stability euro area whole. this mechanism schedule replace efsf efsm mid-2013. in principle, right decision. it reflect dimension increase financial market integration, underestimate founder monetary union facilitate considerable degree single currency. nonetheless, crucial ensure specific design support mechanism discard key basic principle – subsidiarity, independent national responsibility fiscal policy bail-out principle, thus also discipline function capital market – smokescreen financial stability. this would risk increase euro-area countries’ propensity incur debt heighten pressure single monetary policy adopt accommodative stance. i therefore rather critical element decision take euro area’s head state government 21 july. however, i must emphasise i share all-too common view exist framework unsuitable monetary union. i convince found principle remain appropriate stability-oriented monetary union, too. however, certain adjustment undoubtedly need make framework reflect recent experiences. and i certainly support many announce reforms. before i discus specific point i take critical view, i would like outline core element strengthen framework would need. specifically, i believe need give renew force bail-out principle, still enshrine relevant treaties, discipline national fiscal policy via capital market principle entails. there four key element context: 1. prevention: the plan strengthen preventative procedure key ensure crisis prevention reliable future. however, ensure actually work avoid build-up unsustainable sovereign debt, bi central bankers’ speech 5 need much great automatism, particularly stability growth pact, impose sanction deficit debt limit breached. the procedure prevent correct macroeconomic imbalance euro plus pact (epp) act supplementary tool avoid obvious serious imbalances. in use, nevertheless avoid attempt macroeconomic fine-tuning. 2. financial market stability: in addition, suitable measure take field financial market regulation supervision strengthen financial market stability, thus reduce potential conflict objective safeguard financial market stability ensure private creditor remain liable (including event euro-area country defaulting). 3. crisis management mechanism: there need crisis management mechanism last resort avert financial crisis threaten existence euro area. it contain three key elements: attach strict economic fiscal policy condition assistance, ensure appropriate interest rate premium credible involvement private investor event default. have strict macroeconomic fiscal adjustment programme and, all, significant interest rate premium rate pay country high credit rat maintain incentive member state return capital market soon possible. regard discipline national fiscal policy capital markets, rule monetary union adjust that, euro-area country look likely experience difficulties, private creditor cannot rapidly shift liability taxpayer country provide assistance. the introduction collective action clause (cacs) alone, schedule start 2013 within framework esm, highly unlikely sufficient achieve objective. the approach add trigger clause term condition bond stipulate maturity automatically extend fix period time (such three years) event esm grant assistance country question, propose bundesbank, therefore supported. i already stress i critical key element recent eu decision concern design crisis resolution mechanism. in view, undermine key basic requirement assistance mechanism exist legal framework, base country bear responsibility finances. one serious cause concern fact new, loose credit condition considerably reduce incentive country receive assistance make fiscal economic reform enable rapid return possible sound public finances. adopt condition future assistance programme (or even esm) would perpetuate problem encourage country apply assistance. the plan secondary market purchase would also weaken incentive country conduct appropriate fiscal policy. if bond country receive assistance purchase secondary market, unclear country strictly oblige fulfil condition govern consolidation reforms. it also unclear bring line requirement grant assistance measure last resort avert risk stability euro area whole. these decision mean member state unsound budgetary policy count receive assistance, country sound finance increasingly call provide funds. in addition, impression arise condition attach assistance open negotiation target missed, 6 bi central bankers’ speech danger country receive assistance make sufficient effort themselves. this inconsistency illustrate follow example: how improve sanction mechanism stability growth pact prevent unsound national fiscal policy sanction threaten but, rule continue breached, protection capital market ultimately grant extremely favourable condition – indeed, far good condition country provide assistance? 4. consistent implementation: the effectiveness set rule hinge implementation – principle “pacta sunt servanda” cease apply, reliable economic relationship long possible. ultimately, sovereign country receive assistance decide whether fulfil condition attach receive assistance. to avoid make mockery national responsibility, framework must also clearly establish assistance grant condition met. all all, i believe strengthen exist legal framework essentially remain viable promise mean stabilise monetary union. however, framework must ensure conduct sound fiscal policy best interest individual country – even crisis. and, take route, must allow design crisis resolution mechanism open door misguide incentives. 5.2 core element fiscal union substantial transfer competence national eu level the fundamental alternative strengthen exist framework would undertake major shift fiscal union, involve partial transfer fiscal policy competence eu. establish european fiscal union would mean require complete centralisation fiscal policy (including policy govern revenue expenditure). in particular, principle subsidiarity imply wide-ranging competence remain national level order ensure arrangement reflect preference individual countries’ citizen closely possible. in view, enshrine strict deficit debt limit national budget eu legislation pivotal achieve stable fiscal union reliably shield eurosystem’s single monetary policy unsound public finances. these limit would apply level national government, include central, state local government social security systems; eu would need grant ultimate power intervention ensure limit effectively implement practice. in fiscal union, power intervention would extensive enough ensure national government lose sovereignty fiscal policy deficit borrow limit breached, beforehand. consequently, national parliament would long ultimate decision-making authority government budgets; decision would subject approval central body. i must emphasise that, contrary public opinion, fiscal union would necessarily entail joint liability. in principle, kind centralise solution could function successfully without joint liability. this would allow room somewhat great flexibility national borrowing. exist national deficit debt limit could, principle, set monitor democratically legitimise central body, european parliament. it ensure decision exclusively affect euro-area country take representative countries. however, system set deficit debt limit would need follow consistent rules; would rule-based, much strict exist framework – reflect recent experience – make difficult change, example require large majorities. within bind framework, bi central bankers’ speech 7 national fiscal policy could essentially remain autonomous and, permit rules, could, example, allow automatic stabiliser cyclical smooth take effect take temporary loans. the eu limit constitute ceilings; should, course, obligation fully exhaust them. provide stringent rule implemented, approach could make crucial contribution ensure sound euro-area public finance medium term overcome sovereign debt crisis. this kind framework would shield eurosystem’s single monetary policy unsound fiscal policy. a i said: introduce joint new borrow communitising exist debt issue eurobonds, currently widely discussed, would necessary context. however, would possible second step (but certainly fiscal policy sovereignty deficit debt transfer eu) without undermine consistency legal framework, although framework would tighten even further. at events, even fiscal union, joint liability would raise incentive member state incur debt. these incentive would therefore restricted, example strict ban new borrow national eu level. otherwise, i believe fiscal union would long way ensure adequate balance liability control. a communitisation debt would sure result substantial redistribution sound unsound countries. in addition, eurobonds, themselves, would actually rather counterproductive solve fundamental problem lead outbreak spread sovereign debt crisis. in short, i believe risk associate eurobonds far outweigh potential benefits. alongside reform restore competitiveness, fiscal union would provide consistent legal framework. this would major step process european integration – significant move part eu, least euro area, direction federal state. however, implementation would require extensive treaty amendment probably also amendment national constitution – doubtless include german constitution, german federal constitutional court’s rule shown. we illusions: the route fiscal union would long arduous. without broad support people euro-area countries, kind shift would almost inconceivable, unclear whether support actually exists. it vital make mistake take step wrong order. 6 the increase misuse monetary policy in principle, possible monetary policy safeguard price stability either decentralise centralise legal framework monetary union, provide choose system adequate. however, substantial problem likely arise future inconsistent framework enshrine law – perhaps even bad – inconsistent framework re-enshrined law apply practice regardless legal provisions. the momentum crisis show worry pattern respect, particularly point view central bank.  insufficient economic fiscal policy measure member state lead loss confidence markets, focus new weaknesses.  sooner late situation escalates, country question see bond yield rise difficulty access capital market. the interest rate rise hastily classify unsustainable. crisis meet arranged, ad hoc measure adopt call make monetary policy – supposedly institution directly able intervene – step breach 8 bi central bankers’ speech stabilise situation short term. the situation become yet problematic neither country concern take measure remedy situation country potentially provide assistance wish take risks.  monetary policy certainly tool calm financial market short term. however, take measure blur boundary responsibility monetary fiscal policy overstretch mandate independent central bank. in addition, threaten perceptibly weaken incentive fiscal policymakers take action themselves.  this particular subsequently lead delay inadequate implementation fiscal policy measures, bring u full circle trigger downward spiral monetary policy leave “holding baby”. it certainly true central banks, too, learn lesson crisis rethink fundamental positions. i believe one key lesson is, i mention already, primary importance efficient financial market regulation supervision efficient framework monetary union and, particular, stability-oriented monetary policy interplay financial markets. i also aware real world black white rule action interpret differently. nonetheless, follow bundesbank’s tradition, i believe particularly important monetary policy remain true principle – monetary union. but place dogmatism. certain situation allow room certain degree flexibility, also require it. financial market stability is, without question, great importance monetary policy. even so, fact must lead u systematically overturn fundamental commitment responsibilities. this would cast doubt legitimacy independent monetary policy, jeopardise primary objective – safeguard price stability – compromise confidence general public monetary policy, vital importance. central bank currently relieve fiscal policy part burden support individual member state distress banks. however, bring substantial risk onto eurosystem’s balance sheet. i firmly believe risk must reduce account increased. it therefore high time fiscal policymakers decide risk will take on, combat crisis go forward. that responsibility monetary policy. 7 close remark lady gentlemen, i mention begin speech complex challenge subject. i would like thank give opportunity discus issue detail today. i believe current development vital importance future euro. the democratically elect parliament must decide future fundamental design european monetary union. this could mean maintain agree framework correct incentive conducive stability. alternatively, could involve undertake major shift fiscal union, include fundamental transfer key area responsibility national parliament democratically legitimise european bodies. however, i believe middle road embark upon recent decision lead u direction stable long term. thank attention. bi central bankers’ speech 1 william c dudley: financial stability economic growth remark mr william c dudley, president chief executive officer federal reserve bank new york, bretton wood committee international council meet 2011, washington dc, 23 september 2011. * * * it pleasure opportunity today. i want emphasize remark today three points. first, stable financial system prerequisite sustainable economic growth. second, financial system operate year lead crisis fail regard, generate terrible outcome term economic growth unemployment, return available saver access credit borrowers. third, although make progress reform oversee regulate financial system, work toward achieve stable dynamic system able deliver essential service saver borrower far complete. we must keep push agenda forward deter defend status quo. a always, remark follow reflect view necessarily federal reserve system. let start word now. it clear build-up debt year prior crisis, well crisis itself, contribute unusually anemic recovery. this occur despite best effort policymakers stimulate demand aggressive monetary fiscal easing. the extraordinarily poor economic outcome see today underscore importance build financial system resilient ability provide credit household business throughout business cycle. it also underscore importance limit type financial real imbalance develop time prosperity. when balance unwind, cause significant damage financial system economy. a range reform train dodd-frank act initiative implement unite state abroad. within federal reserve system, build robust framework financial stability. and, financial stability oversight council (fsoc), interagency coordination identify mitigate risk financial stability strengthened. a move implement financial reform, dissuade argue cost reform high job simply difficult. i grant everyone is, be, happy reform measures. reasonable people disagree best way achieve certain public policy objective appropriate speed transition. but i think fundamental point financial system need change profound way broadly accept point.  policymakers market participant must acknowledge financial system inherently unstable – prone boom busts, episode destabilize real economy. a consequence, times, must will intervene restrain financial boom order temper busts.  reform undertake way good align economic incentive participant financial system goal financial stability.  we strive achieve degree transparency financial system would enable market participant make inform judgment financial market risk exposures.  the core financial system – major banks, non-bank financial intermediaries, financial market infrastructure – must make resilient adverse shock le susceptible runs. 2 bi central bankers’ speech  recovery resolution regime must effective limit contagion broad financial system major financial intermediary financial market infrastructure come stress.  we must pay close attention component financial system interact. it can’t particular institution infrastructures. market process practice also important. turn first issue financial boom busts, empirical observation make clear financial market inherently unstable. throughout history see numerous sizable boom damage busts. the notion financial market dynamically unstable also support control experiment conduct behavioral economists. now i accept notion minimum degree instability unavoidable. that price society pay maturity transformation service provide financial sector – service produce large public benefits. but i doubt end story – also control amplitude boom severity busts. although impossible attribute instability financial market one single drive force, recent experience suggest many case innovation play important role. i explore point print version remark – purpose discussion today let summarize say innovation initially create real value generate feedback mechanism often fuel development excessive expectation – boom eventually revers basic belief system sustain contradict events. such innovation occur real economy – consider internet – financial sector – think subprime lend structure finance products. although role innovation differ across various boom busts, important common element evident many episodes. early cycle, innovation lead change fundamental valuation creation new market financial products. example might include technology boom follow creation internet subprime lend associate structure finance innovation support house boom. a market participant respond innovation, may cause surge business activity. consider investment fiber optic cable telecommunication equipment late 1990s surge u.s. house demand 2000s. this surge activity drive profit prices, turn sustain boom. a part process, feedback mechanism work reinforce belief importance sustainability innovation. in tech bubble, example, new firm displace traditional provider network effect support scale profitability deter new entrants. in case subprime lend boom, provision credit lead increase demand, push prices, rise prices, turn, hold credit losses. these feedback mechanism reinforce belief sustainability boom, often extend boom far beyond activity level valuation justify innovation change “fundamentals.” the process often come abrupt end, generally basic belief system underpin boom contradict events. in tech boom, price fell earn didn’t materialize firm could achieve sustain first-mover advantages. in subprime mortgage episode, loss experience climb sharply option sell refinance high price long available. with benefit hindsight, inherent contradiction support boom exposed. for example, u.s. house boom unsustainable possible indefinitely keep relax credit underwrite standard qualify new buyer stoke demand. it also unsustainable rise price often lead supply response limit prospect price increases. bi central bankers’ speech 3 another class threat financial stability emerge sudden reversal market sentiment regard economic policy institutional arrangements. this complex issue i explore detail today, note too, early profit often fee pro-cyclical behavior, undermine market discipline. this turn facilitate accumulation private public imbalance painfully difficult unwind finance suddenly stops. when sudden reversal occur, large cost impose real economy financial system, cost fully internalize market participant may benefit boom. the often significant negative externality associate financial market instability suggest regulation prudential standard aim limit frequency extent boom build resilient financial system, le damage bust inevitably occur. the goal use regulation prevent even limit innovation, whether real financial. many innovation generate significant benefit macro-economy. for example, internet, lay heart tech bubble, generate myriad benefits. similarly, innovation financial realm enable business limit risk specialize core competencies, household smooth consumption. this turn enable economy productive. instead, critical objective prudential oversight regulation enhance system financial transaction form reflect assessment risk return borrower lender accurate possible, recognize live inherently uncertain world. this mean reform effort aim strengthen quality information system incentive govern risk-taking institution individuals. and occasion regulator judge systematic understatement mispricing risk may occurring, need find good effective way actively lean dynamics. this include use bully pulpit point particular boom likely prove unsustainable. it also mean ensure market structure investor differ perspective value asset able actively participate. boom tend go ability “go short” limit emerge late game. second, regulation need orient establish standard appropriate throughout cycle – boom period bust. for example, term subprime mortgage underwriting, would include enforce standard respect loan valuation, loan-to-value ratios, household income verification, quality loan documentation. a i argue before, monetary policy often, though always, blunt tool tasks. generally, good develop use surgical instrument design fit particular circumstances. in addition, matter effectively reform financial system, seem unlikely ever able completely eliminate boom busts. there problem identify boom – distinguish sustainable unsustainable. there also broad even subtle obstacle – booms, underway, typically enjoyable. a result, regulatory intervention temper boom normally go unpopular. so practice even activist regulator may struggle act early enough sufficient force arrest boom become bubble. this suggest make financial system secure, go much act temper boom busts. in regard, make financial market institutions, practice structure, le prone amplify propagate shock critical step. this means, particular, regulation design create incentive operate sufficiently long time horizon entire cycle boom bust included. for risk management systems, include use stress scenario place appropriate limit concentration risk exposures. the use value risk (var) model 4 bi central bankers’ speech emphasize recent experience clearly inadequate. in case compensation practices, firm regulator need continue look way tie compensation profitability firm cycle rather short time frames, calendar year, make sure compensation appropriately adjust risk taken. there also need framework ensure collateral haircut high enough provide meaningful protection bad state world even mean keep collateral margin high good times. make progress front would help limit propensity leverage increase loss experience low provide great protection volatility climb market condition become le buoyant. in general, need continue look implement change system practice help dampen pro-cyclicality system, temper amplitude boom busts. attention incentive create infrastructure design also important. poor infrastructure design serve mask obscure participants’ understand credit liquidity risk expose to. a good example triparty repo market, play central role provide fund collateralize basis. this market short-term credit evolve unite state manner transaction lender borrower cover part day – late afternoon early morning. during middle day, two large clear bank supply huge amount intraday credit major security dealers. borrowers’ assume credit would always available them, appreciate rollover risk could expose clear bank decide lend day. similarly, triparty lender underestimate exposure borrowers, believe clear bank would always return fund morning. when triparty borrower encounter fund pressures, assumption starkly call question. the private sector triparty repo infrastructure task force, create 2009, make progress toward objective create stable triparty market, deep change need achieve real systemic risk reduction market. i return subject later. a part financial stability effort, also need build short-circuit mechanism help dampen shock increase resilience. this reflect work underway implement basel iii agreement relate capital conservation buff also capital plan supervisory process. this include requirement financial intermediary cease pay dividend economic circumstance deteriorate. it also include develop systematic framework bank require raise capital ensure adequate resource deal adverse economic scenario – even scenario low probability realized. these innovation design limit behavior saw financial crisis make financial system le robust. bank reluctant cut dividend payment compensation fear would signal weakness. these payouts deplete capital make institution vulnerable deteriorate economic circumstances. similarly, bank reluctant raise capital protect particularly adverse state world. this unfortunate collective behavior bank le prepare adverse state world, often make adverse state world likely. in important sense, poorly capitalize bank generate negative externalities, make entire financial system le secure, cost financial market participants, whereas reverse true well-capitalized bank. a note earlier, another important step increase transparency throughout financial system. there least two important element this. first, regulator need comprehensive access information financial institution market oversee – include one may directly regulated. without information, bi central bankers’ speech 5 diagnosis emerge problem difficult le timely, appropriate remedy difficult develop. second, financial institution market participant need access high quality information term financial condition counterparties. balance sheet information include capital liquidity position counterparty exposure would enable financial market participant accurately ass condition business. increase transparency would reduce level uncertainty, contribute risk aversion financial crises. great transparency term balance-sheet activity otc derivative exposure might also helpful reasons. great transparency often unpopular may reduce market power reveal business strategy and, thereby, limit profits. but private loss profit opportunity must balance public good great financial stability. such step reinforce work underway make major financial intermediary financial market infrastructure resistant shock inevitably occur. this include appropriate capital liquidity requirement appropriate risk management practice bank financial market infrastructures. finally, institution get difficulty need credible way enable institution recover or, recovery possible, resolve orderly manner failure one institution doesn’t threaten bring rest financial system. so relative agenda i lay out? in opinion, make good start, long way go. in many areas, identify necessary task general terms. progress figure detail implementation path coordinate effort cross-border basis limited. i would particularly highlight cross-border coordination problem – regulatory oversight national, many financial firm infrastructure operate global basis. effective reform require mutually consistent global standard – international cooperation date good many fronts, progress uneven, devil detail implementation. we need national authority resist temptation favor domestic financial interest interest achieve true level play field globally. and resist urge favor locally control infrastructure global solution would good advance collective financial stability interest. instead work ensure fair access global infrastructures. also, important national regulator access data role regulatory oversight global infrastructure relevant national financial stability agendas. in unite states, i think make progress bolster resilience bank institution tracks. there two element this. the first element increase capital already occurred. the major u.s. bank institution much good capitalize today fall 2008. the increase capital reflect number factor – long period low capital payouts relative income, significant equity raises, well sizable asset disposition shrink balance sheet bolster capital. the fact credit loss abate enable bank release reserve also important. the second element international agreement implement new basel iii capital standards. not basel iii significantly raise tier i capital standard fully implement 2019, also raise quality capital put emphasis tangible common equity. in addition, partner international community process implement capital surcharge large, systemically important financial institution (sifis), 6 bi central bankers’ speech size surcharge dependent size, complexity, interconnectiveness. i appreciate impossible calibrate “sifiness” precisely, valid argument surcharge. the logic behind sifi surcharge failure systemically important institution would generate large shock rest financial system. a consequence, make sense require high capital firm reduce probability failure. in addition, federal reserve’s effort improve banks’ capital plan process evaluate capital disposition context stress scenario – so-called comprehensive capital assessment review (ccar) process – important innovation. most significantly, process induce bank improve capital plan process light potential stress scenarios. it also create enforcement mechanism dividend share repurchase suspend quickly economic circumstance deteriorate. on liquidity side, also progress. u.s. bank bolster liquidity buff basel committee propose liquidity coverage ratio requirement effectively would require large, systemically important bank hold sufficient liquid asset could reasonably conduct operation 30 day without raise new funds. in addition, industry reengineering triparty repo system operate order significantly reduce large intraday exposure two clear bank system. this important because, saw financial crisis, large intraday exposure prove destabilizing. however, i would argue progress liquidity front progress far desired.1 first, many bank remain dependent short-term fund finance longer-term asset counterparties tend flee first sign distress. in particular, money market mutual fund remain vulnerable runs. such run occur even underlie risk remain negligible, make money market mutual fund source instability. just question investor fund manager’s exposure cause fund manager withdraw fund counterparty. this may market discipline, operate way make financial system stable. the sec lead effort reform money market mutual fund industry. second, basel liquidity coverage ratio review ensure accomplish goal without create adverse unintended consequences. it implement somewhat alter form, since proposal lock degree basel iii capital standards. ensure financial market utility (fmus) robust another important workstream number important elements. for example, dodd-frank act provision enable financial stability oversight council designate particular fmus systemically important and, therefore subject tough prudential standards. internationally, committee payment settlement system (cpss), i chair, international organization security commission (iosco), propose comprehensive set operational standard fmus, i expect finalize early next year. we expect principle endorse adopt g20 countries, establish minimum standard important fmus around world. however, progress slow uneven. for example, unlikely g20 country meet goal clear standardize over-the-counter derivative trade central 1 in general, i think progress liquidity inherently difficult capital tough liquidity standard conflict one basic function banks-maturity transformation. saver want hold fund highly liquid, short-term assets. but borrower want lock fund long time periods. bank help bridge gap. push bank hard liquidity side run constraint. bi central bankers’ speech 7 clear counterparties end 2012. similarly, i doubt whether next set industry recommendation reduce risk triparty repo market sufficient eliminate major potential source instability – include inadequate risk management practice lack resiliency dealer default. experience suggest easy market participant agree measure enhance financial stability goal conflict commercial business interests. if private sector fall short instance, public authority may need intervene impose forceful regulatory solutions. i also think scorecard mix respect make financial institutions, practice structure, le prone amplify propagate shocks. on one hand, capital rule ccar process cause bank husband capital good time stress case financial crisis. also, compensation practice improve pay defer long time periods. similarly, risk management practice improved. institution good able aggregate ass risk exposure within short time period stress test mean good understand exposure might perform adverse environments. but task remain unfinished. while progress reform compensation practice welcome, i recognize still much do truly say incentive line way fully support financial stability objectives. we work information front too. consider issue international regulatory access data. currently u.s. bank regulator access consolidate global balance-sheet information foreign bank operate unite state (or vice versa matter). our examiner see data associate foreign firms’ u.s. operations, fit operation abroad. without certain specific type consolidate global information, difficult place u.s. operation foreign firm global context, make inform judgment adequacy firms’ capital liquidity buffers. for example, liquidity often manage global basis, key business line frequently manage globally, even reside multiple legal entity locate different jurisdictions. make progress establish protocol would enable bank regulator share relevant confidential supervisory information cross-border basis would significant advancement. such enhance collaboration offer attractive alternative ringfencing action seek impose local solution risk face globally active firms. similarly, information counterparty exposure broadly available. occasionally, information reveal follow specific stress tests, disclosure incomplete irregular. nor good price information many financial market instrument otc derivative readily available. this may ultimately change otc derivative instrument become standardized, centrally cleared, data associate trade report trade repository – but, note earlier, still lie future. similarly, implement global legal entity identifier standard would enable regulator (and potentially others), easily aggregate information consolidate legal entity basis still work process. similarly, little progress make respect reengineering financial system transmission mechanism act dampen rather amplify shocks. however, i wouldn’t critical here. this particularly difficult work several reasons. first, difficult relate part financial system interact. it require holistic approach evaluation financial system respond shocks. up point, regulatory reform effort focus individual bank infrastructures, rather entire system functions. second, difficult evaluation must extend entity activity operate outside tightly regulate core – including, course, so-called “shadow bank system.” in u.s., responsibility undoubtedly fall financial stability oversight council, 8 bi central bankers’ speech create dodd-frank act. but relatively new institutional arrangement well able perform mission practice remain determined. similarly, international basis, financial stability board undertake initiative evaluate risk within shadow bank system, effort also still fledge stage. finally, turn last issue deal institution run difficulty, progress. in unite states, dodd-frank act (dfa) give fdic authority resolve certain large systemically important financial firms, recommendation federal reserve fdic, treasury secretary make certain determination consultation president. among things, dfa enable fdic establish bridge institution critical activity could move failure major institution unduly disrupt provision key financial services. dfa also authorize federal reserve require institution develop recovery resolution plan – plan must acceptable federal reserve fdic. the need produce plan likely create incentive rationalize complex corporate structure and, presumably, make resolution easy implement. but major challenge remain implement resolution effectively cross-border basis. the legal rule regulatory regime differ across legal jurisdictions. so, multinational bank organization become insolvent, subsidiary affiliate must resolve multiple bankruptcy proceedings, prospect inconsistent treatment large necessary loss aggregate. although financial stability board take issue, legal impediment progress significant despite best effort intention regulators. the difficulty implement efficient cross-border resolution one reason large globally active firm ask hold additional capital. in conclusion, let emphasize importance mission – reform good regulate global financial system perform key financial intermediation function funnel save investor borrower even adverse circumstances. clearly, financial system 2008 woefully inadequate relative mission. both official sector private sector responsibility respect work remain ahead. it fall u regulator seek minimize cost adjust unforeseen consequence reform become apparent, mindful adjustment cost challenge face many firm markets. in particular, need understand best thread reform effort interact within one integrate global financial system. we also need ensure that, law give u latitude, compliance cost calibrate commensurate financial stability benefit generate particular reform measures. in respect, must particularly sensitive burden regulatory environment place smaller, le systemically important institutions. but private sector responsibility too. bank leader industry trade group propose smart solution achieve essential financial stability objective simply lobby change. the industry interest healthy financial system withstand shock adverse economic circumstances. more statesman-like engagement warrant welcome. thank much attention. i happy take questions. bi central bankers’ speech 1 prasarn trairatvorakul: manage emerge market challenge –

spillover global economy speech mr jean-claude trichet, president european central bank, bretton wood committee, international council meet 2011, washington dc, 23 september 2011. * * * lady gentlemen, it four year outbreak global financial crisis, three year collapse lehman brothers, stark reminder much financial integration globalisation make economy interdependent. this interdependence create benefit also adverse spillover may arise domains, inadequate macro policy choice private market imperfections. i focus today two key area policy interest address spillover global economy: (1) reform global finance, (2) strengthen policy discipline domestic global level, turn euro area contribute global stability. 1. reform global finance at pittsburgh summit 2009, g20 leader agree “to everything need repair financial system maintain global flow capital”. the november 2011 g20 cannes summit take stock stand term implementation important reform agenda. in number areas, important decision already taken, notably regard improvement bank capital agreement basel iii, development macro-prudential frameworks. in areas, close conclude work, particular regard new global framework systemically important financial institution (sifis). in area decision already take international community, implementation key. the g20 yesterday commit full implementation basel iii along agree timelines. the eu already start process early european commission put proposal table so-called capital requirement directive iv, translate basel iii legal framework eu member states. in term macro-prudential framework, european systemic risk board start operation year. all jurisdiction must ensure timely implementation ensure do everything make difference regard resilience global, regional national financial systems. let briefly highlight three key area need stay commit swift progress essence. the first challenge may come shadow bank sector. the introduction stringent capital requirement may provide incentive bank shift part activity outside regulatory realm. it therefore decisive continue work improve capacity identify ass potential risk stem shadow bank system. this include regulatory reform money market funds, securitisation interaction bank sector. the second challenge keep pace financial innovation. improve otc commodity derivative market key part agenda, it complex matter one alignment detail essential avoid regulatory arbitrage. 2 the third challenge enhance transparency across board: regard markets, institutions, products. insufficient information contribute mispricing risks, mistrust among market participants, result downturn crises. at october meet g20 finance minister central bank governor discuss iosco “recommendations promote markets’ integrity efficiency mitigate risk pose financial system late technological developments”. 2. improve policy discipline globally aside resilient global financial system, need discipline macro policy lack discipline macroeconomic policy several country lead build-up unsustainable external imbalance financial crisis. there still gap degree economic integration willingness policy maker take account interdependence spillovers. keep one’s house order long sufficient integrate world. spillover rest world influence economy considerably. multilateral surveillance enhance along two tracks. the informal g20 track formal imf track. the g20 framework strong, sustainable balance growth, incorporate first systematic multilateral assessment global imbalances. it come appropriate time four year crisis, global imbalance remain unsustainably high. the sum current account balance (in absolute terms) major economy project remain close 2.5% world gdp next years. this le pre-crisis peak (over 3% world gdp), still twice high early 1990s, acceleration financial real globalization. it foremost importance implement framework effectively, fully live expectation g20 process raise internationally. the g20 cannes summit provide litmus test. multilateral surveillance domestic policy systemic country ensure orientation towards medium term stability sustainability strengthen imf well. the recently conduct first round imf spillover reports, consolidate multilateral surveillance report imfc current triennial review imf surveillance see useful step towards broad comprehensive framework. 3. strengthen governance euro area the need strengthen discipline understand strongly side atlantic, euro area part contribute global stability. the early economic governance framework prove insufficiently bind lack appropriate comprehensiveness. the requirement significant reinforcement fiscal surveillance stability growth pact creation new surveillance competitive indicator macroeconomic policy discuss widely much detail euro area authorities. we embark deep comprehensive reform economic governance reinforce economic policy coordination. the govern council ecb call “quantum leap” economic governance euro area. this include particular (i) great automaticity sanction mechanisms, particularly stability growth pact (ii) well truly independent fiscal economic analysis macroeconomic imbalances. bi central bankers’ speech 3 the recent conclusion negotiation european parliament eu council economic governance reform package welcome. fiscal surveillance become strong coherent reinforcement stability growth pact. while fall short quantum leap ecb advocating, agreement strengthen initial commission proposal many way thus step right direction. the eu budgetary framework also strengthened, include introduction fiscal rule national level. the so-called “european semester” expect provide ex-ante integrate guidance member state formulation national budget structural reform follow year. this complement introduction macroeconomic surveillance procedure, close important gap economic governance framework. it key framework rigorously applied, include term indicator used, order consolidate effectiveness new procedure ass particular euro area member state experience sustain loss competitiveness large current account deficits. the focus need prevention situation create risk economic, budgetary financial stability euro area. in addition, macroeconomic surveillance procedure rely transparent effective trigger mechanisms. conclusion let conclude three key message policy maker – advance emerge market economy alike – role play address challenge ahead us. first, already decide implement expeditiously, comprehensively fully. this require resolve fortitude part public authorities, also lucidity part private sector. second, complacency regard unfinished part reform agenda strong international financial architecture. and i cannot help say top clearly identify international community urgent issue discussion financial stability board g20, far understand potential global systemic instability associate today sheer size non-banking sector experience exponential growth last 20 years. third, regard euro area sovereign debt crisis, euro area currently epicentre, euro area central banks, ecb particular, permanently call sound economic policy management, particular fiscal domain, structural reform reinforce economic governance. a independent institution devote stability medium- long-term oriented, anchor stability confidence. this especially valuable turbulent market environment witness characterise acute tension sovereign signature cause negative spillover others. only week ago, central banker meet bi headquarter basel global economy meeting. report press afterwards, i stress closely “united purpose”: u economy, different feature challenges, strive solidly anchor inflation expectations, preserve stability consolidate confidence. meet washington, authority opportunity display unity purpose address economic challenge home, prevent negative spillover global economy consolidate confidence world recovery. now, end exposition, might useful tell assessment european systemic risk board express last meet two day ago: 4 since previous meet 22 june 2011, risk stability eu financial system increase considerably. key risk stem potential adverse feedback effect sovereign risks, fund vulnerability eu bank sector, weaken growth outlook global eu level. over past months, sovereign stress move small economy large eu countries. sign stress evident many european government bond markets, high volatility equity market indicate tension spread across capital market around world. the situation aggravate progressive drying-up bank fund markets, availability u dollar fund eu bank also decrease significantly. in context, central bank decide coordinate u dollar liquidity-providing operation long maturities. the high interconnectedness eu financial system lead rapidly rise risk significant contagion. this threaten financial stability eu whole adversely impact real economy europe beyond. look ahead, decisive swift action require authorities. in immediate future includes: (1) implementing, fully rapidly, measure agree upon 21 july meet head state government euro area; (2) adopt sustainable fiscal policy

director, monetary policy, chief economist bank england, south tyneside manufacture forum, london, 21 september 2011. * * * thank invitation speak morning. it pleasure north east opportunity speak forum business leader manufacture sector. a economy recover rebalances towards sustainable pattern growth demand, manufacture export sector generally need play increase role. so i’m really please opportunity speak group company forefront process. the topic talk today one close many hearts. indeed, concern life blood long-term success every one companies. it also central set monetary policy. productivity a know far good i, strong, sustain productivity growth vital ensure company remain competitive global market place. productivity equally important long-term health prosperity economy whole. to paraphrase one economist “productivity isn’t everything, long-run almost everything”. (krugman 1994). productivity matter monetary policy since play crucial role determine supply capacity economy. the balance economy’s capacity supply good service actually demand fundamental driver inflationary pressure medium term, central mpc’s task. the recent behaviour productivity puzzle worry equal measure. the level measure productivity uk private sector today low time financial crisis.1 we three year stagnant productivity. if private sector productivity continue grow average rate see prior crisis around two half percent so, level productivity today would around 9% high (chart 1).2,3 what might account uk’s productivity shortfall? and implication might monetary policy? 1 the private sector approximate exclude employment output data public administration defence, education health sectors, reflect significant proportion sector within public sector. workforce job data sectoral employment scale match aggregate employment level indicate labour force survey. result calculation private sector estimate only. official ons productivity estimate whole economy differ slightly. 2 the productivity shortfall measure term output per head. the scale shortfall would slightly le measure term output per hour worked, qualitative pattern (and puzzles) apparent productivity per hour measures. 3 the uk alone: oecd data reveal several world’s large economy (including germany, france italy) also experience sluggish productivity growth historical standards. one exception us, productivity actually grow rate excess pre-crisis average much past three years. 2 bi central bankers’ speech a i fear may often seem case economist – i’m go offer simple answer. there single smoke gun. rather i think number candidate explanations, likely play role. in next section talk, i’ll highlight three broad class explanation – range relatively benign worry diagnosis – try provide guide relative importance. i’ll discus uncertainty surround recent development productivity complicate set monetary policy. the mpc need form assessment strength supply well demand set policy. i’ll conclude think recent development economy generally affect policy decisions. productivity weakness: reality illusion? so could account recent poor productivity performance? one possibility weakness measure productivity growth may exaggerate true extent underlie weakness. let explain. an encourage aspect recent recession although unemployment increased, rise far le might fear give depth recession. the recent data employment unemployment worry context, unemployment edge summer, previously fall 50,000 peak early 2010. if weaken labour market continue could materially change relationship output employment. but date, company appear hold onto great proportion labour force past recessions. my experience speak business depth recession drive desire retain valuable skill experience. many company learn past experience difficult re-employ skilled worker let go. but consequence labour hoard amount output produce per worker fell sharply, many case partly work hour cut back. and although rebound since then, level labour productivity still recover previous level. this great retention labour suggest firm may sit substantial degree spare capacity. underlie productivity – level productivity would possible worker capital utilise normal level intensity – may continue improve even though measure productivity not. but become apparent demand recover workforce fully utilised. although i place weight explanation, i worry contradict business leader – like – typically say and, importantly, doing. despite apparent hoard labour, respond business survey question network agents, company often say relatively little spare capacity. now good reason company’s notion spare capacity may differ economist, there’s danger over-interpret responses.4 but manager business say, also doing. over past year, despite sluggish output growth, private sector employment increase almost half million people – strong increase 4 a note august 2011 inflation report, one possibility survey capture companies’ immediately available capacity rather long-run capacity. so company may report pressure relative capacity use immediately little additional cost, excluding, example, production line temporarily mothball recession, could reactivate demand increases. bi central bankers’ speech 3 employment since 1997. it difficult understand firm increase employment significantly exist workforce fully utilised. some behaviour may explicable employment growth concentrate sector economy expand quickly, especially orientate towards export sector. but strike pattern rise employment weak productivity common across sector economy (chart 2).5 it also possible firm part economy work flat generate amount business. estate agents, example, try match buyer seller thin house market. or m&a team pitch new business. the extra effort require may explain type company report much spare capacity. but help explain company face type pressure want expand greatly workforces. it hard reconcile number new job create past year belief firm sit substantial margin spare capacity. the recent weakness productivity may also exaggerate sheer difficulty measure economic activity real time. we know early estimate output often revise comprehensive data become available. recent productivity may look le disappoint subsequent estimate output mark up. and indeed, base part pattern past revisions, mpc think current recent level measure output likely revise (chart 3).6 but revision likely provide partial explanation productivity puzzle. for example, gdp revise line path mpc judge likely, would account around one fifth 9% productivity shortfall.7 if labour hoard data revision provide partial explanation recent sluggishness productivity growth, else might account it? difficulty extrapolate past the second explanation might mislead extrapolate previous trend gauge extent productivity puzzle. the past necessarily good guide future. in particular, reason think past productivity growth energy extraction sector financial service sector may provide poor guide recent trend underlie growth sectors. in twenty year prior financial crisis, productivity energy sector grow average annual rate 3%. but pace productivity growth slow markedly past decade north sea oil field age energy extraction become difficult. indeed, since mid-2000s, productivity actually fall (chart 4). in contrast, productivity growth financial service sector increase sharply 10 year prior financial crisis, underpin process financial liberalisation 5 a relate mechanism relate change employment share high productivity sector low productivity sectors. the scale change sectoral employment share date account some, small proportion, productivity shortfall. 6 see box page 22–23 august 2011 inflation report. 7 employment data may also prone revision reflect possible sample errors. headline productivity figure base regular labour force survey households. the workforce job measure employment report business weak recovery date. if lf measure revise towards workforce jobs, could raise productivity per head around 2 percentage points. but survey evidence broadly support lf measure employment workforce job data revise past towards lf measure. 4 bi central bankers’ speech strong growth financial sector balance sheets. it seem sensible – certainly benefit hindsight – think strong growth would continue indefinitely. re-estimating scale productivity puzzle use plausible estimate trend productivity growth two sector reduce size productivity shortfall 2 percentage point – around 9% 7% – majority difference reflect slow underlie productivity growth within energy extraction sector. extrapolate past may also mislead business operate normal level capacity utilisation prior recession. if case, subsequent slowdown productivity growth would simply reflect need company adjust sustainable operate levels. and indeed appear case, business survey point average capacity pressure manufacture service sector prior recession. the imply require adjustment may account around 1% point productivity shortfall.8 take account change productivity trend within key sector economy position economy prior start recession may account around one third productivity shortfall. but even combine factor impact likely upward revision gdp, still leaf sizeable productivity puzzle – around one half productivity shortfall – explain. the third explanation underlie productivity growth weaken impact financial crisis. it notable explanation consistent evidence business survey spare capacity suggest underlie productivity growth manufacture service sector essentially stagnate since start recession (charts 5 6).9 what might account flat line potential productivity? impact financial crisis in account sense, stall productivity growth must attributable one two factors. a slow rate company add physical capital use member workforce. or slow pace efficiency gain associate way company combine capital labour produce output, know jargon total factor productivity. in reality, unlikely slow pace capital accumulation contribute significantly weakness productivity. this largely matter arithmetic. annual business investment flow small relative size capital stock. so even though business investment fell around quarter year follow collapse lehman brothers, remain 20% pre-crisis level, unlikely significant impact stock capital available per worker.10 8 evidence business survey (eg bcc, cbi) bank’s agent suggest capacity utilisation normal manufacture service sectors. qualitative survey balance adjust match mean variance estimate productivity gap inference productivity may drawn. see chart 3.7 3.8 august 2011 inflation report. 9 potential productivity construct use bcc survey capacity utilisation productivity data ons manufacture sector private service exclude finance sector. the bcc survey ask firm whether operate full capacity. since survey measure qualitative, mean variance adjust period 1989 2006 infer measure gap actual potential productivity. the trend show chart 5 6 choose shortfall actual potential productivity map closely mean-and-variance-adjusted survey measure spare capacity. 10 the annual flow business investment prior recession average around 7% uk capital stock. a 20% reduction business investment 5 year would result capital stock around 2% low (assuming plausible assumption rate depreciation). bi central bankers’ speech 5 it possible simple arithmetic underestimate impact fall investment spending, particularly fall concentrate highly-productive form investment. perhaps face deep recession company le will undertake riskier, high-return investment projects, constraint uk bank make le will finance them. but even so, skew would mark material impact quality capital stock.11 the capital stock also likely erode increase level capital scrapping, company force business others scale back operation order survive. although increase level capital scrap likely play role, seem unlikely provide key productivity puzzle. in particular, although corporate liquidation increase recession, increase relatively contain significantly le might fear give depth recession. rather evidence business survey believed, growth productive potential manufacture service sector indeed largely stall recent years, likely reflect slow total factor productivity (or tfp short). i know might thinking: sound like another one unobservable, abstract concept beloved economists, little connection real world. and would point! but think efficiency gains. the fact companies, hone work practice improve internal processes, able increase amount output produce give level labour capital input. do financial crisis recession dampen pace efficiency gain economy, least temporarily? recession actually often credit improve average level efficiency, le productive firm force business others drive productivity gain order stay afloat. only fit – efficient – survive. but recession differ recent experience since trigger financial crisis. banks’ ability lend reduced. credit condition tightened. the implication efficiency company operate potentially far reaching. many small company new businesses, critical source innovation economy, struggle secure finance need grow expand. company start-ups fell sharply recession, evidence bank’s agent suggest many small business still struggle access fund affordable rates. in context, worth recall small companies, employ le 100 employees, hold 40% uk patents, even though account le 20% total investment.12 even company able borrow funds, tighten credit condition likely impede efficiency supply. some company become cautious, prefer hang onto liquidity pay debt rather invest increase level train r&d. the increase cost work capital lead many firm cut back substantially inventory levels, disrupt efficiency supply chains. more 11 the impact physical capital stock would compound extent recession also weigh growth human capital. in particular, employee ability “learn doing” job job relate train likely reduce result decline average hour recession. weale (2010) suggest learn channel could eventually reduce aggregate labour productivity around ½%. 12 “investigating characteristic patent business hold them”, thomas, a., economic labour market review, april 2011 6 bi central bankers’ speech generally, amount management time devote raise finance manage bank relationship increase substantially, divert attention search new product new markets. it impossible quantify precision effect strain within bank system growth productivity past years. but evidence previous period financial turmoil suggest effect might material. in particular, research imf suggest persistent fall tfp growth follow bank crisis account average around one third loss output see follow episode (imf 2009). so leave us? a i warn upfront, i don’t think single, simple explanation recent surprise weakness productivity. some may well get revise away. and may sight set high base past trends. but i also think good reason think recession, particularly impact financial crisis, may dampen underlie productivity growth recent years. at risk state bleed obvious, need bank work economy grow prosper. productivity monetary policy why matter monetary policy? the medium-term outlook inflation depend critically balance demand supply economy. if demand great good service supplied, price tend rise. and vice versa. a such, set monetary policy, mpc need make assessment current future trend supply, well demand. the discussion economic growth typically read newspaper see tv normally pose term demand. be gloom high street spreading? claim counter-claims likely impact fiscal consolidation. but mpc also need consider prospect supply. how quickly capital stock likely grow? and, importantly, recent weakness productivity persist reverse? typically, growth rate factor determine supply potential economy – population, capital stock, structural productivity – far le volatile demand. a such, often natural main focus policy concentrate prospect demand. but judgement supply also matter, particularly aftermath deep recession. in recessions, demand typically fall supply. an output gap open – economy supply currently demanded. and unless gap closed, push cost prices. the job monetary policymakers loosen policy, demand bring back balance supply inflation remain close target. exactly expansionary policy depend critically size output gap. but assess size output gap difficult, exactly reason discuss today. early estimate economic activity revise substantially, hard know weak demand output really are. and equally difficult know extent supply potential economy affect recession.13 this difficultly greatly complicate set monetary policy. indeed, series influential papers, athanasios orphanides (eg orphanides 2003) argue over-estimates size output gap play important role policy mistake lead period persistently high inflation u 1970s 80s. 13 or indeed, shock supply instrumental cause recession. bi central bankers’ speech 7 i hope learn lesson past. take face value, depth recession might suggest considerable spare capacity within economy. and indeed considerable slack within labour market – unemployment rise almost 900,000 since start recession – act contain wage pressures. but degree slack within firm probably significantly le imply shortfall productivity reason i’ve explained. an assessment output gap require evaluation current level supply. but mpc also need form view pace supply capacity economy growing. when face period weak output growth, tempt conclude policy ease order boost pace growth stop output gap widen further. and may well right policy prescription. but much demand boost depend extent weak demand growth match sluggish growth potential supply. if indeed underlie productivity growth economy weak recent past – perhaps due linger effect financial crisis – may well continue yet. to clear, say growth rate supply potential economy permanently scar financial crisis. but rather next two three year – horizon matter monetary policy – shouldn’t automatically assume underlie productivity necessary grow sort rate become accustom past. policymakers need think supply well demand respond weak output growth. recent policy development let conclude brief comment current policy outlook. you may know february august year, i one member mpc vote raise bank rate. a i mention time, vote base nice reason economic recovery look firmly entrench exceptional monetary ease implement height crisis long required. rather, drive nasty reasons. i wasn’t confident strength recovery i worry downside risk growth. but i even worry outlook inflation. in particular, risk continue global price pressures, risk prolong period high inflation would affect credibility monetary policy. and i’ve discussed, grow belief degree spare capacity economy probably le might appear first sight. but i also suggest policymakers approach task considerable pragmatism, downside risk growth materialised, i’d reverse vote. and indeed happened. the outlook demand past month weaken quite materially. consequently, august mpc meeting, i reverse position vote maintain bank rate 0.5% stock asset purchase £200 billion. and show minute publish morning, i vote way month’s mpc meeting. so happen economy past months? the deterioration outlook largely reflect development outside shores. growth world economy, include core trade partner europe us, slowed. concern fiscal position countries, particularly within euro area, intensified. this turn fuel worry uncertainty resilience international bank system. and perhaps fundamentally all, confidence authority ability respond challenge decisive timely 8 bi central bankers’ speech manner diminished. these four factor feed other, lead pronounce downward spiral. the uk catch fallout external developments. the strong growth export see much past year faltered, knock implication growth manufacture output. renew turmoil within financial market lead sharp reduction asset price increase fund pressure banks. and confidence, within company households, take another downward step. the role monetary policy circumstance support demand, help bring inflation back target medium term. and exactly mpc doing. interest rate remain exceptionally low levels. the programme quantitative ease undertake last year continue provide significant stimulus demand. it also noteworthy market interest rate two three year ahead decline markedly past couple months, lead material ease monetary conditions. if economic situation continue deteriorate, additional loosen monetary policy might needed. but decision need weigh backdrop continue high inflation, inflation set climb high next months. and, i’ve emphasise today, also need take account extent slow output reflect weak growth supply well demand. chart pack chart 1: private sector output per head(a) chart 2: private sector output per head(a) 50607080901001101987199119951999200320072011continuation pre-recession trend (b)index:2008q1=100 source: ons (including labour force survey) bank calculations.

financial consumer – global indian perspective need consumer protection – role ombudsman address dr k c chakrabarty, deputy governor reserve bank india, annual conference international network financial service ombudsman scheme – info 2011, vancouver, 21 september 2011. * * * assistance provide shri rajesh verma shri d.g. kale preparation address gratefully acknowledged. introduction mr. douglas melville, chairman info 2011, delegate attend annual conference info, lady gentlemen, it give immense pleasure british columbia particularly, vancouver, beautiful city share think subject occupy centre stage ever since global financial system hit crisis lead concern raise efficacy laws, regulation implementation state objective protect consumer. all ombudsman present may definitely exercise limit role may able play situations. nonetheless, would worthwhile look certain fundamental issue root need financial consumer protection. the focus current international discourse financial sector stability. it may place recall great american president abraham lincoln say “if could first know are, whither tending, could good judge it”. financial sector stability, know, simple terms, absence instability financial system. a policy objective, refer avoidance financial crisis also ability financial system limit, contain deal emergence imbalance constitute threat economic processes. financial sector stability also deep linkage principle financial consumer protection. secure customer a i come india, i would like convey message mahatma gandhi say “a customer important visitor premises. he dependent us. we dependent him. he interruption work – purpose it. we favour serve him. he u favour give u opportunity serve him”. thus, irrespective whether business good bad times, consumer protection central existence business. consumer protection achievable appropriate commercial law open competition. but experience deal provision financial product service indicate law heavily load favour financial service industry. a far competition concerned, implication vulnerable section society. further, legal process tend expensive unaffordable term time money. the good time financial service industry mean expensive service product common person bad time mean inadequate supply even basic financial services. can contradiction balance without consumer protection core? what consumer gain time good financial service industry make suffer today, fault his, industry fall bad times? the disconnect business strategy consumer protection 2 bi central bankers’ speech recipe disaster. when mr. bill gate make famous statement “world need bank need banks” everyone perhaps euphoric would soon breach final frontier banking. but go quite time say good bye banks. the recent past see product innovation product penetration use technology. the challenge pose rapid change product service delivery model ability scale effort regard financial education customer awareness. a financially literate enlighten customer would able good judge suitability product meet requirements. the question i often ask is: “why regulator, concern customer care protection? why leave market force competition take care of?” the answer lie fact service industry market force competition play freely, may well case. however, bank / financial service industry highly regulate service industry stiff entry norms, consumer protection cannot entirely leave market forces. hence, regulator role. availability financial service / product affordable price uninterrupted basis purpose result financial sector stability. responsible marketing, responsible lending, responsible grievance redress mechanism responsible consumer protection mutually exclusive inter-dependent. the public deposit fund available financial service industry represent nation’s wealth. a such, least think protect owner wealth, merely term deposit insurance also term day day transaction contractual relationship consumer bank financial service industry. consumer trust protection always issue interest concern policy maker entire financial industry. the debate become particularly acute last year view recent market developments. in time globalization, new opportunity term new financial products, new instrument technology become available pose new challenge consumer understand risk associate complex products. the current level transparency consequent difficulty consumer identify understand fine print large volume information lead information asymmetry financial intermediary consumer. from perspective policy makers, include reserve bank india financial sector regulators, financial literacy must gauge need population financial institutions, financial resource translate high economic growth minimize financial stability risks. it widely believe complex financial instrument contribute financial crisis essentially basis boom period home loans, credit quality poorly assessed. apart credit quality issue go interest lenders, interest borrower also severely compromise lure complex yet allure deal without assess repay capacity base prospective income net worth. cost irresponsible lend borrow bear ten million tax payer form bailout beleaguer institutions. the financial service industry player need evolve efficient consumer policy must base two main pillars: financial education transparent information one side competition other. these aspect central foster confidence consumer help make inform financial decision select product best suit needs. competition important dimension consumer policy positive impact prices, quality service choice products. wa evident go turmoil global financial service industry? perhaps not. we, therefore, harmonize role regulation, competition financial education achieve twin objective consumer protection financial sector stability. bi central bankers’ speech 3 financial consumer need protection structural disadvantage inasmuch difficulty exercise market power since heterogeneity mass make difficult organize pressure groups. additionally, fix cost procure information high. a great degree protection may therefore make sense. information asymmetry financial service provider customers, especially emerge economies, work advantage former. therefore, transparency rule disclosure regulation should, minimum, seek create standardize comparable information pricing, suitability product different population groups, term condition risk customer supervisory authorities. full disclosure quality information combine mechanism ensure client properly understand information provide impact personal financial decisions. for country bank formal institution still emerging, consumer protection measure must top priority. in case target client group come vulnerable low income segments. this major challenge credibility sustainability whole financial sector. if properly addressed, problem face consumer could lead long-term mistrust formal financial institution loss confidence bank system. it is, therefore, imperative consumer benefit level security protection, whatever institution operate with. unchecked market force lax policies, combine relax regulatory oversight, result customer exploit effort open financial market serve bottom pyramid make financial inclusion measures. while financial inclusion necessary pre-condition financial stability inclusive economic development, negativity may affect poor ill-informed new customer enormous – high level indebtedness due excessively high price predatory lending, complete loss save asset create loan collaterally charge banks. hence, financial service industry cannot blindly follow strategy customer acquisition without provide new access new customer use ict lead financial inclusion model brick mortar structure business correspondent model. these initiative must see cost need reckon investment necessary business stability. it important highlight customer right responsibility also. while financial service provider ask relevant question prospective customer ensure propose product service appropriate accord need means, customers’ responsibility also provide relevant, complete accurate information financial situation take personal well financial circumstance account make decisions. the responsibility financial service provider may, therefore, read assess light customer’s responsibilities. financial service provider need understand business survive, customers’ must survive that, need understand appropriateness product able explain customers. the financial entity must use vulnerable section cross-subsidize clientele power bargain command price choice. the reasonableness service charge / interest rate must ensure way commitment cause financial inclusion. further, service charge / penalty must disproportionate level default. the bundle product bank view generate non-interest income would fall category exploitative pricing. every bank / financial service provider, order expand customer base, need understand requirement customers, risk involve return achieved. the usa, affect crisis, had, aftermath crisis, initiate exemplary policy structural reform guard financial instability (dodd–frank wall street reform customer protection act). among measure initiated, customer protection aspect receive prime attention result enactment 4 bi central bankers’ speech customer protection act creation customer financial protection bureau (cfpb) assure market financial product service work fair, transparent, competitive manner subject meaningful consistent oversight. in india, set financial stability development council also similar view strengthen institutionalize mechanism maintain financial stability way macro-prudential supervision together focus developmental aspect customer protection, viz. financial literacy financial inclusion. where bank ombudsman come the role ombudsman adjudicate financial consumer dispute onerous recent upheaval market place heighten consumers’ expectations. the existence legal framework must consumer protection. the ombudsmen, definition, deal individual grievance common person agitated. they cannot substitute effective legal regulatory systems. expect bring systemic improvement sustainable nature resort class action may expect much schemes. the ombudsman scheme achieve two important objective viz., timely disposal grievance continue relationship financial service provider consumer. while court law decide case finality, many time bring contractual relation end, decision award pass ombudsman generally implications. what need do constant interaction law makers, regulators, standard & code set body ombudsman sort systemic issue may lead individual grievances. the regulator also need aware responsibility protect vulnerable section poor matter pricing, fair treatment, non-discriminatory approach consumer care transparency deal customers. very often, ombudsman bogged issue jurisdiction, either pecuniary physical. this hind encourage conciliatory approach redress grievances. we cannot leave care market force competition expect serve cause consumers. the standard code set body must evaluate quality effectiveness consumer care measure include financial education initiative take service providers. the ombudsman need move office spread awareness exist redress system available within framework financial service industry. all initiative must aim empower customer able make study reasonable choice financial product service. the effectiveness ombudsman judge number complaint handle every year case result bring sustainable continuous systemic improvement. in age networking, forum like info play important role broaden outlook understand issue local well global perspective. while globalization share success improve market competition, also expose limitation national regulator protect consumer action arise trans-border transactions. hence, ombudsman part info regulator must adopt high level principle financial consumer protection put public domain g-20 oced. what india in india, bank industry, follow broad structure consumer protection underpin deposit insurance.

share idea among industry, compliance practitioners, regulators, law enforcement agency relevant stakeholder contribute towards enhancement framework initiative combat financial crime preserve financial macro-economic stability. with that, i wish thank kind attention wish productive conference. daniel k tarullo: industrial organization systemic risk – agenda research speech mr daniel k tarullo, member board governor federal reserve system, conference regulation systemic risk, federal reserve board, washington dc, 15 september 2011. * * * in previous speech i call researcher devote attention investigate economy scale scope financial services. this conference provide ideal occasion audience elaborate request and, indeed, expand suggest broad range topic question perspective industrial organization (io) may relevant financial economist probe nature systemic risk cause financial crises. before address subject directly, let take minute place context change regulatory focus motivate financial crisis. the familiar, “microprudential” approach regulation focus risk within individual firms. the ability borrow risk-free rate confer deposit insurance, combine limit liability standard corporate structures, present bank incentive take socially inefficient risks. this well-known moral hazard problem traditionally address regulation supervision direct specifically protection deposit insurance fund. thus, example, traditional bank hold company regulation actually fairly narrowly defined: it seek protect insure depository institution risk uninsured affiliate limit use insure deposit fund activity part hold company. the potential effect individual bank’s behavior financial system whole – much le bank hold company unregulated financial firm – generally address prudential regulatory law unevenly consider supervisory practice. of course, picture quite monolithic i portray it. the moral hazard associate too-big-to-fail institutions, worry researcher handful supervisors, concern touch upon stability financial system generally. and prescient observer many year call complementary, “macroprudential” approach financial regulation consider effect financial condition of, action take by, individual actor financial system whole.1 but far dominant feature pre-crisis regulation. since crisis, academic work regulatory reform give much prominent place macroprudential regulation. the dodd-frank wall street reform consumer protection act (dodd-frank act) introduce variety new policy levers, include capital surcharges, resolution plan requirements, consideration systemic risk effect review rule application merger among financial firms, even ability require reduction size scope large financial conglomerates. at conceptual level, effective implementation policy tool require incorporate systemic risk normative framework constitute socially efficient outcome. the goal macroprudential regulation require firm internalize 1 in 1979, bank england publish report define macroprudential regulation approach concern “problems bear upon market whole distinct individual bank, may obvious micro-prudential level.” see “the use prudential measure international bank markets,” october 24, 1979, pp. 1–2, bisa 7.18(15) – paper lamfalussy, lam25/f67. see also bi quarterly review, march 2010, pp. 59–67 early use term “macroprudential.” bi central bankers’ speech 1 externality impose stability financial system whole. thus, need way incorporate systemic externality model firm investor behavior inform regulatory supervisory policies. at time, evaluate cost associate systemic events, nature relatively rare, light basic goal promote productive efficiency, access credit, financial innovation. here – fill analytic framework – perspectives, questions, conclusion io literature may usefully applied. many financial market far perfectly competitive. instead, characterize large firm significant market share sustain positive economic profits, fact always reflect financial analysis regulation. yet io economists, study variety topic arise concentrate market structures, generally focus area financial markets, important limit exception competition issue commercial banking. i would venture guess peculiarity financial market motivate evolution entire subdiscipline economics complicate application conventional io learn markets. this i believe interchange io finance researcher important. while much interchange i mind simply add nuance exist work, must recognize early find optimal market structure regulatory policy may hold researcher incorporate systemic risk consideration normative standard constitute efficient outcome. a specific regulatory proposal acquisition considered, may well identify tension traditional io approach antitrust regulation, one hand, goal maintain stability financial system, other. in remainder talk, i discus three topic io literature seem promise systemic risk research: first, need deep understand scale scope economy production financial services; second, way pattern competition cooperation among large financial firm affect systemic risk; third, market structure affect firm incentive thereby impose externality financial system. scale scope economy financial service well financial crisis arrival federal reserve, i find relative dearth empirical work nature economy scale scope large financial firm hind development execution optimal regulatory supervisory policies. some regulatory feature add dodd-frank act increase importance work fill understand social utility largest, complex financial firms. ultimately, want understand scale scope economy imply degree large size functional reach across many type financial activity essential efficient allocation capital liquidity international competitiveness domestic firms. significant economy scale term production cost demonstrate service relate payment networks. generally, though, even intuition suggest economy area – breadth security distribution network ability provide form finance significant amount – evidence existence economy limit mixed. moreover, even significant scale necessary achieve certain economies, important question minimum efficient scale – or, perhaps realistically, minimum feasible scale – actually is. it possible firm would need quite large diversify achieve economies, still large diversify today’s firm become. there promise line inquiry begin academics, include funding-cost advantage enjoy large firms; possible diseconomies scope result firm 2 bi central bankers’ speech complexity; effect market concentration firm size intra- inter-firm diversification. a i note earlier, also considerable amount work scale economy commercial banking.2 however, need do subjects. indeed, policy perspective, value scholarship do date may limited. for example, funding-cost advantage fact derive market perception large firm too-big-to-fail, phenomenon really one competitive advantage ground moral hazard, one true efficiencies. similarly, use profitability large firm surrogate efficiency – find study – would helpful policymaking researcher find way control possibility high revenue associate market power branding. let illustrate two example issue scale scope economy relate increase regulatory emphasis systemic risk. first federal reserve’s review propose merger acquisition bank hold company act. of course, economy scale scope always play part analysis competitive effect propose mergers. but dodd-frank act require also consider whether propose merger would lead great concentrate risk financial stability. consider, instance, would evaluate financial stability effect propose merger two medium-sized institutions. among things, would need ass expansion acquire institution’s systemic footprint. then, would balance potential increase cost across system institution fail potential benefit either less likelihood failure or, respect essential financial functions, great capacity step fill gap one firms’ large competitor fail. in perform kind analyses, draw extensive work systemic risk already do connection development capital requirements, designation systemically important firm financial stability oversight council, matters. it important note that, congress instruct u consider extent propose acquisition would pose great risk financial stability, clearly instruct u reject acquisition simply would increase risks. instead, appear instruct add increase systemic risk list adverse effect could result merger determine whether benefit public acquisition outweigh adverse effects. if, example, indication scale scope efficiency would gained, anticipate adverse effect systemic stability could expect great impact ultimate decision. if, hand, genuine scale scope efficiency realized, complicate set trade-off may needed. the develop knowledge economy scale scope large financial conglomerate becomes, nuanced analysis effect able make. the new authority orderly liquidation systemically important institution second example systemic regulation understand scale scope important. at least advocate orderly liquidation regime seem favor resolution plan silo activity much possible. however, presence significant economy scope, approach might result loss efficient form organization. in circumstances, resolution plan seek preserve scope economy even firm dismember might result good liquidation outcomes. in addition, siloing activity context resolution plan could affect day-to-day operation normal time might 2 for review recent literature topics, see financial stability oversight council (2011), study effect size complexity financial institution capital market efficiency economic growth (washington: financial stability oversight council, january). also see, loretta m (2010), “scale economy bank financial regulatory reform,” federal reserve bank minneapolis, the region, vol. 24 (september), pp. 10–13. bi central bankers’ speech 3 reduce efficiency prevent firm realize economy scope, result increase cost financial service household businesses. both example suggest regulator might, certain instances, require make trade-off systemic risk efficiency considerations. an additional concern would arise country make trade-off limit size configuration financial firm systemic risk reason cost realize genuine economy scope scale, country not. in case, firm first group country might well competitive disadvantage provision certain cross-border activities. the existence international agreement basel committee bank supervision’s capital surcharge systemically important institution allay concern but, depend national choice associate systemic risk mitigation, might eliminate it. but i get ahead thing here. return start point, i reiterate importance research agenda lie precisely determine significant trade-off might be. the event past year make brutally clear potential societal damage associate systemic risk. considerable work already do academic policymakers develop systemic risk metrics, thus lay groundwork sound macroprudential regulatory measures. a counterpart country move forward implementation measures, complementary stream work scale scope would substantially enhance efforts. i recognize study scale scope economy large financial conglomerate present practical challenges. the small number large diversify financial firms, difficulty delineate specific activity interest, problem measure economic cost complicate undertaking. so too, disentangle real economy fund advantage associate moral hazard, supra-competitive profit associate concentrate industry structure, may easy. perhaps, then, short term, research community regulator may benefit case study inform direction future research. cooperation competition among financial institution the second topic i want address today impact financial stability simultaneous competition cooperation among large financial institutions. the io literature give u example limit cooperation otherwise compete firm increase social welfare. in models, cooperation overcome resource constraints, limit information, externalities, thereby induce welfare-enhancing investment would undertake firm act individually.3 large financial institution come together provide infrastructure service exchanges, clearinghouses, even information provider markit partners. other form cooperation among moderate-sized institutions, syndicate lend underwrite partnerships, serve reduce information costs, overcome resource constraints, diversify risk. in antitrust terms, practice i mind would subject rule reason analysis ass potential increase social welfare limit cooperation negative direct spillover effect competition. the industrial organization literature show endure cooperation likely firm interact repeatedly observe others’ behavior. in order model cooperation among large financial firms, however, additional factor need incorporated. unlike firm depict much io literature, financial conglomerate 3 see, example, robert h. porter (1995), “the role information u.s. offshore oil gas lease auctions,” econometrica, vol. 63 (january), pp. 1–27. 4 bi central bankers’ speech transact one another continual basis enter contractual arrangement impose future obligations. in words, cooperation often institutionalize day-to-day operation give firm depend crucially institution cooperates. this, course, one – though – reason systemic crisis recur feature financial system. understand role cooperation among financial conglomerate interconnect counterparty relationship correlate exposure may challenging, could quite important effective macroprudential regulation. cooperation among large firm can, principle, buff impact systemic events.4 on hand, expectation future cooperation one’s competitor induce risky behavior part individual firms. and, perhaps troubling, sudden breakdown cooperation systemic event accelerate transmission adverse consequence throughout financial system. regulator must consider new resolution framework create dodd-frank affect market participants’ belief happen case distress large financial institution and, consequently, cooperative behavior among financial counterparties might change. orderly liquidation authority understand “credible threat” part regulator allow trouble institution fail. resolution plan requirement may allow firm good anticipate consequence failure and, result, reduce cost uncertainty firms. both feature dodd-frank have, theory, potential weaken implicit cooperative arrangement crisis. even so, game theorist would point anticipate breakdown cooperation future would alter type arrangement firm would will enter first place, could, turn, reduce risky behavior likelihood crisis would occur. this obviously complex issue, potentially different conclusion depend context specific regulatory system industry structure. but pursuit line inquiry might yield notable policy implications. that is, understand systemic resolution mechanism could maintain, reduce, reverse incentive engage might otherwise socially desirable cooperation could affect optimal design mechanism element financial regulation. market structure externality the third topic i want mention today systemic risk may affect interaction market structure externality firms’ incentive odds social efficiency. the io literature identify example which, depend circumstances, concentrate market structure exacerbate, reduce, even create new negative externalities. while finance literature extensively study externality associate various form intermediation, researcher begin explore optimal behavior firm’s perspective might shape competitive environment how, turn, aggregation firm decision various environment could affect economy-wide risk. one particularly promise area inquiry relationship among industry structure, firm incentive diversify risk, systemic risk. in principle, large firm good able diversify balance sheet thereby insulate idiosyncratic risks. however, researcher argue financial system dominate large firms, result may large firm balance sheet 4 bruce i. carlin, miguel sousa lobo, s. viswanathan (2007), “episodic liquidity crises: cooperative predatory trading,” journal finance, vol. 62 (october), pp. 2235–74. bi central bankers’ speech 5 highly correlated, create significant common risk exposures.5 in instances, common shock class asset hold large firm could expect systemic effect combination domino fire-sale effects.6 there would considerable value research explore potential tradeoff industry structure relatively smaller, le diversify firm prone idiosyncratic failure versus industry structure large, diversify firm individually le vulnerable idiosyncratic failure collectively likely create systemic risk common exposures. one imagine strand io literature provide insight apply financial sector. let suggest couple possibilities. first subject financial innovation. this audience hardly need remind certain form financial engineer lay heart recent financial crisis. indeed, analysis practice yield important finance work last years. the observation form financial innovation profit-maximizing individual firm pursue them, simultaneously increase systemic risk, parallel io research. work area show competitive structure industry create incentive socially suboptimal behavior through, example, inefficiently low level information acquisition excessive product variety. in think issue, i also remind old work product differentiation may substitute price competition concentrate industries.7 we unlikely see renew use specific financial product precipitate amplify financial crisis. but financial regulation face ongoing challenge try identify respond new practice increase systemic risk, suppress financial innovation improve efficiency capital allocation. in furtherance regulatory objective, could useful complement finance research inquiry whether industry structure competitive factor act increase, possibly dampen, risks. my second example researcher might usefully draw io insight incentive-based compensation practice financial firms. there widespread agreement high-powered, short-run incentive compensation structure finance professional prior crisis may induce take certain kind risk detrimental shareholder firms, overall financial system, both. while firm already change compensation practices, initiative response guidance board, complexity issue require continue attention.& these effort might advance adapt lesson io literature competitive force affect way individual firm solve principal-agent problems, decision affect economy-wide risk aggregate across firms. conclusion in respects, talk today financial regulator’s wish list research intersection io finance, intend complement formidable finance research agenda already generate display conference. some item list – scale

bankers’ speech 1 timothy lane: curb contagion – option challenge build robust financial market infrastructure remark mr timothy lane, deputy governor bank canada, society worldwide interbank financial telecommunication annual sibos conference, toronto, ontario, 19 september 2011. * * * introduction good afternoon and, guest abroad, welcome canada. this conference take place trouble time. concern sovereign debt intensified, particularly europe’s periphery. economic growth unite state advance economy appear significantly weak expected. in face developments, mount skepticism number country whether policy-makers able take address problems. the current bout turbulence, like financial crisis three year ago, serf reminder fundamentally important resilient financial system. period market turbulence fact life. in resilient system, financial shock absorbed, create loss individual investors, leave system intact. if system sufficiently resilient, however, shock amplified. we saw 2008, loss relatively small segment u.s. house market cascade near-meltdown global financial system. that process reflect mixture frailty – excessive leverage, reliance form liquidity prove illusory stressful times, use securitized product risk fully understood, complex web counterparty relationship spread risk breed fear core fund markets, absence resolution mechanism deal insolvency systemically important institution without endanger entire system. in wake crisis, leader g-20 country launch broad agenda reforms. these reform aim ensure financial institution adequate level loss-absorbing capital liquidity cope period market stress; establish robust financial market infrastructure; develop strong resolution mechanism financial institutions, particularly across borders. when implemented, g-20 reform create resilient global financial system. canada benefit significantly reforms. even though financial system perform much good crisis many advance countries, certainly immune event beyond borders. in talk afternoon i want focus one element g-20 reform agenda: build robust financial market infrastructure. that infrastructure include number components: payment security settlement systems, trade venue exchanges, information price providers, collateral management systems. for part, key element function well crisis, fact source strength. just onset crisis, cl bank, settle foreign exchange transactions, successfully process roughly three time normal daily volume transactions; cdsx, clear settle trade canadian-dollar-denominated debt securities, handle double normal volume. efficient clear settlement system able perform stabilize role crisis. that exactly intend do. the crisis did, however, illuminate key area financial market infrastructure need broaden put good use. here, i talk expand use central counterparties ccps replace bilateral clear settlement number core markets. in presentation today i go review bilateral clear contribute contagion financial crisis, describe great use resilient 2 bi central bankers’ speech financial infrastructure need tell ccps strengthen financial system. ccps particular interest u bank canada responsible oversee systemically important financial infrastructure affect stability canadian financial system and, therefore, health economy. what happen robust market infrastructure place? during crisis, two stark illustration great use financial infrastructure needed. the crisis start end follow shortcoming bilateral clear settlement, channel problem obscure part u.s. house market cascade global crisis. although familiar stories, illustrate need change. one instance near-failure bear stearns. bear stearns wasn’t one large investment bank unite states, one leveraged, large broker-dealer proprietary operations. it play pivotal role global repo market, hold collateral transaction act counterparty repo financing. when firm’s mount losses, extensive leverage reliance potentially unstable short-term fund market threaten cause failure, risk bear stearns’ collapse would cause serious disruption repo market – core fund market. anticipation disruption bear stearns’ operation lead cash investor collateral provider alike withdraw, initiate process leverage reduction asset sales. fund condition collateral provider deteriorate sharply, liquidity efficiency relate market severely affected. in event, bear stearns rescue immediate threat averted, danger real. a second instance relate lehman brother role counterparty myriad bilaterally settle over-the-counter (otc) derivative transactions. lehman’s default doubt raise viability remain investment dealer strike heart fund otc derivative market. the strain broaden general evaporation market liquidity retrenchment risk. in cases, basic problem counterparty risk associate financial contract clear settle bilaterally. holder bilaterally clear repos otc derivative expose market risk associate position take financial instrument themselves, also risk counterparty would unable honour commitment. counterparty risk become key channel contagion, pose major threat global financial system. in contrast, lehman’s derivatives, notably interest rate swap value $9 trillion, clear ccp, successfully manage impact lehman’s failure. what objective reform? at pittsburgh summit, g-20 leader move put lesson learn crisis practice. specifically, call standardize otc derivative centrally clear and, appropriate, trade exchange electronic trade platforms. in addition, trades, whether centrally clear not, report trade repositories.1 effort way number countries, include canada, establish arrangement clear interest rate swap otc derivative previously centrally cleared. in canada, also develop new ccp repo fixed-income transactions. 1 http://www.g20.org/documents/pittsburgh_summit_leaders_statement_250909.pdf bi central bankers’ speech 3 these reform far-reaching effect global canadian financial markets. the move ccps intend reduce complexity network enhance net efficiencies, establish robust risk management practice clear default procedures. since ccps – interpose buyer seller financial market – concentrate risk become counterparty transactions, must stringent risk-management standards. the use sufficiently robust ccps likely increase strength financial system. it also reduce counterparty credit exposure major participants, reflect capital requirement financial institutions. to safely clear contract ccps process must, minimum, sufficiently standardized. and push standardize otc derivative contract important ancillary benefit market function. standardization create liquid, transparent efficient market contracts. it also help set stage shift trade onto exchange electronic trade platforms. the challenge g-20 reform the g-20 objective necessary appropriate, achieve go challenging, several reasons. first, may require development new ccp services, complex time-consuming process. we experience canada connection work underway build ccp repos fixed-income transactions. the canadian industry select canadian derivative clear corporation (cdcc) develop facility. the process create ccp repos canada, although yet complete, instructive. two fundamental requirement ccp adequate robust risk-control system capacity implement them. operational issues, develop test relevant software – ccp participant – interaction exist systems, also take time resolve. the challenge establish ccp repos considerable. but least overall parameter clear. fulfil g-20 commitment otc derivative complex task, require coordination among many stakeholders, wide range possible outcomes. the complexity clear otc derivative central clear otc derivative transaction reduce systemic risk decrease likelihood one fail institution bring others. but, give globalize nature industry, several way make transition ccps. clear could take place large international ccps serve global market (such ice clear, cme lch.clearnet), new central clear service could establish individual countries.2 we see variety arrangement emerging. in countries, japan singapore, new central clear service development. other country likely rely offshore ccps – canada – still evaluate options. the task u ensure emerge configuration ccps achieve significant reduction systemic risk, global level canada. the g-20 commitment set tight timetable develop strategy meet challenge. the selection appropriate ccp strategy otc derivative particularly important issue canadian market participant regulators. to put perspective, canadian- 2 five canadian bank currently qualify direct participant lch.clearnet, primary ccp interest rate swaps. and interest rate swap important otc derivative product canadian market. 4 bi central bankers’ speech dollar otc derivative contract notional outstanding value $9 trillion. moreover, otc derivatives, especially interest rate swaps, closely connect via arbitrage finance relationship financial market canada, include derivative, bond money markets. that’s big enough connect enough disruption would likely result significant reverberation throughout markets. at time, derivative market innately global: example, half trade canadian-dollar interest rate product involve least one party resident canada; canadian-dollar otc derivative product 2 per cent global market. whatever solution adopt must come grip reality – systemic importance otc derivative canada globalize nature market. large offshore ccps serve multiple market give globalize nature market, clear large offshore ccps important advantages. these ccps benefit economy scale and, potentially, provide great scope net risk mutualization. a key concern, however, access. until recently, access limit large financial institution global reach. access broadened, global dealer – so-called “g-14” – considerable entrench advantage settlement costs. those institution direct access offshore ccps would clear indirectly one direct clear members. the primary rationale restrict access risk control. direct clear member ccp require share loss take position event another member fail – require large financial resource wide scope activities. but lie important challenge. in carry g-20 mandate require otc derivative centrally cleared, essential ensure unduly concentrate risk relatively small number institution direct clear member global ccps. these institution spread amplify contagion global financial system 2008. this potential concentration risk several dimensions. first, one direct clear member fails, pose risk ccp direct clear members. second, failure one large institution would pose risk institution clear indirectly it. third, offshore dealer may able use dominance direct clear heighten competitive edge financial market activities, trade investment bank services. that, turn, could lead great concentration business, risk, across whole range activities. so go rely central clear large offshore ccps, direct access broaden manner compatible ensure ccps robust risk controls. indeed, financial market infrastructure standard revise ensure ccps member withstand shocks. there also need ensure indirect clear safe efficient. here, key priority ensure indirect clearers’ position protect appropriate segregation collateral portability position event direct clear fails. the bank canada work international level, co-operation colleague canadian agencies, design measure safe effective use offshore ccps matter located. bi central bankers’ speech 5 domestic ccps while offshore ccps may suitable choice jurisdictions, country decide develop ccps, particularly product important repercussion domestic financial systems. so would advantage build canadian ccp clear otc canadian-dollar interest rate derivatives? first foremost, would straightforward canadian authority – include bank canada – exercise responsibility oversee systemically important financial infrastructure ccp locate canada. we would also good place manage crisis provide emergency liquidity support canadian ccp necessary. while cooperative arrangement oversight crisis management offshore ccps developed, currently discuss international level, work still progress. such arrangement need adequate enable bank fulfill responsibility oversee safeguard stability canadian financial system. a domestic ccp could offer advantage well. it could, situations, reduce – although certainly eliminate – impact canadian market financial shock abroad. it could tailor need canadian financial system support development market expertise innovation. the key question whether domestic ccp would economically viable whether would support financial stability efficiency. we know much otc market global nature that, canadian clear service otc interest rate swap success, wide participation canadian global firm necessary. without that, market could become fragmented, market liquidity could decline domestic ccp’s risk control could undermined. yet another key question whether domestic ccp would adequately address clear need canadian financial institutions. a relate point, canadian ccp would need reasonably cost-effective; otherwise could push transaction offshore, undermine potential benefits. develop link ccps different jurisdiction could help minimize fragmentation market. but establish link would complicate undertaking, risk within link would properly managed. in practice, ccp link exist operation (for cash markets, particular), yet generally accept model could use establishment link among ccps clear trade otc derivatives. in assess best clear strategy canadian otc derivatives, bank canada move forward two fronts. first, work domestic international counterpart ensure global ccps, particularly systemic importance canada, able deliver intend benefit financial stability. second, actively explore possibility develop canadian-domiciled ccp, collaboration financial industry public policy institutions. we must choose arrangement best support stability efficiency canada’s financial system. conclusion we midst enormous financial regulatory transformation, easily sweep set reform 70 years. not issue complex, present cross-border challenge must address global level canada. the bank support objective g-20 reform agenda. reform critical prevent crisis similar 2008 occurring. however, must alert risk unintended consequences. at bank canada, work actively, internationally, ensure propose reform global domestic financial infrastructure substantially improve function financial system significantly reduce systemic risk. bi central bankers’ speech 1 lars nyberg: the esrb – reflection 9 month operation speech mr lars nyberg, deputy governor sverige riksbank, norge bank (central bank norway), oslo, 27 september 2011. * * * the financial crisis start 2007–8 expose serious weakness regulatory system. firstly, turn bank little capital quality capital good enough. furthermore, issue liquidity largely neglect regulators. all address basel iii compromise, slowly implement year come – slowly view countries, quickly accord others. secondly, crisis reveal embarrass weakness eu framework financial stability. the quality supervision vary substantially country coordination within europe insufficient, say least. perhaps even importantly, concept macro-prudential supervision (i return concept while) largely unheard of. to address issues, commission, late 2008, set group (where i honour member) lead jacques de larosière mandate present roadmap strengthen european supervisory framework. the group deliver report march 2009. one main idea creation new institution, eventually come call european systemic risk board subject today. thirdly, crisis make apparent framework resolution fail bank grossly inadequate. although step take address question several countries, lot issue remain solved, particularly relate cross-border failures. but today’s discussion. the eu’s financial trilemma the core challenge face eu conceptually quite simple. in europe, build framework base logically inconsistent idea one single market control 27 sovereign nations. from financial stability point view, definitely recipe success. on contrary, source coordination problem conflict interest among eu countries. this challenge describe professor dirk schoenmaker “financial trilemma europe”. we three goal – financial stability, integration, national sovereignty – two reached. figure 1 2 bi central bankers’ speech until financial crisis, combination financial integration national sovereignty seem work well eu (figure 1). financial crisis consider likely financial stability come far political agenda. in connection financial crisis, however, policy maker force realise increase financial stability come cost either financial integration national sovereignty. in principle, two options.  firstly, federal approach, allow full delegation power eu level, include regulation, supervision crisis management (figure 2).  secondly, abandon idea internal market return system full national control domestic financial system (figure 3). figure 2 figure 3 the de laroisière group opt third way – middle way – reform eu financial system. in term financial trilemma, mean keep financial integration and, time, try find reasonable compromise financial stability national sovereignty (figure 4). somewhat strong cooperation, still rest national sovereignty. figure 4 financial stability national sovereignty financial integration give present european crisis, may well ask whether possible compromise whether another damp squib. only time tell. but within concept, room move towards strong european cooperation. the eu’s new supervisory structure the de laroisière proposal rest two major institutional pillars. the first relate previous “level 3” committees, strengthened, transform authorities, bi central bankers’ speech 3 give much power possible without change european treaty. out come three european supervisory authority (esas), namely european bank authority (eba) london, european insurance occupational pension authority (eiopa) frankfurt european security market authority (esma) paris. we discuss whether three authority could merge one, consider premature. suggest merger might delay whole political process (figure 5). try move three city consider equally impossible. figure 5 the eu’s new supervisory structure the second pillar european systemic risk board, esrb. the main idea esrb look beyond supervision individual institution focus risk relevant financial system whole. there widespread feel supervisor many country could see wood tree – certainly wood countries. so new body work issue systemic part whole europe. a time passed, task become know “macro-prudential supervision”. the institutional set-up esrb legally, esrb independent eu body locate frankfurt secretariat provide european central bank. the president ecb

financial stability eu stem interplay vulnerability public finance certain eu member state bank system, potential contagion effect across union beyond. at last meet september 21, esrb state risk stability increase considerably. i think agree conclusion. over summer, weaken prospect economic growth add difficulties. we face dangerous interplay fragile public finances, weak bank sector low economic activity global eu level – vicious financial triangle. it right esrb put issue top agenda, spite highly political content. anything else would  esrb chair (ecb president) first vice-chair  ecb vice-president  governor 4 central bank  european commission representative  chairperson three esas  president efc  atc chair  asc chair 6 bi central bankers’ speech seriously hurt credibility esrb. it vital politician stick previous commitment whatever else need restore market confidence. to limit potential adverse spill-overs, esrb also discuss improve resilience eu financial system. the esrb highlight importance stress test perform eba, european bank supervisor – least way improve transparency financial system. the esrb therefore call competent authority eu member state contribute clear rigorous assessment bank involved. it also call national private public back-stops put place deal potential need bank capital. last week, esrb sharpen message ask supervisor coordinate effort strengthen bank capital. i find stress-testing useful exercise. i also believe disclosure relevant data important tool build market confidence, reduce uncertainty promote financial stability. however, still room improvement. no doubt macro-scenario could conservative possible contagion bank country could handle better. the esrb important role play construction future stress tests. bank fund vulnerability in june, esrb also point bank fund vulnerability could pose threat financial stability. the esrb note september meet progressive drying-up bank term fund markets, availability u dollar fund eu bank also decrease significantly. in sweden, have, time now, highlight risk swedish banks’ reliance short-term fund foreign currency. the riksbank’s stress test indicate swedish bank good capacity handle big loan losses, take somewhat large liquidity risk many european banks. lend foreign currency the esrb also look risk stem lend foreign currency unhedged borrowers. this risk highlight recent fluctuation currency potential impact unhedged household’s capacity repay loan take foreign currency. in view this, esrb develop policy proposal target credit, liquidity fund risks, well risk miss-pricing loans. in hungary austria problem relate foreign exchange lend become acute due appreciation swiss franc. in sweden, experience excessive foreign-currency lending, excess sweden 1990s and, recently, swedish banks’ foreign currency lend baltic states. challenge – define concept macro-prudential supervision the esrb still new body take time fully settle work. the concept macro-prudential supervision new often interpret differently different people, depend background. an important task esrb therefore make concept precise. what macro-prudential mandate look like? how define macro-prudential tools? what institution use different tools, hold responsible use (or using) them? these important question discuss many countries, europe. one important instrument discuss widely basel framework bi central bankers’ speech 7 countercyclical capital buffer. this instrument clear cross-border effect should, esrb, able discus principle set buffers. – gain credibility a esrb bind powers, need earn credibility principle “comply explain” work practice. a i see it, do three ways. firstly, esrb’s risk assessment recommendation act upon need high quality present timely manner. in this, esrb take advantage unique composition representative eu institutions, well national central bank financial supervisory authorities. this institutional set-up give esrb great opportunity gather relevant information key player eu financial system. for function practice necessary actor will share relevant information esrb perform task properly. however, share information, although simple theory, often turn difficult practice. secondly, risk assessment recommendation need well-understood accepted. this require efficient communication. the issuance warn recommendation one way communicate, either public private. so far, press conference general board’s meetings. under esrb regulations, esrb also require publish annual report. this report present chair esrb european parliament council annual hearing. but clear need develop esrb communication. this important, legitimise work esrb also increase public awareness systemic risk macro-prudential policy. the esrb could make substantial contribution promote discussion field, nationally international level. thirdly, member state must will accept warn recommendation esrb. this may perhaps difficult objective achieve. accept warn recommendation may difficult accept political cost. it therefore vital esrb prof independence express view even politically inconvenient. the “comply explain” principle powerful tool in view, esrb good start might expected, give size composition. it focus identify risks, also suggest handle them. and risk discuss relevant ones, spite political sensitivity. certainly, lot remain do esrb establish work procedures. and remain see able produce normal conditions, present crisis mode. but, properly managed, develop useful institution, force country authority act time avoid difficult dangerous situations. comply explain powerful tool, respected. bi central bankers’ speech 1 erkki liikanen: europe stress – way ahead speech mr erkki liikanen, governor bank finland, atlantic council, washington dc, 26 september 2011. * * * i spend last day imf meet washington. the growth forecast unite state revise down. the do europe mainly due sovereign debt crisis. the u lehman center crisis 2008, europe sovereign debt. europe must see global context. the present problem europe nobody else’s fault, europe dependent happen rest world. that see 2008–2009, visible now. the global economic situation today matter clearly serious concern month ago. one need even refer publish macroeconomic forecast see this. it visible confidence indicator business households. it also demonstrate financial markets, stock market index plummet long term interest rate decrease since last spring. significantly, decrease yield also observe market inflation-indexed debt, suggest really question weaken growth prospect – rather expectation deflation, example. but forecaster’s baseline changed. also downside risk economic performance increased. this great uncertainty see many places. it show gold price soared, know; much importantly, show flight (perceived) quality financial markets. the flight quality predictable consequence current financial conditions: fragility country banks, combine heighten uncertainty regard future. investor react try move fund indebted country “safe havens”. at time, bank increasingly cautious selective lend peer – detriment operation interbank markets. bank prefer deal central bank instead. in short, liquidity preference start dominate markets. a i said, europe general euro area particular become centre attention financial markets. this average condition european economy: indeed, judge several objective criteria, europe bad economically comparable economic areas. in 2011, public deficit euro area around 4.5% gdp, unite state japan 10% gdp. a know, accumulate government debt much low euro area japan, order magnitude u.s. moreover, currency solid. the euro credible currency last 12 year keep value term price stability remarkable way comparison precede national currency previous decades. the stability currency dispute evidence distrust it, long-term yield euro denominate aaa rat bonds, inflation expectation surveys, exchange rate itself, strong vis-a-vis dollar single european currency launch 1999. but course, urgent problem euro area today. but predominantly aggregate problems; rather, problem divergence within area, structural deficit several individual member countries. these come surface time eruption global crisis 2008, yield differential euro area government bond start widen. the problem divergence deficit reveal 2 bi central bankers’ speech serious weakness economic fiscal governance euro area process corrected. this summer witness renew problem market worry effect possible new global economic slowdown europe, time european leader slow demonstrate determination deal problem debt, deficit divergence. in order restore credibility weather even le favorable global economic conditions, europe must move forward three main front time. these front 1) fiscal correction, 2) bank capitalization, 3) economic governance. the necessity convince action area well recognize principle work way. for instance, meet july 21, year, head state government euro area country make number important decision which, implemented, take europe long way towards deal present problems. also, eu finance minister reach week ago (in meet wroclaw, poland) agreement strengthen economic governance procedure euro area. the european parliament vote governance package – call six pack – week i expect force begin 2012. the political process europe sometimes painfully slow. it also complicate confuse outside observer. this nature union. eu entity lot jointly legislate mutually bind norms. but common executive really operative certain limit area only, trade, competition agricultural policy – monetary policy, form ecb. in areas, however, eu operate common executive agency; operate common rules. in areas, competence eu executive – commission – work regulation surveillance national governments’ actions. the structure several national executives, operate union treaty directives, complicate process make norms, explain eu work differently u.s., unitary executive federal level, vest president. the way eu operate often stretch patience financial markets, would like see quick clear-cut decision instead slow negotiation large committee councils. a rule-based system coordination work best rule good, follow enforced, world stable. under condition large surprise shocks, like recent great recession, soft enforcement common rules, eu’s economic governance work effectively enough, major underlie reason present problems. ** i return three front advance necessary restore stability. the first fronts, fiscal correction, mean country fragile fiscal position must correct it, indeed commit do. these country fall three categories. the first greece, actually deem special case now. the new eu/imf adjustment program greece crucial foster sustainable economic growth stabilize public finances. strict rigorous implementation program absolutely necessary. besides fiscal consolidation, privatization measure structural reform agree program essential revitalize greek economy create growth time. bi central bankers’ speech 3 in summit july 21, 2011, head state government make number important decision pertain also greek situation impact european financial markets. first all, agree support new program greece. there also decision enhance flexibility use efsf, include intervention secondary markets, warrant exceptional financial market circumstance risk financial stability. the approach private sector involvement euro area also clarified. it recognize greece exceptional situation reason require exceptional unique solutions. a part voluntary bond exchange program private investors. at time, euro area member country reaffirm determination honor fully individual sovereign signature. the ecb outspoken matter. it make clear advise contribution ask private sector voluntary, case. nevertheless, despite financial support, give form loans, clear task rebalancing greek economy must carry greece itself. besides greece, two country adjustment program, i.e. ireland portugal. these country implement program restore public finance sustainable path. especially portugal need also make structural reform increase growth potential country. i confident program proceed agreed. one might note case ireland least, confidence financial market recently improve already. portugal take positive start. the adjustment program program country europe jointly monitor eu, imf ecb, finance temporary european financial stability vehicle, efsf. the efsf finance issuance bond guarantee european states. because reason, rigorous monitor program country necessary. it important individual country responsible also feel responsible fiscal policies. it also important guarantor country see program implement rigorous way. the third category country constitute two large economies, need support program, subject market suspicion – italy spain. both country serious budgetary consolidation already stability program approve last spring 2011. moreover, summer country enact significant additional measure i think exceed expectation peers. especially italy, large accumulate debt, undertake bold budgetary cuts. both country speed budgetary consolidation implement balance budget rule constitutions. ** turn banking, see market bank happy condition bank system, share decline interbank market work well one would hope expect. in europe, systemic liquidity sector support european central bank continue provide liquidity full allotment basis, broad range collateral, marketable non-marketable. the ecb commit continue flexible method liquidity provision long necessary. and amount collateral available market large enough allow even much great creation liquidity present, demanded. i think main problem bank system recapitalization bank already long overdue. this case throughout world. perhaps task especially urgent euro area, uncertainty regard health bank aggravate negative effect economic imbalance divergence area. 4 bi central bankers’ speech this task primarily shareholder weak banks, refrain take dividend inject capital needed. in cases, government investment bank equity may also necessary. come finland, i understand well political problem involve clean bank system. in 1990’s, great finnish bank crisis, finnish government support asset management company handle banks’ problem assets, amount one point reach 10 per cent gdp. most money late recovered, meantime taxpayer furious. the public frustration cost bank crisis forget country. despite short-term discomfort entails, resolution bank problem necessary u move forward last recovery. on one hand, recapitalization weak viable bank necessary restore confidence. on hand, well-managed closure weak bank necessary, distort market viable banks. an important part decision july 21 euro area head state government use fund raise european financial stability facility agree make flexible. this make efsf good tool support present task crisis management. accord decisions, loan efsf use recapitalize bank – program countries, country well. ** the third front advance eu improvement fiscal economic governance. while fiscal correction front deal present imbalances, governance front mainly direct towards future, order reduce likelihood recurrence deficit problems. of course, credible institution would ensure future stability reflect back present situation well, improve credibility confidence already now. when monetary union plan europe, much debate degree economic convergence country would necessary monetary union. some people think high degree economic convergence necessary precondition, whereas others argue membership monetary union necessity hold would perforce bring necessary adjustment convergence. because insistence germany others, emphasis place economic convergence monetary union established: reasonable entry criterion set membership union, members’ fiscal behavior regulate stability growth pact. now know emphasis convergence carry enough force. in 2005, pact actually make flexible originally, despite resistance ecb. that happen big country face prospect subject eu’s “excessive deficit procedure.” then, shake steep recession 2008, several country get unexpectedly danger zone. the current crisis demonstrate clearly ambitious reform economic governance framework interest european union, members, euro area particular. now, need even tight economic convergence, need good economic governance within emu. we must strengthen economic governance mechanism euro area minimize risk additional crisis government finance future. the “euro plus” pact sign last spring step right direction. the signatory – euro area country eu country – commit several important reforms, implement eu’s budget guideline national legislation. these nationally implement norm could help “internalize” fiscal discipline country render matter le issue eu police countries’ current fiscal actions. the euro plus pact also broaden scope policy coordination. bi central bankers’ speech 5 previously, stress deficit debt; now, competiveness issue (such relative labor costs) financial stability also included. a i already mentioned, eu adopt important legislative package strengthen stability growth pact macroeconomic surveillance framework eu. this package includes, among things, directive budgetary framework member countries. this important call “european semester” – new annual review members’ budget before adoption nationally. the package also make sanction enforce stability growth pact automatic, so-called reverse vote mechanism. both preventive corrective arm stability growth pact make stricter. in preventive arm, policy coordination extend growth rate public expenditure member countries; corrective arm, debt norm (60 per cent gdp) promote equal position deficit norm (3 per cent). also macroeconomic policy coordination strengthen “six pack” legislative package. it include regulation macroeconomic imbalance aim prevent accumulation imbalance loss competiveness member euro area. the imbalance cover include current account deficit surpluses, among things. this policy coordination underpin sanction levy country follow recommendation eu council address excessive imbalances. bi central bankers’ speech 1 yves mersch: financial crisis challenge supervision welcome address mr yves mersch, governor central bank luxembourg, ese (european supervisor education initiative) conference 2011: “financial crisis challenge supervision”, luxembourg, 28 september 2011. * * * lady gentlemen, it great pleasure honor host 2011 european supervisor education initiative conference financial crisis challenge supervision luxembourg. i please note many participant supervisory central bank community attending. i convinced, stimulate input distinguish discussant beneficial participants. the banque centrale du luxembourg, give mandate prudential liquidity supervision role macro-prudential policies, join european supervisor education initiative 2010. against background renew vulnerability turbulence markets, subject conference indeed timely. liquidity risk, together sovereign fund risk constitute time main threat eu-banking system. the recent intensification tension sovereign debt market lead contagion risk systemic nature. from supervisory perspective, let redraw past financial crisis evidence fact micro-prudential supervisory instrument tool alone, use isolate way, may long sufficient address challenge pose financial instability. the need highlight restructure regulation supervision go beyond purely micro-prudential approach regard. focus development macro-prudential framework good position authority contribute reduce pro-cyclicality improve financial sector’s resilience adverse shocks. in response regulatory challenges, european system financial supervision (esfs) established, european systemic risk board (esrb) make responsible macro-prudential oversight financial system whole. the work esrb, found close cooperation central banks, national supervisory authorities, european supervisory authority (esas) policy makers, contribute mitigation systemic risk within financial system. however, despite significant progress institutional architecture european level, crucial area within global national financial system remain fragile vulnerable unexpected shocks. all country face vary degree challenges. in luxembourg still significant gaps, particularly respect institutional reform adjustment model supervision. in regard, i aware perfect supervisory model, nevertheless, must try profit recent experience neighbour country order mitigate systemic vulnerability enhance financial stability. a know, different countries; u.k., belgium, france recently switzerland, adjust model integrated. so would appear self-evident central banks, give role lender last resort responsibility monetary policy liquidity management, play key role safeguard financial stability. however, lender last resort might important backstop period financial turbulences, nevertheless “free lunch”. in order fulfill responsibility effectively, central bank equip clear independent macro-prudential mandate toolbox ass mitigate macro-prudential risk systemic level. this proposal coherent 2 bi central bankers’ speech recommendation de larosière report attribute umbrella role central bank supervisory framework. in regard, must assure national macro-prudential authority flexibility adjust regulatory requirement business cycle. thus, i welcome commission’s proposal regard crd iv particular, countercyclical capital buffer. however, macro-prudential regime must find balance preserve national flexibility – business cycle vary european country – maintain level play field distort competition within single market. a i mentioned, aside institutional arrangements, many challenge remain resolved. the g-20 european commission take initiative address regulatory deficiency highlight crisis. these include basel iii, otc derivatives, shadow bank system, high frequency trading, central counterparties (ccps) crisis resolution mechanisms, etc... such proposal remain early stage still face challenge jurisdictional realities. let focus specific issue may arise new regulatory regime. with respect liquidity, two new instrument propose i.e. liquidity coverage ratio (lcr) net stable fund ratio (nsfr). these quantity intend improve financial institutions’ liquidity risk profile result increase resilience help mitigate fund market liquidity risk. in combination robust efficient supervisory landscape, new liquidity standard also help bolster internal liquidity risk management practices. this issue remain crucial recent sovereign debt turbulence increase level liquidity pressure experience banks. at time, tension foreign currency fund financial institution become acute seem important concern address within context new regulation. go forward national level, bcl see need incorporate ratio current risk-based liquidity surveillance framework rely combination qualitative quantitative elements. in addition, regular on-site visit continuous off-site monitor currently combine five day forward-looking liquidity report banks. the bcl also see need conduct survey study order ass liquidity situation financial institutions. indeed, regard new liquidity ratios, empirical analysis perform luxembourg. the result reveal one-size fit approach liquidity supervision might appropriate give diversity banks’ business models. thus i wonder would useful complement focus financial institution take account activities. therefore, maximum harmonize rulebook, disallow flexibility national level, strike right balance efficient liquidity surveillance increase resilience banks. the issue maintenance liquidity buff national level host entity cross-border bank group shall deserve particular attention regard. it profoundly interest actor new requirement implement consistent timely manner. during transitional period however, analysis require order ensure appropriate calibration. unintended consequence due restrict ability bank manage short long-term liquidity undertake maturity transformation process represent core financial intermediary activity need weigh intend benefits. furthermore, care also take avoid incentivising bank shift activity non-regulated bank system; so-called “parallel” ”shadow” bank sector. currently, preliminary information level interconnectedness regulate non-regulated entity available supervisors. additional work need regard, order improve efficiency financial regulation across market jurisdictions. look forward potential new risk stem micro-structural issue bi central bankers’ speech 3 ucits exchange-traded fund high frequency trading, i mention before, need properly addressed. regard access credit institution central bank funding, eligibility base financial soundness, assess solvency liquidity robustness. it therefore crucial importance central bank access relevant detail micro-prudential information assessment monetary policy counterparts. moreover, assessment cannot dissociate prudential information bank group respective counterpart belongs. this call enhance participation central bank involvement eu college supervisor cross border stability groups. before i conclude, i think would appropriate point increase level interconnectedness financial system bank group highlight need improve cross-border cooperation crisis management. finally, let mention human capital requirement another key area often goes, unmentioned yet important improve quality efficacy supervision. by combine competency skill supervisor central banks, ese initiative certainly contribute enhance convergence practices. under welcome initiative, effort banque centrale du luxembourg continue enhance approach adopt ese initiative. lady gentlemen, i wish pleasant stay luxembourg, interest successful conference. i sure presentation well panel discussion include interest fresh idea insight participant benefit ongoing tasks, local cross-border level. bi central bankers’ speech 1 thomas jordan: doe swiss national bank need equity? summary speech mr thomas jordan, vice-chairman govern board swiss national bank, statistisch-volkswirtschaftliche gesellschaft, basel, 28 september 2011. * * * the complete speech find german swiss national bank’s website (www.snb.ch). the swiss national bank (snb) report heavy loss 2010 first half 2011 due strength swiss franc – or, precisely, due valuation change foreign currency reserves. consequently, suffer substantial reduction equity. understandably situation, concern begin voice public. question often pose context include: might snb lose capacity act result negative equity level? and, equity negative, would snb recapitalised, might even go administration? the short answer question “no”, snb cannot compare commercial bank private enterprises. for one thing, central bank cannot become illiquid. this mean central bank’s capacity act constrain equity turn negative. moreover, unlike enterprises, force implement recovery measure go administration. for another, central bank enjoy fund advantage private companies, owe banknote-issuing privilege. moreover, generate surplus income long term. thus, time, central bank like snb usually rebuild equity level loss. nevertheless, even central bank, long period negative equity without problems, undermine bank’s credibility independence long term. for reasons, important snb maintain sufficient level equity. to ensure snb carry monetary policy mandate without restriction, also long term, interest country whole essential capital base adequately rebuilt. this mean necessary profit must earned, retained. in long run, entire economy benefit. bi central bankers’ speech 1 josé de gregorio: imf challenge policy global economy statement mr josé de gregorio, governor central bank chile, speak behalf southern cone country latin america international monetary financial committee meeting, washington dc, 24 september 2011. * * * in past months, near-term prospect global economy worsen significantly financial risk increased. what time ago modest, albeit unbalance recovery, risk turn new economic downturn, particularly major advance economy (aes). this new scenario pose urgent challenge imf membership term decisive political policy response solve fundamental weakness mitigate negative impact new downturn. against backdrop, fund’s surveillance capacities, well-functioning international monetary system (ims), put test couple year 2008–2009 great recession financial crisis. i. the immediate challenge ahead fund’s policy advice two force influence weigh economic prospect major advance economies. on one hand, uncertainty volatility increase high level since october 2008, constrain credit lead cautious behavior household financial institutions. on hand, fully credible medium-term fiscal consolidation economy high debt burden still lacking, prompt even high sovereign spread call short-term fiscal retrenchment private demand yet recover pre-crisis levels. the policy debate surround appropriate fiscal monetary policy mix, well assessment public debt sustainability, become muddled. it would paradoxical year witness example successful global policy coordination sound financial policies, stave another great depression, lesson learn ignored. the fund provide guidance leadership number issues, membership heed advice. in particular, would like note that:  the political achieve meaningful short-term fiscal adjustment present core aes public sector finance condition benefit flight quality, whereas case acute solvency concerns, thus high spreads, adjustment fatigue dangerously settle in.  the negative growth implication short-term fiscal retrenchment give proper regard global community. the bulk evidence, appropriate risk consideration weak economic environment today, suggest much caution exercise implement short-term fiscal consolidation measures, especially case long-term sustainability public finance threatened.  structural reform fatigue settle in, electorate weary creditor debtor country pursue tough measure ensure medium-term fiscal consolidation containment sovereign crisis europe. moreover, financial market remain jittery final outcome agree commitment forego conclusion.  the risk disorderly outcome high, balance sheet repair, especially bank expose european periphery, bolstered. hop best substitute prepare worst, market well 2 bi central bankers’ speech aware that. more extreme measure debt restructure might unavoidable fiscal transfer rule fatigue settle debtor countries.  in environment financial uncertainty fiscal retrenchment, monetary policy remain supportive. emerge market economy (emes) smaller, financially stable aes, thread carefully uncertain environment, saw year ago, unlikely full decouple occur scenarios. the fund’s advice properly recognize rebalancing challenge across heterogeneous group economies; thus, adequate level differentiation term policy advice call for. in regard, would like note that:  if external scenario worsen significantly, many emes flexible exchange rate inflation-targeting regime would scope adjust monetary policy, thank timely process raise interest rate contain overheat risks. go forward, economy able react flexibly change global circumstance context anchor inflationary expectations.  other emes limit room maneuver, economy expand beyond potential output, widen fiscal external deficits, thus today face risk external shock might unhinge inflationary expectation force pro-cyclical monetary fiscal policy adjustments.  a third group emes maintain structurally high national save rate throughout expansion phase global cycle might subject natural deceleration global economy cool down. in cases, undertake reform boost domestic demand would help sustain medium-term global rebalancing short-term policy accommodation.  economy affect high commodity prices, particularly low-income country (lics), strive develop target policy vulnerable group efficient cash transfers, instead across-the-board subsidies. the international community strive support effort similar measures, demand subsidy export constraint non-lic economy exacerbate commodity price pressures. policy advice fund tailor different group economies. policy recommendation appropriate economy necessarily suitable economies. one salient theme, however, fiscal policy space limit across spectrum run 2008–2009 financial crisis. move broad policy recommendation concrete message policy implementation require draw policy-makers’ attention establish constructive dialogue. the consolidate multilateral surveillance report positive step direction. ii. the medium-term challenge fund’s action plan under current circumstances, fund focus short-term policy challenges. indeed, one main issue fund tackle right now, namely triennial surveillance review, shape directly lesson practice traction surveillance reveal current uncertain environment. such surveillance practice basis revamp surveillance framework, instance, integrate surveillance decision encompass bilateral multilateral aspects. the fund’s resource adequacy is, view, directly link function regional financial arrangement (rfa) existence bilateral central bank swap lines. it welcome major central bank currently cooperate area. a reasonable bi central bankers’ speech 3 question whether current fund resources, plus available rfas bilateral swap lines, sufficient deal significant major financial dislocation. assess resource need critical evaluate whether, instance, new arrangement borrow remain active, even quota increase fully implement next year. moreover, discussion resource would link broad rethink need alternative lend instrument bolster global safety net. this topic give high priority current juncture not, previous imfc meeting, simply part broad agenda ims reform. the activation deactivation, criterion conditionality, flexible credit line similar instrument could reviewed, towards make close substitute bilateral swap line implement major central banks. this would help reduce stigma associate fund’s toolkit, would contribute ensure adequate liquidity provision time market stress. bi central bankers’ speech 1 jean-claude trichet: interview corriere della serum interview mr jean-claude trichet, president european

economy accentuate 2011. gdp growth show decline path first half several activity indicator suggest trend worsen third quarter. furthermore, consensus gdp forecast follow year successively revise downward, least since last march. although world economy still predict continue expanding, basically due high expect growth momentum emerge markets. in particular, unite state advance country expect grow modestly near future, analyst already estimate significant odds imminent even ongoing recession economies. although global economic contraction baseline scenario forecasters, continuation downward revision growth projection advance country would definitively affect economic prospect rest world. 1 for analysis current deviation u.s. output secular trend comparison great depression, see robert e. lucas, jr., “the u.s. recession 2007–201?”, milliman lecture, university washington, may 19, 2011. 2 bi central bankers’ speech possible explanation what lie behind disappoint upturn industrialize economies? a strike feature weak deteriorate nature recovery country occur spite unprecedented expansionary fiscal monetary policy stances. large public deficit result automatic stabilizer mechanism well special tax relief program high government expenditures, include bailouts trouble financial non-financial institutions, aim stabilize financial market promote aggregate spending. in addition, monetary policy remain extraordinarily accommodative recent years. central bank main industrialize country combine remarkably low policy interest rate increase change composition balance sheets. the leader expansionary monetary policy u.s. federal reserve, maintain federal fund rate close zero since end 2008, also implement large purchase government bond private financial asset fund high voluntary bank deposit last four years. among objectives, purchase financial assets, feed seek meet extremely high liquidity demand show public financial crisis and, recently, low long-term interest rate order stimulate private finance investment. other monetary authority implement similar practices. the european central bank participate actively market attempt stabilize sovereign bond price country experience fiscal difficulties. while extraordinary action undertake feed lender last resort 2008 appear contribute effectively normalization non-bank financial markets, impact accommodation central bank aggregate demand le clear. question arise light ambiguous effect monetary policy long-term interest rates, still weak credit channel monetary policy transmission, poor output performance expectations. similarly, net effect fiscal policy spend may weak give policy measure probably perceive temporary, potentially induce save view high tax expect near future finance them. in case, regardless actual effectiveness, presence highly expansionary fiscal monetary stance suggest unsatisfactory recovery advance economy reflect lack stimulus measures.2 on hand, recent negative supply shock affect performance world economy particularly unite states. these shock include bad weather, high oil price partly reverse course, tragic event japan first quarter 2011. yet, independently importance, event transitory and, therefore, extent explain sluggish rebound advance country since 2009 necessarily limited. the previous observation suggest need search existence possible fundamental obstacle strong economic recovery industrialize countries. while current complex economic situation many factor certainly interact, feature stand out. in particular, unite states, seem two important source growth-limiting factors. one sequel financial crisis summarize consumer debt overhang, slow debt restructure foreclose home sales, high risk aversion contingent 2 question effect monetary policy aggregate demand find frederic s. mishkin, “monetary policy strategy: lesson crisis,” nber work paper no. 16755, february 2011. for discussion

aftermath big financial crisis. this impasse contribute explanation virtual stagnation mortgage lend residential construction unite states.3 a second source obstacle unite state appear unintended consequence corrective measure crisis, might result heighten uncertainty. these action include discussion eventual fiscal consolidation term future high tax expenditure cut confront unsustainable path project public debt, implementation new regulation prevent financial crises. to extent, environment uncertainty may partly induce recent reduction producer consumer confidence. additionally, european monetary union (emu) severely affect fiscal fragility member countries, since financial crisis exhibit sharp rise public debt-to-gdp ratios, project path judge unsustainable. some state already receive substantial financial support european community international monetary fund, implement strict fiscal structural adjustment programs. however, perception credit risk correspond governments, summarize spread pay credit default swaps, continue portray deteriorate trend observe since 2010 reach worrisome levels. several concern apparently lie behind market skepticism surround remedial action emu. one difficulty resolve trouble governments’ debt burden austerity program ever-increasing support funds. another factor negative impact worsen public finance country others within union, give fact financial system interlink institutions, notably banks, significant holder government bonds. contagion fear spread region outside emu, financial intermediary may also substantial exposure european sovereign bonds, either directly indirectly. in past week urgency find solution problem become even clearer. uncertainty future development monetary union hind growth prospect area fuel sharp volatility investor rush safety, factor recently deepen international financial markets. policy challenge the existence fundamental factor that, large extent, explain meager growth world economy pose important challenge policy makers. first, short-term economic policy face significant limit advance countries. the high rise public-debt ratio many economy call substantial fiscal consolidation effort order make public finance sustainable and, hence, supportive financial stability long-term growth. monetary policy already extraordinarily accommodative, authority need continue monitor anchor low inflation time remain ready function lender last resort guarantee integrity payment systems. a note earlier, slow growth crisis seem reflect lack economic stimulus policies. authority exercise caution consider accommodative policies, negative side effect expectation could offset intend benefits. 3 base international experience, reinhart rogoff find deleveraging big financial crisis lengthy process result negative deviation pre-crisis per-capita income typically take four years. see carmen m. reinhart kenneth rogoff, this time different: eight century financial folly, princeton, nj: princeton university press, 2009. 4 bi central bankers’ speech second and, perhaps, importantly, significant measure implement order overcome underlie difficulty seem explain low growth industrialize countries. obviously, sooner action take better, postponement solution may increase cost. give public finance root problem many advance nations, fiscal reform reduce uncertainty permanently enhance incentive toward productivity necessary. also, deregulation good regulation make market efficient amicable innovation, investment, hire take priority. in aftermath financial crisis, crucial challenge potentially design program help resolution consumer debt overhang unite state countries, possibly expeditious restructure bank balance-sheet cleanups, which, turn, may reinvigorate mortgage house markets.4 by far, serious task definitive solution fiscal difficulty vulnerable emu member states, imply imaginative plan need debtor creditors. the choice face certainly hard. the solution must inevitably include add capital banks. however, step prerequisite stability financial system resumption economic expansion. implication emerge economy the expect low dynamism advance economy necessarily limit growth momentum rest world. in particular, clearly show great contraction 2009, emerge economy immune pressure face industrialize nations. the possible negative effect specific emerge economy necessarily high integrate slow economies. for example, mexican economy highly interrelate unite states, especially manufacture production trade. although mexico recently fare well term external demand, part gradual geographic diversification, dampen activity unite state already affect mexican growth performance forecasts.5 despite constraints, emerge economy good situation advance countries. largely result lesson learn previous crises, general, economy maintain relatively strong public finance reduce exposure foreign currency liabilities. additionally, regulation supervision business model financial intermediary improve substantially. a consequence, financial system show high degree resilience great international turmoil thus far remain sound. hence, point view fundamentals, develop country likely continue positive factor global economic growth. this important, emerge economy account almost half world gdp. within contribution, china expect maintain key role engine global economic expansion. the favorable contribution develop nation world economy require country continue profit experience advance nations. in 4 for interest proposal facilitate mortgage debt renegotiation unite states, see eric a. posner luigi zingales, “a loan modification approach house crisis,” american law economics review, 11 (1): 575–607, 2009. 5 from february september 2011, blue chip growth forecast 2011 2012, respectively, fell 4.4 4.1 3.8 3.0 percent case u.s. industrial production, 3.9 3.8 3.9 3.5 percent mexico’s gdp. bi central bankers’ speech 5 particular, exceptionally expansionary policy response serious drawback develop country may involve unknown future costs. to extent difficulty absent emerge economies, need take risks. although inflation remain relatively contained, develop country sign overheating. thus, monetary authority continue monitor inflationary pressure act appropriately. in short, maintenance price stability, strong public finances, strict prudential oversight financial system openness international trade continue safe road growth emerge market economies, especially volatile times. conclude remark the lackluster economic performance advance countries, largely explain weak upturn world economy great contraction, seem reflect lack stimulus policy influence temporary events. the anemic growth last phenomenon reveal deep factor fuel uncertainty pessimistic expectations. the main contribute element include consumer debt overhang unintended consequence corrective measure financial crisis unite states, worsen fiscal financial trouble emu. the root cause deceleration advance economy pose significant challenge policy makers. their response certainly imply hard choice need make timely way order avoid aggravation. in context, decouple develop countries, emerge economy continue face relatively good condition growth, provide solid economic fundamental maintained. bi central bankers’ speech 1 narayana kocherlakota: central bank independence sovereign default speech mr narayana kocherlakota, president federal reserve bank minneapolis, sovereign debt seminar, cme group-msri prize innovative quantitative applications, chicago, illinois, 26 september 2011. * * * these remark highly similar i give april 1, 2011, philadelphia. i thank marco bassetto, v. v. chari, ron feldman, futoshi narita juan-pablo nicolini comments. the view i express today own, necessarily others federal reserve system colleague federal open market committee. sargent wallace publish classic “some unpleasant monetarist arithmetic” minneapolis fed’s quarterly review 1981. since date, grow appreciation role fiscal policy determination price level. the idea simple one. consider government borrow use non-indexed debt denominate currency. there intertemporal government budget constraint imply current real value government liability – include monetary base – must equal present value future real surpluses. because liability nominal non-indexed, government budget constraint provide linkage public’s assessment future real tax collection government spend current price level. i like john cochrane’s analogy here.1 he think money government bond like stock company. just like firm’s stock, money bond implicitly represent claim ownership government’s stream surpluses. and like financial assets, variation price fundamentally link variation present discount value government profit – is, surpluses.2 this simple insight rather profound consequence think inflation. inflation long “always everywhere monetary phenomenon.” instead, even apparently independent central bank may control price level. thus, public begin think fiscal authority behave irresponsibly, belief push upward price level. however, exist literature, analysis fiscal effect price level typically base presumption fiscal authority never default liability denominate currency. in remark today, i relax assumption. once i so, become clear sufficiently tough central bank ability control price level, regardless behavior fiscal authority.3 i argue ability hinge nature response possibility default part fiscal authority. i talk short-run versus long-run tension involve response. throughout, i refer central bank cb fiscal authority fa. i refer currency dollars, view suggest i talk unite state – australia. 1 see cochrane (2005). 2 the present-discounted-value formula stock price evaluation base assumption stock price bubble component. in way, intertemporal government budget constraint rely assumption price neither money bond bubble component. this assumption violate wide class model money. 3 see bassetto (2008) relate analysis. 2 bi central bankers’ speech let start describe simple cb policy: commodity price peg. suppose central bank hold x ounce gold. it commit will buy sell p dollar ounce gold monetary base $px. this policy successfully tie price level variation price gold, regardless behavior fa. what impact policy fa? now, fa borrow dollars, essentially borrow real commodity: gold. all fa’s debt essentially index price gold, certainly conceivable various shock could lead fa default obligations.4 of course, i argue elsewhere, simple policy generally view suboptimal macroeconomists.5 in contrast, suppose cb follow aggressive taylor rule determine path short-term interest rate.6 that policy pin inflation path usual way, regardless fa’s fiscal plans.7 however, give inflation path, fa’s nominal debt actually real. this mean fa face unexpected decline current expect future real surpluses, force default. thus, allow possibility default fa, sufficiently tough cb considerable control price level. of course, i’ve argue examples. it would interest deliver full characterization term “sufficiently tough” – i’m go attempt so. instead, follows, i’ll discus aspect cb’s response particularly critical situation. suppose fa owe $10 billion give friday. it plan repay loan auction new debt precede monday. however, auction new debt, find raise $5 billion. the fa danger default friday obligation $10 billion. it stage level commitment cb choose inflation path severely tested. the fa ask cb take action allow fa raise additional $5 billion wednesday. there many possible actions. the fa might ask cb intervene set floor price debt wednesday auction. but le overt approaches. for example, cb commit price peg fa’s debt secondary market debt. in event, cb intervene way ensure fa’s solvency, cb long say independent control price level. if cb’s intervention largely unanticipated markets, expect inflation rise cb’s intervention. then, incipient fiscal insolvency trigger inflationary pressures. of course, market may well already assign positive probability possibility cb might intervene kind scenario. if so, past inflation already influence markets’ expectation fiscal policy scenario. 4 a modeled, example, eaton gersovitz (1987). 5 see kocherlakota (2011). 6 here, i’m assume cb exchange reserve fa security control path short-term nominally risk-free interest rate. this nominally risk-free interest rate may interest rate fa debt. 7 atkeson, chari kehoe (2010) cochrane (2011) argue (convincingly mind) aggressive taylor rule sufficient determine inflation. the former author suggest price level determination achieve use hybrid rule augment activist taylor rule commodity price peg. note though implementation implicitly require cb ability buy back money public. if cb hold asset issue fa, fa’s action influence value cb’s portfolio thereby influence cb’s ability implement give price level path. in sense, cb independent control price level. bi central bankers’ speech 3 should cb require never intervene sort insolvency scenario? i’ve argue ban intervention give cb independence control price level. for think cb independence foundational element macroeconomic policy, pretty much settle question. but i see couple reason caution here. it certainly conceivable fa insolvency trigger shock well outside control fa itself. and, empirically, fa insolvency associate large short-term even medium-term decline output. should cb prepare drive fa insolvency give possible adverse economic impact country? more subtly, regardless fa’s solvency, sovereign debt issue fail simply coordination failure among investors. if i, investor, don’t anticipate others buy debt issue, i won’t either. in sense, sovereign debt issue may susceptible suboptimal “runs.” the cb eliminate possibility ensure nominal promise fa whenever fa threaten default. thus, i see trade-offs. on one hand, cb know will intervene keep fa solvent, inflation necessarily shape fiscal consideration short-run incentive elect officials. we know many year theoretical empirical research effect desirable one. on hand, cb fully commit allow fa default necessary, even optimal debt management fa may end expose country trouble risks, like sovereign debt runs. let wrap up. i’ve argue even fiscal authority borrow exclusively country’s currency, central bank large amount control price level. but central bank achieve control will commit let fiscal authority default. such commitment may expose country risk short-term medium-term output losses. how trade-off best resolve await future research. but may turn optimal central bank guarantee fiscal authority debt situations. if so, think price level determination something do jointly fiscal authority central bank – sargent wallace teach u 30 year ago. reference atkeson, andrew, v. v. chari patrick j. kehoe. 2010.

a year ago, i stand front much audience, expound benefit exchange rate flexibility. i argue exchange rate flexibility necessary backbone stable low inflation, must stay u foreseeable future. i reason movement exchange rate absorb shock otherwise would go inflation output applaud role flexible exchange rate play shelter economy impact crisis. at time, however, i call great use hedge instrument shelter financially le literate sector society unwarranted exchange rate exposure. the way forward, i argued, limit exchange rate volatility, rather expand use dinar base hedge instruments. accordingly, monetary policy base flexible exchange rate become cornerstone effort increase use dinar economy. a year on, effect exchange rate volatility already visible. the daily exchange rate certainly become volatile. accord measures1, daily volatility increase threefold past year, although still remain low compare to, instance, volatility similar country flexible exchange rate, poland, hungary romania. and expect remain case period ahead. chart 1. nb intervention short-term fx volatility

credit market become increasingly dinarised. an increase level dinarisation partially relate increase monthly volatility exchange rate. portfolio model financial intermediation2 suggest combination inflation target increase exchange rate volatility foster use local currency discourage use foreign currency. preliminary econometric analysis serbian data past three-years suggest indeed exist relatively fast link high exchange rate volatility high degree dinarisation. in particular, high monthly exchange rate volatility appear increase loan dinarisation delay around two months. also, increase exchange rate flexibility might contribute somewhat weaken link domestic price exchange rate. a recent nb analysis suggest pass-through exchange rate price decline past several years, since lehman brother episode. in summarize short speech: plain data, experience countries, well sophisticate analysis suggest somewhat great short-term fx volatility beneficial market development. indirectly, allow low national bank serbia presence market contribute make market resilient attract longer-term discourage short-term hot inflows. we also observe dinarisation might react positively somewhat high exchange rate flexibility increase use hedge instruments. that said, although long run goal remain full flexibility exchange rate, fx market serbia become deep enough fully efficient,

central bankers’ speech 1 sarah bloom raskin: monetary policy job creation speech m sarah bloom raskin, member board governor federal reserve system, university maryland smith school business distinguish speaker series, washington dc, 26 september 2011. * * * i appreciate assistance hess chung, william english, jean-philippe laforte, andrew levin, susan stawick, william wascher, david wilcox, joyce zickler preparation remarks. good morning. it’s great pleasure you, i want thank center financial policy robert h. smith school business invite participate forum. indeed, i delight see center financial policy already thriving. back 2008, i commissioner financial regulation state maryland, two founder center talk inception ask idea might accomplish. and i glad see – despite formidable challenge face new project – center fully engage address financial policy issue critically important nation. today i want discus monetary policy promote objective maximum employment context price stability. i set stage review current labor market conditions, i talk tool federal reserve deploy foster job creation promote strong economic recovery. i best make point plain english rather economic jargon, feel free correct i lapse back – child certainly do. of course, go without say remark intend express view necessarily opinion colleague federal reserve board federal open market committee (fomc). current labor market condition the global economy begin slow late 2007 early 2008 turn downward sharply autumn 2008 financial crisis intensified, result bad recession many decades. by end 2009, unemployment rate reach horrify 10 percent, correspond 15 million american work, attendant social consequences, include lose income wealth, mortgage foreclosures, family strains, health problems, on. officially, recovery recession begin third quarter 2009, pace recovery modest. we learn recent comprehensive revision government economic data recession deep recovery weak previously thought. indeed, recent read real gross domestic product (gdp) unite state – one second quarter year – still return level attain crisis, increase economic activity past two year rate insufficient achieve sustain reduction unemployment rate. the late employment report issue bureau labor statistic bleak. private-sector employer add 17,000 nonfarm job august, far few already weak average monthly gain 110,000 record previous three months. the headline unemployment rate 9.1 percent, represent 14 million american work august. nonetheless, many family know, headline unemployment number don’t fully capture weakness labor market conditions. beyond headline number, additional 8.8 million worker classify “part time economic reasons” august hour cut back unable find full-time job. in addition, 2 bi central bankers’ speech 2-1/2 million american classify “marginally attached” labor force even though want get job, search one past four weeks. and almost half group – nearly 1 million individual – give search employment altogether, believe job available them. so currently classify unemployed exclude work. the underemployed, marginally attached, discourage – concern security livelihood, housing, rise cost live – speak powerfully weakness recovery. the economic data regard correspond i see firsthand past several years. i travel once-robust manufacture city midwest observe vacant lots, burnt-out factories, metal scrap heaps, foreclose homes. i visit unemployment insurance office job train centers, i meet lot people work year two – work long embarrass show resume potential employers. these circumstance call forceful policy measures. i talk conventional unconventional action federal reserve, part, take foster economic recovery job creation. conventional monetary policy action the conventional tool monetary policy modify near-term path interest rates. to specific, reduction current short-term rate correspond downward shift private-sector expectation future path rate tend reduce borrow rate household businesses, include auto loan rates, mortgage rates, longer-term interest rates. this policy accommodation also tend raise household wealth boost stock market price financial assets. with great household wealth cheap borrow rates, consumer tend increase purchase houses, cars, various good services. in response, business ramp production meet increase level sales. moreover, low cost finance new equipment structures, business may incline increase spend investment project might previously see marginally profitable. in near term, firm meet increase demand resort temporary part-time workers, time strong incentive increase number regular full-time employees. consequently, monetary accommodation lead great job creation, though sometimes substantial time lags. the federal reserve use policy tool aggressively since onset financial crisis. in particular, federal fund rate target, stand 5-1/4 percent mid-2007, subsequently reduce range 0 1/4 percentage point end 2008, target range maintain since then. indeed, currency implicit interest rate exactly zero, economist generally agree zero interest rate effective low bind federal fund rate investor could simply choose hold cash central bank try drive short-term interest rate significantly zero. in effect, therefore, fomc deploy conventional policy tool maximum extent possible since late 2008. rather review vast academic literature regard effect conventional monetary policy, i simply pose counterfactual question: what would happen u.s. employment monetary policy fail respond forcefully financial crisis economic downturn? economic model – fed’s others – suggest federal fund rate target hold fix level 5 percent fourth quarter bi central bankers’ speech 3 2007 now, rather reduce actual target range 0 1/4 percent,1 unemployment rate would several percentage point high today. in words, follow actual policy keep target fund rate effective low bind since late 2008, federal reserve save million job would otherwise lost. of course, substantial uncertainty surround various specific estimates, doubt fomc’s forceful action help mitigate consequence crisis thereby spar american family business even great pain. unconventional monetary policy action give magnitude global financial crisis aftermath, federal reserve clearly need provide additional monetary accommodation beyond simply keep short-term interest rate close zero. consequently, like number major central bank around world, fomc deploy unconventional policy tool promote economic recovery. in particular, provide conditional forward guidance likely future path federal fund rate, engage balance sheet operation involve change size composition security holdings. broadly speaking, policy tool affect economy channel similar – though identical – conventional monetary policy. i’ll spend minute describe form unconventional policy helpful promote strong economic recovery. monetary policy communication an essential element good monetary policy effective communication. in democratic society, central bank responsibility clearly fully explain policy decisions. good communication also essential strengthen effectiveness monetary policy. expectation future play key role decision-making household firms: much spend, save, work, invest, hire. moreover, financial market participant understand central bank likely react incoming information, asset price adjust way reinforce central bank’s expect policy action thereby support central bank’s objectives. finally, clear communication help anchor public’s long-term inflation expectation hence improve extent central bank take forceful action promote job creation context price stability. with federal fund rate constrain effective low bound, effective communication public become important ever. since 2009, federal reserve publish committee participants’ longer-run projection inflation rate, unemployment rate, economic growth four time year conjunction minute fomc meetings. base longer-run projection inflation, committee participant judge inflation rate 2 percent bite less, measure price index personal consumption expenditures, consistent statutory mandate maximum employment price stability.2 the committee currently strive low unemployment rate possible, consistent price stability. in recent projections, committee participant estimate longer-run sustainable rate 1 the simulation describe assumes, common literature, policy follow historically typical behavior assume counterfactual path federal fund rate ends. 2 a indicate figure 2c june 2011 summary economic projections, 11 17 committee participant project longer-run inflation rate personal consumption expenditure 2 percent remain participants’ projection bite 2 percent; see www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcminutes20110622epa.htm#figure2c. 4 bi central bankers’ speech unemployment around 5 6 percent – well current unemployment rate 9.1 percent. since december 2008, fomc provide conditional forward guidance likely path target federal fund rate. from march 2009 june 2011, committee’s forward guidance indicate exceptionally low level federal fund rate likely warrant “for extend period.” in august, decide specific timing, two recent meet statement indicate “economic condition – include low rate resource utilization subdue outlook inflation medium run – likely warrant exceptionally low level federal fund rate least mid-2013.”3 forward guidance provide monetary accommodation lead investor expect long period low interest rates. a i note earlier, downward shift expect path federal fund rate associate reduce longer-term interest rate generate significant boost consumer business spending. simulation frb/us model evidence suggest forward guidance potent tool monetary policy.4 balance sheet operation since late 2008, fomc engage two round large-scale asset purchase (lsaps). the first round lsaps involve purchase $1.4 trillion agency mortgage-backed security (mbs) agency debt security $300 billion longer-term treasury securities; purchase execute 2009 first quarter 2010. the second round lsaps – often refer qe2 – involve additional $600 billion purchase longer-term treasury security complete end june year. by purchase longer-term security open market, federal reserve exert downward pressure longer-term yields, thereby reduce private borrow rate raise household wealth. consequently, conventional monetary policy, lsaps help boost consumer spending, business investment, net exports. and result increase aggregate demand help generate strong pace job creation.5 at last week’s fomc meeting, committee announce intend extend average maturity security hold come month sell $400 billion short-term treasury security purchase equivalent amount long-term treasury securities. this maturity extension program – refer operation twist – exert downward pressure longer-term interest rate help make broad financial condition accommodative, thereby support strong economic recovery. indeed, recent work economist federal reserve bank san francisco suggest similar policy put place 1961 effect longer-term interest

successful narrow spread rate agency mb treasury security comparable maturity. that spread widen substantially since early year, continuation trend could push mortgage rate adversely affect house sector. potential attenuate factor in judgment, federal reserve’s deployment policy tool completely appropriate promote maximum employment price stability. ideally, policy decision would inform precise quantitative information effect tool. in reality, however, estimate effect fomc’s policy action subject considerable uncertainty. such uncertainty intrinsic real-world monetary policymaking time particularly relevant circumstance scope conventional monetary policy constrain zero low bind federal fund rate, leave unconventional tool mean provide monetary accommodation. although monetary policy tool successful push interest rate across maturity spectrum, magnitude transmission economic growth employment somewhat mute i might expected. indeed, seem plausible effectiveness policy tool attenuate number unusual persist factors, include excess supply house impair access credit many household small businesses. under normal circumstances, residential construction interest-sensitive sector economy play important role contribute previous economic recovery – especially brisk recovery follow steep downturn 1981 1982. in wake burst house bubble, however, house sector remain exceedingly weak. in effect, excess supply house seem likely decline gradually despite record-low level mortgage rates. thus, crucial sector, one argue low interest rate show high activity way would expect usual recoveries. consumer spend also restrain excess supply housing, put downward pressure home equity value household wealth. a substantial portion homeowner negative home equity effectively unable refinance historically low mortgage rates. many see drastic decline value homes, would typically serve collateral home equity line credit second mortgages. the slow progress repair restructure households’ balance sheet may also low normal responsiveness consumer spend decline market interest rates. in particular, lender continue maintain relatively tight term standard credit card and, less extent, consumer loans. consequently, many household may unable take advantage low borrow rate available high net worth pristine credit records. many small business also appear face unusual obstacle obtain credit. if time typical, would expect smooth transmission low interest rate would fuel credit expansion would use finance expand payrolls, capital investment, inventories, short-term operate expenses. nonetheless, late federal reserve senior loan officer opinion survey bank lend practices, take july, indicate although domestic bank continue ease standard commercial industrial loans, net

opportunity speak today, i look forward hear comment questions. bi central bankers’ speech 1 inia naiyaga: exchange rate issues, monetary policy inflation response mr inia naiyaga, deputy governor reserve bank fiji, usp fiji update, suva, 16 september 2011. * * * professor biman prasad team usp the diplomatic corp distinguish speaker lady gentleman a good morning all. thank kind invitation respond three paper present today. i also take opportunity thank author paper effort prepare paper also professor biman’s team excellent arrangement event. my response issue relate exchange rate, monetary policy inflation, fiji’s economic performance exchange control issues. 1. exchange rate issue a. there grow tendency empirical support towards flexibility choice exchange rate arrangement, globally. however, flexible exchange rate necessarily boost investor confidence see develop country currently try cope volatility exchange rates. the pro con move flexible exchange rate regime consider carefully. b. the reserve bank review exchange rate policy ascertain effectiveness appropriateness support twin objective monetary policy – maintain low inflation maintain adequate level foreign reserves. the fiji dollar peg basket five currency (us dollar, australian dollar, new zealand dollar, japanese yen euro). the reserve bank assess evaluate possibility flexible exchange rate regime technical assistance international monetary fund last year. the move towards great flexibility remain consideration reserve bank. while benefit flexible exchange rate regime clear, time need carefully considered. c. we note find dr jayaraman’s paper impact fiji’s exchange rate pas inflation. we note conclusion paper line internal assessment exchange rate pas effect. the paper conclude post coup period, depreciation fiji’s domestic currency 1 percent raise domestic price 0.37 percent, similar internal assessment 0.4 percent. 2. monetary policy inflation a. regard dr patrick’s paper rbf’s commitment monetary policy objective give current economic background – the rbf remain commit twin objective – maintain low inflation adequate level foreign reserves. inflation high moment reach 10.4 percent last 2 bi central bankers’ speech month. a know, inflation outcome influence external policy relate factor – beyond control monetary policy. import inflation alone account 60 percent domestic inflation outcome. with current demand side inflationary pressure weak moment, appropriate monetary policy remain accommodative support growth economy time vigilant potential second-round impact inflation. inflation forecast subside 7 percent end year 4.5 percent end next year. b. on core inflation – principle monetary policy respond persistent price movements. the reserve bank two core inflation measure trim mean exclude food energy item inflation, widely accept use many central bank exclude temporary price pressures. universally, hard determine “temporary” impact come end lot factor come play almost time. in fiji, big increase food inflation june 2010 june 2011 11.3 percent attribute many factors. if compare food inflation june 2010 december 2010, food price rise around 2.0 percent regard quite stable. a increase food inflation come year account vat rate change high food price note across world period. by january 2012, see impact vat fall core inflation measure. a impact high world food prices, soon price food commodity normalise abroad, core inflation return normal levels. c. it mention fiji high rate inflation middle year even account impact high electricity tariff increase vat come effect november last year january year respectively. it also mention seychelles despite large devaluation manage bring inflation rate vanuatu. it important note unlike seychelles, fiji’s major trade partner australia new zealand major source market import food, beverage manufacture goods. the strong appreciation australian new zealand dollar year exacerbate impact already high import price feed domestic inflation. these explain large difference inflation rate fiji mid 2011 even account vat electricity price increases. on vanuatu, find low inflation rate present morning intrigue talk counterpart experience. 3. domestic economic performance a. the presentation imf regional resident representative – dr. yongzheng clearly highlight performance pacific island country particularly fiji since global downturn 2008 couple renew risk policy challenge give current development especially advance economies. b. we also agree fiji economy weak recovery 2010 contraction 2009. while tourism manufacture pick up, 2010, sugar industry declined. however, export pick significantly 2010 due rebound global demand also improvement term trade certain resource commodity gold, forestry fish products. c. we need note significant migration skilled labour force affect fiji’s growth potential, may explain recovery fiji economy – despite advantage – extent slow pics. bi central bankers’ speech 3 d. the paper also raise valuable point fiji government already take step implement these. the establishment land bank encourage landowner deposit land lease long term tenure commercial purpose use. the response land owner encourage far area land deposit land bank surpass 2011 target june. sugar reform also underway government take lead role addition allocate around $122 million 2011 budget support sugar industry directly. apart sugar industry, urgent need fast track public sector reform ensure long-term macroeconomic stability. e. the good news strong rebound domestic economy envisage year growth expect across sector except construction sector. the current performance sector date mixed, positive performance reflect tourism relate industry although sector remain weak. the economy expect grow 2.7 percent 2011, however, figure currently review. the new figure expect announce 2012 budget address. f. a mention presentation, growth remittance encourage support consumer spending, particularly time sluggish economic growth. look ahead, agree would prudent fund also direct towards investment spending. ongoing financial literacy education rbf, financial institution others, could encourage family recipient remittance funds, invest money income revenue generate activities. g. the view express effect devaluation noted. it important recognise positive effect devaluation partially overshadow downturn global demand fijian economy would much bad position without adjustment. we continue encourage export sector take advantage competitive gain produce able export countries. 4. exchange control clarification a. a statement make early dr patrick regard exchange control need corrected. the reserve bank assure foreign investor fund introduce fiji include profit free repatriate time. at times, outflow stagger large amounts, like case commercial banks. over last 6 years, total $1.05 billion approve outflow profit remittances. b. in respond concern compulsory surrender foreign exchange, exchange control act state foreign exchange sell foreign exchange dealer. however, order cover exchange rate risks, allow company business hold foreign currency account meet overseas payment – total account currently stand $100 million. c. regard foreign reserve cover, reserve bank target 4–5 month import cover, high standard benchmark 3 months. the standard benchmark foreign reserve study moment especially imf give grow complexity financial system associate increase vulnerability factors. we well moment, foreign reserve level $1.6 billion sufficient cover around 4.8 month good non-factor services. 4 bi central bankers’ speech d. minor observation – it note first paper six bank – four commercial bank development bank. conclusion with current challenge economic environment globally domestically, reserve bank proactive role support economic recovery. we ease monetary policy stance recently conduct moral suasion commercial bank effort stimulate investment credit especially priority sector support growth domestic demand. we continue relax exchange control order support overseas current payment conducive business growth. this also instil confidence investor encourage investment well. the reserve bank rationalise introduce import substitution export finance facility exporter business may access boost export reduce imports. energy renewable project also qualify facility. $40 million available scheme current usage $20 million. the rbf lend fund commercial banks, credit institution fdb 2 percent lend institution allow charge interest rate maximum 6 percent. the current government’s concert effort vital timely also support call make panel variant fiscal income policy give limitation face monetary authorities. nevertheless, positive outlook remain ahead reform take place current mix monetary fiscal policy aligned. from presentation hear far, investment key. we need address obstacle investment address accordingly. we need ensure environment conducive well. it also important fiji attract right type investors. we hear lot issue question far. what need solution – practicable relevant solution implemented. finally, i would like add type dialogue healthy provide excellent platform exchange idea work together move forward good fiji. thank you. bi central bankers’ speech 1 mark carney: some current issue financial reform remark mr mark carney, governor bank canada, institute international finance, washington dc, 25 september 2011. * * * thank invitation speak today. in hope address concerns, i wad 1,000 page report note institute international finance (iif) produce past year. your message consistent, always concise, i would like focus three particular concern financial reform agenda recently expressed: 1. consistency implementation across jurisdictions; 2. possibility substantial regulatory arbitrage shadow bank system; 3. macroeconomic impact reforms. before i do, allow general observation. the g-20 undertake radical comprehensive program strengthen regulation, supervision infrastructure global financial system. it ambition hardly surprise. four year ago, manifest deficiency capital adequacy, liquidity buff risk management lead collapse storied name finance trigger bad financial crisis since great depression. the complete loss confidence private finance – membership – could arrest provision comprehensive backstop rich economy world. with $4 trillion output almost 28 million job lose ensue recession, case reform clear remain today. let turn issues. consistency implementation authority increasingly hear concern pitch play field basel iii implementation. everyone claim boy scout accuse others juvenile delinquency. however, neither merit badge detention self-selected but, rather, determine impartial peer review mutual oversight. it important remember basel rule always been, continue be, international minimums, rather “one-size-fits-all” approach. there legitimate reason implementation may differ across countries. some country implement basel iii fast others. the current transition period 2019 basel iii variously describe enlightened, leisurely generous. it reflect lowest-common-denominator compromise give time need rebuild capital buff crisis economy furthest compliance. some country may decide best interest take full advantage flexibility. indeed, quickly new rule adopt bind function current health financial system macrofinancial environment jurisdiction. in canada, expect bank fully compliant basel iii (2019 definitions) early transition period, start january 2013. this reflect strong start position canadian bank benefit build capital face currently buoyant credit expansion. some adopt tough rules. country sweden, switzerland unite kingdom, large bank sector relative domestic economies, 2 bi central bankers’ speech signal preference high loss-absorbency capacity. in jurisdictions, since failure major bank would disproportionately large consequences, additional prudence desirable. finally, always country opt tight interpretation rules, even adhere international minimum standards. for example, national supervisor may take conservative approach approve bank internal risk measurement system advance measurement approach basel ii. i would stress order foster race top, basel iii permit good rules, minimum standard. a iif emphasised, vital prevent regulatory fragmentation. in regard, several new measure help contain unwarranted difference implementation across countries. for example, new leverage ratio act backstop effectively limit difference risk weights. speak experience, canada know leverage ratio protect bank risk people think low are, fact, high. in addition, policy-makers significantly enhance mutual-surveillance process jurisdiction accept part membership basel committee bank supervision (bcbs). in particular, financial stability board (fsb) standard-setting bodies, include basel committee, jointly develop implementation-monitoring framework coordinate activity include annual progress report country-by-country basis fsb g-20, well le frequent, in-depth, peer reviews. ad hoc review new legislation regulation could also conducted. in regard, review bcbs new european american rule would welcome build confidence today consistency application major jurisdictions. coordinate fsb/bcbs monitor mechanism addition international monetary fund’s (imf) annual article iv surveillance imf world bank’s periodic independent assessment across country compliance international standards.1 all all, legitimate reason country adopt standard quickly go beyond international minimums, much le scope future country give bank competitive advantage fully implement agree global rules. if jurisdiction comply, i certain let u know. the iif’s commitment fair application peer review would complement official initiatives, i urge develop formal approach. in end, interest comply. while period exuberance aggressive bank jurisdiction sail close wind, financial history suggest well-capitalised institution transparent system ultimately premium ratings, valuation outcomes. regulatory arbitrage let turn second issue: regulatory arbitrage. there valid concern recent measure push risk shadow banking. even reform make core financial system resilient, increase incentive move classic bank activities, maturity transformation credit intermediation, unregulated periphery. 1 the imf world bank jointly conduct financial sector assessment program (fsap) report observance standard code (roscs). bi central bankers’ speech 3 this tendency particular concern, give role shadow bank sector play run-up crisis. in final year boom, complacency liquidity reach zenith, scale shadow bank activity exploded. the value structure investment vehicles, example, triple three year 2007, credit default swap grow sixfold. the feedback regulate sector pernicious. financial institutions, include many banks, come rely high level market fund liquidity. for instance, short-term money markets, particularly repo markets, predominant source finance one-third increase gross leverage american investment banks, well british european banks. the system’s exposure market confidence enormous. the crisis expose boom-bust liquidity cycle cascade shadow bank sector reverberate regulate core. market force prove inadequate manage swing confidence despair. today, despite fact shadow banking, prefer call it, market-based finance (mbf), least large regulate sector jurisdictions, often unregulated and/or oversee authority without systemic focus. this change. a does, regulation supervision must strike balance mitigate systemic risk realize benefit financial deepening. properly structured, shadow bank increase efficiency, provide diversification, spur competition innovation. it potential make system robust, provide rely regulate sector liquidity pretend provide liquidity time stress. however, experience also teach shadow bank activity mutate, usually complex highly leverage instruments, regulatory gap create response last crisis. with mind, four broad category regulatory initiative consideration. the first, important, indirect regulation limit size nature banks’ exposure shadow bank entities. example include tight consolidation rule bank-sponsored conduit high risk-based capital requirement liquidity lines. these measure help reduce opportunity regulatory arbitrage, bank seek reduce capital liquidity requirement organise transaction wholly part shadow bank entity retain much underlie tail risk. the second approach would try address systemic risk shadow bank directly. for example, macroprudential measure consider address procyclical haircut collateral rule security lend repo transactions. these measure could much dampen liquidity cycles. contagion could constrain strengthen financial market infrastructure. in canada, come months, central counterparty (ccp) repo transaction launched. this repo ccp strengthen counterparty credit risk management, reduce collateral balance sheet requirement via netting, reduce impact failure one participants. by help ensure core fund market continuously open, heart financial system resilient shocks. the third approach regulate shadow bank activity themselves, money market exchange-traded fund (etfs), disclosure obligation restriction certain financial transaction instruments. this require dynamic monitor financial system coordination across authorities. finally, fsb examine possible regulation shadow bank entities, hedge funds, may pose systemic risk limit maturity transformation leverage. this last option take account relative size institution cumulative impact measures. 4 bi central bankers’ speech whatever decision take come months, one tempt declare “mission accomplished.” in order maintain systemic resilience, monitoring, supervision regulation shadow bank need dynamic.2 the recent loss incur ubs delta one trade desk demonstrate need vigilant risk management complex new products. fortunately system, loss manageable, give increase capital buff bank, broad liquidity squeeze avoided. the fsb prescient highlight risk associate synthetic etfs.3 synthetic etf sometimes use fund illiquid collateral which, finance bank’s balance sheet, would carry high risk weight. the potential procyclical liquidity cycle need monitor carefully. reform shadow bank sector offer opportunity ensure consistency overall financial reform package. for example, capital rule balance risk institution benefit incentivizing direct indirect settlement standardize derivative ccps. liquidity standard market infrastructure reinforce continuous availability core fund markets. in manner, systemic resiliency efficiency increase. a authority examine measure comprehensive, system-wide basis, adjustment may need made. liquidity standard one example. the basel committee committee global financial system (cgfs) currently use observation period review contentious design issue concern liquidity coverage ratio (lcr), uncertainty regard liquid asset use time stress, liquidity rule suppose operate tandem new leverage ratio requirement. they also examine potential unintended consequence commercial paper market market-making equities. the fsb’s work shadow bank shed light intersection among standards, key market economic performance. these issue need address new rule fully implemented.4 there would appear little value delay decision potential amendment lcr beyond early new year. work net stable fund ratio (nfsr) take longer. macroeconomic implication financial reform let turn third, fundamental, concern. base current challenge economic outlook, argue revisit pace breadth financial reforms. this position base two questionable propositions. the first prospect financial reform contribute current economic weakness. a corollary delay implementation basel iii capital rules, example, somehow strengthen recovery. really? 2 the fsb develop two-step approach monitoring. the first step call broad scan shadow bank sector understand key development trends. the second involve detail assessment activity entity sector identify systemic risks, pay particular attention regulatory arbitrage, excessive maturity liquidity transformation, imperfect credit risk transfer undue leverage. although goal implement approach end 2012, obtain sufficiently granular data challenge. 3 “potential financial stability issue arise recent trend exchange-traded fund (etfs),” financial stability board, 12 april 2011. 4 a part work liquidity rules, bank ask supply data every six month complete detail survey liquidity-management practice help gather information impact practice financial system. bi central bankers’ speech 5 weak credit growth crisis economy often cite support evidence. however, fact household credit flat fall unite state unite kingdom hardly surprise. american british household overleveraged. with personal net worth substantially low follow crisis, need rebuild balance sheet environment economic uncertainty quite naturally weigh credit demand. in vast array country experience home-grown financial crisis, issue household borrow robust, despite adherence common timetable implement basel iii. the issue crisis economy primarily one demand, supply. more broadly, g-20’s comprehensive reform program seek boost confidence global financial institution market provide path resilient system end government support. it hard see backslide would help. indeed, time conviction policymakers across range issue call question, appear little value feed concern. moreover, recall implementation timetable basel iii begin two year end 2019. it difficult believe prolong implementation phase even would material impact real economic outcomes. if institution feel pressure today, do little long, rather ask much, soon. the second proposition that, implemented, reform substantially reduce global growth. a recently release iif report estimate output loss transition phase order magnitude great produce bank international settlements, bank canada, imf public institution academic bodies. allow raise many problem iif’s analysis. the iif study assume bank pay earn therefore must rely heavily external source raise capital. debt-fuelled consumption central driver output growth econometric model, despite obvious bias reduce debt major economies. monetary policy assume suspend animation 2020. while i would welcome time off, presumption inconsistent range unconventional tool central bank medium-term prospect global economy. the estimate impact reform cost bank debt exceed increase experience crisis! it hard see capital, good liquidity strong infrastructure would lead result. put differently, iif suggest current public subsidy financial sector massive. finally, analysis assume reform effort naught include none benefits. give recent experience, one would argue financial crisis without costs, jade would argue probability severity cannot reduced. country like canada australia, well-capitalized well-managed banks, experience failure bailouts. partly consequence, economy substantially outperform advanced-economy peers. our estimate indicate even basel iii reduce slightly probability crisis future, potential gain would far exceed cost marginally slow growth. the bank canada estimate net present value basel iii g-20 economy 30 per cent gdp present-value terms, $us13 trillion.5 5 assume 2-percentage-point increase capital (plus liquidity changes). for canada, estimate approximately 13 per cent gdp present-value terms, equal can$200 billion. see bank canada, “strengthening international capital liquidity standards: a macroeconomic impact 6 bi central bankers’ speech in short, worsen global economic outlook implication bank performance, provide rationale delay implementation basel iii. conclusion to conclude, critic reform generally succumb three world-weary arguments:  rule arbitraged;  insurance promote great risk taking;  always financial crises. such fatalism rejected. in aspect human endeavour men woman strive learn improve. the sad experience past year show ample scope improve efficiency resilience global financial system. by clarity purpose resolute implementation, so. the current reform initiative mark real progress. the fundamental objective g-20 measure resilient, global financial system efficiently support global growth. our destination one financial institution market play critical – complementary – role support long-term economic prosperity. this require institution adequately capitalized, sufficient liquidity buff manage shocks. it also require market force allow determine relative size boundary bank shadow bank sectors; market decide firm prosper firm fail. the fsb clear role oversee coordinate development g-20 reforms. it provide system-wide perspective ass total impact reforms. it must strive resolve conflict may arise regulation locally optimal systemically inconsistent. it must balance need guard regulatory arbitrage value preserve diverse risk-taking strategy productive innovation. finally, must ensure consistent implementation across jurisdiction build open competitive system. it also important lose sight limitation regulation. new good rule necessary, sufficient. people always try find way around them. some may succeed, while. that good supervision paramount. rule good supervisor enforce them, good supervisor look beyond letter rule spirit. of course, belief industry appropriateness measure also aid application. a well aware, ultimate duty ensure institution bear responsibly risk taking. we learn event past years, i look forward continue constructive dialogue iif develop implement vital agenda. see also:  financial system reform initiative mark real progress, say mark carney, governor bank canada

anxiety u recession, deepen sovereign debt crisis euro area. each big risk, big risk could materialize simultaneously, interact adverse feedback loop manifest trade, finance confidence channels. political gridlock 3. the problem well known, solution table. the main impediment effective resolution common flashpoint appear political.  in us, central issue manage tension fiscal stimulus immediate term, credible fiscal consolidation medium long term.  in euro area, share monetary framework, without share fiscal framework. what stand way credible confidence inspire resolution fiscal-financial imbroglio political compulsions. decouple 4. let look global situation perspective emes. before 2008, intellectually fashionable talk “decoupling” – emdcs continue resilient even downturn advance economies, improve macroeconomic policies, robust foreign exchange reserve resilient financial flows. in age globalization, decouple theory never persuasive. the 2008 crisis dent credibility 2011 crisis completely demolish it. channel contagion emes 5. emes affect crises. their macroeconomic stability, price stability financial stability jeopardize global crisis several

stark: the global financial crisis role monetary policy speech mr jürgen stark, member executive board european central bank, 13th annual emerge market conference 2011, washington dc, 24 september 2011. * * * lady gentlemen, i please address distinguish audience. look back time, see role conduct monetary policy often change response economic financial crises. in fact, international central bank community always eager learn past development experiences, also respect different experience across countries. of course, imply monetary policy past always everywhere. certainly, difference exist way monetary policy conduct across countries. but precisely open-mindedness discuss willingness learn others’ experience past century monetary policy make go evolutionary process: evolutionary process improve conduct monetary policy time lead great deal convergence across countries. let remark briefly review process. i discus specific lesson learn recent episode financial economic turbulence, conclude challenge ahead monetary policy, also economic policy generally. it response major bank panic first half nineteenth century bank england adopt “responsibility doctrine” propose walter bagehot.1 this require bank lend freely basis sound collateral, penalty rate prevent moral hazard. half century later, federal reserve system establish unite state response frequent bank crises, particular crisis 1907, serve lender last resort similar bank england. under gold standard gold convertibility serve economy’s nominal anchor use way ensure trust currency. before establishment central banks, private bank government issue banknote often overextend gold reserves. in sense, early central bank strongly commit price stability. however, 1920s onwards many central bank fell public control. the great depression lead major reaction central banks, accuse exacerbate crisis. in virtually every country, monetary policy place control treasury fiscal policy become dominant. in many countries, central bank follow low interest rate policy stimulate economy help treasury market debt. in 1950s independent monetary policy make central bank restored, accompany brief period price stability mid 1960s. the belief unemployment could permanently reduce expense high inflation result accommodative monetary policy 1970s, lead increase inflation inflation expectation start rise. only countries, germany, exception rule, bundesbank’s emphasis monetary aggregate result much tight monetary policy. by end 1970s, central bank put renew emphasis credibility start tighten monetary policy inflation decrease significantly. 1 see bordo m. (2007), “a brief history central banks,” economic commentary, federal reserve bank cleveland. 2 in many country central bank grant independence give mandate keep inflation low. a result, stable price become fact life billion people. today experience bad economic financial crisis post-war period. i convince knowledge gain result change sharpen way conduct monetary policy. so let share think direction i expect – hope – monetary policy think change response current crisis. the role monetary policy lesson financial crisis i think fair say widespread consensus key element pre-crisis monetary policy paradigm.2 in particular, background high inflation experience 1970s many industrialise countries, central bank consensus comprise three key elements: 1. central bank independence corner stone effective monetary policy; 2. price stability primary objective central banks; 3. solidly anchor inflation expectation basis transparent communication. in addition, least background “great moderation”, is, period low inflation macroeconomic stability industrialise country observe 20 year crisis, central bank consensus also emphasise three elements, ecb never subscribed. these are: 1. monetary policy primary role management aggregate demand short-run; 2. money credit indicator disregarded; 3. monetary policy react asset price busts; asset price booms. let discus i see element today’s perspective, particularly context recent experience global financial economic crisis, draw conclusion regard usefulness element future conduct monetary policy. let start general conclusion: in view, first three element prove valuable asset crisis i view absolutely essential success monetary policy. the latter three element consensus seriously reconsidered. i think crisis make convince case medium term orientation monetary policy, take account information money credit indicators, try lean wind financial imbalance start develop pose risk price stability medium term. let elaborate element draw conclusions: firstly, crisis – view – crucially underline importance central bank independence corner stone credible effective monetary policy making. of course, central bank independence precondition effective monetary policy times. it important lesson evidence event history central banking, also academic literature, blur responsibility potentially lead 2 see goodfriend (2007), “how world achieve consensus monetary policy,” the journal economic perspectives, 21, 47–68; mishkin f.

(2010), “monetary science, fiscal alchemy,” nber work paper series, no 16510. bi central bankers’ speech 7 public finance could point also cast doubt sustainability prevail regime monetary dominance. this would lead increase inflation expectation least heighten uncertainty inflation outlook medium term. it fallacy think loose monetary policy solve large structural problem facing. central bank must become victim success become overburdened. historically, whenever policy maker try broaden role monetary policy beyond original role guardian value currency, compromise objective price stability. for monetary policy remain effective, responsibility must remain within clear limits. instead, need growth model different one year financial crisis. we need economic growth base genuine increase productivity, low interest rate accumulation debt. the unlimited accumulation private public debt financial crisis become burden economic growth reduce progressively.14 to achieve need far-reaching structural reform increase competition labour good markets, financial supervision, strong fiscal policy framework. we must reform financial supervision strengthen economic governance economic policy become le pro-cyclical. basel iii important step right direction, provide high minimum capital requirement good risk provision financial institutions. still, regulation bank system financial market yet progress sufficiently. fiscal policy ground rules-based framework clear medium term objectives, similar monetary policy. the adoption fiscal rule country clearly improvement. in euro area, number step undertake strengthen economic governance concern competitiveness fiscal policy address pre-emptively. but ecb step go far enough. for rule sanction fully credible strict automatic – subject

kenneth rogoff harvard university. i recall professor rogoff’s outstanding contribution economics financial economics, i also comment research context response current crisis. let first emphasise research play crucial role eurosystem – central banks. indeed, research provide essential input definition ecb’s price-stability monetary policy strategy. i would thus like express appreciation professor rogoff influential contribution make many field special relevance central bank policymakers, range monetary policy international finance financial crises. he merit particular praise help u improve understand main cause mechanism behind link financial crisis sovereign debt crises. early career professor rogoff work central banker international finance division board governor federal reserve system. in period, write two celebrate paper monetary economics international finance. one, appear 1985 quarterly journal economics title “the optimal degree commitment intermediate monetary target”, especially cherish among central banker (and still cite contribution accord google scholar 2,100 citations). it forcefully lay rationale delegation monetary policy independent central bank

virtually policy analysis international economics inside outside central banks. this ground-breaking effort, reflect work write jointly maurice obstfeld entitle “foundations international macroeconomics”, give birth new field “new open economy macroeconomics” spur vast ever-growing literature. this new approach allow researcher policymakers analyse substantive issues, current 2 bi central bankers’ speech account fiscal imbalances, provide welfare-theoretic perspective global macroeconomic policy. a imf’s chief economist 2001 2003, professor rogoff launch development large-scale

universal, far quantitative similarity aftermath, previously believed. the “this-time-is-different-syndrome” powerful reminder danger complacency. one key observation financial crisis follow unusually prolong recession economic activity. another valuable insight fiscal financial dimension closely interconnected. fiscal imbalance undermine financial sector; financial sector imbalance weigh credibility sovereign; spillover real sector, vice versa. the book foresee massive implicit liability towards financial sector accumulate government could result unsustainable level sovereign debt. despite important theoretical empirical advance professor rogoff contribute substantially, still much learn root causes, trigger propagation mechanism crises. the major challenge policymakers pose exist knowledge gap reflect controversial debate optimal response mitigate resolve current crisis prevent future crises. in context, since time imf, professor rogoff feature prominently global policy debates, produce analysis make recommendation contain current crisis restore overall macroeconomic stability euro area. on subject, know, condition financial market take turn bad since second half july early august. in euro area, renew intensification financial market turbulence lead high interest rate countries, potentially damage volatility, low trade volume government bond market time cease

july agreement head state government crucial. a renew commitment euro area government agree fiscal target course equally essential. the ecb also step responses, reflect full commitment ensure continue smooth function key euro area market segments, necessary prerequisite achieve price stability euro area. first, decide continue support ample liquidity condition conduct refinance operation fixed-rate

govern council aim help restore appropriate transmission monetary policy stance environment key market segments, government paper, dysfunctional. the intervention influence monetary policy stance. in order sterilise impact intervention liquidity condition bank system, re-absorb liquidity injected. let underline secondary market purchase not, cannot use circumvent principle budgetary discipline

episode multiple equilibria. creditors’ assessment change, e.g. via contagion effects, even fundamental would justify it. the high degree financial integration within emu mean that, leave unchecked,

rogoff. the inflation tax blunt tool whose accidental effect would reflect mainly ex-ante institutional feature (such degree indexation maturity structure liabilities) rather actual necessity adjust. more importantly, professor rogoff say himself, inflate debt away would unduly jeopardise precious capital ecb independent central bank, namely credibility. the ecb never debase currency, record shows: remarkably preserve internal external value euro keep inflation low inflation expectation well-anchored. a learn repeatedly experienced, credibility particular ability anchor inflation expectation crucial smooth function monetary policy. their key role highlight financial crisis, particularly prevent danger entrenchment deflationary expectations. the euro area highly integrate economic financial area need manage common decisions. however, aside monetary policy, lack powerful decision-making institutions. this mean rules-based framework must act substitute centralise authority. for fiscal economic issues, unitary state would finance ministry define veto fiscal broad economic policies. emu must achieve effect economic governance framework. we know 4 bi central bankers’ speech research, include professor rogoff, also corroborate experience, soft-rules achieve desire outcome. strengthen rule govern fiscal broad macroeconomic policy thus essential. the stability growth pact (sgp), create discipline fiscal policy, work well strengthen complement macroeconomic imbalance procedure. great automaticity implementation sgp need unsustainable policy put stability euro area whole risk. credible economic governance need consistent predictable. it also need back timely, tough sanction encourage compliance. fiscal surveillance set ambitious benchmark excessive deficit set adjustment path towards country’s medium-term budgetary objective. the liquidity dry-ups contagion risk also call strong backstop mechanisms, provide significant, albeit temporary, liquidity assistance. strong financial supervision euro area level also essential. finally, national authority need take ownership european commitments. this mean anchor eu rule national legislation make mandatory hold account domestic parliaments. economic governance prevent crises, also create condition economic growth. at present, major challenge require great coordination across euro area. projection euro area’s long-term growth prospect remain weak, depress fiscal burden age-related expenditure, slow productivity growth, go debt sustainability challenges. i agree recent comment professor rogoff europe need reverse trend. it essential give renew impetus comprehensive ambitious programme growth-enhancing structural reform support intensive monitor follow-up. let conclude. it precisely backdrop challenge stem current crisis fully appreciate invaluable contribution scholar like kenneth rogoff. i extend sincere congratulation receive 2011 deutsche bank prize

australia, australian economic forum 2011, sydney, 22 september 2011. * * * i would like thank jarkko jaaskela, luis uzeda callan windsor extensive assistance preparation talk. good morning. i please able part year’s australian economic forum. two week ago, governor reserve bank australia (rba), glenn stevens, give speech perth title “still interest times”. one consequence live interest time shortage interest thing talk about. there inexorable shift global economic weight asia, public-debt problem north atlantic economies, multi-speed nature australian economy, conservative approach spend borrow australian households, list go on. you relieve hear i don’t plan talk today. rather, i would like spend time morning explore one issues, change pattern household save spend australia. this issue interest right, understand change also help u understand broad change occur within australian economy. household save at aggregate level, story household save is, now, well known. graph 1 from mid 1980s mid 2000s, aggregate household save ratio decline significantly (graph 1). then, past half dozen years, decline reversed, aggregate household save ratio back mid 1980s. 2 bi central bankers’ speech glenn stevens recently speak length change take place.1 in particular, draw attention fact nominal interest rate decline availability credit increased, household spend grow quickly income around decade so. although adjustment draw out, was, nature, one-off event. so even north atlantic financial crisis, household return traditional norm save borrowing, and, doubt, crisis accelerate return. this aggregate story interesting, take u far understand go on. at rba, spend considerable effort delve underneath aggregate figures, good understand factor affect individuals’ decision save spending. one way use hilda (household, income labour dynamic australia) survey which, year, track finance individual households. although survey ask household much save year, save ratio estimate 2006 onwards use income spend number report survey.2 have do this, compare distribution save ratio across population change 2006 2009, late year data available. this period especially interest large increase aggregate save ratio occurred, 2009 mark peak aggregate ratio. graph 2 perhaps easy way summarise result show median distribution change time (graph 2). between 2006 2007, median save ratio increase 1 percentage point. it increase 2 percentage point 2008 jump 4 percentage point 2009, cumulative increase 7 percentage 1 see stevens g (2011), “the cautious consumer”, address anika foundation luncheon, sydney 26 july. 2 similar change evident across entire distribution save ratios. bi central bankers’ speech 3 point three years.3 this figure turn quite close 8 percentage point increase aggregate save ratio period calculate national accounts. the micro level data suggest increase save ratio quite widespread across population. it also confirm increase save ratio occur prior financial crisis, crisis saw mark acceleration trend. when drill data detail, increase save ratio apparent across entire income distribution, although surprisingly, increase small household low income (graph 3).4 many low-income household spend significant share income basic necessity limit scope increase share income save. graph 3 another way look data house tenure. graph 4 show save ratio increase rent, mortgage dwell outright. this confirm increase save quite widespread, although, increase save small household dwell outright. 3 the actual level save ratio calculate hilda data substantially high national accounts, hilda survey capture component household expenditure. this difference should, however, relatively little effect estimate change save ratio time. 4 for purpose classify household income bands, income measure average household disposable period 2005/06 2008/09 effort capture income “normal” times. it also “age matched” avoid effect life-cycle factor adjustment make number people household. 4 bi central bankers’ speech graph 4 it also possible look save rate change different age group (graph 5). do this, clear increase large young household small old households. this result hold household rent owner occupiers. the survey suggest young household experience income growth broadly line groups. however, spend grow quickly groups, hence relatively large increase saving. graph 5 take together, evidence consistent idea high house price debt level contribute reassessment save decisions, although, obviously, bi central bankers’ speech 5 reason increase save go well beyond happen house market. high house price require high deposit require savings. this trend probably reinforce development lend side, lender low maximum loan-to-valuation ratio recent years. save decision today also likely influence early rise debt level relative income debt service burden stay high longer. the adjustment seem particularly pronounce among young household hop enter house market recently enter market. there two aspect individual level data i would like draw attention to. the first relationship change save household’s hold financial asset (excluding deposits).5 to explore relationship, divide household income quintile two group – above-average hold financial asset below-average hold – calculate median change save ratio group 2008 2009, year financial crisis. the result exercise show graph 6, top line show median increase save ratio household high financial asset bottom line show change low financial assets. it clear five income quintiles, household relatively high level financial asset financial turmoil increase save household relatively low level financial assets. graph 6 this evidence consistent idea fall financial asset price recent year lead household increase save current income order rebuild asset positions. when share price fell, household wealth decline and, consequence, 5 financial asset include superannuation, cash investment (i.e. bonds), equity investments, trust fund life insurance. 6 bi central bankers’ speech increase save require attain desire level wealth. this particularly case household hold lot financial assets. this experience flipside happen decade mid 2000s. during period, household wealth increase substantially way increase asset prices, despite household save relatively little current income. the second aspect individual-level data i would like draw attention relationship change save ratio much uncertainty household feel future. this difficult issue investigate, important one financial crisis 2008/09 clearly illustrated. during period, uncertainty around world increase greatly, result household business delay discretionary spend increase savings, amplify downturn global economy. in hilda survey, household employment ask year worry future job.6 use response question, classify household four groups: become le worry time; become little worry time; become lot worried; change. a before, calculate change median save ratio group result show graph 7. it clear graph large increase save ratio household become lot concern time lose job. and conversely, small increase save become le concern lose job. graph 7 here, evidence consistent idea people become uncertain save build large buff possibility something go wrong late 6 respondent ask rank feel statement “i worry future job” scale one seven (strongly disagree strongly agree). household classify as: “less worried” perceive job insecurity response decrease 2006 2009; “slightly worried” response increase one step; “a lot worried” response increase two steps. bi central bankers’ speech 7 on. it also consistent early work reserve bank show household particularly uncertain future tend spend le increase income household confident.7 in summary, work save use household level data confirm many popular explanation recent increase savings. high house price debt level effect, fall price investment portfolio general increase uncertainty. this work also confirm increase save widespread across population. household spend i would like turn save spend look change take place household expenditure patterns. the two comprehensive source data area quarterly national account household expenditure survey, currently conduct every six year abs. the late survey take place 2009/10 release couple week ago. it cover almost 10,000 household classify expenditure 600 individual categories, range “towels face washers” “road tolls” “ten pin bowl charges”. look longer-term trend sources, two change stand out. graph 8 the first significant rise time share total expenditure housing. when household expenditure survey conduct early 1980s, house account little le 13 per cent total expenditure (graph 8). by way contrast, recent survey share increase 18 per cent. this large change single expenditure category. the bulk change take place past decade largely reflect rise interest payment mortgage debt due high level debt relative income. 7 see berger-thomson l, chung e r mckibbin (2009), “estimating marginal propensity consume australia use micro data”, rba research discussion paper no. 2009–07 8 bi central bankers’ speech the second longer-term change decline share spend good increase share spend (non-housing) services. for example, early 1980s, spend clothing, footwear, household equipment furniture total around 14 per cent total household expenditure. today, figure 8 per cent. in contrast, substantial rise share total expenditure account health, education range household personal services. while increase partly explain rise relative price many services, volume consumption service also increased. these broad trend see across entire income distribution, although subtle difference across incomes. the decline share spend clothe footwear, example, evident across income groups. conversely, household income quintiles spend high share services, large increase evident expenditure recreation services, pay tv internet (graph 9). in addition, many middle low income household noticeable increase share spend holidays. it would appear rise incomes, appreciation exchange rate emergence low-cost airline make travel affordable many people. there also general increase share expenditure devote education and, higher-income households, noticeable increase spend household personal services. look forward, likely broad trend continue. graph 9 return aggregate data, different trend spend good service also evident national account measure change expenditure adjust movement relative prices. the difference unusually pronounce past year, consumption good increase around 1¾ per cent, compare growth around 4 per cent consumption service (graph 10). bi central bankers’ speech 9 graph 10 the recent relatively weak growth consumption good lead subdue trade condition many part retail sector. in contrast, condition good number service part economy. again, accord national accounts, consumption education service 5 per cent year, recreation culture 7 per cent, hotel cafés restaurant 6 per cent, consumption transportation service well ten per cent. these outcome suggest although household save high share income past couple decades, also prepare increase spend service quite significantly. exactly difficult pin down. one can’t completely rule possibility spend good understate due increase internet purchase foreign retailers, although unlikely particularly large part story. another explanation gradual shift household preference away good towards “experiences”. this would consistent strong growth spend recreational activity occur recent times. a important factor though likely strong growth household income. over past year, aggregate household disposable income around 7½ per cent, boost spend service quite sensitive income growth. this increase importance consumption service australia pose challenge track overall growth consumption real time. the main high-frequency data consumption goods. australia long comprehensive retail trade survey publish monthly basis abs, survey report separate result various type retail establishments. but spend measure survey currently account one third total consumption, around 40 per cent early 1980s. unfortunately, service timely comprehensive measure spending. there are, however, number high-frequency indicator bank track provide insight part economy. to take one example, variety monthly indicator spend transportation including: number litre petrol sold; number domestic flights; number international flights; 10 bi central bankers’ speech number passenger certain public transport network (graph 11). over recent times, data international flights, particular, provide timely insight relative strength service consumption, australian travel overseas ever increase numbers. graph 11 however, various partial indicator useful, fall well short full substitute comprehensive timely measure service consumption. the ab forward work program include effort improve measurement service consumption bank strongly support efforts. conclusion so conclusion, significant change save spend pattern take place australia. the effect change probably pronounce retail sector, increase save switch towards service lessen growth spend goods. a result, condition quite difficult many retailers. the increase household save is, however, positive development national risk-management perspective. household use income growth build big financial buffers, hold good stead uncertain world live. these high save rate likely quite persistent represent return traditional patterns. while partly reflect ongoing adjustment early big run house debt house prices, evidence i talk today suggest also factor play. in particular, many household appear increase save response decline equity price increase uncertainty future. it reasonable expect that, point, impact factor begin wane, although exactly remain open question. the reserve bank continue monitor trend carefully, national level micro level. over period ahead, way household respond global uncertainty continue growth income will, doubt, important bear development australian economy. thank you. bi central bankers’ speech 1 denton rarawa: recent economic financial development solomon island address mr denton rarawa, governor central bank solomon islands, open new anz

declare anz’s new honiara central branch hyundai mall officially open. thank much. bi central bankers’ speech 1 ric battellino: will australia catch u cold? address mr ric battellino, deputy governor reserve bank australia, euromoney forum, new york, 21 september 2011. * * * it great pleasure take part conference, particular new york again. i visit new york regularly large part career reserve bank. i always much enjoy visits, that, course, purpose. the point visit find go u economy because, long time, major bear australian economy. through 1980s 1990s, development australian economy show close correlation u economy. it particularly strike recession early 1970s, early 1980s early 1990s highly synchronise two country many similarity nature origins. a result, common 1980s 1990s hear phrase “when u sneezes, australia catch cold”. australian economists, include reserve bank, spend lot time research question growth australian economy highly correlate us. we intrigue closeness relationship trade flow two economy particularly large. the unite state always moderately important export destination australia. the research unearth various channel contribute close relationship, two factor seem particularly important:  first, economic shock face two country lead recession 1980s 1990s similar, policy responses. it understandable, therefore, economy would follow similar paths.  second, financial cultural link two country always strong. the unite state large investor australia many australian company operation us. u economic news receive wide coverage australian media. this, turn, often promote similar movement financial prices, business sentiment, even household behaviour. scrutiny close relation two economy reach peak around mid 1990s. ironically, around time relationship begin change. certainly, first decade century, path economy clearly diverged. whereas unite state experience recession 2001 2008/9, economic downturn australia around time relatively mild. it 20 year since australian economy experience year negative growth. this represent long period uninterrupted growth australia’s economic history, one precedent among develop economies. why path two economy diverged? i don’t think i provide exhaustive conclusive answer question, couple factor clearly play significant roles. first, 2001 2008/9 recession unite state large degree consequence financial misadventure. the former heavily influence collapse “tech” bubble, latter collapse sub-prime house bubble. australia affect nearly seriously either events. the tech bubble largely miss australia. in fact, late 1990s australia constantly berate 2 bi central bankers’ speech old-world economy home-grown information technology industry. a turn out, heavy user technology, manufacturer it, advantage. the australian economy distort tech bubble build late 1990s, weaken much u economy price tech stock collapse 2001. the mildness 2001 economic slowdown australia mean reserve bank able normalise interest rate relatively quickly thereafter. in event, help australia avoid bad excess house market subsequently build many countries. the house market “frothy” australia whole around 2002–2003, cool noticeably 2004 interest rate rose. while subsequent price increase particular cities, speculative element market subside considerably state time global financial crisis hit 2008. aside increase interest rates, reserve bank also warn repeatedly around time danger excessive increase house price borrowing, may have, margin, curtail speculative activity. it also helpful australian prudential regulation authority (apra), prudential supervisor, press bank maintain relatively high lend standards. while sub-prime lend activity australia, small scale, mainly non-bank lenders. a such, arrears rate house loan remain low levels, australian bank remain profitable. australia, therefore, home-grown financial crisis 2008/09, financial institution also little direct exposure u house market. a consequence, case 2001, australia experience mild economic slowdown 2008/09. the fact australia avoid direct impact tech crash sub-prime crisis obviously help explain australian economy do good u past decade. but another factor contribute outperformance grow role china global economy. the expansion china overwhelmingly positive impact australian economy past 10 15 years, whereas implication chinese expansion unite state mixed. the integration china global economy important factor shape performance many economy past 10 15 years. generally, economy complement chinese economy do relatively well. obvious example commodity exporter australia latin american countries, exporter capital equipment luxury cars, germany, country part china supply chain, many asia. arguably, australia one economy complement chinese economy. it large producer food, energy, basic material education tourism service – product service china strong demand – limit size specialise nature australia’s manufacture sector mean economy whole face wide-scale competitive pressure china. a evidence this, past decade australia experience much large rise term trade major commodity exporters, apart chile. while clear china large influence australian economy, say u development long matter. clearly, do. they continue play important role shape financial market behaviour, household business sentiment. the point, however, past 10 15 year channel powerful enough dominate overall economic outcomes, outweigh influence i mentioned. at juncture, u australian economy find different cyclical positions. the unite state still struggle recover deep recession cause sub-prime crisis, australia, grow 20 years, operate relatively bi central bankers’ speech 3 little spare capacity invest heavily meet rapidly grow demand resource china, elsewhere asia. a topical question present whether recent turmoil global market eventually overwhelm positive effect australian economy china. that could occur either financial uncertainty undermine household business confidence, therefore consumer investment spending, turmoil also weaken chinese economy, lead reduce demand resources. it simply early able answer question. for one thing, nobody yet know when, how, issue cause financial turmoil resolved. in case go heart institutional arrangement europe, cannot resolve quickly. it impossible know, therefore, long turmoil last, even escalate further. a yet little way hard economic data available period since financial market volatility escalated, let briefly run know. i begin observation china. a year ago, common question whether chinese economy could continue grow u economy slowed. the experience past three four year has, i think, answer question, answer affirmative. china maintain strong growth face u recession sluggish recovery. the late batch chinese data, relate august, suggest slow economy has, date, modest. this confirm recent data australia’s shipment coal iron ore china, also hold firm. so price iron ore coal. in relation australia, comprehensive data economy – national account – available june quarter, pre-date recent financial volatility. they confirmed, point, picture strong business investment; decline government investment, early fiscal stimulus unwound; relatively flat dwell investment; weak commercial construction. all broadly line expectations. the one area national account surprise strength household consumption. retail sale subdue much year, generally take sign weak consumption overall. but national account show household spend service strong. household spend entertainment, eat travel, particularly overseas travel. at one level, surprise give clear sign caution among households, le surprise account take on-going fast pace increase household income. for time, increase income use rebuild saving, household save ratio stabilise recent quarters, income growth provide wherewithal fund consumption. the national account also show australia’s gdp continue affect severe effect mine activity flood australian summer. take literally, weak sector australian economy past year mine sector, output fall 9 per cent past year. we know process reversed, need look judge underlie strength economy. our estimate underlie trend mining-related activity next couple year increase order 10 15 per cent. the rest economy hand, grow annual rate 2 per cent. this would regard normal past. this slow pace growth non-mining sector simply matter shortfall demand. there sign capacity part economy supply good service also slowed. for one thing, growth working-age population slow markedly past couple years, due largely slowdown immigration. also, 4 bi central bankers’ speech productivity growth continue low. for growth non-mining economy pick up, likely trend need reverse. labour market data available august. they continue point soft outcome employment, surprisingly fast increase last year. the unemployment rate also rise 0.4 percentage point past months, steady around 5 per cent much year. these trend could indication economy slow recently pace potential. on hand, aspect labour market number strong feel. contrary slow number people employed, solid growth total hour work recently. also, recent rise unemployment pronounce resource-rich states, independent indicator – number people unemployment benefit – point rise unemployment. all suggest information need draw firm conclusion whether labour market weakening. measure consumer business confidence decline sharply august, follow increase financial market volatility. this surprising. consumer confidence subsequently recover somewhat september. we need wait see swing confidence affect spending. so far, recent liaison information retailer point significant weakening. let end word reserve bank see monetary policy. the context monetary policy past year overall economy operate relatively little spare capacity, face large boom investment large rise national income. the bank’s view that, accommodate without generate undue inflationary pressures, component spend would need grow le might otherwise case. the implication monetary policy would need provide element restraint. accordingly, bank late last year lift cash rate point result lend rate economy little average. from time time past year, bank consider whether restraint required, balance conclude exist policy set remain appropriate, particularly give restraint also apply high exchange rate. at recent monetary policy meeting, board judge recent financial volatility could weaken outlook demand, hence may, due course, act dampen pressure inflation. on basis, board judge prudent maintain current stance monetary policy. in meantime, financial market seem conclude risk weight towards australian economy weaken sharply and, take literally, seem price reduction official interest rate towards unusually low level reach global financial crisis. there technical reason current market price may give accurate picture interest rate expectations. nonetheless, market seem reach pessimistic assessment appear base mainly assumption weakness u europe flow australia. the present situation similarity 2003. from late 2002 third quarter 2003, financial market price cut interest rate australia, largely back concern sluggishness u recovery time. in event, however, sluggishness unite state flow australian economy australian interest rate fall. bi central bankers’ speech 5 conclusion let conclude. it early stage judge degree certainty whether australia catch cold us. however, give past 10 15 year australian economy le vulnerable severe u symptoms, reasonable grind optimism. until clear picture emerges, bank’s approach keep open mind, base assessment appropriate policy careful analysis data become available. bi central bankers’ speech 1 ardian fullani: build future financial education speech mr ardian fullani, governor bank albania, 9th annual conference bank albania “building future financial education”, tirana, 15 september 2011. * * * honourable minister finance, honourable deputy minister education, your excellency ambassadors, honourable nb governor šoškiæ, honourable mr. passacantando, it special pleasure open 9th conference bank albania time dedicate financial education. i take opportunity wish warm welcome participant room particular foreign guests. if ask directly i mean financial education, i would summarise as: ability consumer investor understand financial concept products; ability understand protect oneself unwanted developments; ability people make sound decision money accordance life’s circumstances. financial education start understand role finance free market economy. finance “lubricates” economic growth process. it also provide opportunity sufficient financial resources. in 1911, renowned austrian economist joseph schumpeter said: “...that structure modern industry could erect without finance, make individual certain extent independent inherit possessions, talent economic life ‘rides success debts’ even conservative orthodoxy theorist cannot well deny.” if ask financial education important, i would say words: contribute albanians’ financial welfare. the literate financially, capable make decision contribute improve welfare. this true everyone, regardless come from. a friedman, nobel prize winner, says: “economic freedom essential condition political freedom”. our exercise right result economic freedom would unavailing absence financial literacy equality marketplace. this imply information time, also capacity use information. finance create add value rich, also entire society. it necessary create equal access citizens. equal access finance equality law foundation modern market economy. finance financial education walk side side. while literacy may turn poor man rich man, illiteracy, hand, may conduct rich man misery. finance dangerous financially literate enough. that i consider conference highly important. the bank albania devote constant attention financial education. our education agenda integral comprehensive term geography age groups, full interactive element modern communication methodology. furthermore, i would like refer element constitute philosophical grind educational work. 2 bi central bankers’ speech first, i would like recall financial welfare inextricably relate country’s economic progress. it already prove individual’s welfare proportionate economic activity price financial assets. the cause-effect relation true directions. our economy financial institution strong revenue wealth grow. financially healthy individual incline increase consumption and, therefore, boost spending, consequently push economy forward. moreover, financially successful people boost lend potential channel save deposits. therefore, position access credit bank system, give life new business which, turn, provide high employment welfare. to people, job salary estate essential personal financial welfare. however, fact may job, salary imply automatically capacity make wise decision effective money utilisation. this point relation financial education subject test truth. be test passed? the sub-standard credit crisis u reveal individual case manage pas test. consequently, debt load individual grow even heavier, access credit become tighter, result big risk financial future. a similar analogy may draw lend foreign currency eastern european countries. secondly, financial education see public good bring positive externality society. it increase individuals’ financial welfare, also affect directly economic policy efficiency undertake relevant authorities. the more-educated public, high economic policy efficiency is. maintain inflation economic activity control almost impossible society ail financial illiteracy. macro-economic balance achieve maintain monetary fiscal policy instruments. the society need aware instruments, understand them, evaluate stimulus incentives, properly respond them. the important role consumer behaviour policy success clearly evidence “rational expectations” theory. a simple intuition behind theory rational individual shape expectation use available information optimally. they respond new information adopt behaviour maximise welfare. in case, individual “equipped” financial literacy read understand development economic policy respond rationally. this mutual understand would drive economy towards desire direction. the central bank adjust policy response actual behaviour agents, would adjust behaviour line central bank policy. for interaction happen, public central bank need speak language understand unequivocally. money management need two-way understand active role individuals. consequently, trust confidence public earned, monetary policy objective achieve reliability enhanced. thirdly, i would like underline financial education individual establish stable society one hand strong secure bank system other. efficient ongoing financial education path trot million individual family endeavour achieve financial goal accumulate wealth. the positive effect process reflect strong economic financial stability entire society. the bank system role play process, mainly lend business households. a regulator, bank albania give share contribution ensure bank strictly abide legal regulatory obligation relation customers. on hand, financially literate customers, contribute bi central bankers’ speech 3 development bank system increase demand financial product services. therefore, result clear: high efficiency, low charges, good service healthy safe bank system. fourthly, i would like highlight financial education, time, improve live standard long run, include retirement age. in recent analysis, essential reason individual need amplify financial literacy investment help reach money management objectives. although personal objective may vary individual another, financial education point view, improvement society’s live standard guarantee confidence future boosted. financially literate individuals, capable make healthy financial plans, early stage career. their knowledge enable plan finance retirement, children’s education accumulation financial assets. these individual behaviours, seemingly irrelevant, bring great benefit national perspective. fifth, i would like underline financial education long-term process, extend time, presence specialise institution indispensable. although financial crisis individual incur large damage, continue involve future crisis. the number individuals, familiar interest rate either receive pay financial transactions, remain low. the may say investment strategies, financial risk identification assessment, elementary money management concepts. many people think financial term perceive accurately profit cost result bank loan use, wealth-related effect originate home ownership similar long-term assets. reason behind behaviour understandable relate fact majority society acquire information circumstantially, hop actual failure become lesson future. one way eradicate circumstantial learn introduction financial read early stage education. in view, i would proudly say that, bank albania provide outstanding contribution. allow briefly make résumé work aspect. the first strategic station financial education provide bank albania need assessment identification train priorities. from point view, assess indispensable open bank “de facto” public. more frequent communication market important participants, well periodic explanation monetary policy decision-making risk balance relate inflation financial stability, initiative consider effective education process. i proud say have:  a public opinion build expectation regard decision-making;  a medium sector, admirably enhance understanding, interpretation expectation relate decision-making;  a bank sector, read accurately respond high flexibility direction orient us;  a qualify public critique, bank albania find mirror alternative opinion adopt decision practices. another important aspect identification division population accord demographic, geographic cultural characteristics. for us, financial education public 4 bi central bankers’ speech good intend all. in compliance best international experiences, identify financial education young people highly important, target student also educators. it practical realisation complex process require adequate human financial resources. for purpose, slogan adopt u meaningful: “education may costly, priceless”. the implementation methodology widely known: meet face-to-face, interactive game intrigue children’s imagination, series publication flexible level difficulties, train teacher economy, tour various school country. in regard, i would like point recent contribution bank albania high-school student book on: “personal finance hands”, conceptualise elective subject high schools. honourable participants, education never-ending process. learn lifelong. it deep, immense, comprehensive. therefore, i say spite do far, still long way go. the bank albania deem imperative draft implementation national strategy contemporary financial education. the bank albania stand ready join initiative national level, aim promote literacy across country. thank you! bi central bankers’ speech 1 mark carney: recent economic development remark mr mark carney, governor bank canada, saint john board trade, saint john, new brunswick, 20 september 2011. * * * introduction it pleasure saint john. when i get morning, thing changed. for first time, sense turn seasons. it fitting, course, autumn equinox week, look calendar doesn’t dispel wistful feeling: summer go? instead look forward string lazy, hazy days, face touch frost air ... smell fear financial markets. canadian enter summer brim confidence. expect strong sales, business full plan add job invest plant equipment. canadian positive view economic prospects. now, face alarm event abroad, le sure. what happened? and public private sector respond? what happened? the fear currently dominate global financial market three causes: deterioration global economic outlook, intensification european sovereign debt crisis grow question ability policy-makers respond. high government debt leaf euro area extremely vulnerable change global growth prospect investor sentiment. these challenge compound nature european monetary union, demand prolong deflationary adjustment country lose competitiveness. the immediate concern grow fund pressure european banks. most see cost borrow rise sharply, access important financial market curtailed, equity trade historic low relative value assets. if quickly reversed, situation could create damage negative feedback loop among banks, lend real economy. this would occur time european economy – large world – already slow dramatically. while immediate concern banks, broad issue fiscal competitive position number countries. most european government little choice reduce budget deficits, despite weak private demand (chart 1). ultimately, europe’s problem cannot solve fiscal austerity alone. any durable solution must include series measure rebuild competitiveness. for example, spain run 4 per cent current account deficit despite depress economy, greek unit labour cost rise third relative germany’s since start european monetary union. in short term, problem europe compound slow global growth. in particular, u.s. economy lose momentum. 2 bi central bankers’ speech recent benchmark revision show u.s. recession deep recovery shallow previously reported. what learn summer suggest dynamic currently affect u.s. economy changed, magnitude much larger. in short, house market remain mess, consumer weak, government action expect reduce growth materially boost recent years. american household experience major shock net worth, fall peak 6.4 time income pre-crisis 5.0 second quarter year (chart 2). these loss recover combination increase save rise price house financial assets. each clearly take time. overall, unite state midst weak recovery since great depression, bank expect change time soon (chart 3). in fact, u.s. economy track exactly dreary path advance economy experience major financial crises. bi central bankers’ speech 3 the bank expect u.s. economy continue grow trend rate around 2 per cent second quarter 2012. this reflect combination modest growth consumption, begin fiscal drag, solid business investment equipment software, relatively strong export growth. these last two factor course importantly influence global developments. at stage, bank canada expect recession unite states, although risk clearly risen. the u.s. economy close stall speed, negative feedback loop weak employment, consumer demand, business hire investment could emerge. the possibility market could tip balance cannot dismissed. further decline value financial asset could encourage high save discourage corporate investment, remain possible credit condition american firm could tighten materially. what mean canada? the direct impact weak european growth canada relatively modest. however, financial confidence effect could considerable. in response uncertainty europe, global equity commodity price fall significantly, financial market volatility increase markedly. the spillover canadian financial market le pronounce still notable. overall financial condition tighten canada, largely due decline equity values. importantly, financial system continue work well. our bank virtually unmatched access fund capital; credit canadian household business remain widely available historically low rates. the direct impact renew slowdown unite states, large trade partner, material. moreover, u.s. slowdown hit activity sectors, auto housing, matter canada. to put perspective, consider average u.s. recovery, u.s. gdp would 2.5 per cent high canadian export would 6.5 per cent greater, equivalent $30 billion additional sale (chart 4). but average recovery and, now, considerable external headwind economy face recent year blow harder. net export expect remain major source weakness, reflect modest global demand ongoing competitiveness challenges, particular persistent strength canadian dollar. 4 bi central bankers’ speech it worth remember reduce competitiveness typically mean high penetration import canada. the ratio import gdp rise 7 percentage point past decade. there also good news: period, increase proportion import investment purposes, rather consumption. this indicate increase share canada’s import add capital stock, rather simply consume (chart 5). this need continue. the bank expect growth resume second half year, lead business investment household expenditures, although low wealth income likely moderate pace investment consumption growth. slow global economic momentum dampen domestic resource utilization inflationary pressures. the bank expect total cpi inflation continue moderate temporary factors, significantly high food energy prices, unwind. core inflation expect remain well contain growth labour compensation stay modest, productivity recovers, inflation expectation remain well anchored. the risk economy remain largely external skew downside. bi central bankers’ speech 5 what must done? the debt-ceiling fiasco unite state inability, date, european policy-makers get ahead crisis reduce investor confidence effectiveness policy. the combination high debt load unpredictable politics toxic. still, important distinguish willingness act ability address current challenges. there much policy do. the european situation fragile fixable; manageable managed. the european central bank stand ready supply virtually unlimited liquidity european banks. this prevent sort dramatic liquidity event saw 2008, cure. bank situation become highly defensive. the lesson japan 1990s behaviour starts, hard reverse. the point central bank effort create bridge. the follow-up action must swift sizeable. european authority need move decisively contain crisis. measure take must draw private capital back in, rather merely fund exit. actually implement announce measure start rebuild confidence. enhancement exist european fund facility put place. financial reforms, include basel iii capital measures, implement timely fashion. path sustain fiscal consolidation established, consistent agreement reach last year’s g-20 summit toronto. but required. in bank canada’s opinion, need comprehensive capital plan european banks, crucially, sizeable fund backstop european sovereigns. the reality best commitment even bind legislation restore investor confidence overnight. a canada learn mid-1990s, country need build sustain track record tangible result order rebuild trust. similarly, structural policy enhance growth long pay back. thus, european authority must create time re-found monetary union base credible fiscal arrangement flexible economy adjust quickly inevitable shift internal european competitiveness. in opinion, exist european resources, include european financial stability facility european central bank facilities, use much efficiently create multi-year window adjustments. just demand must rebalanced europe country current account deficits, spain, surpluses, germany, must adjust globally. under current policies, large current account imbalance expect persist. continue reliance domestic demand advance economy promise disappointment. a see recent weeks, hand-off public private sector unite state europe danger fumbled. fiscal consolidation begun, without autonomous private demand pick slack unresolved fragility barrage negative shocks. rebalancing demand across economy require implementation comprehensive financial reforms; open trade capital markets; significant change fiscal, structural exchange rate policy across broad range countries, include major emerge markets. when g-20 meet late week washington next month paris, issue must centre agenda. in face difficult external environment, bank continue support canada’s economic expansion keep inflation low, stable predictable. since crisis erupt four year ago, bank demonstrate nimbleness conduct monetary policy. we react quickly forcefully downturn. a 6 bi central bankers’ speech canadian recovery progressed, emphasise would prudent respect possible withdrawal degree monetary stimulus. the bank always take flexible approach. our decision guide consider analysis inform judgment rather mechanical rules. for example, emphasised, give current material headwinds, policy rate return long-run level inflation project reach 2 per cent target output project reach potential. the bank also exercise considerable flexibility respect time horizon inflation expect return target. in general, size nature shock hit economy bear appropriate target horizon. over last 20 years, persistence effect shock economy typically desirable return inflation target period six eight quarters. however, considerable variation horizon short 2 quarter long 11 quarters.1 on least eight occasions, bank extend target horizon beyond eight quarters. it recently april 2009, return inflation target long period warranted, give unusually large shock confront canadian economy time. just mechanical rule path policy rates, outsource monetary policy u.s. federal reserve. what happen unite state obviously matter canada, mean rate tie americans. over two decade inflation targeting, overnight rate canada 200 basis point above, 200 basis point below, federal fund rate. these variation reflect difference respective economic outlooks. canadian monetary policy appropriate canadian circumstance consistent achieve price stability canada. canadian also assure bank take necessary step ensure core financial market remain liquid operating. in event major systemic shock, bank wide range tool provide exceptional liquidity, consistent principles-based framework. this help ensure canadian benefit strength financial system, bad time well good. while experience fallout event europe unite states, canada also draw lesson experiences. the european sovereign crisis reinforce importance sustainable government debt value flexible exchange rate. american difficulty underscore risk excessive household debt. should wait storm? financial market appear paralysed. you shouldn’t be. these event like wave sea. the underlie current – force affect long-term outlook business economy – much stronger. today, chart reveal three major currents: canadian firm underexpose fast grow part global economy; commodity price expect remain elevate relative historic averages; firm productive could need be. regardless happen unite state europe, challenge opportunity need seize sustain effort canada. the world’s economic centre gravity shift rapidly advance emerge economies. the game unite state take market share (something recently) participate grow market. to put 1 accord projection publish since 1998 bank monetary policy report, variance horizon inflation project return 2 per cent target. bi central bankers’ speech 7 bluntly, u.s. economy expect relatively weak time household repair balance sheet government wrestle deficits. how weak depend choice american make but, give pressures, limit upside. canada look elsewhere grow exports. emerge market already account almost one-half growth import past decade. in process expect continue decades, emerge asia rapidly urbanizing. china india house equivalent entire population canada every 18 months. in parallel, massive new middle class formed, grow 70 million people year. thus, even though commodity price ease recent weeks, expect remain elevate levels, support large, sustain demand increase emerge world, particularly asia. we need take advantage opportunity limit domestic debt demography mean potential growth economy slowing. a boomer generation ages, labour force participation rate decline hour work fall. the direction clear. the question merely one degree. if develop new market improve productivity, cumulative loss income slow potential growth could almost $30,000 every canadian next decade.2 conclusion it often say canada island. this true illustrate immune global events. perhaps good analogy u today shore bay fundy canada like ship. we toss wave pull current, still able chart course even stormy seas. the challenge current global economic environment significant so, too, opportunities. our corporation government strong balance sheets, financial institution among resilient world, economy gear future source global growth. to take advantage attributes, need continued, heavy investment improve productivity sustained, innovative effort develop new markets. for part, bank canada wide range tool policy option continue deploy appropriate order ensure canadian seize opportunity environment domestic macroeconomic financial stability. fall may around corner, know canadian best winter. 2 see m. carney, “the virtue productivity wicked world,” speech ottawa economics association, ottawa, ontario, 24 march 2010, available at:

efficient equilibrium towards sustainable growth speech dr darmin nasution, governor bank indonesia, bankers’ dinner, jakarta, 9 december 2011. * * * respectable member parliament, prominent bankers, businessmen dignitaries, distinguish guests, lady gentlemen, assalamu’alaikum wr. wb, good even may god bless u all, to open speech today hold salubrious settings, i would like invite join express thank praise god almighty bless u opportunity congregate bankers’ dinner end 2011. in distinction previous bankers’ dinner’s tradition usually hold open new year, 2011, decide organize annual event close year. by so, sincerely hop ample time reflect success failure past year well discus expectations, risk challenge draw commitment ahead time. distinguish guests, ladies, gentlemen, it come common understand change constellation global economy since global financial crisis 2008 aftermath leave profound widespread fright. against backdrop linger effect global financial crisis, significant challenge manage increasingly complex macroeconomic stability rise considerably. external shock uncertainty seem become constant dimension incessantly shadow u along prevail shift changes. in current era globalization, every formulation implementation would surround degree uncertainty. however, believe every open economy indonesia constantly challenge different external shock time. the problem know when, big channel shock happen. nevertheless, grateful. despite uncertainties, economy show strong performance year compare last year. solid collaboration close coordination, base common understanding, become fundamental element achieve maintain successful management economy. therefore, prior deliver main substance annual address evening, please allow express sincere appreciation thank bank community, element central local government, parliament, business community, academics, observers, medium party i am, unfortunately, unable acknowledge individually, incredibly supportive bank indonesia fulfil duties. for personally, journey lead bank indonesia, state institution legal mandate maintain national macroeconomic stability, extremely precious cherish experience. the experience arduous journey labyrinth trial tribulations, bestow upon deep understand economic dynamics. hence, citizen great nation myself, mandate also provide great honor opportunity pay homage nation indonesian always give best. 2 bi central bankers’ speech this evening, time come reflect bank indonesia achieve year leadership communicate plan strategy beforehand present view regard economic prospect challenge face year come implication bank indonesia. i genuinely hope future perspective i plan present even serve contribution u determine common measure achieve good national economic future. for reason, theme speech even “building efficient equilibrium towards sustainable growth.” distinguish guests, ladies, gentlemen, by theme, i would like bring think view meditate question suppose place function role bank industry achieve economic development goals. in particular, i ask u contemplate heal inefficiency disease hind economy grow high sustainable. only sustain growth, problem poverty unemployment solve altogether. it technically believe high sustainable growth often refer potential economic growth. base estimate, potential growth indonesian economy around 7%, provide investment could grow 12% per year. however, achieve sustainable economic growth, two condition satisfied. first, continuous condusive macroeconomic environment. second, capital accumulation total factor productivity grow economic capacity competitiveness would steadily increase. capital accumulation achieve investment form machinery, plants, research development human capital. the sustainability investment influence multiple factors, profit expectation, investment climate, le important, availability financing. for indonesian economy, scarcity finance among bind constraint investment activity. this reflect late survey sectoral map business condition. more specifically, survey point finance constraint suffer business players, particularly difficulty access bank loan, result high lend rate, demand collateral obligation, complicate administrative requirement. reflect survey results, i would like invite u retrospect place role bank industry. there doubt bank industry strategic role national economic chain. look back evolution innumerable crisis elongate learn curve, would excessive say bank industry transform good bank industry expect public. the public crave bank industry sound robust, also capable effectively efficiently participate finance economy. the establishment sound robust bank industry one hand, successful perform intermediation function effectively efficiently hand, two thing cannot stand apart. it’s like two side coin. it possibly trade-off two, certainly find optimum point two. we cannot remain silent, static satisfy soon, believe bank industry reach good equilibrium, know bank industry asian country continue pursue improvement transform good attain real equilibrium sound, robust, efficient bank industries. if bad equilibrium prevails, face difficulty hardship cop imminent challenge lay bare u welcome the asean economic community (aec) 2015. when capability compete globalization era, become le compatible nations. consequently, become le able benefit globalization accept-induced harm. bi central bankers’ speech 3 distinguish guests, ladies, gentlemen, amidst increasingly strong current globalization, i see 2011 fascinate worthy note year. throughout 2011, book numerous successful achievement bring immense satisfaction. yet, year also full dynamic mount challenge transform u become relatively mature entity manage national economic stability. in manage national economy year 2011, global fluctuation uncertainty seem constant threat loom incessantly us. the uncertainty european mechanism sovereign debt crisis resolution widespread fear linger global recession become two epicenter trigger turbulence unrest global financial market 2011. in closely follow european debt crisis, experience infinite uncertainty walk dark abyss. we know yet profound much long european debt crisis continue last dimension crisis significantly extensive complex. at present, negative event produce negative event reinforce vicious cycle (adverse feedback loop) reflect government debt crisis, worsen fragility bank industries, simultaneous slowdown economic activity turn escalate crisis precipitous prolong crisis. meanwhile, u.s. economic recovery appear remain stagnant due restrict maneuverability fiscal policy stimulate economic activity. the combination relatively constrain fiscal policy economic slowdown naturally compel pin hope central bank savior economy. however, diminish room cut interest rate coerce central bank like the federal reserve invent creative policy stimulate economy “quantitative easing”. a emerge market country, we, too, suffer blow measure form two-way cross border capital flows. retrospect highlights, intention discourage u pessimist look future. quite opposite, highlight present make u continue vigilant devise stretch policy framework withstand large adverse shock anticipation global imbalance uncertainty come year predict much good current condition. we also require make adjustment re-alignment prevail forecasts. distinguish guests, ladies, gentlemen, we grateful, midst unrelenting global turmoil; resilience financial sector national economy increasingly demonstrate robustness. at least, 2011 indonesian economy manage insulate spillover effect european debt crisis trade channel due robust basis largely domestic demand-driven economy within economic structure. despite successfully safe-guarded financial system integrity, believe spillover effect financial market channel felt ever since start greece’s fiscal crisis mid 2010. in early 2011, period optimism global economic recovery flourished, massive capital inflow flood market, thus rupiah greatly appreciated. however, optimism fade instantly april may 2011 follow credit rat downgrade portugal greece fitch. in early september 2011, scale crisis pressure escalate italy spain, prompt investor reassess (repricing) investment risk profile reposition portfolio emerge market assets, include indonesia. we witness rupiah considerably pressure last three month amidst foreign currency excess demand situation. 4 bi central bankers’ speech amidst imbalance foreign exchange supply demand within last three months, bank indonesia maintain steady pace rupiah depreciation relatively measure scale regional currencies. the obtain range fluctuation exchange rate align consistently internal external macroeconomic balance create conducive atmosphere provide great certainty business player real financial sector regard average exchange rate long run. distinguish guests, ladies, gentlemen, we closely monitor amidst massive pressure global financial markets, economy breed strong resilient force make apt mitigate external turbulences. this hearten situation provide u space direct various macro-economic indicator right track (on-track). domestic household consumption expenditure remain strong, investment export continue rise. in spite this, inconsequential realization fiscal capital spend lead situation multiplier effect fiscal operation towards limit gross domestic product (gdp) still inadequate. with ever-increasing investment, investment ratio gdp rise 31.3% compare 23.6% 2005. the increase investment also reflect increase import capital good mainly form machinery, high growth investment lending, expansion foreign direct investment. the increase role investment export pave way well-maintained balance economic growth 2011. for 2011, indonesian economics project grow 6.5%, surpass achievement 2010 6.1%. correspond increase investment, manufacture industry project grow 6.1% (yoy), offset growth extractive sector mining. it hearten note expansion manufacture industry boost absorption workforce formal sector. consequently, unemployment rate fell 6.6% august 2011 7.1% august 2010. portrayal success maintain exceptionally high economic growth even recent global downturn deem satisfactory consumer price index (ihk) inflation remain control. the ihk inflation forecast reach 3.9% (yoy). meanwhile, core inflation remain steady past three-years around 4.0% indicate economy yet operate potential growth. this occur increase production capacity simultaneously correspond increase investment. i perceive trend good start mean capital accumulation process lead buttress effectiveness productive capacity expansion economy. our late assessment phenomenon supply side constraint point fact sensitivity price increase (core inflation) growth increase decline last 5 year, particularly compare early 2000s. distinguish guests, ladies, gentlemen, in midst sluggish economic recovery develop country commodity price correction within global market, indonesia’s export performance remain solid. export grow 28.2% 2011. we take advantage increase intra-regional trade asia; adverse effect economic slowdown develop country compensate increase export asian country high economic growth china india. in meantime, import continue grow rapidly (30.4%) consequence accelerate economic activity. i conclude rise import performance still within relatively safe healthy outlook likely associate import raw material capital good spur increase production capacity. meanwhile, quality capital inflow structure significantly improve increase foreign direct investment (fdi) exceed portfolio investments. overall, 2011, balance bi central bankers’ speech 5 payment book surplus usd 12.6 billion foreign reserve rise usd 111.0 (december 7, 2011). distinguish guests, ladies, gentlemen, the financial system stability preserve midst global turbulence also attributable resilience bank industry, increasingly able absorb instability risk maintain intermediation function. improvement capital consistent implementation bank prudential principle appear effective avoid drastic deterioration industry. this reflect low gross non-performing loan (npl) ratio, reach 2.7%, far indicative threshold 5%, capital adequacy ratio (car) record 17.2% end october 2011. despite pressure domestic foreign exchange market, rupiah liquidity condition interbank money market (puab) remain unaffected, bank liquidity also continue adequate. third party fund (dpk) 2011 (up october) grow 19,0% yoy, ratio liquid asset non-core deposit keep 100% (182.0%) october 2011. the bank intermediation function manage run planned. in 2011 credit growth reach 25.7% (yoy), loan deposit ratio (ldr) rise 81.4% october 2011 75.5% end 2010. the quality credit growth escalate credit productive sector increase reflect growth investment credit reach 31% october 2011. in addition enhance ability absorb risks, bank industry also able gain large amount profit, fact large among asean countries. in october 2011, return asset (roa) bank industry stand 3.11%, far asean average 1.14%. meanwhile, islamic banking, base survey conduct bmb islamic finance, islamic business management consultancy base london, indonesia islamic financial industry occupy 4th position world iran, malaysia saudi arabia. indeed, satisfactory achievement. in september 2011, total asset islamic bank reach rp 126, 6 trillion 3.8% total national bank assets, grow 47.8% (yoy) high last 3 years. the average car islamic bank (bus) sharia unit (uus) grow 16%, average capital adequacy ratio (car ) islamic rural bank (bprs) 24.7% . in rural bank group, late october 2011 year year asset grow 20.56%, credit 20.96%, third party fund (dpk) 21.31%, number deposit account grow 9.72%, capital adequacy ratio (car), late october 2011 grow 28 , 58%. distinguish guests, ladies, gentlemen, i view positive achievement national economy 2011 result hard work strong cooperation among stakeholders, support actively bank community, business agent general public. in opportunity, i would like highlight several policy action take bank indonesia confront national economy dynamic 2011. on monetary side, bank indonesia’s policy 2011 basically strengthen previous year’s policy mix, calibrate dynamic challenge economy 2011. interest rate policy throughout 2011 direct consistent predetermine inflation target 5%±1% 4,5%±1% 2011 2012, respectively. in february 2011 bank indonesia increase bi rate 25 bps 6.75% response intensify inflation expectation, attributable high volatile food inflation. since september 2011, monetary stance turn ease phase, decrease low limit interbank money market interest rate corridor. further october november 2011, bank indonesia low bi rate 25 bps 50 bps, respectively arrive 6 bi central bankers’ speech 6.0% level. the decision low bi rate indeed quite delicate since take middle ongoing turmoil global financial market market mainstream. however, strong belief support highly fundamental consideration. since mid 2011, convince cpi inflation would move down, possibly even reach 5±1% target. on hand, need lay strong basis domestic demand anticipation global economic slowdown. it note year bank indonesia ahead curve first central bank asia low policy interest rate. we view national economy also ring-fenced instability source short term capital flows. in addition, structure capital flow need amend shift long instruments. therefore, 13 may 2011, sbi’s hold period extend 6 month previously 1 month. this policy prof effective halt capital inflow sbi shift foreign capital investment government security market. distinguish guests, ladies, gentlemen, experience demonstrate crisis management often bear extremely high economic social cost involve long recovery. against background, bank indonesia also implement crisis management protocol (cmp). however, cmp need equip proper guidance legal basis regulate crisis prevention resolution process systematic integrate way national scale, financial safety net law. financial crisis generally start liquidity squeeze interbank market, market interest rate hike, exchange rate pressure. for reason, intensify monitor financial market transactions, especially scrutinize vulnerability would lead financial crisis. through develop monitor system, wish ensure adequacy rupiah foreign exchange liquidity financial market, well maintain exchange rate stability. therefore, conduct combination intervention foreign exchange market acquisition government security (sbn) secondary market. this policy quite effective stabilize exchange rate sbn price, also increase sbn accumulation bank indonesia monetary operation purpose (reverse repo). in order maintain stability exchange rate, also need seek long-term policy breakthrough ensure sustainable supply foreign exchange. against background, end september 2011, take initiative issue regulation obligate export proceed proceed external debt deposit domestic bank system. this policy consider soft compare thailand malaysia, regulate tightly foreign exchange flow relate export import since decade ago. we take hostage long market mechanism, fact lead market imperfection, need correct it. consider significant role inflation supply side problem, bank indonesia close coordination government preserve price stability, particularly result volatile nature commodity price government’s decision administer prices. bank indonesia take step increase role inflation control teams, national regional levels. additionally, bank indonesia regional representative office also routinely publish regional economic study serf outlet various aspect regional economy. distinguish guests, ladies, gentlemen, on bank area, within 2011 bank indonesia pursue several policy frame four pillars, namely: bi central bankers’ speech 7 a. policy boost bank intermediation role, enable efficient transparent intermediation, well open access low-income community financial services. include policy policy transparency information primary lend rate continuation financial inclusion program. i put strong attention strengthen bank transparency, expect lead efficiency. first, transparent bank industry would encourage healthy competition good market discipline. second, would increase banks’ ability identify aspect influence cost structure high efficiency level achieved. b. policy enhance bank resilience, bank remain strong sound confront competition, transparent management refer good governance principles. this policy include improvement calculation capital suit good risks, obligate bank implement anti fraud strategy, prudential principle outsource risk management deliver service prime customers. c. policy strengthen supervisory function, aim increase effectiveness bank supervision, especially term quality early warn system. consequently, apply improvement regulation bank report bank indonesia.. meanwhile, enhance effectiveness resolution bank problems, impose deadline every bank supervision status regulation “determination status follow-up supervision.” d. strengthen macroprudential policy. this policy aim strengthen financial system stability good implementation macroprudential surveillance. include policy increase foreign exchange reserve requirement ldr-reserve requirement. in mean time, policy syariah bank 2011 continue pursue term harmonization regulation conventional banking, relaxation regulation, implementation law no.21 year 2008 syariah banking. among issue regulation regulation asset quality syariah commercial bank, syariah business unit, syariah rural banks, finance restructurization, risk management syariah commercial; bank syariah business unit. we also support research, train facilitation smes though policy strategy “enhance sme’s access banks” “encourage bank finance smes”. this policy aim enable smes enhance eligibility capability meet bank requirement (bankable), also boost regional economy capacity. with intensify payment transaction mean payment credit card, atm/debit card, e-money, pursue number policy ensure establishment safe efficient payment system. this policy include among others standardization chip-based atm/debit card, establishment national payment gateway standardization electronic money. distinguish guests, ladies, gentlemen, it important say cannot may assume macro stability definitely continue future. this assumption lead u comfort zone would reduce ability anticipate future challenge early on. for reason, allow part highlight view challenge confront economy, require hard work u anticipate address 2012. the increasingly difficult external challenge relate vulnerability recovery global economic recovery, may bad predict (downside risk). this consider complexity european debt trap definitely affect global economy. imf revise 2012 global growth 4,0% 2,0%. 8 bi central bankers’ speech on one hand, dismal global picture, national economic machinery depend effectivity domestic absorption ability benefit local markets. in connection that, capacity preserve growth momentum limit bank intermediary fiscal expenditure absorption sub-optimal. on hand, combination among global economic deterioration, low interest rate, dan global excess liquidity, tend shift global portfolio allocation. such situation source instability challenge emerge markets’ authority sustain financial stability. a domestic challenge, lot homework finish. some old issue never solve thus create inefficiency economy. in financial sector, national bank industry 1998 vigilant. however, contribution economic development still margin. if look statistic, indonesian bank asset gdp ratio reach 47,2% september 2011. however, credit gdp ratio 29,0%. a comparisons, credit gdp ratio region vary, malaysia, thailand china record 111,4%, 117,0%, 131.0%. opinion business player provide similar picture. from bank indonesia recent survey “how finance company”, proportion bank loan total finance low, 25% work capital, 21% investment. on contrary, intental finance main source financing, 48% work capital 61% investment. in words, seem large asset size bank industry follow high contribution economy. this also substantial portion bank asset productive macroeconomic point view. those one form monetary instrument (fasbi, td, sbi) government debt (sbn). the size bank placement monetary instrument government debt security rp 415.48 trillion rp 245.97 trillion, respectively, end october 2011. in total, constitute 31.4% total credit rp 2,106.2 trillion. about 60% bank indonesia monetary instrument currently hold 10 big banks. moreover, seem preserve high probability, bank charge high lend rate customers, partly also compensate generally low rate placement monetary instrument government securities. the low efficiency bank industry also contribute high lend rate. this reflect operational cost operational revenue ratio (bopo) 86.44% october 2011. for comparison, ratio asean country 40%–60%. although intermediation function somehow works, operational inefficiency generate high cost financing, result low economic competitiveness. such high finance cost illustrate lend rate work capital loan, investment loan dan consumption loan, 12.09%, 11.66%, 13.40%, respectively, october 2011. this despite bi rate reach low ever level 6.0%. for comparison, 3.0% policy rate malaysia 4.5% philippines, bank lend rate malaysia philippine 6.5% and5.7%, respectively (october 2011). the current structural problem give rise false equilibrium bank industry solve market mechanism alone. there need put corrective policy place bring system back towards real equilibrium. on real sector side, inefficiency still dominate conduct economy follow weakness market microstructure, eventually hind market capacity efficient allocation resources. this feature significant impact inflation rate particularly foodstuff category tend volatile uneasy subdued. the fragile microstructure staple food market significant bear two fronts, namely production distribution process. on production front, le effective development strategy agricultural sector, instance, give rise imbalance supply consumption rice bi central bankers’ speech 9 unfortunately take place long period time. the recent increase rice supply result rice import, see mere short cut solution problem. on distribution front, weakness market microstructure revolve around (i) availability logistics services, transportation, transportation infrastructure relate foodstuff, (ii) availability symmetric market information suppliers, wholesalers, retailers, (iii) presence policy favor particular market player eventually create oligopolistic behavior distribution market, well rent-seeking activities. the weakness microstructure distribution market cause rise price consumer level, producer level. distinguish guests, lady gentlemen, the magnitude challenge face come year discourage optimism towards prospect economy. in future, must strive maintain high sense hope optimism, macroeconomic stability strong economic growth momentum. amidst global economic slowdown, expect domestic economy grow 6.3%–6.7% 2012, slightly low 2011 due sluggish growth export. for reason, able maintain strong economic momentum provide foundation domestic economic growth strengthened. we confident low bi rate since october 2011 revive domestic financing, particularly bank sector. an economic growth rate 6.3%–6.7% require finance (including credit channelling) amount rp 598 trillion, equivalent credit growth rate 26,9% (yoy). investment growth rate reach 7.7% 2011 expect grow even high 2012 9.7%–10.1%. vigorous investment eventually buttress purchase power hence support household consumption growth 2012 project reach 4.7%–5.1%. meanwhile, role fiscal stimulus project limit line conservative fiscal deficit target (1,5% gdp) along still significant budget allocation subsidies. cpi inflation 2012 project consistent target 4,5 percent ± 1 percent 2012–2013 expect stable around level 4,5%. distinguish guests, lady gentlemen, consider management macroeconomy still prone global risk well complexity domestic predicament, bank indonesia policy direction 2012 stay focus towards following: a. optimize role monetary policy support economic capacity well mitigate risk global crisis. b. increase efficiency bank optimize contribution economy, strengthen bank resilience. c. increase efficiency competitiveness payment system service national payment well international payments. d. strengthen resilience macroeconomic condition enhance coordination management crisis prevention resolution. e. support real sector empowerment include initiative broaden bank access wide-array community (financial inclusion). in 2012, policy mix instrument strengthen calibrated. policy rate response anchor consistent cpi inflation target 4,5 percent ± 1 percent 2012 2013, time maintain momentum toward economic 10 bi central bankers’ speech strengthen mitigate risk global economic slowdown. this interest rate policy also complement macro-prudential policy mitigate risk vulnerability consumptive sector see unsustainable potentially prone asset bubble risk. the monetary operation policy strategy direct maintain interest rate stability rupiah money market support exchange rate stability forex market. i view kind stability need provide broad leeway domestic financial market deepening. therefore, monetary operation base instrument directly stimulate transaction money market rupiah interbank money market (puab), repurchase agreement (repo), swap market. this approach, i believe, able encourage efficient sound liquidity management banks, lessen dependence placement monetary instrument. i also observe need continue re-alignment process interest rate structure financial market refine mechanism open market operation. bank indonesia policy exchange rate center maintain exchange rate stability preserve external internal balance economy, provide certainty economic agents. since january 2012, policy exchange rate stability support implementation regulation export proceed foreign debt withdrawal domestic banks. bank indonesia also review regulation enrich forex market instrument order revitalize hedge transactions. to curb regional inflation, optimize function bank indonesia regional office (kbi) facilitator catalyst acceleration development region, particularly eastern indonesia growth still immense disparity. kbi encourage carry function effectively strengthen coordination cooperation well synergizing local government. in future, task force regional inflation control team (tpid) sustain strategic consumer good information system primarily encompass information national production stock. to achieve target, strong commitment support wide variety parties, include relevant ministry ministry agriculture, ministry commerce, well local government significantly needed. distinguish guests, lady gentlemen, on bank sector front, policy direct maintain proper balance improve competitiveness strengthen banks’ resilience, well encourage banks’ intermediation function include broaden access low cost bank service rural community. in order improve banks’ competitiveness, kebijakan suku bunga dasar kredit (sbdk) carry ensure well-functioning market mechanism policy target could achieved. from bank supervision perspective, continue enhance enforcement policy require bank include appropriate level target efficiency improvement credit rate low business plan. bank indonesia also look practice interest rate set third party level set indonesia deposit insurance, well limit conduct prize gift offer banks’ customers. policy strengthen banks’ resilience conduct improve banks’ capital structure. it hop policy reinforce bank anticipate potential risk specifically amidst global economic uncertainty. i see policy consumer protection governance also need special attention. follow several act bank fraud course 2011, policy two aspect need reviewed. for reason, 2012 continue refine several aspect relate customer potential customer protection. bi central bankers’ speech 11 furthermore, improve banks’ governance, several regulation financial report transparency would review particularly relation publish financial report regulation pertain appointment public accountant banks. we also examine policy banks’ ownership multi-licensing follow increase complexity banks’ activities. distinguish guests, lady gentlemen, we view strengthen central bank’s role systemic regulator follow enactment law otoritas jasa keuangan (ojk) timely role bank regulation supervision hand bank indonesia ojk end 2013. go forward, bank indonesia continue escort bank industry context financial stability system. for purpose, bank indonesia conduct surveillance bank non banks, examine bank context macro-prudential, coordinate closely context crisis prevention resolution. the function role bank indonesia achieve financial system stability important part bank indonesia law’s amendment schedule 2012 national legislation program. distinguish guests, lady gentleman aside bank competitiveness resilience, encourage process bank intermediation several measures: a. by continue initiative broaden community access bank (financial inclusion), particularly low cost bank service rural community, include improve “my saving” program (tabunganku), develop program financial education, implementation financial identity number conduct survey financial literacy. b. work together government agencies, facilitate intermediation support finance several potential economic sectors. we also ass potential barrier finance sector relatively low credit growth. with regard finance need particular sector commercially unviable bank possess strategic role economy, bank indonesia together government, develop special finance scheme. initiative increase competitiveness governance also center policy direction sharia bank particularly sharia rural banks. in addition, also encourage development product activity sharia banking. go forward, strategy develop sharia rural bank direct accordance characteristic sharia rural bank community bank sound, robust, productive feature special focus provide financial service smes rural community. similar bank sector, financial service sector also encourage low economic costs. this sector include cash non-cash payment system well transaction settlements. bank indonesia determine take lead set policy orientation payment service development future. in context, policy coordination among institution authority imperative, especially since development payment service also involve many party beyond central bank. go forward, development payment service industry perform follow initiatives: a. first, improve security reliability payment service provider implement risk mitigation include leverage technology advancement, strengthen legal framework, strengthen supervision, improve role national payment service providers; 12 bi central bankers’ speech b. second, improve efficiency national payment service providers, include encourage setting-up interoperability interconnection among service providers. c. third, improve consumers’ protection enhance transparency service provider strengthen regulation consumers’ protection. those abovementioned program payment service development stipulate integrate blueprint serf guideline establish efficient, secure, reliable payment system. distinguish guests, lady gentlemen, this bring end speech evening. a thoughtful ponder challenge ahead lead u understand year ahead easy previous years. our commitment carry policy measure already present definitely call support cooperation you. a close remarks, i would like invite “to release nation trap inefficiency, otherwise, crush modernization globalization”. may allah almighty always us, bless u lighten way towards good future. thank you. bi central bankers’ speech 1 abdulrahman a al-hamidy: risk strategy basel iii compliance beyond – extract business value regulatory change speech his excellency dr abdulrahman a al-hamidy, vice governor saudi arabian monetary agency (sama), the institute banking/moody’s analytics symposium, riyadh, 30 november 2011. * * * distinguish participants, i please today share think “risk strategy basel iii compliance beyond”. give linger global financial crisis ongoing impact number economy financial markets, relevant timely subject deliberate upon. i appreciate effort institute bank moody’s analytics organize symposium benefit banker supervisor kingdom. i see list topic cover today impressive list speaker i confident would greatly benefit discussions. the world today yet recover global financial crisis start 2007. while governments, central banks, supervisory authority international organization work hard revive revitalize financial market financial institution many advance markets, recovery slow. follow financial crisis lesson learn exercise attribute main cause include long period easy monetary policy fuel accelerate economic growth accompany lax light supervision number advance markets. consequently, one key response authority develop basel iii reform package aim strengthen global supervision international bank bank systems. while global bank supervisor work hard improve bank supervision, financial crisis mutate fiscal crisis market europe, threaten viability global bank cause risk contagion financial institution markets. consequently drive home lesson strengthen bank supervision alone sufficient prudent fiscal monetary policy essential sound resilient bank system. before i talk basel iii, i would like revisit evolution basel ii framework publish basel committee june 2004 tentative full implementation date 1st january 2007. consequently 2007 pertinent question basel ii fail prevent financial crisis. the response apart slow uneven implementation advance markets, basel ii flaw standard fail address major supervisory weaknesses. these include lack common definition quality capital, limit leveraging, common standard liquidity failure recognize excessive market risk embed trade derivative transaction rise sharply among major banks. therefore, basel ii would do job require do. this bring basel iii address shortcoming basel ii go far beyond introduce variety new concept raise bar term global supervisory standards. some concept emerge various lesson learn exercise carry follow 2007, others product serious research reflection global bank supervisors. basel iii introduce fundamental reform elevate status common equity capital key component core capital. it also introduce concept conservation capital buff even importantly additional countercyclical buff top minimum capital 2 bi central bankers’ speech requirements. also basel iii recognize liquidity important even important capital safety viability bank institutions. it recognize must limit leverage financial institution banker restrain excessive risk taking. basel iii also take serious perhaps much need close look risk trade investment activity particularly derivative balance sheet transactions. in july 2009, interim measure, basel committee issue document address market trade book weakness basel ii immediate implementation. this document know basel ii.5. basel iii go much refinement area counterparty credit risk, credit value adjustments, etc. these measure enhance risk management, governance supervision activity securitizations, re-securitizations credit derivatives. also conceptual level far great emphasis stress test bank institution various risks. bank require develop stress scenario demonstrate ability cope survive stressful situations. basel iii also require supervisor use stress test systemic level. one relate area major concern keep basel committee busy enhance supervisory regime global systemically important financial institutions(g-sifis). these institution subject stringent, sensitive effective supervisory regime also face high capital charge form common equity capital. they already subject supervisory college emerge requirement strong resolution regimes. there already informal consensus rule equally apply domestic sifis. i want delve many detail measure i sure cover various speaker today. i want make fundamental point global supervision revert back fundamental value prudence, conservatism simplicity. these value sama always espouse maintain therefore u transition basel iii raise major concern pose major challenges. let highlight challenge globally face bank supervisor implementation basel iii:  firstly, base iii substantially raise quality, quantity international consistency capital liquidity. the new rule aim strengthen capital risk management banks. this may require bank inject high quality fresh capital, preserve exist capital limit payout dividend bonuses, realize efficiency gains, mobilize liquidity new source certain jurisdiction meet additional capital liquidity requirements. this would major challenge internationally active banks, particularly present market conditions;  secondly, internationally active bank face major capital shortfall revisit business strategy global presence expansion plans. they might require take tough decision exit certain location consider merger consolidation affiliate subsidiaries;  thirdly, implementation basel iii require bank ass exist capacity estimation additional capital liquidity requirements. this may also require bank make additional investment system procedure build-up capacity;  fourthly, new capital liquidity rule conceptually technically demanding. this require bank supervisor undergo extensive train learn new concept techniques; bi central bankers’ speech 3  fifthly, give scarce availability qualify human resources, bank supervisor face challenge attract retain staff appropriate skill sets;  sixthly, meet additional regulatory requirement relate basel iii implementation require bank reassess exist regulatory report compliance structure ensure adequacy. this important give extend transitional timeline implementation, bank require participate quantitative impact study others prepare full implementation within specify timeline. we also keep mind new rule still evolve certain area base result quantitative impact study thus may require adjustment current regulatory requirements;  lastly, important step take banks, adopt robust governance structure best suit business model risk profile. the board director clear understand role corporate governance able exercise sound objective judgment affair bank. the senior management ensure bank’s activity consistent business strategy, risk tolerance/appetite policy approve board. this cornerstone effective risk management framework, sound incentive structure robust governance arrangement must built. in order give perspective implement basel iii, i would point bank control law (bcl) already provide clear definition capital also provide legal capital, liquidity leverage ratio limit large exposures. the bcl also allow sama introduce appropriate relevant international standard emanate basel committee financial stability board. over years, sama proactively introduce international standard best practice saudi arabia ensure saudi bank well managed, adequately capitalize effectively governed. this also reflect safety soundness individual bank resilience overall bank system. in line stance, sama among first group non basel country time introduce basel i framework 1992 basel ii january 2008. while basel i crucial introduction concept risk sensitivity banks’ asset tier-1 tier 2 capital, basel ii introduce u concept internal risk rat system risk modeling. from sama perspective great value introduce basel ii significant progress bank make four areas. firstly, introduction internal capital adequacy

challenge industry globalization keynote address his excellency rasheed mohammed al maraj, governor central bank bahrain, 18th world islamic bank conference, manama, 22 november 2011. * * * your excellencies, lady gentlemen: “salaam alaikum” it pleasure welcome world islamic bank conference. over year conference become firmly establish landmark event calendar bahrain, also global islamic financial service industry. i would like congratulate organiser assemble strong list speaker year’s event. a special word thank due many distinguish speaker appear conference. their contribution vital success. no le important contribution make sponsors, generous support. collectively, contribution reason great success wibc. the topic year’s inaugural session manage challenge industry globalization: strengthen regulatory framework accelerate international development islamic finance. this immensely important topic. a i point several speech since global financial crisis begin three year ago, essential future development islamic financial industry learn mistake interest base finance. this include make sure base secure regulatory foundations. in past 30 year see growth truly global financial system. financial market institution long stop national borders. for example, amount lend bank cross-border 1983 $703 billion. by 2008, year financial crisis become global, figure rise $20 trillion. the trend bank market follow trend sector financial industry. a globalise financial system deliver many benefits. capital free flow could obtain best investment returns. in many part world, foreign capital responsible create new business factory raise rate economic growth provide employment million people. a result, process capital allocation global financial system make possible responsible lift countless million people poverty. it important critic global financial system remember achievement. it far insignificant. at time, however, know, cost achievement. a globalise financial system also provide perfect mechanism transmission contagion one part world another. in early 1980s, problem latin america bring large bank world brink collapse. in late 1990s, asian country suffer financial crisis global capital flow reverse direction. in 2007, problem mortgage market unite state almost cause collapse global financial system give rise first global economic downturn since second world war. there many attempt explain reason global financial crisis. most agree basic conclusions. first, excessive rate save country offset excessive rate consumption others. this create so-called “global imbalances” result flood capital pour advance economies, 2 bi central bankers’ speech set search yield. this turn encourage financial engineer creation cdos structure instruments. secondly, great flow global capital pass financial system inadequately regulated. financial market institution might become global, regulation keep up. despite best effort international standard set body like basel committee bank supervision, nationally-based regulator struggle ensure proper oversight global bank groups. in many cases, group grow large economy country responsible license regulate them. thirdly, institution inadequately regulate also inadequately managed. board director senior management simply could know enough go large, diverse, globally active financial group understand full extent risk running. too often, firm’s risk management internal control system job ensure large diversify firm could properly manage controlled. fix problem highlight global financial crisis take time. there progress issue others. global imbalances, example, still large, remain long unite state continue run large deficits. there sign shareholder large global banks, well regulators, put pressure downsize simplify operations. some bank reduce scale overseas activity crisis. law maker britain unite state look way separate deposit-taking lend activity bank operations. and regulator press bank come so-called “living wills” – plan possibility bank might fail. the great progress has, however, make write new regulations. at end last year basel committee bank supervision publish new capital framework internationally active banks, know basel iii. basel iii try several things, main aim ensure bank big capital liquidity buffers, le highly leverage past. when bank could operate leverage ratio $1 equity every $40 assets, clearly highly leveraged. it mean loss little two percent bank’s asset portfolio could wipe entire capital. the basel committee has, rightly view, set make sure future bank able operate little capital relative assets. how relevant development islamic financial industry? islamic finance relative-newcomer globalization trend. the industry still comparatively young, hardly exist 30 year ago. since record impressive rate growth, even today’s $1 trillion industry still relatively small global scale. even so, global financial crisis give islamic financial industry great opportunity. the obvious flaw conventional finance create great interest islamic financial model. this provide basis industry sustain period strong growth rest decade. the growth opportunity especially strong islamic finance large presence rapidly grow economy least affect global financial crisis. they continue register high rate growth year ahead. if islamic finance make opportunities, still need learn mistake interest-based finance. a islamic financial institution expand, need make sure management control function keep pace growth. a global financial crisis shows, bi central bankers’ speech 3 need firms, especially become internationally active, make sure risk management, control systems, it capable provide accurate picture financial institution’s overall risk profile. board director senior manager also need ensure knowledge, expertise, professional skill manage business grow complexity. build high quality human capital essential build block expansion islamic financial industry. finally, regulatory framework need keep pace expand industry. the islamic financial industry fortunate several well-established standard set bodies, include islamic financial service board, international islamic financial market, account audit organization islamic financial institutions. over years, standard set body demonstrate ability adapt international standard need islamic financial industry. these body need take lead adapt new international standards, include basel iii, specific circumstance islamic finance. ensure firm strong capital liquidity buff see optional extra industry, essential foundation next stage growth. the industry strong strengthen foundations, foundation interest-based finance strengthened. thank attention. bi central bankers’ speech 1 ipumbu shiimi: enhance access finance namibia improve land tenure system annual address mr ipumbu shiimi, governor bank namibia, windhoek, 27 october 2011. * * * director ceremony honourable dr theo ben gurirab, speaker national assembly, honourable minister member parliament member diplomatic corps, member bank namibia board distinguish lady gentlemen, member medium fraternity good even let express gratitude take time u evening. the annual address become one key highlight bank’s calendar, also prove important forum share view issue national importance economy key stakeholders. at last year’s address, i speak financial inclusion imperative inclusive economic development. a bank, put forward four points’ agenda, area regulatory intervention, consumer literacy protection, access financial payment service local ownership commercial bank intervention strategy ensure enhance access finance currently excluded. tonight, i would like expound issue, albeit different angle. that is, share think appropriate land tenure system economy like namibia use conduit improve access finance. but i so, let provide update promise last year’s annual address. i please report make considerable progress regard. the namibian financial sector strategy 2011–2021, endorse cabinet launch end december. under leadership minister finance, bank namibia namfisa, consultation relevant stakeholders, draft document manner reflective four points’ agenda. furthermore, one chapter financial sector strategy dedicate financial inclusion. in addition, white paper local ownership commercial bank draft relevant stakeholder consult provide comments. however, realise present approach improve access finance poverty reduction though meaningful, take u half way unless additional measure reform improve access finance communal area undertaken. it reason tonight, choose theme: “enhancing access finance namibia improve land tenure system”. we believe reform would serve key conduit poor successfully integrate mainstream economy. the key question enhance access finance channel eliminate divide urban rural areas, view reduce poverty? director ceremonies, poverty namibia acute rural areas, land right cannot use produce capital. the late household income expenditure survey 2003/04 show high number namibian household remain 2 bi central bankers’ speech poor poverty largely depend live. the incidence poverty amongst rural household 38 per cent compare 12 per cent urban households. in words, fellow namibian rural area three time poor counterpart urban centres. moreover, 19 per cent household rural area severely poor compare 6 per cent urban areas. this, lady gentlemen, clearly demonstrate disparity level exclusion majority people formal sector economy, especially rural poor, remain serious concern. moreover, farmer communal area remain poor depend largely old age government pension remittance family members. we strongly believe order reduce poverty rural areas, need improve productivity land area move away subsistence farm towards commercial activities. this happen want transform commercial activity able attract finance modernise farm practice able buy farm equipment, fertilisers, livestock labour, also engage economic activities. in regard, need ponder reflect could do ensure divide level exclusion rural urban area minimise and, eventually, eliminate become rather urgent. director ceremonies, lady gentlemen, answer lie already possession poor. the answer land. history demonstrate time again, land remain one important conduit access finance. and, i want present evening. by way background, namibia cover 825 thousand square kilometre land. about 38 per cent land fall communal land tenure, approximately 50 per cent population lives. virtually land right communal area customary rights, registration system. this unlike rest country land right register properly function deed office. this imply 50 per cent namibian population secure tradable land rights. it mean half namibian people cannot use land raise capital. consequently, mean 38 per cent namibia’s land term “dead capital”. director ceremonies, another example dual namibia, is, one country, le formal tenure system communal area advance one allow security tradability rest country. lady gentlemen, land tenure system important factor explain development lack thereof. in book title “the mystery capital”, hernando de soto, term time magazine one five lead latin american innovator twentieth century, demonstrate startle research find asia, africa, latin america former socialist’ country major problem develop country inability use land right produce capital. accord de soto, problem fact develop countries’ resident hold resource defective forms. a typical example this, lady gentlemen, is, house build land whose ownership right adequately record tradable. in environment, asset cannot turn capital cannot use collateral. this situation contrary generally happen advance countries, every build every piece land legally documented, essentially activate asset resource potentially participate economic activities. by de soto’s calculations, total value real estate hold defective form poor third world bi central bankers’ speech 3 former socialist nation estimate around usd9.3 trillion. in namibia, asset could amount n$20 billion represent 23 per cent gdp. let’s imagine, lady gentleman, situation 30 per cent communal land turn productive capital. this may potentially unlock sizable investment equivalent 7 per cent gdp, almost equal current contribution mine sector gdp. the question is; impact 30 per cent, 80 per cent communal land? this go long way create much need employment, stimulate growth reduce poverty rural areas. director ceremonies, i believe ministry land resettlement make good progress improve tenure security communal area must applaud efforts. the communal land reform act promulgate 2002. this act provide clarity administration customary leasehold right communal areas. also, accordance act, regional land board establish manage, together traditional authorities, registration land right i understand reform envisage regard. but important, make land right communal area fully tradable like property rest country. here, i talk tenure security tradability, matter whether freehold, leasehold land rights; important security tradability. lady gentleman, i mindful fact reform land right costly exercise, involve survey mapping. i also aware fact rural area can, socio-political perspective, difficult undertake may even unintended consequences, people sell property quick financial gains. while legitimate fear, i think often somewhat overstated. i believe way mitigate risk manner benefit reform would outweigh costs. similar concern also present today’s advance economy reform land tenure system around 16th century. but, manage overcome challenges. the lesson history country make land right tradable make progress reduce poverty. for instance, vietnamese land tenure policy reform central part wide economic reform doi moi program 1986. this steer country transition well towards market base economy. the improve land tenure security cite play critical role accelerate agricultural growth, increase food security, reduce poverty throughout country. the impressive gain fall poverty rate 70 per cent mid-80s around 29 per cent population 2002 10 per cent 2010. this one sharp decline poverty ever recorded. director ceremonies, need proceed great urgency momentum make land right communal area fully tradable. go forward, propose multi-disciplinary team set-up map road ahead. this team task coordinate action required. for instance, current land law need amend reflective ideal. the revise law also need strengthen management land use communal areas, so-called commonages. this one issue need urgent attention. further, need educate people communal area right obligation result secure tradable land tenure. education ensure citizen fully benefit economic value land tradable land right without fall prey uninformed behaviour, lead loose valuable possession. a namibians, strive make land communal area tradable within period 10 years. 4 bi central bankers’ speech in conclusion, lady gentlemen, property ownership namibia, include land ownership fundamental human right, enshrine supreme law, article 16 namibian constitution. in addition, national land policy 1998 state “all citizen equal rights, opportunity security across range tenure management system several form land right accord equal status law”. we yet realise aspirations, director ceremonies. our people communal area land right equal status fellow citizen rest country. a result, lack opportunity turn land productive capital. let us, therefore, required. let u fulfil human right, will, turn, enhance access finance rural poor unlock conceal potential destiny great country. lady gentlemen, destiny people, nation necessarily shape one big event. it shape series events, series decision – major minor. let u therefore require move communal land system tradable secure land tenure system. let u move towards choose destiny great nation! i thank kind attention. bi central bankers’ speech 1 ardian fullani: educate inspire albania’s young generation speech mr ardian fullani, governor bank albania, 2011

challenge face japan speech mr masaaki shirakawa, governor bank japan, board councillor nippon keidanren (japan business federation), tokyo, 22 december 2011. * * * introduction i honor opportunity address representative japan’s economy gather today. we week leave year notable event nation definitely great east japan earthquake march 11. speak economic impact terrible event, japan’s economy suddenly face enormous downward pressure arise damage production facilities, disruption supply chains, shortage electricity supply. thank tremendous effort company manager employee field, supply-side problem resolve summer, fast expected. however, prospect gradually begin look good japan’s economy overcome problem cause disaster, sovereign debt crisis europe trigger new problem – slowdown overseas economy appreciation yen. a result, sharp rebound, pick-up japan’s economic activity gradually slow currently pause. accord tankan (short-term economic survey enterprise japan) release last week, business condition deteriorate large manufacture enterprises, extensively report newspapers, improve large nonmanufacturing enterprise (chart 1). a smes, business condition improve manufacture nonmanufacturing enterprises. a such, although overall business condition improved, pace improvement slowed. a see result tankan, currently two oppose force operation: one hand, export production remain le flat due slowdown overseas economy appreciation yen; other, term domestic demand, private consumption remain firm post-earthquake rebuild reconstruction demand expect materialize. the bank japan judge japan’s economy le flat time former force prevails. beyond phase, judgment economy gradually return moderate recovery path, reflect pick-up growth overseas economies, especially emerge economies. have say that, fully aware outlook attend various uncertainties. the significant risk is, course, impact european sovereign debt crisis economy effect international financial market global economy. although economic outlook important, i already discuss various occasions. today, instead, i would like give think challenge face japan’s economy central bank medium- long-term perspective, i believe end year good time so. i. japan’s economy past 15 year progress globalization in order understand medium- long-term challenge lie ahead japan’s economy, i first compare today back 1995. i choose particular year comparison point similarity year, 1995 2 bi central bankers’ speech japan experience great hanshin-awaji earthquake (or kobe earthquake also known) appreciation yen, peak year 80 yen u.s. dollar. there many change past 15 years. first, saw globalization goods, capital, people (chart 2). for goods, global trade volume real term exclude effect price fluctuation expect rise index level 100 1995 253 2011. this imply global trade volume continue expand annualized rate 6.0 percent, pace much fast real gdp growth rate 3.7 percent period. this increase essentially cause end cold war subsequent transition region worldwide market economies. this increase opportunity international division labor, lead optimal production combine technology capital advance economy ample labor force emerge economies. emerge economies, particularly china, india, brazil, grow rapidly process (chart 3). for capital, average amount daily transaction foreign exchange market worldwide 1.5 trillion dollar 1998 – far back go make comparison – grow 4 trillion dollars, correspond almost 20 time world gdp per day, 2010 (chart 2). for people, tourist travel abroad increase substantially 530 million 1995 940 million 2011. the number first-generation immigrant also increase 170 million 1995 210 million 2010 (chart 2). rapid population age second, japan’s population continue age rapidly (chart 4). the working-age population, word population age 15 64, decline peak 1995. the working-age population 2010 decline 7 percent compare 15 year previously 1995, 0.5 percent yearly basis. meanwhile, percentage people 65 old account 15 percent total population 1995, rise 25 percent 2010. this globally unprecedented rapid population age far-reaching various effect japan’s economy. the first effect economy’s potential growth rate. the working-age population play central role economic activity. it decline reduce labor supply thus push economic growth. the second effect fiscal balance. at time become difficult increase tax revenue labor income, pressure increase expand fiscal deficit, give social security expense – include pension cost medical nurse care expense – increase population age long current level benefit maintained. the third effect diversification consumer need services. give diverse life lifestyle elderly population, individual wide range unique needs, term medical nurse care also wide context live fulfil life retirement, encompass hobby continue learning. to put another way, continue population age is, sense, market expansion cannot consider mass terms. japan’s delay response change we see environment change significantly past 15 years, globalization rapid population aging. change point time always provide country difficulty opportunities, capability society whole adapt change largely affect economic performance. on point, japan’s government firm respond various ways. unfortunately, however, economic growth rate continue decline price continue fall moderately bi central bankers’ speech 3 result. furthermore, government debt increase substantially period. face facts, cannot deny japan’s economic system manage respond swiftly sufficiently big change environment. one reason decline growth rate aftereffect unprecedented economic bubble late 1980s. the effect bubble considerable. prior lehman shock, optimistic view prevail among economist policy authority unite state – significant economic downturn follow bubble period could avoid implementation powerful monetary fiscal policy bubble burst. that optimistic view long prevalent today. economic activity remain stagnant excess production capacity debt build bubble period resolve (chart 5). such balance-sheet adjustments, however, long act constraint japan’s economy least sometime 2003 2004. the essential reason subsequent downturn japan’s economy japan’s delay response significant change environment, namely, globalization population aging. go back early reference 1995, japan around time desperately look way recover collapse bubble economy. at stage, i recall many u understand significance globalization population age japan’s economy well late come realize. in words, good attribute delay respond inability fully recognize seriousness problem difficulty implement solution despite know were. i believe could happen next 15 year (chart 6). for instance, japan’s rapid population age alter course japan’s future economic growth fiscal conditions? will japan’s economy able maintain longstanding current account surplus? ii. set agenda japan’s economy serious consequence leave situation unchanged regard first question, even focus demographics, relatively easy predict go forward, confirm condition underlie factor affect japan’s growth go change dramatically. the average growth rate decline 4.3 percent 1980s 1.5 percent 1990s le 1 percent 2000s (chart 7). the economic growth rate consist two components: rate growth number worker rate growth labor productivity, represent increase value add worker. we project future growth rate forecast two components. of two, rate growth number worker start decline 2000s, decrease annual rate 0.3 percent average decade. base long-term projection demographic trend assume current labor participation rate gender age group change, rate decline number worker increase 0.6 percent 2010s, 0.7 percent 2020s 1.3 percent 2030s. the impact population decline serious, especially regional economy (chart 8). a component, labor productivity, average growth rate past 20 year around 1.0 percent. exclude 1990s, economy significantly affect legacy burst bubble, choose period characterize relatively favorable economic conditions, labor productivity growth rate 1.5 percent 2000 2008. give significant difference productivity growth rate among advance economies, may able assume average productivity growth rate japan stay 1.0 percent 1.5 percent. assume rate decline number worker described, annual rate economic growth 2010s remain somewhere 0.5 percent 1.0 percent become around zero percent 2030s. medium- long-term growth rate significant impact fiscal 4 bi central bankers’ speech situation. the sovereign debt crisis europe provide u important lesson – fiscal credibility change discontinuous manner (chart 9). we must work seriously strong determination strengthen growth potential. need work create value add how strengthen growth potential? i explain rate growth number worker rate growth labor productivity together constitute economic growth rate. a number workers, difficult expect dramatic improvement unless demographic trend change. however, still possible slow pace decline number worker make easy elderly people woman participate workforce. a second variable, raise labor productivity growth mean increase value add per worker. the key, therefore, continuously capture potential need provide good service people find worth purchasing. more specifically, three important aspect considered. first, important make best use major trend towards globalization. it go without say important aggressively capture demand overseas, especially fast-growing emerge economies. at time, important take active step open market society. with inflow outflow people, goods, capital, chance come new idea business opportunities. second, effort cultivate new domestic demand also critically important. sens value lifestyle diversify elderly, explain earlier, also generations. it important business expand domestic market work capture potential demand measure deregulation take prepare environment firm take challenges. third, order dynamically implement dual strategy expand business globally explore domestic demand, necessary shift labor capital smoothly business high growth potential. this mean effective use human resource capital within firm improvement economic metabolism macroeconomic basis. to mobilize resource way without cause social stresses, necessary strengthen outplacement support schemes, make easy start new businesses, improve safety nets. more anything, important share sense value within japanese society, include acceptance need improve economic metabolism support people take new challenges. “hollowing domestic industries”? i would like briefly touch upon recent concern hollow domestic industries, also relate economic metabolism. to start with, expansion production overseas unique current phase rather trend play past twenty year (chart 10). until middle 1980s, japan increase global market share expand exports. since second half 1980s, japanese firm increase overseas production partly response intensify trade friction. thereafter, continuously review global production network optimize division work home abroad take consideration change demand structure cost structure consequence globalization. a result management decision firms, pace expand production overseas increase trend continue today. this shift production site overseas decrease domestic employment manufacture sector. we need create employment opportunity economy whole enhance growth domestic demand-related sectors, service sector create employment sectors, make use resultant idle labor bi central bankers’ speech 5 force (chart 11). within manufacture sector, give significant gap labor cost home abroad, necessary promote division labor, production assembly site mass production expand overseas domestic operation focus profitable business well cutting-edge technology business ideas. we must, course, pay due attention risk expansion production overseas adversely affect domestic economy. for example, shift could suddenly accelerate certain reasons, include appreciation yen, pace surpass rate consistent trend increase overseas demand. another risk core firm factory abandon domestic production sites. it true appreciation yen create need serious adjustment export industries. at time, also benefit yen’s appreciation. for example, appreciation clearly cause reduction cost imports, increase significantly due increase import crude oil lng japan’s nuclear plant stop operations. we also see japanese firm avail yen’s appreciation make strategic move expand business globally, evidence increase outbound m&a activity (chart 12). credit foreign direct investment income currently total 3.4 trillion yen per year, 0.7 percent nominal gdp. although income somewhat increase compare past, amount overseas investment rate return still small compare country (chart 13). when domestic investment opportunity limited, vitally important improve return overseas investment, particularly foreign direct investment. in case, negative impact yen’s appreciation tend notice positive effect japan domestic-demand relate firms, natural beneficiary yen’s appreciation, fail develop successful business plan reap benefits. in words, order overcome concern hollow domestic industries, ultimately must work strengthen medium- long-term growth potential. make accommodative financial environment lead growth a clear i say far, strengthen growth potential achieve substantive effort work increase value added. in regard, argue “stopping deflation come first achieve easily monetary easing.” however, rise inflation without pick-up real growth rate improve live standard fiscal balances. the real issue raise real growth rate. past experience show price rise later, economic growth pick real terms. to use analogy human body, price like temperature, growth potential fundamental strength. raise temperature without improve fundamental strength possible. even successfully do temporarily, would side-effects. in fact, japan, strong correlation observe potential growth rate expect rate inflation (chart 14). in past even prominent academic economist unite state argue “stagnant growth deflation japan solve easily implement significant monetary easing.” after experience difficulty restore u.s. economic growth lehman shock, however, revise understand issue considerably even apologize withdraw past criticism japan. in case, japan’s financial condition extremely accommodative. nominal interest rate even actual fund rate firms, real interest rate corporate bond adjust use inflation expectations, low japan compare unite state europe (chart 15). in relate context, argue “insufficient provision money bank japan cause deflation yen’s appreciation,” cite size monetary base, total amount currency provide central bank. a chairman bernanke u.s. federal reserve also point out, i, too, consider monetary base appropriate indicator monetary easing. still, even 6 bi central bankers’ speech size monetary base proportion nominal gdp large japan unite state europe (chart 15). a present today must sense business activities, situation business fixed-investment purchase foreign currency-denominated asset constrain amount cash deposit level interest rates. the bottom line come problem make use current extremely accommodative financial condition order strengthen growth potential. iii. the role challenge central bank the bank japan alone: central bank advance economy similar situation. europe deal sovereign debt problem unite state process balance sheet repair. in circumstances, chairman bernanke u.s. federal reserve president draghi european central bank repeatedly point central bank measure panacea. have say that, i deny importance role play central banks. on contrary, many thing central bank do. what important government, private sector, central bank play respective role properly. what, then, role central bank? financial globalization central bank in recent years, become increasingly important central bank global perspective seek conduct monetary policy appropriately achieve price stability. come back basic monetary ease stimulate demand, one channel bring future demand forward urge firm make investment interest rate low. another channel, low interest rate result depreciation currency, capture overseas demand. once interest rate fall almost zero, however, become difficult increase benefit make investment now. moreover, interest rate advance economy also close zero current situation, limit room leave make use overseas demand, least among advance economies. in sum, two channel monetary policy become le effective. give emerge economy high growth rate interest rates, monetary ease advance economy expect stimulative effect increase export emerge economy currency advance economy depreciate emerge economy whole. at present time, however, many emerge country adopt fix foreign exchange rate currency peg u.s. dollar unite state face balance-sheet repair problems. what actually happen monetary ease unite states, instead stimulate domestic economic activity, contribute overheat emerge economy rise international commodity prices, result inflationary pressure adverse effect private consumption u.s. economy. in way, increasingly globalize world, possibility central bank find unintended effect monetary policy eventually come back effect overseas economy financial markets. in end central bank conduct monetary policy base assessment economic price development respective country regions. at time, also become important ever make decision consider complex interdependence different part global economy. against backdrop increase globalization, task maintain financial system stability equally important monetary policy central bank. a see foreign exchange trade volumes, massive capital flow move around globe beyond national borders. even without actual movement capital, derivative transaction transfer bi central bankers’ speech 7 risk across borders. although see financial transaction negatively, give progress globalization term real economy associate need hedge various risk associate economic transactions, interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk credit risk, simply dismiss financial transaction help improve situation. in addition, evidence sovereign debt crisis europe, credibility sovereign state question year. in circumstances, maintain stability global financial system become important prerequisite global economic growth. on topic global financial system stability, strong commitment national government necessary, central bank also utmost regard. one example coordinate action six central banks, include bank japan, regard u.s. dollar liquidity, announce end november. a contingency measure, central bank also agree establish bilateral swap arrangement liquidity non-domestic currency u.s. dollar could also provide jurisdiction. i also add central bank contribute ongoing effort revise financial regulation supervision framework prevent recurrence financial crisis like one 2008, prevent accumulation financial imbalances. the bank’s policy conduct finally, i explain bank’s recent conduct monetary policy (chart 16). first, bank pursue powerful monetary ease comprehensive monetary ease framework implement fall last year. the bank also repeatedly expand size asset purchase program intend proceed additional purchase approximately 13 trillion yen next year. second, bank utmost ensure financial market stability. it provision ample fund immediately follow earthquake well u.s. dollar funds-supplying operation i mention good example efforts. third, extraordinary measure central bank, bank proceed fund provision provide support strengthen foundation economic growth. this aim encourage firm make use accommodative financial environment, provide financial institution long-term fund low interest rate take advantage expertise identify business opportunities. conclude remark – importance adapt change strengthen growth potential i almost use time. my message today summarize follow five points. first, need recognize japan currently face major change – globalization rapid population age – significant impact economy. second, order maintain exist live standard japan next generations, economy must strengthen capacity adapt major change strengthen growth potential. third, deflation overcome strengthen growth potential. fourth, order strengthen growth potential, firms’ willingness take challenge vital need prepare environment encourage firm so. fifth, bank japan also continue consistently make contribution monetary side aim achieve sustainable growth price stability. incidentally, october next year, japan host annual meet world bank group international monetary fund. this big event ten thousand participant exist 187 member countries. japan host meet 1964 country still emerge economy fill energy associate high growth. in year series historic event japan enhance people’s confidence: become member oecd april 28; host annual meet 8 bi central bankers’ speech world bank group international monetary fund september 7 11; launch tokaido shinkansen october 1; hold open ceremony tokyo olympic game october 10. almost half century pass since and, fall next year, japan provide venue discussion among global leader tackle various problems, time mature advance economy. japan experience burst bubble twenty year ago currently face rapid population age ahead countries. in sense, japan well position present new growth model rest world mature economy global frontrunner term population aging. i sincerely hope that, 2012, japan show rest world vision determination continue shine mature economy and, anything else, people japan regain hope courage. in regard, bank japan utmost close cooperation you. thank attention. bi central bankers’ speech 9 10 bi central bankers’ speech bi central bankers’ speech 11 12

congress’11, organise financial plan standard board india, mumbai, 18 december 2011. * * * input provide p r ravi mohan, g s hegde, subrat da smt sadhana varma gratefully acknowledged. justice (retd.) shri b.n. srikrishna, chairman, financial sector legislative reform commission (fslrc), shri swarup shri malegam (members fslrc), shri yogesh agarwal, chairman, pension fund regulatory development authority (pfrda), shri mudholkar shri chikermane, delegates. it honour privilege address today, key issue regard “reforms bank sector” i thank financial plan standard board india opportunity. this financial plan congress come opportune time far reach exercise rewrite financial law undertake fslrc i commend organiser effort put together congress. i. introduction empirical research show good develop financial system accelerate economic growth shrink income inequality disproportionately increase earn low income families1 i.e. enable growth equity, vital country. a well develop financial system require sound legislative framework because, legislation foundation institutional framework stand. to effective, legislation need unambiguous fair also robust enough address exist concern while, time, flexible enough accommodate new need account evolve environment. role legislation context economic development general financial sector particular, interest area study. it argue strong legal system foster development sophisticate financial market intermediaries2, enhance economy’s ability manage risk eventually lead economic growth. measure robust contract enforcement disclosure discipline go long way strengthen financial systems. every legislation time dimension relevance see vis-à-vis dimension. with change environment, practice process change, necessitate review extant legislations. this hold true area like financial system change rapid frequent. the dynamic nature legislation well articulate aristotle say “even law write down, ought always remain unaltered”. india say one over-legislated countries. we numerous act regulations, date back decades. a time change quite significantly since enacted, emphatic need update fine tune enhance relevance rapidly change financial landscape. it welcome step 1 levine, ross. 2 levine, ross; law, finance economic growth; journal financial intermediation 8 (1999). 2 bi central bankers’ speech fslrc constitute look revise exist financial legislation. in context, role congress important facilitate deliberations. financial sector policy comprise set policies, as: – prudential policy ensure safety soundness financial system (financial stability) – regulatory supervisory policy – depositor consumer protection policy – financial inclusion policy – other policy ensure adequate supply credit economically important sector i.e. smes, infrastructure, etc. – market structure competition prudential policy comprise macro prudential micro prudential policy aim ensure safety soundness financial system. collectively, macro micro prudential policy ensure stability financial system would facilitate efficient allocation resource real economy. while financial stability necessary condition ensure objective financial sector policy well growth macroeconomic stability, sufficient condition attain objectives. other financial sector policy implement balance numerous consideration growth imperatives, flow credit disadvantage prefer sectors, consumer protection, financial inclusion equity, etc. at times, become extremely challenge balance consideration and, adequate care take design implement financial sector policies, financial stability may adversely affected. therefore, important set sound financial sector policy (including prudential policies) back sound legislation must adopt deliver various objective – growth equity backdrop financial stability. ii. recent amendment carry various financial sector law before i delve key issue require legislative review, i list enactment amendment make various act last decade highlight dynamic nature legislation. i. reserve bank india act, 1934 amend 2006 provide legality certain otc derivative transaction also give explicit regulatory power reserve bank derivative money market instruments. ii. the bank regulation act, 1949 amend 2007 remove low limit prescribe maintenance statutory liquidity ratio (slr) bank confer wide power rbi stipulate slr requirement bank control liquidity market. iii. the state bank india act, 1955 amend 2007 enable transfer ownership rbi government india 2010 provide enhancement capital, issue preference shares, raise capital public issue preferential allotment private placement right issue; issue bonus share exist shareholders, etc. iv. the state bank india (subsidiary banks) act, 1959 amend 2007 facilitate enhancement capital, raise resource market raise capital right issue. v. the bank company (acquisition transfer undertakings) acts, 1970 1980 amend 2006 enable nationalise bank issue preference bi central bankers’ speech 3 share accordance guideline frame reserve bank raise capital preferential allotment private placement public issue, approval reserve bank. vi. the negotiable instrument act, 1881 amend 2002 introduce concept “electronic cheque” “cheque truncation” expand definition “cheque”. vii. the security contract (regulation) amendment act, 2007 pass view provide legal framework enable list trade securitised debt instruments, include mortgage back debt. viii. the government security act, 2006 enact consolidate amend law relate government security management rbi. the act simplify procedure settlement claim legal representatives, provide admissibility computerise information evidence, contain provision effectively deal misuse statutory general ledger (sgl) account facilitate pledge hypothecation government securities. ix. the payment settlement system act, 2007 enact empower reserve bank regulate supervise payment settlement system country provide legal basis multilateral net settlement finality. x. the prevention money- launder act, 2002 enact follow un general assembly resolution 1998, call adoption national anti-money launder legislation programme member states. the act provide prevent money launder connect activities, enable confiscation proceed crime, set agency mechanism coordinate measure combat money laundering, etc. xi. the foreign contribution (regulation) act (fcra), 2010 enact repeal erstwhile foreign contribution regulation act, 1976 mainly rectify several deficiency find previous act. the new act cover electronic medium organizations, political parties, apart entity prohibit list fcra, 1976. xii. the credit information company (regulation) act, 2005 empower reserve bank regulate credit information company (cic) facilitate efficient distribution credit matter concern incidental it. iii. the road ahead: legislative reform bank sector multiple act – need consolidation bank regulate supervise bank regulation act, 1949. public sector bank viz., state bank india, state bank india subsidiary bank nationalize bank constitute different statute govern respective statute provision bank regulation act. the provision relate ownership management bank company contain bank regulation act applicable public sector banks. co-operative bank constitute respective state co-operative society act multi-state co-operative society act provision bank regulation act make applicable certain modifications. since origin bank historically different, continue govern respective statute well general laws. each statute craft contemporaneous setting, reflect need concern time. therefore, almost 4 bi central bankers’ speech statute amend time time reflect change circumstance context prevail time. there strong case review legislation recast number reasons. first, prudential regulation ownership neutral. however, fact different bank govern different law result uneven play field need addressed. for example, amendment carry enable sbi, sbi subsidiary bank nationalise bank issue preference shares, though different point time, bank private sector cannot issue preference share amendment br act still carry out. similarly, bilateral net event liquidation admissible private sector bank govern company act normal bankruptcy laws, position regard public sector banks, sbi subsidiary clear law, liquidation, all, bank would per notification issue government regard. second, single, harmonize uniform legislation applicable bank provide transparency, comprehensiveness clarity provide ease regulation supervision reserve bank. third, also need sort conflict overlap primary law govern bank sector applicable laws. for example, competition act, 2002 (as amend competition (amendment) act, 2007) conflict provision bank regulation act, sbi act statute deal amalgamation banks. consolidation bank sector law lay common regulatory framework commercial bank issue require serious consideration. management bank management bank institution fit proper person play important role secure safety banks. while rbi power, certain circumstances, remove managerial person bank appoint additional directors, etc., power may effective handle situation supersession board warranted. rbi, currently, power supersede board director bank company. in bank law amendment bill, 2011 amendment propose confer power rbi, use appropriate safeguards. with respect public sector banks, way amendments, similar power vest central government, majority shareholding banks. the shareholding pattern also play vital role respect management bank and, therefore, necessary shareholder sizeable hold also fit proper. rbi has, way regulatory prescriptions, implement acknowledgement procedure. in 2011 bill, statutory provision propose obtain prior permission rbi acquire 5% equity share vote right bank company. at present, deadlock situation arise group person acquire sizeable equity vote right bank without follow acknowledgement procedure. there statutory power direct disgorgement share such, acquisition take place, may result contravention provision br act. the main object prevent management bank capture person fit proper hold sizeable interest achieved. rbi should, therefore, power direct, order, time person fit proper hold equity vote power contravention provisions, shall vote power. the 2011 bill propose confer power rbi. this help prevent unscrupulous person exercise control banks. deposit collection activity currently, collection deposit members/shareholders treat acceptance public deposits. this matter serious concern, particularly, respect co-operative societies. deposit accept enrol member tap collect nominal bi central bankers’ speech 5 amount them, expose depositor serious risks. bank regulation act apply co-operative society outside regulatory purview reserve bank. it necessary plug important loophole. unless deposit receive member vote rights, deposit treat public deposit exemption provision bank regulation act make applicable. every entity accept deposit person vote right treat deposit accept entity regulate rbi. rbi discretion determine level intensity regulation supervision depend upon risk system entities. financial conglomerate in india, bank entitle carry certain financial activity bank subsidiary model. some bank form subsidiary carry security insurance business. the performance subsidiary affect balance sheet bank. on account vary activity carry entity group fall within regulatory jurisdiction multiple regulators, risk system whole pose financial conglomerate difficult assess. these raise systemic issue rbi regulator bank need empower obtain information, respect entity function umbrella bank. the 2011 bill propose confer power rbi get information respect entities. this ought pursue new legislative framework also. non-operative bank hold company the traditional theory economy scale scope support big entities. in india, need big bank finance large infrastructure need also large industrial projects. thus, advantage grow big handle multiple activities, nobody know exactly tip point is, bigness size start become disadvantage. the crisis highlight downside “too big fail” entities. very big complex entity pose supervisory issue regulator pose serious systemic risks. so need ensure structure complex effective resolution mechanism ensure orderly wind systemically important entities, case crisis. it suggest non-operative bank hold company structure may useful deal financial conglomerate greatly mitigate risk spill entity group. while functional regulator subsidiary non-operative hold company may regulate supervise business subsidiary concerned, non-operative hold company need regulate line bank need place regulatory supervisory control rbi. appropriate legislative measure necessary operationalising model. apart regulatory issue model, challenge addressed. one relate place public sector bank hold companies. another impact taxation transfer share subsidiary hold company. unless adequate tax relief granted, difficult exist bank come hold company structure. stamp duty issue in india, certain issue respect stamp duty documents. one major hurdle face development securitisation market stamp duty structure. it add substantial cost differentiate duty structure different states. while state recognise special nature securitization transaction 6 bi central bankers’ speech reduce stamp duties, state still operate stamp duty high 5% 12% transfer secure receivables. concern stamp duty also raise context propose subsidiarisation foreign banks. the broad objective propose subsidiarisation foreign bank promote financial stability india require harmonisation simplification stamp duty structure across country. minimum capital requirement the minimum capital prescribe bank regulation act bank low reserve bank prescribe minimum capital requirement case private sector bank time time (currently bank minimum networth rs. 300 crores). minimum capital requirement prescribe “ownership governance” guideline prescribed/ prescribe new bank private sector way current provision act. it would, therefore, appropriate empower reserve bank stipulate capital requirement quantitative parameter time time, instead prescribe quantitative limit respective acts. migration ifrs a part effort ensure convergence indian account standard (ias) international financial report standard (ifrs), format financial statement undergo change consequent introduction ifrs. further, whenever bank introduce new type capital instruments, etc. appropriately incorporate format. therefore, reserve bank empower prescribe format balance sheet, profit loss account, etc. give third schedule b. r. act. bilateral net issue various bank request rbi allow bilateral net counterparty credit exposure, respect interest rate foreign exchange derivatives, gold. the legal position regard bilateral net unambiguously clear case bank establish special statute [like sbi act, bank company (acquisition transfer undertakings) act, etc.]. amendment large number enactment particularly synchronise manner may practically difficult. enact single legislation cover aspect banks’ functioning, possibly provide differential legislative framework corporate governance issue account ownership difference may make legislative framework efficient. bank resolution the significance effective resolution mechanism promote financial stability well consumer protection cannot underestimated. the legal framework address resolution mechanism practical point view must least follow characteristics:  early intervention insolvency  speed intervention/resolution  ability transfer merge operation  effective write-down shareholders’ right  protection on-going business bi central bankers’ speech 7 in addition banks, resolution mechanism address resolution systemically important financial institution (sifis) also. post crisis, globally, initiative strengthen resolution framework financial market infrastructure (fmis) entity financial sector. the resolution mechanism also include framework resolution nbfcs entity operate payment systems. swift simple procedure quick resolution, particularly, systemically important entity – global domestic, necessary. under evolve international framework would require jurisdictions, adequate resolution framework per international standards. the key attribute effective resolution regime adopt financial stability board (fsb) plenary endorse g-20 leader cannes summit essential component package policy reduce risk moral hazard potential systemic disruption associate systemically important financial institution (sifis). this require legislative change administrative actions. the power rbi effective resolution regulate entity perspective need enhancement. merger voluntary merger transfer help consolidation financial sector pave way strong financial institution rescue weak ones. such voluntary measures, save constituent weak institutions, provide business opportunity strong one spread presence different geographies. the br act empower rbi sanction scheme voluntary amalgamation bank companies. however, power available respect cooperative banks. consider challenge face quick resolution fail cooperative banks, certain enable provision br act facilitate rbi sanction scheme takeover bank asset liability cooperative bank commercial bank would desirable. partial merger certain business asset liability bank also may need examined. one issue could complicate resolution bank merger transfer due sensitivity process applicability competition law. an enterprise propose enter combination via merger amalgamation require notify competition commission, commission allow 210 day decide default clause kick in. the 2011 bill try address issue. consumer protection globally compatible secrecy law for speedy redressal consumer grievances, rbi frame bank ombudsman scheme statutory direction br act. the scheme work satisfactorily. secrecy customer information principle common law practice india also banks, recognize courts. statutory basis provided, clearly set forth exception relevant present requirement prevent money launder cross border finance undesirable activities. the law strike balance privacy right customer need share crucial information law enforcement agency regulators, domestic foreign. in matter crime proceed crime, large public interest would outweigh private interest individuals. appropriate amendment may carry br act provide statutory back bank secrecy law limit privacy customer lay down. protection require law regulator respect information collect regulate entity include assessment analysis make regulator supervisor correspondence relate information. in large public interest, law enable share information regulators, domestic overseas, mutual benefit. the recent crisis demonstrate need 8 bi central bankers’ speech cooperation. the absence specific protection information hold regulator whether collect regulate entity regulator impede share information. our law globally compatible specific exemption disclosure need provide regard. disclosure sensitive information could compromise effectiveness regulation supervision. further, unless secrecy law jurisdiction compatible global standards, possible receive from, share information with, overseas regulators. appropriate provision may insert rbi act br act regard. iv. conclusion financial sector important segment economy direct bear growth prosperity. strong financial system need strong legal system provide unambiguous fair legislation. the financial system india include banking, insurance, capital, taxation, etc. many regulators, separate mandate. this blend raise pertinent concerns. first, financial system still characterise considerable fragmentation legislation, regulation enforcement. second, policy relate friction might arise diversity different legislation overlap regulatory jurisdictions. third, might risk legal arbitrage among financial jurisdictions. a need continuously felt rewrite streamline financial sector laws, rule regulation bring harmony requirement india’s fast grow financial sector. the current legislation draft contemporaneous set amend time time incorporate change milieu. enact new law amend old law continuous process remain align change circumstances. in emerge scenario, task prevent financial risk become important challenging. amid global economic worries, enormous task which, completion, would immensely benefit financial sector india economy large. a sound legal framework may help deter imprudent risk-taking financial institution reduce systemic risks. revision bank sector law also motivate recognition bank sector remain critical factor accelerate india’s growth also make inclusive. harmonise financial sector legislations, rule regulation has, therefore, become imperative. i try give view regulatory financial stability perspective. i hope benefit today’s discussions. thank you. bi central bankers’ speech 1 zeti akhtar aziz: talent development islamic finance next decade keynote

govern board swiss national bank, end-of-year medium news conference, berne, 15 december 2011. * * * in introductory remark today, i would like look important development area financial stability take place since publication recent financial stability report june year. our late analysis reaffirm need action already identify back then. firstly, view high level risk associate current global economic environment, big bank must – extent possible – push quickly ahead expansion loss-absorbing capital base. secondly, give medium-term risk real estate market, particularly affect domestically focus banks, vital effective macroprudential policy framework developed. international development relevance financial stability the global economic financial condition affect stability swiss financial system worsen second half 2011. a colleague, philipp hildebrand, already mentioned, outlook global growth currently subdued. a major reason sovereign debt crisis build peripheral euro area country last two year threaten spill core country euro area. the european bank sector particularly affected, investor fear loss write-down government bonds. the ensue loss confidence bank system result sharp fall activity interbank market, turn lead high refinance cost liquidity bottlenecks. meanwhile, european bank hold back economic activity restrictive lend practices. weak economic activity hamper effort affect nation restructure budgets. all development cause steep rise credit risk premia financial markets. in response serious situation, euro area country adopt additional measure strengthen fiscal discipline sustainable way restore confidence european bank sector financial markets. the actual implementation measure essential financial market convince long term. on whole, expect international environment probably remain fraught considerable uncertainty time come; risk financial stability remain correspondingly high. situation swiss big bank the deterioration global economic environment leave swiss big bank unscathed. in second half 2011, profitability suffer volatile financial market situation well low customer activity levels. against backdrop give enhance regulatory requirements, ubs credit suisse announce significantly reduce risk exposure next years. in addition this, expand loss-absorbing capital base. the swiss national bank welcome measure see step towards achieve sound capital situation. additional effort necessary, however, loss-absorbing capital big bank still low, give risk profile considerable uncertainty international environment. in order good equip deal 2 bi central bankers’ speech possible worsen current economic conditions, big bank must improve capital situation. they achieve retain earnings. another measure would issue contingent convertible bond contingent capital instrument write-off features, essential element “too big fail” regulations. they also strengthen capital base accelerate announce reduction risk exposure. by make use options, big bank could quickly substantially improve capital situation. situation domestically focus bank allow move situation bank domestic focus. the capitalisation domestically focus bank remain good. profitability – measure ratio gross profit asset – drop slightly, however; least low interest rate margins. at time, domestically focus bank contend two significant risk factors, namely interest rate risk, remain unchanged high level, credit risk, rise further. interest rate risk measure potential loss result mismatch term structure bank’s asset (e.g. mortgages) liability (e.g. customer deposits). while term structure asset get increasingly longer, liability remain short. the rise credit risk due, one hand, deterioration outlook swiss economy. a slowdown economic growth switzerland could negative impact domestic credit quality, result bank would face prospect write-off assets. on hand, continue strong rise mortgage loan real estate price also cause credit risk increase past months. furthermore, result mortgage lend survey suggest high risk appetite part individual banks. in regard, federal department finance (fdf) submit two important measure consultation counter potential imbalance real estate mortgage markets: risk-sensitive capital requirement mortgage lend countercyclical capital buffer. with risk-sensitive capital requirements, incentive mortgage lend structurally improved. the countercyclical buff component basel iii framework represent variable capital requirement activate event excessive credit growth. a soon credit growth weaken again, buff deactivated. it thus permanent instrument boost capital, rather temporary requirement employ exceptional circumstances. the countercyclical buff important element macroprudential toolkit. i would therefore like take brief look progress make area macroprudential policy switzerland snb’s perspective. progress structure macroprudential policy framework at news conference one year ago, snb draw attention absence adequate set instrument area macroprudential policy. this response request parliament’s control committee evaluate mandate set instrument relate financial stability. so key milestone achieve year establish framework macroprudential oversight switzerland, relation instrument division responsibilities? firstly, regard above-mentioned countercyclical buffer, financial stability task force lead fdf take concrete step towards implement important bi central bankers’ speech 3 macroprudential instrument. in addition, propose structure buff provide clear division responsibilities: after consult finma, snb submit request federal council regard activation level buffer. the federal council make final decision. secondly, context implementation “too big fail” regulations, decision-making authority regard systemic importance clearly defined. the propose legislation give snb authority determine bank bank function systemically important. thirdly, snb give improve access information necessary macroprudential analysis. in context, federal council announce would look way snb could gain good access information bank case finma requisite data available. to extent exist legal basis provide adequately this, federal council intend submit proposal parliament near future. the snb welcome progress make area macroprudential policy switzerland. what crucial appropriate measure indeed implemented. this important view fact risk imbalance mortgage real estate market increase past year. moreover, owe focus minimum exchange rate, monetary policy currently unable react potential imbalance mortgage market use traditional instruments. we therefore continue work within relevant committee towards rapid implementation appropriate, streamline macroprudential policy framework. the decision framework ultimately apply switzerland lies, however, policymakers. bi central bankers’ speech 1 jean-pierre danthine: market volatility, swiss national bank liquidity measure foreign exchange reserve introductory remark mr jean-pierre danthine, member govern board swiss national bank, end-of-year medium news conference, berne, 15 december 2011. * * * i would like address three main issue today. these acute market volatility experience summer, impact swiss national bank’s (snb) liquidity measure minimum exchange rate upon money foreign exchange (fx) markets, management fx reserves. acute market volatility the second half 2011 has, now, mark extraordinary degree uncertainty. volatility equity, bond foreign exchange market increase markedly, reflect investors’ concern soften global growth, european sovereign debt crisis, u debt ceiling crisis resilience international bank system. sign acute volatility abound. allow highlight three recent examples. firstly, july early august, vix index, measure volatility s&p 500, abruptly doubled. secondly, msci world index, measure state global equity markets, decrease almost 20% early july late september, rebound october, fall afterwards. a concern bank solvency credit risk increase bank heart crisis benchmark msci world bank index also fell 25% early july late september. thirdly, concern security corporate government bond grew, premia investor pay bond default increase significantly. the perceive decrease creditworthiness key european company western european sovereign bond highlight sharp rise several benchmark credit default swap (cds) index markets.1 the foreign exchange market particular concern snb, swiss franc’s safe property grow dearth alternative “safe” asset lead massive movement currency, require snb act. in early august, real effective exchange rate swiss franc peak estimate level almost 40% post-1990 long-term average.2 the extent deviation rare, historic terms, previous high point, end 1995, 12% long-term average. since introduction euro 1999, volatility eur/chf exchange rate average approximately 5%.3 in august rise almost 30%. a chart 1 shows, three large ever daily negative movement eur/chf exchange rate also occur period. since introduction minimum exchange 1 the markit itraxx europe index, example, compose 125 investment grade entity six sector (auto, consumer, energy, financial, industrial tmt), double july september. likewise, itraxx sovereign western europe index, consist 15 sovereign cd across europe, rise approximately 70% period. 2 this approximation real effective exchange rate, assume constant weight inflation differentials. 3 annualised volatility compute one calendar month basis daily movements. 2 bi central bankers’ speech rate 6 september, eur/chf volatility fall 10%, though remain high historical perspective. the introduction minimum exchange rate also impact dynamic property swiss franc. a red bar leave side chart 2 suggests, previously positive correlation movement swiss franc risk indicator vix index, i.e. investor tend buy swiss franc perceive risk increases. in vein, blue bar leave chart show correlation movement swiss franc risky assets, equity share msci world index, historically negative. in words, negative market development often accompany rise swiss franc. intriguingly, right side chart 2 shows, introduction minimum exchange rate appear significant impact correlations. the snb’s implementation monetary policy: liquidity measure on 3 august, snb start implement liquidity measure massively overvalue swiss franc. let provide information operations. that day, snb announce narrow target range three-month libor 0.00–0.75% 0.00–0.25%. it also state intention expand sight deposit snb. these subsequently increase around chf 30 billion begin august chf 250 billion first week september. the snb use range well-established instrument effect extraordinary increase supply liquidity swiss franc money market, chart 3 shows. firstly, reverse repo operation discontinued. a result, outstanding reverse repos fell chf 26 billion 3 august zero week later. secondly, snb stop renew snb bill fell due, late start repurchase remain outstanding. while amount chf 110 billion end july, figure gradually decrease chf 45 billion end august, reach chf 20 billion end november. thirdly, boost liquidity, 10 august snb also start employ foreign exchange swaps. these amount approximately chf 80 billion end third quarter. fourthly, snb resort conduct repo operations, provide swiss franc money market approximately chf 18 billion liquidity august around chf 33 billion november. these exceptional liquidity measure exert downward pressure interest rates. in line goal state snb’s announcement 3 august, three-month libor fell 17.5 bp 2 august low 0.3 bp 5 september, chart 4 shows. it hover around 5 bp, though worth note limit volume unsecured trade conduct present environment. the significance three-month libor remain unchanged, however, reflect fact money market interest rate currently close zero, swiss franc libor itself. since early august, libor future yield curve also decrease sharply, march 2012 maturity reach –0.5% 18 august. that day, entire curve period september 2013 also lay zero. the three-month rate imply price eur/chf swap reach low –1.5%4. from foreign investor’s standpoint, interest

central bankers’ speech 5 6 bi central bankers’ speech bi central bankers’ speech 1 mario draghi: interview financial time interview mr mario draghi, president european central bank, financial times, conduct messrs lionel barber ralph atkins 14 december 2011 frankfurt, publish 19 december 2011. * * * financial times: we four year financial crisis. what lesson would draw far? what go right go wrong? mario draghi: we distinguish two stages. first financial crisis, repercussion real economy. i think learn lesson need resilient financial system, system would le debt capital. there substantial progress design new regulatory policy progress implement new design. the second stage crisis really combination of, i would say, challenge political phase, euro area leader reshape i call fiscal “compact,” situation bank countries, face serious fund constraints. these challenge fund condition produce credit tighten certainly increase downside risk euro area economy. action proceed two fronts. at last week’s european union summit saw first step towards fiscal rule binding, actually different nature. they would bind ex ante, entirely new quality, write primary legislation member states. the second line action set meaningful, significant decision take ecb last week. we cut main interest rate 25 basis points. we announce two long-term refinance operations, first time last three years. we halve minimum reserve ratio 2 per cent 1 per cent. we broaden collateral eligibility rules. finally, ecb govern council agree ecb would act agent european financial stability facility (efsf). will three-year refinance operation give bank incentive buy “periphery” eurozone bonds? not necessarily. of course bank also capital difficulties, measure don’t necessarily help side. the objective ease fund pressure bank experiencing. they decide best use fund is. one aspiration finance real economy, especially small medium size enterprise (smes). what observe small medium size bank one big fund difficulties, generally one provide finance smes. and smes account 70 per cent employment euro area’s corporate sector. be europe’s version “quantitative easing”? each jurisdiction rules, also vocabulary. we call non-standard measures. they certainly unprecedented. but reliance bank channel fall squarely mandate, gear towards price stability medium term bind prohibition monetary finance [central bank fund governments]. come back bank go money: don’t know exactly. the important thing relax fund pressures. bank decide total independence 2 bi central bankers’ speech want do, depend best risk / return combination businesses. one thing may buy sovereign bonds. but one. and obviously equivalent ecb stepping-up bond buying. do expect, next six months, another round bank recapitalisations and, cases, nationalisation? last week, result european bank authority (eba) “stress tests” exercise. but ideally, sequence ought different: we efsf place first. this would certainly positive impact sovereign bonds, therefore positive impact capital position bank sovereign bond balance sheet. so ideal sequence would recapitalisation bank efsf place tested. in fact, do way round, capital need identify eba exercise reflect stress bond market conditions. that may exert pressure bank achieve good capital ratio simply de-leveraging. de-leveraging mean two things; sell asset and/or reduce lending. in present business cycle conditions, i think second option far worst. i understand regulator recommend bank shouldn’t go way, let’s hope follow advice. couldn’t somebody say eba, look, hold now, completely unhelpful? i think press statement eba somehow hint that, say wouldn’t another exercise next year. to fair eba, shape exercise decide time big economic threat seem bank system’s lack credibility. people fear banks’ balance sheet conceal fragility end would strain economies. so start exercise think that, transparent, marking-to-market sovereign bonds, would strengthen credibility bank system reduce risk premia. at end, work way sequencing. but i wouldn’t say it’s eba’s fault. the big point though is, least world 2011, fundamentally changed, last two years, position equity would see risky government bond reverse…. the big change asset consider absolutely safe view potentially unsafe. we ask do restore confidence. i would say least four answers. the first lie national economic policies, crisis loss confidence start budget get completely control. the second answer restore fiscal discipline euro area, sense last week’s eu summit started, redesign fiscal compact. however, situation premia risk overshot. when high volatility – like lehman – increase counterparty risk. in bad case, accident even don’t accidents, much reduce economic activity people become exceedingly risk averse. so third answer firewall place fully equip operational. and mean provide efsf. bi central bankers’ speech 3 the fourth answer ask: situation. part fiscal discipline, part lack growth. country undergo significant structural reform would revamp growth. and fifth answer idea introduce private sector involvement (psi) eurozone bail-outs was, retrospect, mistake? the ideal sequence would first firewall place, recapitalisation banks, afterwards decide whether need psi. this would allow manage stress sovereign condition orderly way. this done. neither efsf place, bank recapitalised, people start suggest psi. it like let bank fail without proper mechanism manage failure, happen lehman. now, fair again, one address another side this. the lack fiscal discipline certain country perceive country breach trust underlie euro. and psi political answer give view regain trust countries’ citizens. come fiscal pact, answer say excessive concentration budgetary rigour expense competitiveness growth actually create “stagnation austerity union”? the answer right wrong time. they right can’t sustainable economy without growth competitiveness job creation. they wrong think trade-off two. there’s trade-off fiscal austerity, growth competitiveness. i would dispute fiscal consolidation lead contraction short run, ask yourself: mitigate this. improvement budgetary position elicit positive market response, low spread low cost credit. but two condition satisfied: implementation national level structural reform need enhance growth job creation. and finally, necessary right euro area design, implement fiscal compact, confidence fully restored. austerity one single country nothing else enough regain confidence market – see today. consolidation must also go hand hand structural reforms. each country path undertake. for some, situation would sustainable even outside euro devalue currency. that would give temporary respite – high inflation, course. but part answer early 1990s italy – exchange rate adjustment. if take example, remember imf around, efsf gross [government bond] issuance 1992 multiple figure see today. it’s true italy move exchange rate, cut ways. it bring temporary respite economy, export could grow, also widen sovereign bond spread exchange rate risk come top sovereign risk. three four year road italy still something like 600 basis point spread respect german bund. furthermore, effect devaluation would temporary without structural reform (abolition indexation among others) followed. 4 bi central bankers’ speech but austerity programme harsh. don’t think country really effect debtor’s prison? do see alternative? they could leave eurozone? but i say before, wouldn’t help. leave euro area, devalue currency, create big inflation, end road, country would undertake reform due begin with, much weak position. but maybe would best thing rest eurozone? well, would substantial breach exist treaty. and one start never know end really. you say early would far good efsf place. so create firewall – size bazooka talk about? one first observation delay make efsf operational increase resource necessary stabilise markets. why? because anything affect credibility immediate effect markets. a process fast, credible robust need le resources. it sound like you’re bite disappoint outcome last week’s summit then? actually no, confirmation previous figure efsf’s resource – additional €200bn could provide international monetary fund. what also overlook many date first assessment adequacy resource bring forward march 2012 – three months’ time, leader ask whether resource firewall adequate. in meantime, ecb act agent make efsf operational. important also commitment clearly restrict psi imf practices, reassure investors. when think efsf operational? our aim ready provide agency function january next year. but assume idea float october leverage efsf actually go happen? and bring sovereign wealth funds, chinese, overpriced. no, i think premature probably wrong proclaim efsf dead. furthermore i think one show usefulness present size, argument enlargement would much stronger. what say say solution big fire wall ultimately put ecb behind it, thing tame markets? people accept always act accordance mandate within legal foundations. bi central bankers’ speech 5 but look word treaty, nothing set limit many government bond buy…. we act within treaty. in general, must system citizen go back trust government trust fiscal discipline structural reforms. once firewall place efsf, perhaps soon begin next year, might actually stop smp (securities market programme)? we discuss precise scenario smp. a i often said, smp neither eternal infinite. let’s also forget smp initiate view reactivate monetary policy transmission channels. so long see channel seriously impaired, smp justified. arguably, monetary transmission channel impair ever before, look interest rate greece italy compare germany? the cost credit bind differ it’s gear extent short-term policy rate sovereign spreads. would ecb consider put limit yield spreads, would violate treaty view? sovereign spread mostly sovereign nature compact them. it area progress ongoing. monetary policy cannot everything. but economic situation deteriorated, would prepare embark “quantitative easing” style u federal reserve bank england, term large-scale government bond purchase support economic growth? the important thing restore trust people – citizen well investor – continent. we won’t achieve destroy credibility ecb. this really, sense, undertone conversation today. what effect british stay europe’s fiscal compact, view risk city london? the uk certainly show capacity undertake fiscal correction extraordinary size. my general reaction it’s sad. i think uk need europe europe need uk. there’s lot learn sides. the uk take legal action ecb [over location financial market clear houses]… i can’t comment that. what expectation global growth next year? you could significant slowdown several part world. global growth decelerating, uncertainty risen. at time, lay lot groundwork good function economic union future draw confidence that. bi central bankers’ speech 1 lorenzo bini smaghi: the reform international monetary system speech mr lorenzo bini smaghi, member executive board european central bank, conference memory tommaso padoa-schioppa, rome, 16 december 2011. * * * 1. introduction it great pleasure attend conference today honour memory tommaso padoa-schioppa member panel discuss reform international monetary system. that field tommaso bore responsibility ecb i inherit him. i would like focus remark main critique – share robert triffin – international monetary system remain incapable impose acceptable macroeconomic discipline world economy. i also wish examine reservation express international policy cooperation enough ensure stability. i would like organise remark follows. first, i would like explore theoretical underpinnings international policy collaboration, explain practice seem fall short need today’s global world country remain trap short-term policy-making. i review proposal make tommaso correct today’s international monetary system, include provision anchor exchange rate mechanism, consider consequence maintain status quo. in conclusion, i argue good prevent volatility cure it. the deployment ever large official resource cope potential crisis cannot solution – neither conceptually practically. the policy implication three key area preventive action could taken, require structural change major economies: first, financial development emerge market economy (emes); second, financial economic integration europe; third, reform ensure financial market serve real economy support stability. 2. analysis let start global financial crisis. there broad consensus main factor underlie global financial crisis – grow persistent current account imbalances, inadequacy financial regulation supervision, systemic risk cause excessive leverage combine risky financial products, on. a tommaso argued, also lack recognition fundamental flaw present monetary arrangements, rather non-arrangements. be policy-maker, identify flaws, propose essence solution problem. great cooperation economy critical element reform international monetary system. let elaborate point. why would international policy coordination beneficial first place? after all, every country strive meet growth stability objective order produce strong stable economy. isn’t enough? the message crisis, loud clear, “no”. the problem economic policy actions, particularly large countries, create quantitatively significant spillovers, “externalities”, countries. hence, achieve global optimum mean take externality account decision-making process. therefore, coordination regard mechanism encourage country include potential spillover effect policy 2 bi central bankers’ speech considerations, words, “internalise externalities”. only possible achieve pareto optimal outcome1. in practice, even though international coordination vital optimise global welfare, notoriously difficult attain necessary level sensitivity commitment policy-makers. economic theory provide u conceptual framework help explain case. country impose negative externality others create deviation global pareto optimal outcome. but since country lack sufficient incentive pursue global optimum, international community face prisoner’s dilemma systemically relevant country pursue policy produce mutually reinforce negative spillovers. this dilemma however become small participant interact continually. to put context, country repeatedly interact other, cooperation become beneficial pursue self-interest alone, particularly complex situation involve numerous option respond strategic action others2 country fact interact repeatedly, achieve effective international cooperation internalise externality still appear largely elusive. a tommaso said, “the self-sufficiency national monetary sovereignty” 3 “false idol”; country tend pursue policy generate unsustainable growth cum imbalance short run, thereby neglect global spillover negative feedback loop undermine domestic long-run performance stability. i would even go step further. i would suggest economic growth rely unsustainable policy framework might even turn ex post “accounting illusion”. so short-termism policy-making result unsustainable domestic policy framework global economic financial instability? let offer four thoughts: first, primacy electoral cycle. policy-makers tend maximise utility functions, incorporate national objective limit time horizon. in context, difficult enforce policy result international commitment may, short term particularly run-up election, see contradict national objectives. second, policy-makers face asymmetric opposition change. interest group profit current system usually far organise vocal oppose change silent majority, nationally also internationally, could potentially benefit economic reforms. third, move away political economy considerations, difficult ass equilibrium value certain key variables. therefore, fundamental often over- underestimate depend country point time. imbalance are, thus, finance long favourable prices, eventual correction turn sudden sharp. fourth, habit persistence sluggishness adjustment process, large international player sometimes trap give policy framework. for example, despite financial crisis, policy incentive arise us’s exorbitant privilege remain unchanged presence sizeable liquid u financial market strong international role dollar reserve currency. at time, case china, current growth model still deliver acceptable result – even expense 1 amartya k. sen: collective choice social welfare. holden-day et al., san francisco, 1970. 2 mailath, g. & samuelson, l. (2006). repeat game reputations: long-run relationships. new york: oxford university press. 3 padoa-schioppa, tommaso (2010): “the ghost bancor: economic crisis global monetary disorder” 25 february 2010, page 4. bi central bankers’ speech 3 segment society and, such, represent implicit tax them. give accumulation major imbalance china persist disrupt aspect economy – thank financial repression close capital account – current growth model perceive sustainable. the could probably say major economies, like us. sooner later, however, unsustainability domestic policy expect materialise crisis. this particularly case if, witness prior 2008, rise imbalance go unchecked weakness market discipline and, while, negative externality persist without redress owe absence collective high authority rein tommaso refer “robust political economic interests”. crisis impose potentially severe domestic economic financial disruption economy and, best, lead sustainable model growth, albeit high price. at worst, condemn country protract low growth. in cases, global economic performance stability undermine great less degree. 3. response how weakness corrected? be answer find indeed international policy cooperation? i tend share tommaso’s view soft international cooperation alone, though necessary, would sufficient. in words, “coordination fail precisely needed, i.e. policy preference divergent”. my experience confirm even wake global financial crisis – bring home global interdependency porosity national boundary national policy – international cooperation continue base premise pursuit national interest best approximation pareto superior result. it philosophy underlie g20 mutual assessment process, seek achieve strong, sustainable balance growth. another weakness current international monetary system centre gravity – unite state – economic monetary policy shape suit domestic interests. the current system mimic therefore, i say earlier, generalise version triffin dilemma. tommaso recognise identify element solution. first, argue sort “common exchange rate mechanism” would ensure every country agree shoulder responsibility appropriate valuation currency exchange rate determine interaction market economic policy. he anticipate would well support float regime large currencies, small country may thrive intermediate regime consistent geographic pattern economic financial linkages, possibly manage peg regionally dominant currency. he observed, example, strong regional interdependency east asia momentum create regional monetary arrangement comparable europe seek bretton wood system come end. the distinction large small economies, float manage currencies, particularly reveal present time, see large anomaly. we currently face unprecedented situation once-small economy peg currency large economy since grow become world’s second-largest national economy. the result giant economy run fledgling currency internationally, outsource monetary policy international requirement money (as medium exchange, unit account store value) globally dominant currency. this major source imbalance recent years. the way address unsatisfactory effect prospect global economy likely become grave time. 4 bi central bankers’ speech the major economies, recognise domestic impact policy others, yet appropriately factor mutual interdependence utility function policy deliberations. in europe, luxury reflect european interdependency decade calm condition make successive attempt produce stable european monetary order, lead european monetary union. and still, learn lesson well enough hard way. there alternative strict supranational disciplinary element europe and, corollary, global level. a tommaso said, nonsensical country believe reap benefit economic financial integration without policy acknowledge two-way street. the second issue need anchor ensure stability reform international monetary system. more specifically, interplay demand for, supply of, reserve currency limit support global stability. just triffin saw unresolvable tension global stability arise subordination management reserve-issuing currency domestic policy interests, tommaso consider tension keep disorder alive. in view, need quantum supranationality would hold sway global monetary policy stance. and here, think could make supranational currency, special draw right (sdr). tommaso recognise hurdle sdr assume herald role key reserve asset, particular, need critical mass sdrs public private sector circulation. although sdr may potential reduce triffin dilemma, cannot remove it. a basket currencies, would reflect domestic policy interest dominant economy, rather “average” economy currency basket. and respect, would improve global stability extent “average” policy stance good dominant policy. however, mere average policy drive national objective guarantee public good stable monetary anchor global scale. this would require policy framework anchor global standard objective global stability. an alternative view multi-polar currency system. the emergence system would accompany global rebalancing economic power take place. it would market-driven process rather require international agreement, framework mechanism. and conducive global stability, shift multi-currency system ideally occur gradually. like sdr, offer welcome alternative reliance one dominant national currency stability, effect erode exorbitant privilege u dollar increase policy discipline major, internationally-used currencies. but also like sdr, stability multi-currency system would still ultimately rely nationally-oriented policies, though case multi-currency system, market participant would choose directly set national policy prefer. would reduce volatility, would even greater, player switch among currencies, particularly transition phase currency composition reserve re-weighted? of course, shift multi-currency system require privilege incumbency u dollar removed, sovereign debt weakness euro area resolved, renminbi develop full international potential. now suggest reform pose many new questions. let focus two particular. first, political institutional condition necessary form basis great supranationality? we travel along path europe make progress, assist principle subsidiarity. federation may find conceptual headstart, also highly open, integrate economy innate appreciation benefit cooperation. all same, implement shift authority sovereign super-sovereign level require find way overcome perceive democratic deficit. in bi central bankers’ speech 5 respect, tommaso believe cathartic effect crisis – expose flaw system point way forward. the global financial crisis result g20 mutual assessment process. doe go far enough? might become necessary step stone improve framework global stability? this prompt second question: kind world head absence mechanism anchor global stability? the focus likely continue measure deal volatility, increase reserve buffers, restrict capital flow heavily manage currency values. all come cost:  excessive reserves, especially emes, represent tax domestic consumption and, widespread across countries, would produce systematic excess plan save plan investment, lead deflationary bias;  capital control understandable, unfortunate, response exceptional surge inflow outflows, produce externality own, include increase inflow outflow pressure countries;  devalue currency trigger beggar-thy-neighbour retaliatory measure push global economy downward spiral. now failure properly address issue past lead current scramble financial resource shore systemic stability. and amount reassurance demand market increasingly exceed official resource available ever high margin. national foreign exchange reserve stand all-time high; regional finance arrangement – especially europe asia – good endow sophisticate ever before; imf resource treble 2009, soon reflect yet upon adequacy resources. it clear prevention always good cure. therefore, must find good way reduce financial market volatility. policy measure address problem need tailor-made. in emerge markets, financial sector underdeveloped, policy measure need foster financial development. domestic save could easily channel domestic investment, promote domestic income growth consumption, rebalancing economic growth away export reduce incentive maintain low currency value. it would also low need reserve official outflow advance countries, excessive demand u dollar-denominated financial assets. in europe, especially euro area, need deep financial economic integration reduce uncertainty inefficiency current institutional framework, region become core area stability. financial market need reform structure, conduct performance support stability. this call acute risk awareness, responsible risk analysis appropriate risk pricing. it require participant able to, do, bear consequence decision without jeopardise system stability. and achieve thing necessitate interplay market regulator way balance dynamism stability. effort way areas, yet remain much work done. we cannot afford wait cathartic effect (next) crisis improve function international financial system. bi central bankers’ speech 1 philipp hildebrand: global swiss economic outlook – overview 2011/12 introductory remark mr philipp hildebrand, chairman govern board swiss national bank, end-of-year medium news conference, berne, 15 december 2011. * * * the swiss national bank (snb) reaffirm commitment minimum exchange rate chf 1.20 per euro. it continue enforce minimum rate utmost determination. it prepare buy foreign currency unlimited quantities. the target range libor remain 0.0–0.25%, snb continue aim three-month libor close zero. even current rate, swiss franc still high continue weaken time. the snb stand ready take measure time economic outlook risk deflation require. in third quarter, global economy pick slightly, thank positive stimulus japan, u china. growth europe, however, remain weak economic outlook euro area deteriorated. in switzerland, pace growth slow considerably third quarter. the substantial appreciation swiss franc summer weigh heavily swiss economy. for 2011 whole, real gdp growth 1.5–2.0% expected. this favourable economic development first half year. for 2012, snb expect economic growth order 0.5%. the international outlook continue highly uncertain. a escalation european sovereign debt crisis cannot rule out. this would grave consequence international financial system. moreover, give country’s close relation euro area, switzerland’s economic prospect highly dependent crisis develops. compare previous quarter, snb’s conditional inflation forecast adjust downwards. in short term, inflation dip negative territory sooner, owe effect early currency appreciation, strong expected. in long term, worsen growth outlook euro area dampen inflation. the forecast 2011 show inflation rate 0.2%. for 2012, snb expect inflation –0.3% 2013, 0.4%. these forecast base assumption three-month libor 0% depreciate swiss franc. in foreseeable future, risk inflation switzerland. if foreign demand fall sharply expected, downside risk price stability would emerge. global economic outlook follow weak second quarter, global economy pick slightly third quarter, benefit resumption production follow earthquake disaster japan. the decline commodity price third quarter also positive effect. in japan, u china particular, aggregate economic activity strengthen slightly. in euro area, hand, economic growth weak. the outlook global growth nevertheless subdued, has, anything, deteriorate since last monetary policy assessment. the recent u economic data somewhat good expected, escalation european debt crisis cloud economic outlook euro area. bond yield fiscally weak state rise markedly. the grow unease among market participant also reflect increase volatility financial markets. mount borrow cost high level uncertainty contribute mark worsen business climate euro area. 2 bi central bankers’ speech the snb adjust growth assumption euro area next three year substantially downwards. for rest world, hand, forecast remain essentially unchanged. uncertainty future outlook global economy remain extremely high. in particular, european sovereign debt crisis pose grave risk international financial system real economy. swiss economic outlook in switzerland, pace growth slow considerably third quarter. accord preliminary estimates, annualised real gdp increase 0.9%. in particular, substantial appreciation swiss franc summer weigh heavily swiss economy. export fell sharply. at time, domestic final demand stagnated. the economic slowdown accompany slight decrease technical capacity utilisation. in manufacturing, around long-term average. in construction industry, decline slightly, remain high level. narrow profit margin mount concern international outlook hold companies’ demand labour check. the introduction minimum exchange rate correct massive overvaluation swiss franc give company sound basis investment planning. this notwithstanding, situation big part

inflation turn negative, development largely drive strong appreciation swiss franc summer. price large number tradable good fell markedly. follow introduction minimum exchange rate, snb expect temporarily negative inflation rates, sustain decline general price level. moreover, survey also show medium-term inflation expectation still positive. a result substantial expansion liquidity combat strength swiss franc august, short-term interest rate turn negative. they close zero since previous monetary policy assessment. long-term interest rate also decline further. the yield ten-year confederation bond reach new low. the expansionary effect monetary policy also evident growth money supply real interest rates, remain low level. since introduction minimum exchange rate 6 september 2011, swiss franc exchange rate euro chf 1.20. compare august, swiss franc even depreciate u dollar euro. nevertheless, even current exchange rate, swiss franc still high. in august, snb substantially expand swiss franc liquidity, order weaken heavily overvalue swiss franc. since then, banks’ sight deposit snb historically high levels. the snb continue maintain liquidity exceptionally high bi central bankers’ speech 3 levels, decide set specific target level sight deposit present. my colleague jean-pierre danthine discus snb’s liquidity measure effect detail. both domestic mortgage corporate lend real economy continue see robust growth. in third quarter 2011, lend standard condition mortgage remain largely unchanged. by contrast, bank report slight tighten lend standard condition corporate loan – especially loan large companies. low interest rate continue favourable effect demand loans. in addition, robust growth real estate prices, particularly price owner-occupied apartments, continue unabated third quarter. in context, snb welcome recent advance achieve switzerland introduction macroprudential instruments. my colleague thomas jordan report development area financial stability macroprudential policy. chart conditional inflation forecast the (dashed) red curve chart represent new conditional inflation forecast. it show future path inflation, assume three-month libor remain unchanged 0% next twelve quarters, cover period fourth quarter 2011 third quarter 2014. for purpose comparison, (dash-dotted) green curve show conditional inflation forecast publish previous quarter, also base assumption three-month libor 0%. until second quarter 2012, snb’s new conditional inflation forecast previous quarter’s forecast. this early swiss franc appreciation impact price quickly expected. from third quarter 2012, inflation rise previous forecast, point negative base effect price decline since mid-2011 disappears. the mute course inflation end

bank portugal workshop “fostering cooperation es escb”, lisbon, 25 november 2011. * * * member committee monetary, financial balance payment statistics, colleagues, lady gentlemen, i please banco de portugal host workshop “fostering cooperation european statistical system (ess) european system central bank (escb)” – event mean recognise celebrate 20th anniversary committee monetary, financial balance payment statistic (cmfb) – i would like extend warm welcome join u today. it also great pleasure opportunity briefly address joyous occasion. let start say banco de portugal think highly work cmfb undertake last two decade assist commission achieve close cooperation european union (eu) member state field monetary, financial balance payment statistics. i would like praise specially advisory role provide committee context issue raise application excessive deficit procedure (edp). over 20-year period, cmfb act relevant fashion, accompany reinforcement integration europe, especially creation economic monetary union. the committee able develop right condition effective mutually beneficial cooperation between, one hand, national statistical institute eurostat and, hand, national central bank european central bank (ecb), thus foster interchange statistical knowledge among entity contribute bring efficient data collection compilation well access high-quality eu euro area economic financial statistics. ultimately, work cmfb contribute positively build trust official statistics. i remain convince that, help u cop predicament euro area face present juncture, cmfb still unique significant role play. indeed, four year begin large financial crisis since great depression, global financial stability yet secure many policy challenge remain addressed:  global recovery proceed balance pace  large global imbalance persist  widespread public debt sustainability concern emerge  link weak balance sheet government bank sector lead renew tension financial markets, particularly affect euro area. at national level, clear utmost priority must place restore public debt sustainability, increase domestic save enhance potential growth crisis-hit countries. these necessary condition stabilise external debt put 2 bi central bankers’ speech downward path. these objective core recently approve financial assistance programme portugal. at eu level, new economic governance model need deliver fiscal discipline, prevent sustain loss competitiveness promote financial stability. for purpose, october 2010, european council endorse proposal put forward special task force economic governance lead president van rompuy. build recommendation task force, european parliament council adopted, november 2011, six legislative proposal present european commission september 2010. the new economic governance model comprises:  a reform stability growth pact, aim enhance surveillance fiscal policy apply enforcement measure consistently early stage  new provision aim strengthen national fiscal framework  a new surveillance mechanism macroeconomic imbalances. it remain see whether new surveillance framework prove sufficient ensure smooth function euro area. the current turmoil financial market i concisely addressed, together challenge pose globalisation vulnerability economy cross-border financial risks, call need fully timely capture evolve reality mean relevant statistics, produce disseminate regular basis. statistic public good. therefore, compile communicate top-quality statistic require efficient production dissemination processes, line international standard compliance commitment national international organisations. the design, implementation monitor eu policy constantly require statistical support ensure policy address relevant issue expect result achieved. just eu policy evolve, good statistic develop parallel. in regard, necessary strike proper balance reduce respondents’ report burden require data (e.g., raw micro data) compile high-quality statistics. enhance collaboration among statistic compiler also warranted, mainly regard interchange quantitative information knowledge statistical purposes. effective efficient interagency statistical cooperation, especially international level, instrumental quality, relevancy cost-effectiveness macroeconomic statistics. to reach stage, i believe need strengthen statistical governance europe. with mind, i would like draw speech make mr jean-claude trichet, former president ecb, 3rd ecb conference statistics, 2006. in communication, mention “good governance particularly important statistic direct administrative policy use europe, indicator assess convergence eu member state yet belong euro area statistic underlie excessive deficit procedure”. from there, move importance interagency cooperation statistic purpose role play cmfb process, emphasise “while eurostat responsible statistics, benefit, decide upon conceptual issues, considerable statistical expertise available eurostat, ecb, nsis ncbs, bring together cmfb”. another important point raise mr trichet speech regard need safeguard independence statistical function. on topic, say “... compilation government finance statistic – statistic matter – subject political considerations. the compiler statistic must act full bi central bankers’ speech 3 scientific independence, government must ensure sufficient resource make available task”. he also highlight need periodically appraise relevance extant statistics, state “... important regularly review cost/benefit ratio exist statistic agree upon many year ago”. these wise word still relevant today i fully support them. i find particularly interest idea express mr trichet occasion “over time european statistical system develop direction genuine system regional competence centres, coordinate european institutions. the mutual interdependence statistic compiler would increase, turn call strengthen international statistical governance.” that said, i turn subject bring u today, twofold: lisbon workshop relate banco de portugal’s sponsorship book celebrate 20th anniversary cmfb. i start latter. to celebrate 20th anniversary, cmfb think publish book offer recollection main milestone achieve two decades, well reflection number statistical issue committee expect involve future. in recognition good work carry cmfb years, banco de portugal decide support initiative sponsor publication book. the outcome undertake present next speaker little while. a lisbon workshop, principal goal could summarise follow statement: draw past prepare future! this is, opinion, fit commendable proposition. during two session workshop ensue debate participant expect draw lesson learn cmfb’s past mandate find way reinforce collaborative effort central bank statistical offices, view good cop challenge ahead regard official statistic (e.g., early identification likely change true underlie economics event transaction

function. credit market plague informational problems, problem especially acute develop economies. informational problem raise transaction costs, often extent potential borrower deny access credit formal sector. the adverse consequence informational imperfection financial market analyse 1970s joseph stiglitz george akerlof; work receive nobel prize. the etymology word “credit” latin verb “credere”; trust believe. unfortunately trust alone rarely sufficient ensure creditor ever get money back; hence credit decision must make basis accurate, reliable data. without data creditor reluctant risk money. a key challenge policy maker concern financial market development design policy intervention mitigate informational imperfection thus reduce negative externalities. the kernel challenge ensure accurate reliable information wish raise finance acquire cost effective manner provide finance bear risk so. credit reference bureau provide institutional solution problem. a well function credit reference bureau mitigate information relate market failure compulsory participant credit market provide share information, circumstance may private incentive so. furthermore, pool information credit reference bureau reduce social cost acquire information. this motivation bank uganda, support development partner – kfw, gtz world bank – introduce credit reference bureau uganda. our development partner help subsidize credit reference bureau system initial phase operation. although service credit reference bureau provide private enterprises, drive profit motive, subsidy case warrant social benefit well function credit reference service generate, exceed private benefit accrue individual financial institutions. nevertheless, institutional framework credit reference service established, cost provide credit reference service fall hence much le need ongoing subsidy. in three half year since compuscan commence credit reference bureau operation uganda, may 2008, great progress achieved. all supervise financial institution – commercial banks, credit institution deposit take microfinance institution – participating. a total 640,000 financial card issue customer

stipulate regulation issue bank uganda, protect accuracy confidentiality information give credit reference bureau ensure use purpose intended. to remain competitive, credit reference bureau worldwide must stand laurels; must introduce innovative service meet evolve need clients. compuscan currently introduce credit score system intend facilitate quick good decision make participate financial

organizers, cmd indian overseas bank chairman iba offer opportunity share think topical issue engage attention policy maker india abroad recent times. the reserve bank intimately involve effort ensure financial inclusion financial stability india. be part institution, i large intellectual also operational canvas roam around. that fact, encourage avail opportunity discus two important dimension economic issue shape tone tenor financial sector policy space globally last decade so. the one deal juxtaposition, mutual exclusiveness get demystified. let explain, how? the importance financial inclusion base principle equity inclusive growth stability engage renew attention policy maker internationally recent years. it increasingly recognize despite tremendous growth bank sector significant improvement area relate financial viability, profitability competitiveness, glass remain half-full. there remain concern bank able include vast segment population, especially underprivileged section society, fold basic bank financial services. the recent global financial crisis also bring focus financial stability centre stage. the debate quite wide-ranging encompassing, inter alia, definition financial stability implication financial stability growth welfare. many lesson learnt. one, financial stability jeopardize even price macroeconomic stability. two, financial stability shift implicit variable explicit variable economic policy three, threat financial stability anywhere world potentially threat financial stability everywhere. fourth importantly, learn financial instability hurt even advance economies, damage cause poor develop economy particularly severe. people low level income headroom bear downside risks, livelihood disrupt financial instability. it therefore even important country pay particular attention preserve financial stability even deepen broaden financial sector home integrate rest world1. the development recent year ensure pursuit financial inclusion pursuit financial stability long policy option policy compulsions. the key challenge emerge conclusion achieve goal financial inclusion, 1 “financial stability: issue challenges”, d. subbarao, september 2009. 2 bi central bankers’ speech i.e., provide basic financial facility wide segment society ensure stability financial system compromised. an important question emerge whether increase wide access formal financial service work tandem policy aim enhance financial stability work cross purpose jeopardize financial stability, i.e., financial inclusion financial stability two side coin two different disparate goals. these issue i pick enunciate. first, i share think financial inclusion financial stability must co-exist difficult, long term, envisage prevalence one without other. next, i discus various way financial stability financial inclusion complement other, go discus way may conflict work cross purposes. i touch upon suite enable regulatory framework, effective policy consumer protection great financial awareness literacy work together exploit synergy financial inclusion financial stability. finally, i briefly outline manner financial stability consideration weave reserve bank’s initiative towards great financial inclusion. financial inclusion financial stability: mandatory co-existence the first point i would like make i explore relationship financial stability financial inclusion two must co-exist. financial inclusion may difficult without stability financial system difficult envisage continue financial stability increase chunk socio-economic system remain financially excluded. let elucidate. financial inclusion defined, committee financial inclusion, process ensure access financial service timely adequate credit need vulnerable group weak section low income group affordable cost2. it primarily represent access bank account back deposit insurance, access affordable credit payment system. there significant, albeit, slow progress towards great financial inclusion around world recent years. accord estimate adb work paper3, africa, kenya pioneer interest process financial inclusion mobile phone payment solutions. latin american country peru bolivia attempt put place enable regulatory environment microfinance. in two countries, rapid growth past seven year include six million client formal financial system. brazilian policymakers achieve universal coverage 5,500 municipality enable bank use retail agents. this new low-cost delivery channel trigger expansion formal financial service 12 million client six years. latin america also demonstrate potential conditional cash transfer simplify bank account way connect beneficiary formal finance simultaneously low delivery cost government. transfer challenge motivate use agent brazil. in mexico, beneficiary increase save investment 90 per cent household start use bank services. the benefit financial inclusion well understand well documented. financial inclusion, particularly promote wide context economic inclusion, uplift financial condition improve standard life poor disadvantaged. access affordable financial service would lead increase economic 2 a define committee financial inclusion (chairman: c. rangarajan, 2008). 3 adbi work paper series no. 259 – “financial inclusion financial stability: current policy issues” (dec 2010). bi central bankers’ speech 3 activity employment opportunity rural household possible multiplier effect economy. it could enable high disposable income hand rural household lead great save wide deposit base bank financial institutions. it enable government provide social development benefit subsidy directly beneficiary bank accounts, thereby drastically reduce leakage pilferage social welfare schemes. thus, financial inclusion could instrument provide monetary fuel economic growth critical achieve inclusive growth. further, expand reach financial service individual currently access would objective fully consistent people-centric definition inclusive growth attempt bridge various divide economy society, rich poor, rural urban populace, one region another. an analysis world bank development indicator imply strong link financial access (measured term commercial bank branch per 100,000 adult deposit per 1000 adults) economic development. empirical evidence indicate distinct rise income level country high number branch deposit commercial banks. high number bank branch per 100,000 adult number deposit account per 1000 adult observe high income country country low middle income categories. though cause-effect relationship could subject detail research, fact progressive increase income level country financial access increase empirically evident. source: world development indicator 2010, world bank just difficult envisage continue financial stability without financial inclusion, especially long term, difficult envisage success policy effort expand reach financial service unless bank financial service provider sound, financial market function smoothly financial market infrastructure robust. a recent world bank report shows4 nearly 60 percent economy experience contraction real per caput income 2009 result deepen global financial crisis. worldwide volume deposit loan shrank, median decrease 12 percent ratio deposit value gross domestic product (gdp) median decrease 15 percent ratio value loan gdp. i discuss financial inclusion financial stability need co-exist policy measure pursue either objective achieve degree success. let return key question i flag outset – whether financial inclusion financial 4 “financial access: the state financial inclusion crisis”, consultative group assist poor (cgap)/the world bank group , 2010. 4 bi central bankers’ speech stability two side coin mutually reinforce disparate goal would contradict work cross purposes. there are, fact, several way financial inclusion contribute maintain sound stable financial system. financial inclusion financial stability: work tandem first, financial inclusion improve efficiency process intermediation save investment facilitate change composition financial system regard transaction take place, client use various services, new risk created, possibly institution operate newly create expand markets. a balance sheet financial sector grow diversify encompass broad spectrum economic agents, contribution resilient economy commensurately higher. second, financial institutions, especially banks, financial inclusion help provide stable retail base deposits. a recent global crisis also demonstrated, stable retail source fund reliance borrow fund greatly enhance soundness resilience financial institution reduce volatility earnings. low income saver borrower tend maintain steady financial behaviour business cycle term deposit keep borrowing. thus, period systemic crises, deposit low income client typically act continue source fund even source credit dry become difficult roll over. small customers, thus, provide big opportunity garner stable deposits. in absence deposits, financial institution may find difficult continue lending. this credit channel potential aggravate impact crisis local economy would otherwise case. third, financial inclusion facilitate great participation different segment economy formal financial system. the presence large informal sector impair transmission monetary policy significant segment financially exclude household small business make financial decision independent of, un-influenced by, monetary policy action central bank. a share formal financial sector increase great financial inclusion, yield important positive externality make monetary policy transmission effective. fourth, extent financial inclusion help people move cash economy bank account monitored, help facilitate implementation anti-money launder combat finance terrorism (aml/cft) guideline make possible deploy suspicious transactions’ monitor report large share financial transaction economy. recent financial action task force (fatf) guidance on5 “anti-money launder terrorist finance measure financial inclusion” conclude financial exclusion undermine effectiveness aml/cft regime recommend country’s level financial inclusion initiative expand financial inclusion considered, effectiveness aml/cft regime assessed. fifth, financial inclusion contribute enhance financial stability contribute improve health household sector, small business and, extent, corporate sector. the health household sector improve improve economic linkages, reduce reliance costly informal sector improve ability make receive payments. the benefit cannot overstate give household sector implication lack access bank service severe. 5 fatf guidance “anti-money launder terrorist finance measure financial inclusion”, june 2011. bi central bankers’ speech 5 lack access affect ability household receive government transfers, make payment accumulate cash surplus plan expense emergencies. individual option carry cash expose security risks. such access also reduce cost make payments. social benefit include protection loss due theft, improve mechanism social transfer remittance (including tax benefit remittances) improve economic linkage rural deprive communities6.the lack access availability vehicle save could also result households, especially low income households, resort expensive short-term debt. there many anecdotal instance high interest rate lead household catch debt trap country impact financial stability increase leverage household succinctly demonstrate recent crisis microfinance sector. financial inclusion improve access finance quality cost service small business receive banks. these factor key profitability prosperity business economy. research reveal increase formal save help reduce cost credit facilitate business expansion, example, increase availability low cost deposits. this collateral benefit improve resilience small businesses, even large businesses. sixth, cases, effort include increasingly large section population within fold formal bank financial service result deployment innovative solution outsource arrangements. such financial innovation potential reduce cost thereby contribute increase overall efficiency economy financial stability. they may also, fast information dissemination efficient function financial markets, contribute improve efficiency transmission monetary policy. of course, financial innovation outsource arrangement come set risk could pose challenge overall policy framework pursuit financial stability. but i discus little later. finally, financial inclusion, careful policy orientation, may help facilitate reduction income inequality and, bridge gap prosperous poor, foster social political stability. financial inclusion financial stability: work cross purpose this say risk financial stability emanate great financial inclusion. one recall save loan crisis u 1980s appreciate even financial institution gear cater retail investor and, thereby, foster financial inclusion, could source financial instability. the recent crisis u subprime market another case point. policy maker often endorse market subprime borrower mean financial inclusion7. with hindsight, seem clear over-extension credit potential affect quality credit portfolio bank financial institution could sow seed financial fragility, ultimately financial instability. the position may aggravate regulatory governmental forbearance potential vitiate credit culture amongst target group. a elucidate prof. raghuram rajan8, “easy credit” response bridge gap have have-nevers could prove 6 “financial access financial stability” – paper write p. hawkins, feasibility limit south africa bi (2010). 7 collard, s. kempson, e. (2005), affordable credit: the way forward, york: joseph rowntree foundation. 8 rajan g., raghuram (2010), fault line : how hide fracture still threaten the world economy. 6 bi central bankers’ speech costly way redistribution create fault line along financial sector enormous stress could build lead instability system akin subprime crisis recent times. our experience local entities, as, cooperative banks, deposit take non-banking financial company regional rural bank – largely gear meet need poor un-banked – highlight risk poor governance, connect lending, geographic concentration lead vulnerability natural calamity downturns. the recent experience microfinance industry another example initiative foster financial inclusion result financial stress institution promote inclusion. hence, risk financial institution cater le develop low-income market need well understood. first, market typically involve large number low ticket clients/transactions commensurate burden operate costs. second, segment typically associate informational inefficiency borrower unable produce collateral provide adequate track record repayments. third, financial institution venture segment first time often need incur substantial cost adjust business practice process fresh rule game. fourth, financial service use launder illegally obtain fund well fund terrorist activities. this could accentuate expansion finance access much regulatory forbearance way relax kyc norm give even large volume/high frequency transactions. while, discuss above, great financial inclusion facilitate monitor large share suspicious transactions, emergence payment services, particular person person remittance facilities, cater need increase large base retail client may also provide opportunity illegal activities. conversely, challenge pose aml-cft requirement goal achieve financial inclusion and, hence, fatf guidance state need “take account nexus financial integrity financial inclusion cross-reinforcement two objectives”. fifth, outsource activity banks, include financial inclusion, also pose reputational, financial fidelity risk may impact health institution financial system9. in particular, reputation risk associate outsource may impact activity entire bank outsource activity case mishap misdemeanour outsource agents. there also systemic risk associate entire bank industry rely single vendors, frequently case, especially early stage innovations/outsourcing. these risk need carefully manage banks, particular, system check balance could, inter alia, involve well define contractual arrangements, standard due diligence, exposure monitoring, cash limits, rat agents/business correspondent (bcs), periodic audit/inspection, etc. use information, communication technology (ict), manage operational financial risks. further, design appropriate compensation structures, include performance base features, ensure reasonable fee agent ensure adequate incentive prevent misuse system agents. sixth, risk would also arise business model specialise non-bank institution {e.g. micro finance institution (mfis)} cater exclusively need low income group. these institution face concentration fund risk contribute overall systemic risk amply demonstrate recent experience andhra pradesh. the great involvement commercial bank provision service low 9 the report internal group examine issue relate rural credit microfinance (chairman: shri. h. r. khan), reserve bank india, july 2005 (khan committee). bi central bankers’ speech 7 income group institution cater low income segment go long way towards mitigate risks. finally, i discuss earlier, pursuit financial inclusion often attempt low cost delivery channels, innovative product outsource agencies. these development come set risk could jeopardize financial stability. for example, time stress, financial innovation complicate transmission monetary policy. in case, period financial instability, may difficult predict consequence financial innovation thereby add additional element uncertainty already uncertain economic environment. facilitate financial inclusion financial stability: financial regulation literacy & consumer protection let quickly sum discussion far. it clear potential cost financial inclusion. there also important benefit play cycle boom bust period financial crises. the end result deeper, diversify resilient financial system well healthy corporate household sector enhance financial stability. there risk financial institution financial inclusion. there is, however, enough evidence risk hugely systemic nature. on contrary, saver borrower low segment evidence maintain consistent financial behaviour financial crisis compare customer segments. to extent, add resilience financial institutions. in case, risk prevalent institutional level manageable know regulatory & prudential tools, great financial awareness literacy effective customer protection practices. a highlight outset, achieve great financial inclusion maintain financial stability complementary policy compulsions. the challenge ensure exploit synergy two policy objectives. the answer arguably lie facilitative regulatory supervisory structure ensure formal financial system deliver affordable financial service exclude population great efficiency without compromise acceptable level safety soundness. in connection, important role play credit information bureau provide database capture outstanding loan individual borrower prevention multiple-lending borrowing10. also important regulatory environment facilitate promotion new line business idiosyncratic risk profile whose contribution systemic risk relatively low. an effective consumer protection policy framework also critical component regulatory

range cross country experience testify effort underway achievement balance financial inclusion financial stability facilitate regulatory framework, especially relative consumer protection reputational

financial inclusion key inclusive growth motto empowerment poor, underprivileged low income/skilled rural/urban households. amartya sen18 convincingly argue poverty merely insufficient income rather absence wide range capabilities, include security ability participate economic political systems. financial inclusion design bring capability participate contribute among economically socially exclude people create equal opportunities. achieve sustainable financial inclusion require systemic effort leverage technology, viable business model appropriate regulatory framework cohesively. while research need good understand transmission channel potential feedback loop financial stability financial access identify policy solution aim balance objective sustainable manner, evident financial inclusion financial stability need coexist. the indian experience prove financial inclusion work within framework financial stability give enable regulatory environment. also provide testimony experience host countries, i briefly describe earlier. a combination viable business strategy target towards population bottom pyramid, low transaction cost technological innovation appropriate regulatory environment help foster great financial inclusion stability. the twin objective financial stability financial inclusion arguably two side coin imperative robust risk-mitigating framework

difficulty italian economy struggle decade. between 1995 2007, per caput gdp grow average 1 per cent year, compare nearly 2 per cent euro area. the recession hit almost advance economy 2008–09 strike profoundly italy elsewhere. even little growth, low interest rate make possible adoption single currency measure aim public finance adjustment make cost service large public debt bearable. in recent months, however, heighten tension financial market make balance precarious, fuel operators’ doubt sustainability italy’s sovereign debt. the measure adopt start summer improve public finance sufficient achieve lasting, structural rebalancing country need order return growth. italy’s failure thrive good part due hesitancy economy respond past twenty year challenge technological innovation, emergence new economy world arena, powerful increase european integration. entry monetary union away ephemeral gain derive devaluation impose great fiscal discipline italy order qualify membership. boost growth potential require wide-ranging measures, include reform institution responsible economic governance, stimulate business activity encourage sustainable work inclusion, especially woman youth. the main measure need long perfectly well know include: heighten competition, particularly protect service sectors; wide access risk capital, especially innovative firms; regulation labour market social welfare system which, act together, help reallocate human resource towards productive uses; efficient civil justice system. there is, however, one point least important, namely measure increase stock human capital. 2 bi central bankers’ speech human capital new technology economist always pay heed role education knowledge increase productive capacity individuals. more recently, come use term “human capital” indicate people’s endowment skills, technical ability know-how. the term thus recognize economic value endowment improve quality work, increase efficiency production process facilitate adoption development new technique products, benefit individual system whole. this pool skill knowledge evolve time response change technological paradigm. start 1990s, rapid spread new information communication technology constant advancement radically change nature skill demand productive economy. new technology enable automation routine activity require simple application standard skill codify sequence (however long) instructions. the new technology tend reduce demand labour activities, favour managerial intellectual roles, and, less extent, non-repetitive manual job well. where trend pronounced, le benefit intermediate education levels, mainly associate possession standard skill set. no long human capital acquire school apply standard fashion throughout one’s entire work life. what educator call “competence” become crucial: namely, ability mobilize internal resource (knowledge know-how) external resource integrate way cope often unprecedented non-routine situations. “competence” interact innovation enable rapid adaptation change; together specialize knowledge, allow innovation emerge everyday, effectively combine available resource know concepts. these input necessary fundamental change gear mature economies, need shift away model growth base essentially emulation progressive advance towards technological frontier one centre ability generate innovation independently, thus advance frontier itself. it increasingly necessary cultivate 21st-century skills, namely critical think aptitude problem-solving. traditional area knowledge (including

receptiveness towards innovation, well creativity, intellectual curiosity, ability communicate effectively, openness collaboration teamwork, decisive. italy’s laggard performance italy lag behind main develop countries, high school university education skill level young people adult population. italy’s low stock human capital international standard longstanding issue. at time national unification 1861, adult population average le one year education four five france, germany, unite kingdom, unite states. a giovanni vecchi recall recent book in ricchezza e povertà, begin last century two british historians, bolton king thomas okey, observe volume entitle italy today: “education gloomy chapter italian social history, chapter painful advance, national indifference primary need, present backwardness, give italy (next portugal) sad primacy illiteracy western europe”. since then, considerable progress education levels, enough bridge gap. in 2009, accord late oecd figures, 54 per cent italian age bi central bankers’ speech 3 25 64 year earn senior high school diploma, compare oecd average 73 per cent. the gap narrow still substantial young age groups: 25–34 age bracket, proportion italian senior high school graduate rise 70 per cent, oecd average 81 per cent. the proportion child complete junior high school study also rising, gain 10 point recent year 80 per cent. for university education, however, gap certainly worrying. here, italy seem hard put keep advance countries: 2009, proportion graduate 25–64 age group le 15 per cent, half oecd average; amongst people age 25 34 years, exceed 20 per cent, compare oecd average around 37 per cent. over past twenty years, direct test read comprehension, logical mathematical skills, ability combine piece information solve problem vary complexity, reveal similarly worry picture. at end primary school italian student least skilled develop countries, late stage formal education fall behind. for 15-year-olds, gap find pisa survey carry oecd 2006 correspond around one school year; although diminish 2006 2009, remain significant. the gap reflect severe disparity different part italy, score north slightly oecd average south dramatically lower. these disparity subject various interpretation involve geographical distribution discrepancy different school rather within individual school. yet fact remain country like ours, poor material resource lag various fronts, invest “knowledge”, “below” “around” average country natural resources. such deficit also observe respect skill adult population. the international adult literacy lifeskills survey (all) conduct 2003 gauge functional literacy numeracy together analytical problem-solving ability show 80 per cent italian age 16 65 unable apply linear reason draw inference average complexity extract combine information provide write text little basic. they are, say, functionally illiterate: lack adequate read comprehension, logical analytical skill respond demand modern life work. this high percentage advance country surveyed. for purpose comparison, correspond figure switzerland unite state 50 per cent, canada 40 per cent, norway 30 per cent. these deficit represent milestone, country like longstanding shortfall growth. this education policy seek close gap advance country must rather aim radical reversal situation. collective decision individual choice in order accomplish this, need reflection tool society us increase stock human capital determinant individuals’ educational choices. we must analyze place human capital developed, namely school universities, reason individual choice sometimes seem unwarranted light economic return education. learn research evaluation mechanisms, great decision-making autonomy, link public fund indicator quality teach research university recognize internationally important effectiveness educational system. the successive reform italy recent year seem step direction, effort improve efficient organization undermine inadequacy public private resource devote accumulation human capital. and situation risk get bad current economic climate. in middle last decade, point 4 bi central bankers’ speech time international comparison possible, investment knowledge – approximate total public private expenditure high education, research development, software – amount 2.4 per cent gdp italy, oppose oecd average 4.9 per cent. the capacity educational system absorb generate new idea probably also constrain slow generational turnover, dramatically reduce number young people teach positions. accord oecd estimate 2009, 9 per cent teacher italian senior high school 40 year old, compare 25 per cent germany, 34 per cent france, 40 per cent unite kingdom unite states. in year, accord eurostat database, 16 per cent university teacher italy 40, 30 per cent france, 39 per cent unite kingdom 47 per cent germany. yet despite shortcomings, metric available indicate education remain worthwhile investment italy. people education le difficulty find employment, le discontinuous work career earn high salaries. accord oecd, 2009 average earn gap adult population people compulsory school high school graduate close average develop countries, whilst latter university graduates, although small major countries, close 50 per cent (compared 63 per cent france, 67 per cent germany, 78 per cent unite kingdom almost 90 per cent unite states). the additional return senior high school diploma degree scientific discipline is, italy, three four time great derive degree humanities. yet, end last decade, 20 per cent young people age 18 24 junior high school certificate go qualification, half young people age 20–24 senior high school diploma enrol university, go university, nearly half fail complete degree. so reason apparent discrepancy return education people’s educational choices? firstly, economic benefit high education properly perceived. accord result survey european commission year, scarcely half young italian see high education advantageous. this low proportion amongst eu countries. approximately two-thirds italian respondent recognize university train improve job opportunities, third – le country survey – expect gain term high remuneration. this lack awareness exacerbate consequence obstacle (often economic nature) investment education. the strong correlation family background educational choice reduce social mobility. individual suffer result, society whole, fail cultivate use talent emerge le privilege backgrounds. learn integration difficulty even great child foreign nationals. by end primary school, around third them, compare 2 per cent italian children, already fall behind normal education cycle, disadvantage amplify late years, show small proportion promote junior high school great likelihood drop end compulsory school (twice high among italians). in absence effective integration mechanisms, country’s stock human capital thus risk penalize rapid increase relative proportion young people foreign backgrounds, istat project exceed 30 per cent 2050. furthermore, italian economy’s ability reward make human resource remain poor. wage differential educational attainment small country much small young old workers. entry-level wage bi central bankers’ speech 5 level, real terms, decade ago, people enter workforce today appear preclude income growth register meantime. this probably due hesitancy – compound financial economic crisis – italian industry adapt trend change world radically. it possible generally inadequate standard education provide school system – least perceive firm – factor low salary offer (and accordingly low investment human capital). in term labour market, increase flexibility certainly facilitate absorption high level unemployment register mid-1990s. but sustain employment young people, increase flexibility – together protract wage moderation – may lead firms, especially le efficient ones, put investment r&d advance technologies. indirect evidence fact that, teeth conventional economic theory, italy’s shortage human capital require new technological environment link comparatively low extra return university graduate enter labour market. so far i concentrate university education, key component human capital stock modern economy, furnish specialize skill readily codify form basis advancement knowledge and, hence, technological frontier. good graduate produce good universities, but, all, good university need good student capable learn think critically creatively solve problems. such student cultivate low level education system, many recent study concur investment knowledge direct towards early year education effective, learn deficit stage difficult make subsequent years. human capital social capital invest knowledge, especially early year schooling, important many reasons, positive effect productivity individuals. the benefit education go beyond private financial gain. for instance, better-educated people average enjoy good health, due also increase awareness value prevention cost associate risk behaviors. accord eurostat, 25 year age residual life expectancy male italian senior high school university graduate 58 years, compare 53 compulsory school (for women, 62 59 respectively); 65 year age, gap life expectancy reduce eliminated, still amount two year men one year women. the benefit good education extend many aspect life. of special significance particular gather positive influence curb lawlessness. whilst statistical breakdown italy, data sweden unite state show high average level school bring substantial reduction crime rate person property. among things, result significant cost save community. this outcome product various mechanisms. in strictly financial term – thing equal – education reduce incentive crime decrease gain compare achievable legal means. furthermore, cultural impact stem enhance opportunity socialization people go school compare dropouts. conversely, increase lawlessness community area may reduce incentive school attendance young people lure prospect even small immediate gain drive strong copycat effect. it surprise, then, social milieu geographical area low level school crime rife. nor accident circle area small stock “social capital”, factor increasingly recognize important also economic development. 6 bi central bankers’ speech a community educate socially aware individuals, likely condemn deviation legality recognize benefit cooperation, fact also incline subscribe value norm facilitate achievement share goal “social capital” frequently identified. for country particularly meaningful concept, whose broad modern acceptance derive robert putnam’s celebrate study italy’s regional administrations. it study turn spotlight poor endowment social capital region southern italy compare centre north. in market economy, social capital play central role low transaction cost facilitate commerce economic agents. this benefit degree financial development, average size innovation propensity firms, design institutions, and, ultimately, rate economic growth. in context education, trust others willingness cooperate limited, vertical relationship characterize subordination, cronyism exploitation likely prevail. it condition lawlessness take hold crime – include organize crime – spread easily. the social economic cost enormous. some italian work use econometrics gauge extent north-south development gap ascribe organize crime. compare per caput gdp southern region (where crime take hold relatively recent years) several region centre north (which statistically comparable baseline characteristic organize crime become similarly entrenched), estimate cumulative economic growth former thirty year 1977 2007 15 percentage point less. the correspond impact development region mark long-established presence mafia-style organize crime assume great still. whilst estimate treat great caution, give indication relevance crime inhibit development southern region entire country. how one go augment community’s social capital? civic sense, trust, willingness cooperate value take time ingrain themselves, display considerable persistence time. putnam even trace current regional discrepancy italy back different political regime prevail late middle ages. other scholars, however, maintain endowment social capital increase – albeit slowly – work factor directly influence policy choices. the role school education central. there strong correlation, instance, literacy level different region italy end 19th century degree trust others observe today. education level thing matters, though. international data also suggest importance teach methods: active participation teamwork student favour traditional hierarchical relationship teachers, one find trust others institution well cooperative attitudes. where horizontal teach method predominate, one may find great willingness delegate decision-making within firm le conflict organization labor. some conclude consideration like country europe around world, italy go difficult stage. but economic problem partly consequence severe global recession. rather, origin go far back root structural characteristics; today’s financial trouble reflect budgetary policy past years. there illusion macroeconomic intervention capable remedy shortcomings, much due limit scope action belief resolve structural weakness italian economy gain new lease life. our economy must make inclusive increase labour market participation, especially young bi central bankers’ speech 7 people women, eliminate needle obstacle economic activity barrier connect family background. this mean continual call removal constraints, vest interests, restriction competition economic activity. the lack competition curb output employment many sectors, impinge competitiveness innovative capacity entire economy, hind regeneration manufacture base still fragmented, prevent talent emerging. the institutional system must favour business dynamism, growth, stability certainty regulatory framework, overcome infrastructure deficit, particularly high-tech sectors. the north-south labour market divide overcome comprehensive regulatory welfare reform; decentralize flexible collective bargain arrangement could enable remuneration organization labour good tailor actual production conditions. particular attention pay southern regions, structural weakness acute. human capital investment knowledge represent one key economic policy variables. the economic return individual community unquestionable. they important direct impact productivity also indirect effects, emerge interaction individuals, growth public spirit, respect law belief triumph justice, fight corruption crime – two major factor curb sustain continuous economic growth. it clear, however, despite great advance since national unification yet make good italy’s historical lag. there press need strong commitment, public private sector, invest knowledge now, order break vicious circle small stock human capital

path would help restore market confidence. assume europe ultimately succeed manage situation, strong union emerge view robust resilient. this would welcome development u.s. if, contrast, europe fully successful chart effective course, could number negative implication u.s. in particular, three possibility i would like highlight subcommittee today. first, european situation deteriorate, euro area would face even serious fiscal economic challenges. a result, growth within euro zone would 2 bi central bankers’ speech weaken would lead le demand u.s. good service export europe company worker here. this would hurt growth unite state would negative impact u.s. jobs. it important recognize euro area world’s second large economy u.s. important trade partner us. also, europe significant investor u.s. economy, vice versa. thus, happen europe significant implication economy. second, european situation deteriorate, could put pressure u.s. bank system. the good news u.s. bank much robust resilient year ago. u.s. bank bolster capital significantly, build loan loss reserve significantly large liquidity buffers. also, direct exposure u.s. bank country europe face intense fiscal challenge actually quite modest. the bad news exposure u.s. bank climb quite sharply one also consider exposure core european country overall european bank system. this mean crisis broaden intensify, could put

recently, federal open market committee decide re-launch tool, cooperate five central banks. our intention create credible backstop – supplant – private markets. bank surplus dollar likely lend bank

recognition this, reserve bank step effort recent year enhance penetration formal financial sector promote financial inclusion view improve well-being society. in regards, reserve bank undertake special initiative extend outreach bank facility state union territories. against backdrop, i propose briefly outline economic financial structure ut ani well highlight various financial inclusion initiative take reserve bank. in conclusion, i shall flag issue need policy attention. background andaman & nicobar islands, union territory india since 1956, archipelago 572 island (306 island 266 rocks) geographic area 8,249 square kilometre. of islands, 38 human habitation. the ut bestow abundant green vegetation marine wealth besides huge potential culture fisheries. it cover indian subcontinent’s rich rain-forest house indigenous tribe negroid mongoloid origins. the diversify mangrove include world wildlife fund (wwf) global 200 list world’s high priority biodiversity “hot spots”. furthermore, island include unesco-designated biosphere reserve/zone (indo-malayan bio-geographic zone). accord forest survey india (2005), 87 per cent total geographical area ani forest cover 50,000 hectare available cultivation ally activity distribute among various islands. at present, major crop grow paddy, coconut, arecanut, vegetable fruits. ani aggregate coastline 1,912 kilometres, one-fourth total coastline india. the exclusive economic zone (eez) around island encompass around 0.6 million square kilometre 30 per cent eez india. this provide great opportunity development fishery marine resources. 2 bi central bankers’ speech social indicator a per census 2011, total population ani register decennial growth 6.7 per cent total population 3.80 lakh. ani consist three districts, viz., south andaman district, north middle andaman district nicobar district. over 88 per cent population ut life first two district 37 per cent live urban areas. nicobar district urban area. while sex ratio north middle andaman south andaman district increase 925 874, respectively, 2011 884 824 2001, sex ratio nicobar district decrease 778 2011 857 2001. the population density ani increase 43 per square kilometre 2001 46 per square kilometre 2011. the literacy rate island high 86.3 per cent 2011 compare 74.0 per cent all-india level (table 1). table 1 andaman nicobar islands: select socio-economic indicator macroeconomic structure the ut ani significant potential growth give natural resource endowment. however, comparative isolation island mainland, scatter islands, difficult communication system, heavy reliance government supply input small base local market major constraint achieve rapid growth. in line national economy, last decade, economy ani undergo significant structural transformation. the dominance primary sector decline share tertiary sector increased. the reduction share primary sector could partly attributable reduction cut forest timber per decision supreme court. further, reduction agricultural produce due submerge land wake tsunami. the increase share service sector attributable enhance construction activity due rehabilitation measure increase government expenditure post-tsunami period. the share industrial sector, however, remain le stagnant. a per available information central statistical office (cso), 2009–10 per caput income (nsdp) ani 62 per cent high all-india per caput income. however, 2009–10, growth nsdp ani decelerate 2.7 per cent mainly due sharp decline growth industrial agriculture sectors. notwithstanding deceleration growth, average annual growth rate improve second half 2000s almost 10 per cent 6 per cent first half. the average growth bi central bankers’ speech 3 nsdp ani generally remain high all-india ndp period 2005–10 (chart 1). table 2 sectoral net domestic product (at 2004–05 prices) (in per cent) 4 bi central bankers’ speech the increase average growth nsdp ani 2005–10 mainly drive industrial service sector. the industrial sector make sharp recovery low growth rate 1.5 per cent first half 2000s 12.4 per cent second half decade. however, observe growth rate sector remain highly volatile entire decade. the agriculture sector witness turnaround negative growth 2000–05 growth rate 3.7 per cent 2005–10 (table 2). driver growth keep overall trend country, economic activity ut dominate tertiary sector share continuously rising. the share primary sector decline share secondary sector nsdp static around 3 per cent. there hardly manufacture activity ut mostly concentrate wood processing, present restriction exploitation forest lead activity stagnate. within tertiary sector, construction activities, transport, storage communication public administration major driver growth. agriculture the average rainfall island high spread eight month april–november year produce humid tropical climate. the agro-climatic condition island suitable cultivation plantation crop like coconut, arecanut, fruit like banana, mango, pineapple, guava, jackfruit spice like clove, nutmeg pepper. the soil low water retention capacity. out total report geographical area 8,24,900 hectare 2009–10, total crop area island stand 16,535 hectare (table 3). table 3 land utilisation pattern 2009–10 among major crops, production paddy increased, yield go down. the production coconut, cover maximum area production, remain stagnant. performance plantation crop mixed. accord agriculture census 2005–06, number operational hold well area increase primarily hold size-class le 1 hectare less bi central bankers’ speech 5 extent hold size 1 2 hectares. mainly institutional land fall 10 plus hold class. the average size operational hold also decrease 2 hectare 2000–01 1.88 hectare 2005–06 indicate increase fragmentation land hold ut (table 4). table 4 number, area size operational hold ani industry the absence sizeable local market manufacture good need bring much raw material mainland consider main impediment development industries. therefore, large medium scale industrial activity absent ani. the industrial base ani consist mainly small tiny industries. the industry region mainly timber agro-based. the recent year see decline industrial output owe closure wood-based industrial units. there 1,961 register small-scale industrial (ssi) unit union territory end-march 2010 (table 5). 6 bi central bankers’ speech table 5 industrial scenario andaman nicobar island tourism the andaman & nicobar island unique combination sprawl beaches, rise hinterland dense equatorial forests. more 50 per cent forest area tribal reserves, national park wildlife sanctuaries. any development activity island include tourism sensitive ecological fragility. the key challenge face growth tourism ani connectivity commensurate infrastructure ensure good accessibility. in context, considerable scope public-private partnership sustainable development tourism region. in recent years, private sector increase role provide transport services, theatres, restaurant shops. the number unit well employment provide private sector increase time. this trend need reinforced. infrastructure give geographical topographical peculiarity islands, include separation sea great distances, single power-grid electrify island several diesel generator set cater independently power requirement area/island. at present, ani face significant power shortage. due steady rise population demand inter-island ferry good movement people become important. lack adequate transport facility serious bottleneck economic development islands. further open air traffic could give boost trade tourism. fiscal scenario a andaman nicobar island union territory (ut) without legislature, allocation receipt expenditure make union budget. the ut’s primary source revenue emanate non-tax receipts, constitute 80 per cent revenue receipts. non-tax revenue steadily increase recent years. on average, total bi central bankers’ speech 7 revenue receipt gsdp ratio around 4.7 per cent 2007–12. the tax gsdp ratio ani le 1 per cent far all-india average 5 per cent states. revenue expenditure gsdp ratio increase mainly account sixth pay commission award. however, capital outlay gsdp ratio decline (table 6). table 6 receipt expenditure financial development it important well-functioning financial system sustainable economic development. while reserve bank actively engage development financial sector, step effort recent year enhance penetration formal financial sector promote financial inclusion view improve well-being society. let first broadly outline financial fabric ani. there gradual improvement bank penetration ani recent years. this evident fact average population per bank branch improve to11,000 end-june 2010 13,000 end-june 2002. the bank network largely dominate public sector banks. 8 bi central bankers’ speech the recent trend growth rate deposit ani low correspond growth rate record all-india level. the credit deposit (c-d) ratio ani 37.6 per cent end-december 2010 significantly low ratio 76.7 per cent all-india level (chart 2 table 7). table 7 c-d ratio population group a end-march 2010, almost 58.3 per cent total priority sector advance absorb small enterprises. agriculture account 8.3 per cent total priority sector advance period. the occupational credit structure dominate personal loans, follow advance trade industry (chart 3). chart 3 occupational credit financial inclusion in context financial inclusion initiative take reserve bank, bank sensitise pursue inclusive drive. it may observe progress bank term branch expansion stagnant period 2007 2010 though improvement term deposit credit expansion. due recent initiative bi central bankers’ speech 9 take reserve bank, number branch increase 37 2010 42 2011 (chart 4). source: bsr, rbi. further, pursuance overall financial inclusion strategy, total 47 village population 1,000 identify three district ani. of these, 17 village identify south andaman, 21 north middle andaman 9 nicobar. a total 37,370 no-frill account open end-june 2011 ani. a end-march 2010, total number kisan credit card (kcc) issue ani 7,000 amount loan sanction scheme 158 crore. a end-june 2011 total 9.5 crore disburse 1260 shgs. financial inclusion measure financial inclusion important bring poor under-privileged section society within bank fold thereby generate sustain equitable growth. let turn various measure initiate reserve bank promote financial inclusion. first, reserve bank long institute mechanism call “priority sector lending” credit channelise certain prefer sectors, which, inter alia, include small-scale industry, small business agriculture. in post-reform period, priority sector group expand include advance retail trade, educational loans, micro-finance low-cost housing. this help further cause financial inclusion. second, union finance minister announce budget 2010–11 every village country 2000 population must access bank service march 2012. in order operationalise process, commercial bank prepare financial inclusion plan submit reserve bank. a brick-and-mortar branch viable small centres, approach meet challenge business correspondent (bc) model leverage communication technology. under model, 10 bi central bankers’ speech bank appoint agent provide basic bank service door-step client behalf bank. third, reserve bank ask bank open no-frills accounts. these account low minimum balance requirement provision small loan way overdrafts. this convenient account small depositors, especially rural areas. fourth, major impediment common person open bank account “know your customer” (kyc) norm. the norm relax small accounts, viz., deposit 50,000 credit 1 lakh. a simple introduction exist account-holder bank adequate open account. in regard, aadhar, unique identification number (uid) project central government, aim provide unique id number everyone country, help poor establish identity meet banks’ kyc norms. fifth, farmer get credit bank conveniently kisan credit card (kccs) general purpose credit card (gccs). sixth, financial literacy become critically important. while several bank facility available, common person may aware them. hence, reserve bank initiate “project financial literacy” objective disseminate information regard central bank general bank concept various target groups. our “financial education” website link offer basic banking, finance central bank child ages. our website also available 13 languages. finally, also learn process reserve bank. we recognise responsible banking, must sensitive need common person. accordingly, governor, dr. subbarao initiate outreach programme part platinum jubilee celebrations. under outreach programme, top management reserve bank visit least one village every state union territory state government official commercial bank give focus attention financial inclusion. this highly enrich experience u understand grind realities. accordingly, decide continue programmes. policy challenge first, developmental activity pursue far propel direct involvement government area economic activities. however, need broad-based economic strategy great involvement private sector. second, limit size local market major constraint growth. the ut focus outward-looking policy export mainland area natural advantage marine products, horticulture floriculture. third, island exclusive economic zone (eez) 30 per cent country’s eez endow unique marine habitat coral diversity. however, resource adequately tapped. there need develop fishery export mainland. this boost income ut also significantly reduce transport cost currently ship ferry good island return empty mainland. fourth, need renew thrust agriculture. horticulture, floriculture, plantation crops, medicinal plant dye plant offer lot opportunity potential investors. fifth, give high level literacy strategic location strong potential development information technology. sixth, tourism potential island promote high-value low-volume eco-tourism. this need great investment tourism infrastructure. bi central bankers’ speech 11 seventh, great nicobar island locate centrally singapore/colombo north sea traffic route south east asia beyond. this extremely busy route substantial part world’s commercial traffic flow area. development south eastern tip nicobar trans-shipment port container handling, bunker refuel international/national ship pass route great economic strategic potential. eighth, step-up economic activity, investment demand enhanced. the bank need proactive support private investment enterprise. this help improve current low level c-d ratio great penetration banking. conclusion the comparative isolation andaman nicobar island mainland, scatter landscape, difficult communication system, heavy reliance government department supply input small base local market main impediment rapid growth economy. however, ut ani immense potential achieve high growth aid mainly extensive marine resources, high literacy rate, conducive work environment strategic location. in achieve goal, government effort need supplement private initiative bank sector important role play. this help improve well-being mass islands. bi central bankers’ speech 1 anand sinha: financial report context financial stability – regulator’s view account issue address mr anand sinha, deputy governor reserve bank india, event organize muscat chapter institute charter accountant india (icai), muscat, sultanate oman, 21 december 2011. * * * input provide p r ravi mohan amarvir saran da gratefully acknowledged. 1. dr. ashraf nabhan al nabhani, dean, college bank financial studies, mr. kishore rabi, chairman, icai muscat chapter delegates. it give great pleasure address august gather organise muscat chapter institute charter accountant india (icai). i give understand muscat chapter, 19th overseas chapter icai amongst active chapter icai engage capacity build omani accountant impart professional education sultanate. a key initiative tie college bank financial study (cbfs) assist account curriculum. this chapter’s engagement college bank financial study one many way bank community regulator benefit technical knowledge base account community. 2. the history indian account profession trace back enactment company act 1857 introduce first time concept prepare balance sheet voluntary basis companies. we come long way since icai, establish 1949 act parliament, today world’s second large professional account body american institute certify public accountant (aicpa), 180,000 members. over six decade existence, play vital role nation build services. 3. in line motto “ya aeshu suptaeshu jagruti” (a person awake amongst sleep) emblem garuda, “vahana” lord vishnu, institute play key role keep watchful eye financial statements, ensure represent true fair view state affairs. 4. a regulator supervisor india’s bank system, reserve bank india (rbi) place significant amount reliance input provide u profession statutory audit long form audit report bank well annual interaction statutory auditor commercial banks. we also periodic interaction senior member institute various forum take keen interest late development field. 5. rbi closely work institute account issue bank sector. in october 2001, rbi set work group chairmanship shri n d gupta president institute identify gap compliance account standard issue icai also recommend step eliminate gaps. base recommendation committee, landmark guideline compliance account standard issue bank march 2003 ensure strict compliance account standard avoid qualification financial statements. 6. rbi form committee 2000 study observance international standard code india various individual area overall financial system. with respect indian account audit standards, find several gap compare international standard recommendation make reduce gap. i happy note icai since issue many account standards, substantially reduce gap. 2 bi central bankers’ speech 7. while subject rbi’s insistence adherence international best practice ongoing benchmarking standards, i would like draw attention report observance standard code (rosc), joint initiative imf world bank 2004 among others, review strength weakness corporate account audit practice india. some major recommendation bridge gap international financial report standard (ifrss) indian account standards, strengthen monitor enforcement mechanism, introduce practice ensure compliance code ethic auditor public interest entity take step improve professional education train arrangements. 8. india also participate financial sector self assessment programme (fsap), joint initiative international monetary fund world bank attempt ass stability resilience financial system member countries. base india’s experience fsap subsequent self-assessments, government india, consultation reserve bank, constitute committee financial sector assessment (cfsa) undertake comprehensive self assessment india’s financial sector, report submit 2009. 9. the cfsa make assessment indian account audit standard come key recommendation prove critical institute. the report, inter-alia, suggest convergence ifrs early create awareness among auditor others involve process ensure system procedure place comply ifrss. another important recommendation india contribute significantly agenda set iasb technical output. the challenge institute take right earnest identify person requisite competence participate global forums, benefit flow profession large. account issue context financial crisis 10. the global financial crisis consequence thereof expose weakness account audit aspects. during course presentation i would like place issue relate financial report context financial stability. 11. there widespread criticism certain account practice either contribute least, exacerbate severity crisis, view failure deal illiquid market distress sales. the g20 work group “enhancing sound regulation strengthen transparency”, i occasion work actively, recommend account standard setter strengthen account recognition loan loss provision consider alternative approach recognize measure loan loss incorporate broad range available credit information. account standard setter prudential supervisor advise work together identify solution consistent complementary objective promote stability financial sector provide transparency economic result financial reports. 12. g20 report also recommend iasb enhance effort facilitate global convergence towards single set high-quality account standard also opine account standard setter accelerate effort reduce complexity account standard financial instrument enhance presentation standards. these recommendation together recognition within account audit profession certain drawback current standard necessitate large scale revision various standard especially relate financial instrument fair value accounting. during global financial crisis, international account standard board (iasb) u financial account standard board (fasb) establish financial crisis advisory group comprise senior leader broad international experience bi central bankers’ speech 3 address account issue emerge global crisis. the key issue identify fcag involved:  difficulty apply fair value (“mark to-market”) account illiquid markets;  delay recognition loss associate loans, structure credit products, financial instrument banks, insurance company financial institutions;  issue surround broad range off-balance sheet finance structures, especially us;  extraordinary complexity account standard financial instruments, include multiple approach recognize asset impairment. some weakness also highlight area ifrs u generally accept account principle (us gaap) diverged. 13. while aspect identify account professionals, regulator express concern systemic risk arise procyclicality account standards. procyclicality policy make refer financial development policy add momentum economic cycle amplify effect economic fluctuations. the procyclicality embody capital regulation account standard among identify cause underlie global financial crisis. the in-built procyclicality amplify business cycles, affect degree credit expansion benign condition degree credit contraction downturn. 14. the requirement use fair value account asset liability illiquid market serious disadvantage point view regulators, systemic financial risk. a mark-to-market approach i.e. fair value account contribute excessive leverage boom period lead excessive write-down busts. under account irrational exuberance asset price fee high publish profit perhaps bonuses, encourage irrational exuberance self-reinforcing fashion: market turn down, equally drive irrational despair. if market participant attempt simultaneously liquidate positions, market previously reasonably liquid also become illiquid, realisable value may, banks, significantly low publish account suggested. 15. volatility financial statement also concern regulator. fair value account introduce volatility financial statement follow channels:  volatility account change underlie economic parameters. for instance interest rate increase, fair value bond reduce vice versa.  volatility produce due measurement error and/ change view regard economic prospect business cycle. fair value measure generally represent present value stream expect cash flows. very often determination expect cash flow involve statistical technique may amount estimation error well errors.  volatility arise account use mix measurement model i.e. one us fair value category asset liability amortise cost others thereby reduce net effect full fair valuation asset liability would produce. 16. another area receive focus delay recognition impair assets. account standard today rely “incurred loss” model recognise loss event non-payment due 90 day trigger provisioning. consequently, overstatement interest income early life loan. when series default downturn trigger provision requirements, stock provision available absorb credit losses. these loss directly impact income 4 bi central bankers’ speech statement bank constrain bank lending, thus exacerbate procyclicality. this cycle-neutral approach provision fail account excessive deterioration loan portfolio associate excessive credit growth. there broad international agreement need provision base instead “expected loss” basis life time loss recognise early, i.e. provision increase good time possibility environment may deteriorate future. however, implementation model difficulty regard estimation expect loss international account standard board (iasb) u federal account standard board (fasb) still engage deliberation modality implement model. 17. the iasb issue exposure draft expect loss model attempt mitigate shortcoming recognize loss make provision thereof early life loan. however, presently, iasb fasb’s deliberation revolve around three bucket approach capture pattern deterioration credit quality. under model, loan classify three category depend upon possibility expect losses. loans, event direct relation possible future defaults, place first bucket. the second third bucket use loan affect event relationship possible future default drop house price i.e. trigger event default possibility loan/ portfolio loan sensitive occurred. in second bucket, expect credit loss identifiable individual loan whereas third bucket expect credit loss individually identifiable. the provision requirement also differ accord bucket. whereas entity expect provide expect life time loss second third bucket propose approach first bucket make provision 12 month expect loss though yet agree upon. since direct relationship possible future defaults, lifetime expect loss require recognise loan place first bucket. further, criterion guideline transfer category still discussion stage. 18. let dwell upon proactive measure initiate rbi mitigate effect procylicality indian context. recognise procylicality cause provision norms, rbi try build buff provision requirements.  firstly, bank require maintain provision asset classify standard show sign impairment. sector specific provision require bank provide standard asset certain sensitive sector also prescribed.  secondly, bank require classify account npa inherent weakness observe account even credit record balance sheet date avoid npa classification. bank also require put place appropriate internal system eliminate tendency delay postpone identification npas, especially respect high value accounts.  thirdly, 2009, observe trend profit make banks, provision coverage ratio (pcr) requirement bank introduce address apprehension asset quality due exuberant lend boom phase. bank require build pcr 70% gross npa september 2010. pcr intend interim measure hop would replace forward-looking counter-cyclical provision methodology develop basel committee bank supervision (bcbs) iasb. since take time, rbi work methodology similar spanish dynamic provision framework interim measure. 19. a regard pcr, decide freeze pcr reference gross npa position bank september 30, 2010, since absence calibrate methodology would difficult allow bank use countercyclical provision build bi central bankers’ speech 5 pcr freely certain design issue too,. the buff (surplus provision specific provisions) allow use bank make specific provision npa period system wide downturn, prior approval rbi. 20. the financial crisis also lead heavy criticism account rule permit certain structured/ special purpose entity exposure remain off-balance sheet. a key concern instrument vehicle tendency veil risk off-balance sheet robust account framework provide recognition disclosure risk prerequisite introduction. the iasb try rectify situation introduce ifrs 10 consolidate financial statement fasb also work towards toughen off-balance sheet account rules. 21. in india, rbi always follow cautious gradualist approach towards complex exotic financial product take step reduce contain regulatory arbitrage bank shadow bank sector (mainly non bank financial company i.e. nbfcs) considerably upgrade prudential rule nbfcs. 22. overall account financial instrument become highly complex rule base period lead crisis iasb’s project replace ia 39 ifrs 9 welcome initiative. however, delay finalise proposal relate impairment hedge account couple recent proposal reopen classification measurement financial asset cause concern. iasb’s classification requirement asset revolve around business model approach whereas fasb’s approach base characteristic instrument. further, fasb’s approach may also entail item balance sheet carry fair value. implementation ifrs india 23. the convergence ifrs india work-in-progress i would like dwell upon implementation issue challenge particular reference indian bank system. 24. a part g20’s effort evolve single set global high quality standards, ministry corporate affair (mca), government india release roadmap provide gradual convergence ifrs phase manner commence april 1, 2011. in term road map, commercial bank india require converge ifrs effect account period begin april 1, 2013. while mca place website thirty five ifrs converge indian account standard (ind as) 2011, state standard implement various issue include taxation resolved. 25. in order address implementation issue facilitate formulation operational guideline facilitate ifrs convergence indian bank system rbi form work group. specific issue relate (i) classification measurement financial assets, (ii) classification measurement financial liability hedge accounting, (iii) amortise cost impairment, (iv)fair value measurement, (v) presentation, disclosure balance sheet format (vi) derecognition, consolidation residuary issue deal work group. 26. with respect financial sector india, special issue challenge view large scale revision standard pertain financial instrument (ias 39) central importance bank system. iasb indicate period 2009 2011 keep stable platform facilitate convergence many country period. however, global financial turmoil consequence thereof account scenario necessitate large scale revision various standard especially relate financial instrument fair value accounting. 27. a india attempt transition ifrs, big challenge bank sector equal concern u regulators, lack clarity uncertainty regard 6 bi central bankers’ speech finalisation ifrs 9: financial instrument (scheduled replace ia 39) convergence u gaap. one intention behind schedule bank late convergence avoid first apply ia 39 immediately transition thereafter replacement viz. ifrs 9. country like canada recently converge ifrs find easy account pre-existing standard fairly well align ia 39, case india. with delay uncertainty finalisation ifrs 9, convergence process become almost equal chase fast move target. 28. the finalisation impairment provision ifrs 9 early date critical issue need address iasb fasb. our apprehension current proposal contain exposure draft three bucket model provision difficult implement operationalise. further, country like india, may enough data available apply highly quantitative statistical technique implement robust expect loss model recognise impairment losses. therefore, work group suggest comment letter iasb, need practical expedient allow simple rule base model specify regulator least initial years. we hope iasb consider finalise requirement impairment. 29. in country like india, financial market still develop deep liquid develop country specific concern regard implementation fair value account absence quote price illiquid market several instruments. consequently, implementation fair value account would necessitate dependence valuation technique use unobservable input would also bring fair share estimation errors. 30. there also major technical issue arise indian bank course convergence. difference ifrs current regulatory guideline classification measurement financial assets, focus standard business model follow bank challenge management area, lack adequate number skilled staff modification it system process challenge may need tackle due course. 31. apart preparers financial statements, bank also significant user financial statement base lend investment decision financial statement customers. this aspect make skill build important indian bank ifrs implementation impact account finance team pervade credit investment analyst decision makers. the rbi proactive facilitate skill build conduct seminar train programme well provide faculty support institutions. i glad learn icai incorporate ifrs curriculum student introduce certificate course ifrs members. there also scope rbi, bank system icai work together build skill area. 32. let conclude state several area common interest regulators, banker accountant frequent interaction interface group would mutual benefit all. i thank opportunity share regulator’s perspective current account issues. reference 1. report financial crisis advisory group(2009) 2. report committee financial sector assessment (2009) 3. fair value financial statement volatility, ms. mary e barth (2004) bi central bankers’ speech 1 ignazio visco: conference memory tommaso padoa-schioppa introductory remark mr ignazio visco, governor bank italy, bank italy conference honour tommaso padoa-schioppa, rome, 16 december 2011. * * * i grateful today conference memory tommaso padoa-schioppa. i glad able bring together many colleague friend year fortune appreciate intellectual human qualities. and i especially glad gather bank italy, institution spend good part professional life environment first build international reputation. an institution that, like others work in, help forge always remain deeply attached. for many u tommaso colleague; also friend mentor. you could always count advice, ability anticipate find concrete solution problems. conversation always enlightening; benefit idea challenged, sharpen reasoning, learned, example, deliver results. in year since untimely death i often miss wisdom acumen, lucid vision road ahead, i often find try guess advice would time face many difficult challenge italy, native country, europe, ideal devote much life. tommaso devote country always conscious great potential. but innate optimism blind serious weakness trouble lay ahead. he consider italy country suffer grave illness: twenty-five year healthy growth second world war follow two decade growth achieve “toxic stimuli”: “a combination inflation currency devaluation, deficit-financed public expenditure, accumulation debt impoverishment capital”.1 the result country heavily indebted under-capitalized, grow slowly, social inequality bind increase. with writings, speech actions, minister economy seek instil sense urgency often hostile political environment: vital act immediately simultaneously stability, growth social equity. a sense urgency, i must say, much vindicate recent events. the underlie problem, view, italy lose ambition excel. a put vividly, “italy like cyclist capable extraordinary sprint catch group, incapable take lead break away. it seem anguish lag behind nightmare exclude enable u summon energy best.”2 well, point imperative demonstrate determination react emergency; also time take, tommaso use say, longer-term view problem italian economy tackle structural impediment sustain growth. with regard europe too, last year tommaso saw fear materialize, alarm bitterness. although rightly consider one architect euro, sense start single currency unfinished project. he among first warn danger “currency without state”. he deeply dissatisfy 1 t. padoa-schioppa (2007), “intervento del ministro dell’economia e delle finanze all’assemblea dell’associazione bancaria italiana”. 2 corriere della sera, 16 may 2005. 2 bi central bankers’ speech political inertia follow introduction single currency. he clearly perceive risk pose inadequate governance macroeconomic field, financial regulation supervision, union “failed satisfy, even function attribute it, cardinal principle western constitutionalism (balance powers; democratic vote; majority principle)”.3 he plead unflaggingly close political union. tommaso academic economist. he special gift use insight theoretical economics challenge receive idea establish practices. at time, challenge academic economist go beyond simplistic behavioural assumption take role institution fully account. institution design indeed constitute leitmotif thinking, whether connection central banking, market infrastructures, european integration global monetary arrangements. he always stress need clearly identify nature scope public good need provide order design suitable set rule institutional framework case case. at time, dynamic view issue institutions: look underlie economic trend could one predict new demand would drive evolution institution future. thus, example, fundamental insight – early career economist and, let add, political scientist – grow economic financial integration interdependence, europe global level, would inevitably require profound rethink allocate policy-making responsibility concept national sovereignty. he certainly underestimate difficulty process resistance would meet. like jean monnet, tommaso fond quote word swiss philosopher henri-frédéric amiel: “experience start every individual. only institution become wiser, accumulate collective experience.” we add institution lucky enough public servant clear-minded far-sighted tommaso padoa-schioppa really chance become wiser. to conclude, tommaso’s example constant source inspiration, model kind describe one favourite quote machiavelli: “a wise man ought always follow path beat great men, imitate supreme, ability equal theirs, least savour it. let act like clever archer who, design hit mark yet appear far distant, know limit strength bow attains, take aim much high mark, reach strength arrow great height, able aid high aim hit mark wish reach.” [machiavelli, the prince, translate w. k. marriott (1908), chapter 6] we decide commemorate tommaso take idea start point discus burn economic issue today’s real world, approach, i believe, would appreciated. we prepare four background notes, one session conference, summarize think legacy four theme centre work: monetary policy payment systems, financial system regulation supervision, process european integration, reform international monetary system. i think note give ample testimony depth vitality contribution. 3 corriere della sera, 3 may 1998. bi central bankers’ speech 3 before panel discussions, however, pleasure address italy’s prime minister, professor mario monti, i thank warmly confirm acceptance invitation spite many press engagements. bi central bankers’ speech 1 christian noyer: “the brussels agreement sound” – interview le télégramme interview mr christian noyer, governor bank

well slump credit. what legitimacy rat agencies? agency become totally incomprehensible irrational. they make threats, even though member state take strong positive decisions. rat agency behave nothing happened. it may seem agency long useful guide investors. would say judgment base political criteria? indeed, argument develop, political argument economic ones. credit agency downgrade rat three large french banks. be bank undercapitalised? no, well capitalised, particular compare european u counterparts. the importance downgrade overstate especially since rat agency recently downgrade

prolong austerity? france must extremely rigorous management public finances. a balance budget must rapidly restored, presuppose particular structural reduction government spending. like many countries, live mean many years. we need stop accumulate debt. growth return confidence does. and reinstate confidence, must guarantee public finance consolidated. bi central bankers’ speech 1 yaseen anwar: role financial institution capital market pakistan’s economy speech mr yaseen anwar, governor state bank pakistan, paf air war college, karachi, 21 december 2011. * * * the commandant paf air war college, member faculty future leader arm force i delight invite paf air war college one premier institution arm force pakistan, share view role financial institution capital market pakistan economy. the importance financial institution (fis) cannot overemphasized. fis perform vital function intermediation provider investable fund (depositors, security holder etc) user fund (namely businesses). no economy progress unless financial sector facilitate business activity consistently, case develop country like pakistan, fis act necessary catalyst economic growth well. the state bank pakistan, central bank develop country, play two critical role respect financial sector. firstly ensure soundness bank dfis prudential oversight view maintain financial stability; secondly pursue developmental objective facilitate financial market development enhancement access finance. over year much accomplished, yet lot yet achieved. the bank system, constitute 88 percent share total financial sector, comprise 34 commercial bank 4 specialize banks. the share non-bank financial institution approximately 12 percent, include lease companies, mudarabas, insurance companies, investment banks, house finance companies, venture capital companies, mutual funds. the bank sector economy generally significant player perform three primary function include facilitation payment system, mobilization savings, allocation loanable funds. by virtue pivotal role, bank sector exert positive influence various segment economy. during course speech, i would give historical perspective development financial sector pakistan, follow discussion challenge opportunity present scenario. finally, i would like share priority relate bank sector future come. historical perspective the current structure financial sector pakistan result several policy shift developments. the era financial sector development pakistan broadly segregate 1947–70, 1971–90 1991 date period. prior 1971, primary focus develop commercial bank private sector create development finance institution back government. the private sector development, however, almost clog period 1971–1990, owe nationalization policy government. during period, bank sector come government’s control. since 1990s, liberal market-based reform followed. 2 bi central bankers’ speech period 1947 1970 at time independence 1947 bank service adversely affect june 30, 1948, number branch schedule bank come 81 territory comprise pakistan. however, commercial bank make tremendous progress achieve phenomenal growth since independence december 31, 1973 i.e., nationalization, 14 schedule pakistani commercial bank 3,323 branch pakistan 74 branch foreign countries. development finance institution (dfis) play significant role early industrial development pakistan sixty mid eighties. these dfis major channel rout development fund private manufacture sector achieve socio-economic objective encouragement new entrepreneurs, set industry le develop area wide diffusion industrial ownership. however 1980s 1990s many dfis run problem stem basically poor management, excessive bad loans, withdrawal incentive resource constraints, considerable loss point financial ruin. they also unable compete increasingly nimble bank sector 1990s able capture substantial investment bank business. period 1971 1990 a may aware, 14 pakistani commercial bank nationalize merge 5 bank january 01, 1974, financial landscape country change significantly. one rationale give nationalization fact private bank likely neglect small borrower priority areas, think nationalization, government could direct credit desire sectors. consequently, various step taken, include commencement subsidize credit schemes, introduction complex system credit ceilings, imposition control interest rates. the experiment nationalization, however fail give desire results, political interference lend decision also appointment board chief executive mar operation banks. the efficiency bank affect severely, end 1980s, bank sector pakistan become unsuitable adequately meet grow financial need country. period 1991 date realize inherent weakness pakistan’s financial system, broad base program reform frame financial sector early 1990s. the reform agenda included, among others, financial liberalization deregulation measure were: privatization ncbs, removal restriction opening‐up private banks, phase subsidize mandatory credit schemes, removal cap deposit lend rate banks, abolishment system credit ceiling, switch towards market base approach credit distribution, etc. these measure implement time gradual improvement continue today. the state bank pakistan play pioneer role reforms, champion development financial sector. a brief summary major step take reform follows: for privatization nationalize commercial banks, government inject rs. 30.7 billion offset loss incur bank recapitalized them. professional banker appoint chief executive person private sector enjoy reputation competence integrity nominate board director ultimately bank privatized. besides privatization, fresh license also issue private sector sponsor set new commercial banks. these new bank provide necessary competitive stimulus bi central bankers’ speech 3 system, contribute enhancement bank service pakistan. resultantly overall share private sector own commercial bank bank sector asset increase almost negligible 1991 80 percent june 2004. the legal regulatory framework strengthen significantly, state bank power bank company ordinance enhance order make effective regulator. here i would like emphasis strengthen framework dynamic process, recently april 2011, amendment bco carry reinforce sbp’s role regulator bank sector. the prudential regulation various guideline issue sbp provide essential impetus prudent operation bank dfis. under regulatory framework, corporate governance, risk management standard improve significantly across industry. these regulation also aim enhance quality oversight board director banks, mainly (a) ensure reputable competent person sit board (b) require member fulfill responsibility towards policy make respective banks. foreign direct investment bank sector make viable; since liberalization, large number reputable foreign shareholder invest locally incorporate pakistani banks. at time several foreign bank opt operate pakistan branch mode well. one recent positive development entry large chinese bank icbc pakistan start operation early year. since capital bank provide buff unexpected losses, essential bank adequate capital survive up down business cycle bear exogenous shock successfully. the capitalization bank enhance steadily years. the minimum pay capital (net losses) set rs.1 billion 2003, increase rs2.0 billion 2005, rs6.0 billion 2009, rs.10 billion achieve 2013. in addition minimum capital requirement (mcr), sbp also adopt internationally accept solvency standard basel i 1997; revise standard basel ii enforce since 2008. under regime, bank maintain capital adequacy ratio 10%. the ratio calculate keep view risk profile bank’s assets, ultimate objective ensure bank carry high risk asset require hold capital. over year monitor bank dfis also improved. the on-site inspection off-site surveillance increase level supervision sbp. electronic information gather make oversight timely consequently effective. the sbp also undertake massive capacity build late 1990s early 2000s upgrade level expertise officers. merit-based recruitment, competency-enhancing training, performance-linked promotion, induction skilled human resource regular feature sbp’s corporate strategy. the imf world bank bank sector assessment 2004 state quote: “far reach reform result efficient competitive financial system. in particular, pre-dominantly state-owned bank system transform one predominantly control private sector. the legislative framework state bank pakistan’s supervisory capacity improve substantially. a result, financial sector sound exhibit increase resilience shocks”. unquote. present day scenario before i discus present day challenge opportunities, let first identify key performance figure current bank sector. total asset bank amount rs7.7 trillion end june 2011. the deposit stand rs6.0 trillion, advance 4 bi central bankers’ speech investment sector rs3.8 trillion rs2.6 trillion respectively. in spite economic slowdown, pretax profit bank sector year 2010 rs105 billion first six month 2011 rs77 billion. the bank stand healthy capital adequacy ratio (car) 14 percent show steady increase capital even absolute terms, equity bank rs722 billion (june 2011). while picture appear quite stable, key challenge come word i use “economic slowdown”. we witness impact economic slowdown rise credit risk banks. the gross non-performing loan low 2007 (7.6%) 15.3% june 2011. thank conservative provision regime, net npls still reasonable level 5.5%, aware unless economic turnaround achieve within reasonable time, impact high credit risk cause serious problems, least banks. since fy07, bank pakistan able withstand headwind weaken macroeconomic fundamentals. while remain largely insulate first round shock global financial crisis, cannot ignore adverse trend rise since then. the global financial crisis (gfc) continue despite recovery effort advance economy morph financial crisis sovereign credit crisis serious political implications. the crisis bring forth realization organization too-big-to-fail also too-interconnected-to-fail major source systemic risk. it reinforce fact complete reliance mathematical model-based risk management system insufficient assess wide array risk face financial sector, need qualitative analysis judgment. most importantly, show protract duration severely impair basic function financial sector i.e. efficient allocation resource process financial intermediation. the regulatory focus pakistan strive prevent mitigate occurrence factor financial sector continue evolve progress. the silver line gfc fact emerge market gain focus. the contribution bric emerge economy world economic growth rise. the relatively le sophistication financial market bless disguise, face brunt gfc growth continue even fast pace. it unfortunate pakistan unable take advantage shift growth paradigm. we face several domestic issue limit ability fully attain potential. our financial institution business must become competitive innovative, regulator like sbp secp must actively facilitate financial markets, government step function provide infrastructure growth, crucially meet energy demand productive sectors. a true cases, challenge provide opportunity well. a bank regulator, big challenge arise two-pronged dilemma. we want bank sound, profitable efficient user funds, yet also want increase financial service penetration unbanked segment economy. interestingly challenge big stimulus technological innovation. there huge surge among bank upgrade technology on-line bank services. the atm network expand june 2011 approximately 5200 atm operate throughout country. progress create automate on-line branch bank significant far expect almost bank branch on-line automated. utility bill payment remittance would handle atms, kiosk personal computer reduce time cost. the country’s payment system infrastructure strengthen provide convenience transfer payment customers. the concept branchless bank open new avenue efficient channel funds. it potential change life people still unbanked bi central bankers’ speech 5 without financial service open new vista entrepreneur household areas; particularly increase ease mobile phone usages, prefer channel choice customer transfer funds. keep view importance, state bank take lead introduce branchless bank regulation 2008. these first kind regulatory initiative since jurisdiction replicate development branchless banking. since 2008, branchless bank expand steadily increase participation strong well new players. at present, agent network umbrella branchless bank exceed 20,000 facilitate around 53 million transaction amount rs196 billion (sep-11). notwithstanding progress, overall financial penetration pakistan remain quite low. the number borrower 3.8 million constitute 2.3% population december 2010. recognize overwhelm size intensity financial exclusion pakistan, sbp pursue second generation reform financial service industry place high priority develop implement effective strategy financial inclusion. enable regulatory environment provide lend sme, agricultural microfinance; thus bank financial institution encourage enable expand scope lend customer outreach. license prudential norm micro finance institution design particular emphasis facilitate growth institution expand outreach poor vulnerable segment population. in 2010 & 11 consecutively, pakistan rank first sample 55 country category “overall regulatory framework practice microfinance” the economist intelligence unit (eiu) the economist magazine. the customer base mfbs (microfinance banks) cross 700,000 whereas mfis exceed 1,300,000 june 2011. at present 8 mfbs operate pakistan, total asset rs21.4 billion. moreover, sbp engage collaborative effort civil society institutions, especially involve large ngo rsps provide complementary services, social intermediation capacity building. the regulatory regime adopt sbp microfinance sector facilitator, guide problem solver. we prescribe micro finance bank onerous regulation prevail financial institutions. we consultative group draw representative stakeholders, guide u development regulation prudential norms. the access small medium entrepreneur credit major constraint expansion business gradation technology. there exist strong evidence sme expansion boost employment large firm growth smes labor intensive. we realize fundamental importance sme sector economic development country. while sme prudential regulation place years, process review revise make conducive sector. the economic slowdown hit particularly hard. the advance sme sector decline rs.383 billion dec 2008 rs.292.5 billion june 2011. the loan infection ratio sme sector also rise around 16.8 percent. clearly need come sound solution revival sector. in march 2010, sbp come credit guarantee scheme small rural enterprise assistance gop donor agency aim motivate bank lend borrowers, otherwise would access credit normal circumstances. several initiative also underway. pakistan introduce islamic bank system 2003 operate parallel conventional banking, provide choice consumers. a large number pakistani remain withdraw commercial bank strong belief riba-based banking. these individual firm opportunity invest trade business avail loan islamic bank thus expand economic activity 6 bi central bankers’ speech employment. the total islamic bank asset stand rs.560 billion (june 2011) 7.3% total asset bank sector. more importantly, sector show accelerate growth compare segments. deposit grow 15.9 percent overall deposit growth 9.4 percent (june 2011 data). we optimistic prospect ib system. now i would like touch upon role importance capital market mainly consist stock (equity) debt markets. the capital market provide avenue raise long-term finance need business equity long term debt attract investor long term investment horizon. both bank well capital market vital ensure desire level liquidity system, facilitate efficient price discovery allocation credit diversify risk economy. however present level development vary considerably market. while bank take lion’s share overall financial sector dominant player money foreign exchange markets, capital market yet develop still require nurture reach true potential. even within capital market, corporate debt market truly nascent stage. while equity market typically tend develop early debt market develop countries, pakistan’s economy financial sector stage support benefit vibrant efficient debt market. the size private debt, term finance certificate (tfcs) pakistan, remain around rs. 74 billion (0.5% gdp) paltry compare outstanding domestic government debt pkr 4.64 trillion (31.4% gdp). there clearly underexploited capacity available support economic growth. bank continue main provider debt system. in absence active capital markets, commercial entity fail procure long term debt financing, rely short medium term loan banks. consequently bank carry sizable maturity mismatch balance sheet fund advance short term deposits. since bank tend lend large borrowers, portfolio highly skew towards large size loan. in recent years, rise npls, increase borrow government, growth private sector credit become stagnant. bank try limit credit risk become challenge raise private debt business. while credit uptake may take place future, unlikely bank keen finance new long term project anytime soon. there need coordinate effort support government well regulator (sbp & secp) bank development fix income market necessary diversify financial sector turn would enhance role support economic growth. future priority bank sector the future obviously isolate progress make far. we unambiguously designate future path include three main priority (a) make bank sector resilient exogenous shock macro (systemic) micro prudential framework, (b) actively encourage technological solution financial access efficient payment system, (c) address development need financial market broaden array product service well outreach. we would like see bank operate world class standard synergistically reinforce real economy. we actively work pace achieve goal, despite current economic challenges, confident succeed. bi central bankers’ speech 1 sayuri shirai: recent gobal economic development monetary policy japan – grow uncertainty european sovereign debt issue speech m sayuri shirai, member policy board bank japan, meet business leaders, yamanashi, 2 november 2011. * * * i. global economic financial development the world currently face two press macroeconomic issues: one slowdown global economic growth, increase instability international financial market trigger largely fiscal financial problem europe. a. outlook global economy let start outlook emerge economies. these economy continue main engine global economic growth, although pace growth slow somewhat recent months. their source economic strength arise mainly (1) robust domestic demand reflect rise income employment generation – phenomenon commonly observe develop countries, (2) considerable leeway expansionary fiscal policy thank relatively sound public finances, (3) abundant labor forces, (4) potential high labor productivity growth part process technological catch-up. at time, emerge economy experience inflationary pressures, place dilemma contain inflation decelerate pace economic growth make monetary policy decision. by contrast, pace economic growth advance country remain moderate. in case unite states, economic growth far slow originally expected, exemplify substantial downward revision make number international organization think tank – include international monetary fund (imf) – projection 2011 2012. u.s. economic growth decline sharply first half 2011, due mainly (a) decline automobile production cause supply-chain disruption follow great east japan earthquake (b) drop real household income reflect hike gasoline prices. on bright side, corporate profit substantially strong, production, business fix investment, export continue rise. although economic indicator suggest deterioration business sentiment recent months, pessimism suggest sentiment indicator appear great actual corporate business condition warrant. overall, pace economic recovery unite state remain modest, deleveraging process adverse impact burst house bubble household balance sheet persists. a house loan debt remain excessive, debt service exert huge burden households, particularly since employment generation income growth sluggish. moreover, give 30 percent household financial asset invest stocks, negative wealth effect cause recent downturn stock price likely considerable. against background, president obama september 2011 propose job package worth 447 billion u.s. dollar – 3 percent gdp, although clear whether proposal gain approval congress. if not, fiscal stimulus economy come year may limited. b. instability international financial market not pace global economic growth decelerating, international market investor increasingly risk averse. this reflect grow concern 2 bi central bankers’ speech economic performance unite state well worsen fiscal financial problem europe, i touch upon later. strain international financial market intensify since middle 2011, part due prolong debate u.s. congress fiscal debt ceiling deficit reduction, result downgrade credit rat u.s. treasuries. moreover, high-level meet european union (eu), group seven (g-7) countries, group twenty (g-20) country fail come decisive solution fiscal financial problem europe. this series event prompt global investor become even risk averse. a result, international financial market become highly volatile: price stock – perceive risky asset – fell substantially around globe, price government bond major advance economy – perceive safe asset – rise (or yield declined). since october year, however, stock price recover somewhat yield government bond risen. regard corporate bond markets, credit spread widened, particularly unite state europe, issue condition low-rated corporate bond continue remain unfavorable. the number initial public offer (ipos) also drop sharply around globe. what more, since september price gold – generally perceive safe asset – well price commodity decline well. in foreign exchange market, meanwhile, yen, together u.s. dollar, appreciate wide range currency emerge commodity-exporting economy basis perception relatively safe international currency. moreover, emerge economies, cross-border capital flow reversed, lead decline stock bond price well foreign exchange rates. the main reason instability international financial market increase lack confidence measure undertake eu resolve fiscal financial problem europe. a i explain next section, problem europe unlikely resolve short term. therefore, international financial market expect face continue strain while. ii. the fiscal financial problem europe so far, i present overview outlook global economic financial developments. now, i would like take close look fiscal financial problem europe, become epicenter grow strain international financial markets.1 before i go details, i would first like make sure difference eu euro area well understood. the eu economic partnership 27 country constitute world’s large economic zone. it population 500 million account 20 percent global gdp. people money move without restriction region. the euro area, hand, presently comprise 17 eu member state adopt single currency call euro. country large economies, germany, france, italy, spain, among member euro area. the area population 330 million account 15 percent global gdp. it economic zone almost large unite states. i follow standard practice distinguish “core countries” (such germany, france, netherlands, belgium) “peripheral countries” (such greece, ireland, portugal, spain, italy). 1 this speech base information available october 31, 2011. bi central bankers’ speech 3 a. the three problem face euro area the fiscal problem euro area reach critical stage. look back, fiscal problem greece surface spring 2010, follow ireland fall 2010 portugal early 2011. a country – large fiscal deficit and/or government debt – face sharp increase cost funding, choice ask eu imf provide financial support. with regard greece, become clear middle 2011 fiscal consolidation economic reform program, internationally commit itself, far behind schedule. a result, greek debt crisis resurfaced. in addition, market concern fiscal position peripheral country intensified. this, turn, adversely affect creditworthiness european financial institution large hold government bond countries. a result, institution face sharp increase fund cost well. in response, eu announce comprehensive set measure address sovereign debt financial problem end october. this may consider step forward. the measure appear support financial markets. nevertheless, time need see whether help restore stability international financial market revive risk-taking appetite investor general. the euro area large economic zone, but, like unite states, also home headquarter many large, globally active financial institutions. give europe’s close economic financial linkage regions, possible effect volatile development euro area global economy international financial market matter great concern. i would next like talk three main problem confront euro area. 1. fiscal consolidation economic reform greece the first problem loss market confidence ability greek government pursue fiscal consolidation economic reform program, trigger problem euro area face now. greece high level government debt even join euro. moreover, latter half 2009 emerge greek government understate scale fiscal deficit falsify official statistics. the discovery act give rise skepticism toward greek government’s capacity properly manage economic fiscal affairs, result successive downgrade rat agency government bonds. the downgrade turn bring hike bond yields, make difficult government raise fund market, force ask eu imf financial assistance may 2010. the financial assistance provide installment condition program monitor imf eu quarterly review make progress schedule. the disbursement sixth tranche due approve september 2011; however, approval suspend follow find greece would unable achieve budget deficit target 2011 2012. the greek economy middle severe recession, strong likelihood face four successive year contraction continue shrink. a result, tax revenue grow despite increase tax rates, thus undermine government’s fiscal reconstruction efforts. additionally, point that, partly problem associate government’s capacity collect taxes, difficult devise effective measure raise tax revenues. against background, financial market conscious possibility program fiscal consolidation economic reform could stall unless government conduct drastic expenditure cut take decisive measure raise revenue through, example, privatization government enterprises. the sixth tranche likely disburse first half november, follow passage late october bill greek parliament provide reduction fiscal deficit, include layoff public employees. yet, thing develop remain seen. 4 bi central bankers’ speech when agree may 2010 provide financial assistance greece, expect 2012 greece would position raise fund market assumption steady progress would make fiscal consolidation economic reform. this scenario look increasingly unlikely greek government bond yield remain prohibitively high levels. the eu, imf, greece, therefore, agree second bailout package greece – separate financial assistance mention far – provide fund 2012 onward. in addition, agree give sheer size government debt, provision financial assistance alone enough bring greek government debt position sustainable level. therefore, intermediation institute international finance (iif), global association financial institutions, financial institution – private-sector creditor – large hold greek government bond ask bear part burden voluntary basis. more specifically, holder greek government bond due mature 2020 ask exchange hold new bond discount 20 percent present value; words, debt cut roughly 20 percent. in turn, principal new bond would guarantee report large number bond holder represent iif agreed. more recently, however, eu member country voice view that, greece’s fiscal situation deteriorate rapidly anticipated, steep write-down greek government bond necessary. in words, become increasingly clear reduce greek debt 20 percent present value would insufficient sustain greek government’s ability repay debts. in view this, meet hold end october eu iif, agree principle creditor would write 50 percent greek bonds. at time, agree greece implement fiscal consolidation measures. in order meet international commitments, greece, economy already prolong recession, thus require introduce additional restrictive fiscal measures, may intensify vicious cycle economic contraction. policy reduction national debt unavoidable, greek economy need anything else break vicious cycle press ahead growth-generating economic reform build path toward credible fiscal consolidation regain market confidence. 2. mechanism stop greek fiscal crisis spread the second problem concern mechanism stop crisis greece spread euro area member states. in response financial turmoil trigger collapse lehman brother 2008, european country introduce various measure help boost economy rescue banks. such measure inevitably lead increase fiscal deficit government debts. it context crisis greece spread peripheral european countries, ireland portugal, perceive relatively great difficulty proceed fiscal consolidation and/or economic reforms. in order prevent current fiscal financial problem region trigger chain reaction, eu create european financial stability facility (efsf) 2010. the efsf raise fund issuance bonds, proceed use provide loan below-market interest rate financially trouble euro area countries. these bond effectively guarantee euro area member state remain financially healthy. so far, loan form extend ireland portugal, request financial assistance, second bailout package greece due use fund efsf. subsequently, meet head state government euro area, agree increase size guarantee efsf bonds, thereby raise ceiling facility’s lend capacity. the efsf able purchase government bond market inject fund bank system by, example, recapitalizing financial institutions. the agreement ratify october 2011. bi central bankers’ speech 5 in financial markets, however, concern emerge possible contagion crisis euro area member state spain italy. these country much large economies, therefore lend capacity facility already agree meet head state government euro area perceive insufficient fend spread crisis. however, additional increase lend capacity difficult due strong opposition lead germany. at euro summit, meet eu euro area leader hold end october, therefore agree leverage resource efsf enhance ability deal critical situations.2 it probably take leverage plan actually take effect, detail work november need approve member state. needle say, build mechanism prevent fiscal crisis spread euro area whole extremely important stability international financial markets. what matter whether mechanism succeed gain confidence market.3 3. fiscal problem lead problem financial system the third problem fiscal problem europe threaten stability financial system. what start fiscal problem greece, couple concern ability consolidate finance carry economic reforms, spread european countries, doubt arise regard creditworthiness. this, turn, raise concern balance sheet european financial institution hold large volume government bond peripheral countries. consequently, european financial institutions, include financial institution france belgium – core country – begin find difficult raise fund markets. the fiscal problem europe thus begin seriously undermine stability financial system region. in july 2011, result stress test financial institution perform eu confirm progress make strengthen capital bases. however, result mitigate investors’ concern soundness financial system. in fact, imf stress need european financial institution make substantial capital enhancement base estimate potential loss 200 billion euro european financial institution could suffer event collapse price government bond peripheral country greece. however, give current weakness stock markets, easy financial institution increase capital own. a result, concern counterparty risk increased, cause financial institution reduce interbank market trade activities. in addition, uncollateralized interbank trading, particularly term instruments, declining, lead increase fund cost european financial institutions, mainly longer-term u.s. dollar-denominated funds. in comprehensive set additional measure agree end october, eu decide require european financial institution attain core tier 1 capital ratio 9 percent end-june 2012, account market valuation sovereign debt exposures. it also decide financial institution unable increase capital themselves, national government provide support or, unable so, efsf so. it would easy come solution problem contain fiscal deficits, case greece beginning. the appropriate response would 2 leverage refer to, example, “guarantees” provide efsf, could amount many time facility directly lend. if approved, efsf could give flexibility measure prevent crisis spread major euro area member states. 3 in addition, already decide make efsf permanent institution set mid-2013 european stability mechanism (esm) aim facilitate smooth restructure government debt issue country financial difficulties. it also report discussion underway bring forward start date esm year. 6 bi central bankers’ speech increase government revenue reduce expenditure short term, push wide range economic reform medium long term aim achieve sustainable growth. however, come measure stabilize financial system, thing become much difficult, impact international financial market cannot ignored. a major factor currently destabilize international market lie daunt situation deal two crucial issue simultaneously – fiscal imbalance instability financial system. b. effect economic activity europe the problem europe start affect activity real sector economy (such production, business investment, consumption), set downward spiral among economy, fiscal situation, financial system. keep mind, i touch upon current situation outlook economic activity europe. at present, recovery european economy seem stall due slowdown domestic global economies. growth exports, main engine economic growth, slow sharply, growth production consumption also decelerated. furthermore, corporate consumer sentiment worsened. nevertheless, economy core countries, particularly germany strong manufacture sector, remain relatively robust back firm business fix investment. the employment income situation germany also improving, unemployment rate decline 7 percent. in contrast, peripheral countries, greece portugal, suffer short-term downward pressure economy due additional austerity measure follow downgrade sovereign debt ratings. their international competitiveness long weak, challenge achieve economic growth, – already see – market remain deeply concern sustainability government finance countries. with regard economic outlook europe, moderate recovery expect whole. although private consumption unlikely grow household income remain severe pressure, export expect increase gradually base steady growth emerge economies. in addition, business fix investment core country expect remain firm. nevertheless, restore fiscal health challenge face euro area countries. the government-debt-to-gdp ratio euro area whole 85.4 percent 2010, well euro convergence criterion 60 percent. this wide gap highlight need continue effort reduce fiscal deficit limit scope expansionary fiscal measure euro area whole. a monetary policy, policy interest rate already low 1.5 percent, leave little room reductions. in view limit room fiscal monetary policy, necessary aware possibility economic instability continue while. iii. japan’s economy bank japan’s policy measure base development global economy international financial market describe far, i talk current situation outlook japan’s economy measure take bank. for details, please refer outlook economic activity price release bank october 28, 2011. a. japan’s economy follow earthquake march 11, 2011, japan’s economy contract sharply. this due follow factors: (1) production activity fell significantly nationwide due physical damage cause earthquake tsunami production facility bi central bankers’ speech 7 distribution infrastructure well disruption supply chain manufacture sector, especially automobile industry; (2) nuclear power plant accident lead electricity shortages, affect manufacture non-manufacturing industries; (3) consumer sentiment weaken result voluntary restraint follow disaster problem radiation due nuclear power plant accident. 1. the current situation japan’s economic activity pick steadily supply-side constraint cause disaster gradually resolved. supply-chain disruptions, example, ease fast pace expect thank effort make involved. production real export return pre-quake levels, although rate growth moderate recently. while exports, particularly automobiles, increased, iron steel product well digital camera declined. business fix investment increase moderately result september 2011 tankan (short-term economic survey enterprise japan) show business fix investment plans, include small firms, relatively firm. while overall damage cause flood thailand clear stage, impact supply chain warrant careful attention, give japanese firms, especially automobile-related industries, expand overseas production facility finish good part components, include thailand, recent years. meanwhile, although private consumption almost return pre-quake level, weakness remain area indicate by, example, fact restaurant sale return pre-quake levels. also, number foreigner visit japan remain pre-quake levels. 2. outlook economic activity price although adverse effect slowdown overseas economy appreciation yen may continue time being, japan’s economy expect return moderate recovery path reconstruction demand follow disaster gradually materializes. business fix investment likely expand, provide corporate profit improve, domestic overseas demand recovers, government economic policy effective. private consumption also expect gradually become firm backdrop gradual recovery employment income environment. the year-on-year rate change consumer price index (cpi) recently around 0 percent, partly due change base year cpi august 2011. a outlook, year-on-year rate change cpi expect remain around 0 percent time being, factor addition base-year change positive contribution rise tobacco tax charge accident insurance dissipate since october 2011. survey households, firms, economist suggest medium- long-term inflation expectation remain stable; however, future development warrant continue attention. 3. risk outlook while many uncertainty regard outlook economic activity prices, three risk i think warrant attention following: (1) risk fiscal financial problem europe intensify may affect japan’s economy various channels; (2) downside risk regard overseas economy europe; (3) possibility firms’ households’ medium- long-term growth expectation may decline long run. a first risk, two main channel japan’s economy could affected: international financial market channel international trade channel. let u start consider international financial market channel. japan’s financial market remain stable whole despite instability overseas markets. 8 bi central bankers’ speech moreover, far japanese financial institutions’ fund cost affect development overseas, exposure greece, portugal, ireland form investment lend relatively limited. however, give grow international linkage financial markets, global investors’ appetite safe asset intensify further, price risky asset (such stocks) could decline globally. with global financial market increasingly integrated, stock price japan could fall result development markets, foreign exchange rate yen – see relatively safe currency – u.s. dollar currency commodity-exporting emerge country might rise further. thus, risk that, result, business consumer sentiment may deteriorate, push economic growth. in fact, diffusion index overseas supply demand condition september 2011 tankan suggest grow perception excess supply. with regard export channel, i already stated, possibility japan’s export europe might directly affect economic activity europe decelerate result worsen fiscal financial problem area. it important bear mind case impact could substantial, since europe account 10 percent japan’s exports. moreover, risk japan’s export might indirectly affect decrease export europe asian economies. a second risk, concern slowdown u.s. economy could continue give weaker-than-expected employment situation sluggish activity house market due persistent downward pressure house price see increase number home foreclosures. on hand, emerge commodity-exporting economies, despite decline demand unite state europe, likely continue grow thank potentially large domestic demand; however, inflationary pressure remain strong, whether achieve soft landing, is, achieve price stability economic growth time, require continue attention. attention also need pay possible economic slowdown emerge commodity-exporting economy result capital outflow economy investors’ risk aversion intensify due contagion fiscal financial problem europe. with regard third risk concern firms’ households’ medium- long-term growth expectations, japan’s economy long face challenge decline growth rate due, among things, shrink age population. in addition, japan confront new challenges, uncertainty regard supply demand electric power reconstruction effort need follow earthquake. i course anxious uncertainty regard reconstruction-related demand, concern uncertainty surround electricity supply. electricity supply past summer, cause great concern, turn impose considerable constraint economy, summer cool extremely hot summer last year, also effort firm household save electricity. in long run, however, resumption operation nuclear power plant regular inspection still unclear. give possibility might extremely cold winter heat wave next summer, uncertainty regard supply electricity therefore remains, long uncertainty lingers, corporate activity could restrained. in addition, attention need pay possibility appreciation yen could exert downward pressure corporate profits, employment, income, accelerate shift overseas production, could turn lead decline firms’ households’ medium- long-term growth expectation increase downside risk economy. b. the bank’s conduct monetary policy

association chamber commerce important role play step credit segment. asymmetry information lack transparency reliability data major concern organization deal msmes world over. the association need therefore, proactively engage organise workshop train programme member enlighten cash flow cycles, various financial products, account practices, etc. in regard, i would urge upon msme associations,

shareholder and, therefore, they, i.e. mses, customer bank credit, certain obligation fulfill way repay bank loans, maintain proper book accounts, submit information correctly importantly share information financial problem arise work together bank resolve these. on cost credit, interest rate deregulate reserve bank india, message msme sector interest cost small fraction operate costs, approximately 4%, ask low interest rate bank sector, instead ask credit competitive rates. credit self-liquidating viable project cost. in fact, small entrepreneur need focus four typical mistake entrepreneur make rightly point peter f. drucker book “managing next society”. many new business start high promise suddenly run trouble year two. there typical mistake entrepreneur make foreseeable avoidable. firstly, majority successful new invention product succeed market originally designed. so one keep option open dogmatic push product market initially design targeted. success may lie elsewhere. secondly, entrepreneur believe profit matter new enterprise. but profit secondary. it cash flow matters. a business grow fast devour cash. constant investment make keep even. thirdly, business grows, necessary create management team. young entrepreneur often cannot afford bring external management team. so, necessary identify 8 bi central bankers’ speech core competency people work you. this plan take place well advance. lastly, business success entrepreneur need ask business need stage whether concentrate right things. a successful entrepreneurs, gain experience wisdom mistake go forward, necessary ensure mistake repeated. e. need financial infrastructure establish solid financial infrastructure (credit registries/ bureaus, collateral, insolvency regimes) priority financial development agenda, low cost risk financial institution serve msmes. bankruptcy regime regulate efficient exit market, make resolution multiple creditors’ conflict claim orderly, result extensive opportunity recovery bankrupt entity creditors. strong creditor right improve access finance. strong creditor right tend high number loan account per adult population also high rate private credit gdp. there need adequate reliable credit information mechanism, msme credit bureau, serf need msmes’ potential lenders’. transparency shall facilitate obtain finances, get favourable contract improve business prospects. a world bank report state good credit information infrastructure contribute significantly towards assist msmes’ access capital. the report highlight small firm access credit bureau 40% chance obtain loan, whereas firm without access credit bureau 28% chance receive loan. therefore, significant opportunity exist increase lend activity msmes establishment msme credit bureaus. a sound financial information infrastructure improve transparency disclosure msmes cost-effective way, help msmes build credit history, critical help address challenge information asymmetry cost serve. set credit information company already approve reserve bank india. f. conclusion the recent past challenge time bank sector india. you, along entrepreneurs, cop well challenge emerge strong difficult phase. while bank sector respond well far, several challenge lie ahead. our bank system need equip deal emerge challenge prepare cash opportunity unleash high growth. in deal need small medium enterprises, bank look new delivery mechanisms. they must economise transaction cost provide good access currently under-served. to serve new rural credit needs, innovative channel credit delivery found. the proud history bank inspire seek great height professional glory. in end, i congratulate central bank india sme chamber jointly organize conclave. i also convey best wish every employee

bi central bankers’ speech 1 duvvuri subbarao: challenge account profession – reflection inaugural address dr duvvuri subbarao, governor reserve bank india, 26th regional conference western india regional council institute charter account india (icai), mumbai, 16 december 2011. * * * 1. thank invite speak conference western india regional council institute charter accountant india (icai). 2. when i get invite speak conference, first i bite surprised. i wonder might waste valuable conference time listen reserve bank much common reserve bank account profession, except possibly fact lose sleep number go wrong. i speak staff realize wrong i was. we share considerable professional space several mutual concerns. i address share concerns. 3. before though, i must acknowledge another link reserve bank account profession shri y.h. malegam, director central board reserve bank almost continuously since 1994 except brief interlude days. shri malegam is, wide acknowledgement, one foremost charter accountant india set exact standard professional competence, importantly, professional conduct. the reserve bank benefit enormously vast knowledge accounting, understand financial sector judgement large public interest. a profession, proud colleague like shri malegam enhance public respect account profession. the account profession 4. the development account profession owe origin emergence joint stock company consequent separation ownership management. this arrangement trigger need independent inform opinion account owners’ fund entrust management stewardship. the “raison d’être” profession consequently base confidence profession enjoy invest public, continue relevance essentially tie retain confidence. while initially profession provide confidence shareholder joint stock companies, today provide assurance wide base stakeholder include government, bank system, regulator society itself. 5. at reserve bank, depend account profession least two reasons. you audit reserve bank’s balance sheet course, also audit balance sheet commercial bank regulate supervise. reserve bank’s balance sheet 6. let make brief comment reserve bank’s balance sheet. the balance sheet reserve bank different commercial organization important respects. uniquely, reserve bank statutorily mandate two balance sheet – one issue department bank department. the issue department handle task issue, exchange withdrawal currency notes. the bank department maintain deposit account bank governments. the rationale build firewall around balance sheet issue department maintain integrity asset back currency issue. the firewall 2 bi central bankers’ speech ensure explicit promise every currency note carries, pay bearer sum mention therein, honour full account sense. our balance sheet, bank department, reflect transaction perform role banker bank central state governments. 7. in reserve bank, deeply conscious responsibility maintain integrity balance sheets. the reserve bank’s balance sheet analyze wide array stakeholder study underlie monetary macro economic trend make inform decisions. we obligation, therefore, maintain high standard clarity, transparency disclosure, try best meet obligation. rbi account profession 8. while financial statement reserve bank subject audit profession, regulator supervisor bank system, reserve bank major stakeholder commercial bank whose financial statement audit you. in view, auditor “eyes ears” rbi, trust alert u early warn signal assist u supervisory process. we also encourage auditor discus regulatory issue rbi finalize accounts. further, process “annual financial inspection” banks, inspection team interact auditor discus issue regulatory concern. challenge account profession 9. a several stakeholder depend upon account profession, profession recognize continue inspire trust confidence stakeholder remain relevant value adding. in recent years, several challenge emerged, domestic global level which, effectively addressed, could erode confidence. let address what, view, key challenges. competence 10. first, challenge competence. with grow complexity financial sector emergence new sophisticate financial instruments, knowledge base profession need keep pace emerge practice innovations. this requires, continual review curriculum, importantly, active, well diversify constantly update programme continue professional education members. continue professional education cannot mere “tick box” determine participation number hour education training, evaluate way outcome – upgradation relevant knowledge skill sets. 11. towards improve skill set account profession, particular reference audit banks, reserve bank take initiatives. we establish practice annual statutory auditors’ conference apprise statutory auditor bank critical issue area bank regulation supervision. the conference also provide forum auditor give u feedback current concern suggest change supervisory regulatory policies. we find effective forum mutual exchange views, i hope likewise find value adding. i open suggestion improve engagement. 12. i also happy note context result institute’s initiative, india embark convergence international financial report standard (ifrs), would result financial account report get world class. a doubt aware, ifrss largely broad principle rather detail rules. their application require judgment possibly even lateral thinking, especially area bi central bankers’ speech 3 determine fair value financial asset liabilities. the audit profession need improve skill endowment facilitate smooth efficient convergence ifrs. globalization 13. the second challenge profession need reckon globalization. globalization imply country long afford remain isolate far operate legal system concerned. for profession, get reflect merely international account audit standard also number area like education, ethics, etc. i gather icai, 180,000 members, second large account institution world. it sufficient institute merely respond adopt global standards. it should, fact, go actively participate formulation standards. 14. i happy learn president icai recently elect member board international federation accountant (ifac) indian member iasb. i also want commend institute active participation involvement several international committee project aim improve account system processes. i would urge go forward, icai proactively take lead formulation account standard area specific concern emerge market economy (eme). 15. another task profession need address regard manage globalization select, within membership, person requisite competence participate global forums, provide financial professional support make participation reward individually profession broadly. needle say, process selection person represent institute international forum strictly meritocratic transparent. information technology (it) 16. next list challenge information technology. in past, one main objective audit ensure arithmetical accuracy financial statements. with advent it, task take machines. this nudge facilitate profession move value chain. the main task profession shift judgment value, discharge task, auditor demonstrate much high level maturity, integrity, independence balance judgment. the development quality major challenge future. 17. let make comment regard it banking. over past decade, commercial bank successfully implement core bank solutions. this create opportunity challenge auditors. challenge come way lack visible evidence, risk undetected system error bug fraud hide labyrinth data. retrieve information computerize environment assess implementation computer relate process also critical audit process. opportunity come way increase use computer assist audit tool (caats) access database beneath account software create queries, write report develop audit trails. while profession rise challenge audit bank it environment, need explore audit overcome challenge exploit opportunity it environment make audit bank effective meaningful. opportunity 18. i tell one issue agitate expansion opportunity account profession especially view grow membership institute. so far, 4 bi central bankers’ speech enjoy monopoly position respect certain area work, example, audit financial statements. the easy way seek expand opportunity would agitate continuation monopoly position. i believe mistake. rather, profession need identify emerge opportunity market place develop skill need exploit them. 19. let cite example. with concept like core bank centralize record keeping, relevance audit branch public sector bank (psbs) significantly declined. these bank represent rbi audit bank’s branch reduced. there merit suggestion, since currently cost audit psbs significantly high cost audit comparable private sector banks. however, institute resist would mean reduction work members. 20. i believe institute’s effort regard ill advised. in fact, make much sense profession sharpen skill area concurrent audit need exist agitate retention work add value. similarly, profession shy away responsibility prevention early detection fraud. the need service exist profession fulfill need, agency provide service displace auditor deprive potentially expand opportunity. independence 21. let turn challenge “independence”. the growth large international firm accountant create opportunity provision multiplicity services. client benefit umbrella service attach value it. however, also raise vex question extent provision multiple service erode concept independence. 22. the case enron, take along audit firm arthur andersen, come mind context. the sudden collapse enron, energy trade distribute company, rank seventh fortune 500, raise number question account audit practice follow company. the company use creative account shift loss debt company’s balance sheet special purpose entity (spes) thereby conceal extent indebtedness. the company also report withhold information spes could lead auditor insist consolidation balance sheet. enron’s account transgression mislead investor believe company profitable le leverage really was. 23. andersen audit enron sixteen year since company’s formation. on top pure audit, also sell internal-audit consult services. despite privilege insight, andersen discover enron publish incorrect financial statement lead term “enronisation financial statements”. this raise important question conflict interest. be case extensive consultancy work do arthur andersen enron compromise independence lead failure detect erosion account standards? it also subsequently come light member audit committee face financial conflict interest, generate part company’s donation charity connected. could conflict prevented? 24. account audit practice also call question collapse parmalat, large dairy company europe, one big account fraud corporate history. like enron, parmalat undertake elaborate derivative deals, often use complex offshore structure involve many subsidiaries. investor banker struggle understand balance sheet gauge true extent liabilities. by time collapsed, parmalat establish dozen arrangement involve offshore companies, form part company’s consolidate financial statements. bi central bankers’ speech 5 25. instance reaffirm need systemic reform two areas. the first regulation auditors. the profession argue year self-regulation peer review right way maintain standards. but conduct enron, parmalat etc. nose auditor raise question effectiveness soft regulation. the profession find way remedy want prevent imposition external regulator. 26. the second reform need eliminate conflict interest account firms. should ban auditor sell consult service audit? one view real conflict interest good audit would best way assure regulator ban unnecessary. yet confidence audit regained, perception equally important. regulator likely demand meaningful change issue conflict interest. overall, complex issue need address dispassionately. inter-disciplinary approach 27. inter-disciplinary approach next challenge list. in complex world, single profession meet requirement market participants. neither possible individual profession operate silo cater specialize needs. inter-disciplinary interaction therefore unavoidable, fact desirable. but create problems, particularly area disciplinary jurisdiction professional standard different govern body – body exist – may different member body may differently regulated. 28. the recent global financial crisis illustrate problem arise divergence view across discipline – case account profession prudential bank regulators. there widespread criticism account standards, fair value account insist accountants, fail reckon illiquid market distress sales, thereby contribute crisis, least exacerbate severity crisis. 29. post-crisis, convergence view prudential regulator account standard setter desirability forward look expect loss approach loan loss provisioning. the iasb, fasb well basel committee bank supervision (bcbs) actively engage find commonly agree solution complex problem. 30. while discuss issue loan loss provisioning, i would like highlight reserve bank’s concern issue divergence identification non perform asset (npas) provision certify statutory auditor vis-a-vis find supervisory inspection conduct rbi. in reserve bank’s view, certain cases, statutory auditor underestimate extent npa require provisioning. since rbi, supervisor bank system, rely leverage work do auditors, profession effectively address issue. ultimately, statutory auditors’ certification take “true fair” statement account bank disclose stakeholders. it therefore prime importance underestimation provision requirement finalise financial statement banks. value system 31. finally, let turn sensitive important issue value system. recent month witness agitation across country erosion value public domain. the norm society determine dominant section society, account profession certainly dominant section society. the value system 6 bi central bankers’ speech practise professional conduct influence value system society. sadly, see several transgressions. 32. take case worldcom. worldcom indulge major account misstatement hide precarious financial position company. investigation reveal three billion dollar worth cost wrongly classify capital expense five quarter period. this boost report profits, fact fictitious. 33. the case satyam computer service india similar. the company’s chairman confess billion dollar fraud balance sheet hide company’s board, senior manager course auditor several years. the truth follow familiar pattern – overstate profits, understate liabilities, overstate cash cause big hole balance sheet. 34. with much account misconduct big corporations, stakeholder wonder book review default assumption could fraud afoot. account expert explain kind forensic audit reconstruct fraud time-consuming expensive could bring honest business knees. however, i strongly believe robust system audits, corporate culture ethical conduct encourage exemplify active independent board director

tool, april 1994, reserve bank advise bank set audit committee board (acb) directors. needle say, need skilled qualify person acbs make truly effective. accordingly, september 1995, advise bank ensure least one non-executive director charter accountant acb. acbs since contribute immensely provide direction also oversee internal control function bank. we keep ceo bank outside acb keep independent. however, second command, executive director concern member acb bring insider perspective bear committee’s deliberations. however, presence executive director may see compromise independence acb. i

professional domain audit profession reserve bank. i allude uniqueness reserve bank’s balance sheet, indeed balance sheets. i go indicate, view, key challenge profession address order remain effective add value real sector. where relevant, i give contextual reference illustration reserve bank, particularly stem role regulator supervisor bank system. 38. i wish deliberation next two day success. bi central bankers’ speech 1 christian noyer: the euro area sovereign debt crisis speech mr christian noyer, governor bank france chairman board director bank international settlements, bank france / toulouse school economics conference “the euro area sovereign debt crisis”, paris, 19 december 2011. * * * lady gentlemen, it great pleasure give introductory address stimulate conference banque de france please organize jointly toulouse school economics. obviously, find topical subject would difficult, euro area’s sovereign debt market catch vortex financial turmoil plague world economy last four years. this topic also one choose next financial stability review, release next march, significant number contribution stem today’s presentations. the current crisis indeed extremely challenging. many complex factor currently interacting, make policy decision-making particularly difficult. in context, academic critical role play help u clarify tradeoff available options, good able make right choice real time. this fact intellectual input research precious resource time stress multi-faceted uncertainty confirm view central banks’ investment economic research, in-house partnership academia, valuable asset. therefore, i also warmly welcome conference one brilliant illustration benefit bring three year long partnership toulouse school economics (tse). note however that, organization high-level academic conference important achievement within partnership, one. indeed, many avenue fruitful collaboration developed. two series regular joint seminars, one monetary economics, financial stability, several workshop notably contribute strengthen link banque-de-france tse researcher stimulate scientific policy debates. i would also like take opportunity thank jean tirole personal involvement exchange banque de france. last least, let also advertise new banque de france – tse senior junior prize monetary economics finance purpose distinguish outstanding contribution academics. the first prize award first time 16 march 2012. in remain address, i first discus sovereign nature current crisis, origins, implication associate challenges. then, i focus response eurosystem crisis. 1. the euro-area sovereign debt crisis: think origins, implications, challenge ahead the origin euro-area sovereign debt crisis twofold: real cost overall financial crisis excess pre-crisis period jointly contribute gravity current situation. while specific euro area, consequence turn particularly harmful here. indeed, internalize policy requirement associate participation monetary union, several euro-area country enter global financial crisis particularly vulnerable position. one policy requirement fiscal discipline. within stability growth pact, fiscal discipline associate pre-agreed quantitative ceiling deficit debt-to-gdp ratios. in practice, many euro-area country take advantage expansionary period reduce probability reach limit recessionary phases. 2 bi central bankers’ speech unfortunately, exceptionally hard recession, historical standards, hit euro area 2009, consequence financial turmoil initiate u 2007–2008. the tax revenue go large fiscal stimulus package require contain real consequence crisis avoid major disruption finance economy also result swift increase public debt across board. the fact public private indebtedness follow unsustainable pace growth previous decade make area-wide adjustment necessary painful. among factor contribute excess pre-crisis period stand view mislead belief sophisticate financial engineer able achieve close-to-perfect risk diversification market completeness lead fact excessive risk-taking banks. this sharp contrast current situation, investor doubt even risk-freeness sovereign bond develop economies. restore market confidence difficult potentially lengthy task. that said, action consistent commitment government address national fiscal imbalance structural impediment real growth likely accelerate process. besides, clear nominal long-term anchor also essence reduce uncertainty facilitate reforms. the primary mandate best possible contribution eurosystem precisely ensure price stability medium run. then, extent dysfunctional financial-markets likely jeopardize ability maintain stable price medium run, eurosystem must intervene. this analysis motivate decision past continue motivate future ones. this bring second part talk today. 2. measure take eurosystem fight financial crisis our analysis recent situation suggest weak outlook economic activity euro area weigh downward costs, wage prices. accordingly, govern council decide twice low key ecb interest rate 25 basis points, early november early december meetings. change ecb rate ultimately affect inflation change bank lend rates, monetary financial condition aggregate demand. under normal financial-market conditions, monetary-policy transmission mechanism work properly non-standard measure unnecessary. but transmission mechanism impaired, standard policy likely le effective. in exceptional circumstances, extraordinary, non-standard, measure must implemented. it spirit eurosystem constantly reactively update set non-standard measures, keep pace crisis’ developments. on december 8, announce extensive measure contain refinance risk euro area banks. the eurosystem announce particular two longer-term refinance operation maturity 36 month conduct fix rate tender procedure full allotment well extension collateral consider eligible borrow liquidity. we also reduce rate reserve requirement 2% 1%, also contribute stem collateral constraint part euro area bank system. i would like recall that, euro area, bank main channel mobilize domestic save finance investment. this explain ecb’s non-standard measure primarily aim enhance access bank sector liquidity facilitate function euro-area money market. give topic current conference, i would like take opportunity elaborate one non-standard measures, namely security market programme, smp. sovereign yield central transmission monetary policy, particular government bond provide floor private-sector fund costs. this reason launch smp. bi central bankers’ speech 3 i insist that, implementation non-conventional measure – include smp – eurosystem fully play expect role lender last resort (llr), i mean intervene stem liquidity crisis threaten stability bank system. have say that, clear engage large-scale asset purchase sovereign bond well beyond expect central bank’s role llr. moreover, large-scale asset purchase without risks. while may help alleviate upward pressure long-term interest rate short run, could also affect price financial stability medium-run, endanger value central-bank money. such risk necessarily materialize, do, repercussion dramatic. altogether, consider different tool potentially disposal policy-makers, crucial gauge short- long-run benefits, limit risk associate them. i think confidence would really benefit measure know carry non-negligible long-run risks, even short-term relief expect them. a way conclusion, let shortly consider progress already make solve crisis list remain challenge ahead. first, seem important welcome significance fiscal stabilization program many euro-area government commit to. a mention earlier, necessary step restore confidence sustainable way. although difficult task, timely delivery promise reform necessary. second, beyond individual policy actions, recent progress obtain design common fiscal governance euro area essence. indeed, many important decision take direction: the creation efsf esm agreement fiscal rule surveillance mechanism brussels eu summit december 8th 9th historical step right direction. obviously, newly establish institutions, rule process would unthinkable four year ago. this make really optimistic prospect restore stability growth euro area. thus, significant progress achieved. however, future may still add extraordinary challenge confront with. i rely academic community help policymakers decisive decision take. thank attention. i wish fruitful stimulate conference. bi central bankers’ speech 1 lars nyberg: monetary policy financial crisis – reflection speech mr lars nyberg, deputy governor sverige riksbank, danske bank, stockholm, 21 december 2011. * * * on first january 1999, thirteen year ago, sweden gain new central bank act. six people give privilege independently decide something interest almost everyone sweden, namely interest rate. these six people forbid take instruction anyone – is, politician – also forbid outsider give instructions. i privilege one six start 1999, i thus ever since. this mean i member executive board twice long current member four year long person board. whether long experience reflect correspondingly great wisdom central bank-related matter course le certain. in case, i shall leave others decide. an eventful period but doubt thirteen year eventful. there usual cyclical up downs, also number crisis various part world and, course, global financial crisis ensure sovereign debt crisis currently midst of. the way conduct monetary policy also change past thirteen years. the inflation-targeting policy introduce 1993 course always nucleus, develop various ways. work particular field interest, financial stability, also refine many ways. for obvious reasons, area come particular focus recent years. one might say task maintain financial stability previously tend overshadow usually attention-grabbing task maintain price stability, situation almost reverse crisis. the financial stability work case gain prominent position become par monetary policy. now i intend devote last speech member executive board outline central bank memoirs. i always interest look ahead look back, i intend today. more specifically, i intend take area i believe feature discussion central bank activity come years. they connect financial crisis one way another; difficult avoid context. in brief, i talk two themes: the importance indebtedness become high importance crisis management mechanism place event. the important lesson: don’t allow much debt build up! of course, financial crisis due many factor act together. but one important lesson one beware allow debt grow much. this apply equally households, company governments. this neither particularly surprise especially new lesson; several hundred years, financial crisis often precede period attitude credit grant lend carefree. but seem though lesson must experience – least generation, perhaps even often. 2 bi central bankers’ speech a rapid substantial credit expansion cause many different problems. if expansion characterise exaggerate optimism underestimation underprice risk, large loan loss may arise bank sentiment changes. this lead bank fail ultimately financial crisis. we experience 1990s, spain ireland experience now. once economy enter recession period rapidly-increasing indebtedness rise asset prices, recovery level may slow. the reason economy often enter know balance sheet recession.1 put briefly, mean economic agent need time adjust balance sheet if, example, property price fallen. their income time come use amortisation rather consumption investment. monetary policy stimulation le effect normal development economy whole weak. study show type mechanism largely explain recovery unite state been, still is, slow.2 a financial crisis may also consequences. for instance, one claim sovereign debt crisis currently midst many way consequence financial crisis, thus credit expansion precede it. bank crisis sovereign debt crisis often connected. public finance many country weaken substantially demand fall case also need support precarious bank system. moreover, many country credit expansion conceal need structural reform labour market public administration, mean ill-equipped recession came. so, all, many good reason try avoid situation credit lend accelerate control. various perception link monetary policy financial stability policy so prevent, least reduce risk of, type development future? opinion currently divide question. the role central bank play debate lot, particular whether rate-setting use subdue credit expansion. at one end spectrum say crisis mean divide line monetary policy financial stability policy many way erased, least become le evident. if central bank already clear express task maintain financial stability, give – addition natural task act “lender last resort” crisis. monetary policy regard legitimate tool financial stability toolbox.3 at end spectrum find say monetary policy financial stability policy distinct policy confuse one another. they claim monetary policy financial stability policy differ way monetary policy fiscal policy differ, different target methods. the policy rate therefore regard instrument financial stability policy. both type policy react one another, coordinate conduct together 1 the concept “balance sheet recession” introduce year ago explanation development japan “lost decade”; see koo, r.c., balance sheet recession: japan’s struggle unchartered economics global implications, wiley, 2003. 2 see, instance, eggertsson, g. p. krugman, “debt, deleveraging, liquidity trap”, federal reserve bank new york work paper, february 2011 mian, a., k. rao a. sufi, “household balance sheets, consumption, economic slump”, chicago booth work paper, november 2011. 3 see, instance, eichengreen, b., r. rajan e. prasad, “central bank need big bold mandate”, financial times, 24 october 2011. bi central bankers’ speech 3 risk become unclear. the outcome may also poor may difficult hold policymakers accountable.4 the problem exaggerate believe type policy must coordinated… i understand point view, i believe exaggerate argument somewhat. those say monetary policy financial stability policy integrate great extent sometimes give impression believe central bank every monetary policy meet determine policy rate activate number macroprudential supervisory lever find policy mix appropriate monetary policy financial stability. i believe way thing do – i believe way think colour recent events. after all, though problem arise over-generous credit grant every economic cycle. most cycle ”normal”, financial imbalance balance-sheet problems. of course, one must remain vigilant constantly ass risk – try reduce necessary. but probably quite rare one actually need use macroprudential tools, policy rate, subdue credit boom thus reduce risk crisis. growth lend normally something positive. it is, course, difficult say often problem may arise, one conclude, instance, sweden experience two financial crisis quite twenty year them, regard unusually often. for great majority time central bank thus able conduct monetary policy normal way. monetary policy financial stability policy have, say, slightly different time dimensions. …and say entirely separate but i also believe problem exaggerate warn integrate monetary policy financial stability policy. for example, i believe one decide policy rate macroprudential supervisory measure time coordinate way, without either monetary policy financial stability policy perceive le clear. i believe, instance, would fully possible riksbank explain, together finansinspektionen (the swedish financial supervisory authority), mortgage ceiling low counteract excessive credit expansion rise price house market, time riksbank hold policy rate unchanged justify event economy whole. of course, make considerable demand authorities’ communication, i believe fully possible put message across gain understanding. i also imagine certain circumstance might difficult purely practical manner avoid amount coordination monetary policy financial stability policy. some country choose place main responsibility maintain financial stability central bank. other country create form cooperation central bank supervisory authority i believe would good model sweden, too. macroprudential supervision entail large extent use traditional supervision instrument focus entire financial system instead individual financial institutions. 4 see, instance, svensson, l., “monetary policy crisis”, speech federal reserve bank san francisco, 29 november 2011, sverige riksbank. 4 bi central bankers’ speech in case, central bank become deeply involve also macroprudential supervision. i believe may difficult practice make monetary policy decision assumption financial stability policy regard given, vice versa.5 let also say, context, word general whether monetary policy financial stability policy regard different type policy different goal means. when regard principle concept course case financial stability quite different stability inflation rate real economy, is, central bank flexible inflation target strive achieve. logically, one could thus argue monetary policy financial stability policy two different type policy conduct quite separately. but i sure meaningful distinction practice. personally, i regard financial stability merely goal, much means, condition, attain stable real economy stable inflation. assessment development financial sector must, far possible, include macroeconomic assessments. financial unrest instability often lead demand economy low inflation undershoot target. if one consider ”normal” economic cycle le frequent credit debt cycles, upturn cycle necessarily synchronised. however, often case rapid fall credit debt cycle entail correspond fall normal economic cycle – uncommonly balance-sheet recession.6 monitor credit debt cycle thus become way stabilise normal economic cycle. with view, le obvious financial stability policy monetary policy conduct separately. but, again, probably quite rare reason coordinate them. the policy rate probably need support financial stability policy with regard question role policy rate financial stability policy, personal opinion one must always prepare use slow excessive expansion credit, “lean wind” usually called. hopefully, possible find set macroprudential tool efficient enough need use policy rate purpose. hopefully also possible find appropriate form shall use whom. but feel even proper framework macroprudential supervision, situation may arise support need monetary policy “leaning wind”. one reason experience show difficult construct regulation never circumvented. the policy rate blunt instrument, broad impact economy. but time, may strength compare macroprudential tools, simply difficult “avoid” policy rate increase. i also convince quite regardless formal responsibility central bank bear financial stability, always receive large share blame financial crisis arises. when say done, interest rate price credit central bank control price, least regard short maturities, i believe general public hardly absolve central bank blame financial crisis arise period 5 the comparison fiscal policy, regard forego conclusion monetary policy discussions, falter somewhat, i see it. fiscal policy formulate politician vary goal probably wise regard forego conclusion. however, regard relationship monetary policy macroprudential supervision similar way may function conceptual model, would work practice. 6 for recently-published study importance credit debt economic cycle, see jordà, ò, m. schularick a.m. taylor, “when credit bite back: leverage, business cycles, crises”, nber work paper no. 17621. bi central bankers’ speech 5 cheap credit. it probably therefore difficult practice conduct monetary policy take account financial stability. we continue develop flexible inflation target so, conclusion one draw development recent years? how much need reconsider much must modify monetary policy framework? i would reply: somewhat, perhaps le one sometimes might think. i fairly convince flexible inflation-targeting policy conduct many part world essentially right path take, although solve problems. it appear solve problem intend solve, without serious side effects. i think difficult, particularly regard sweden, overestimate role play inflation target attain good macroeconomic stability – together, course, far-reaching change especially fiscal policy area. economic policy discipline able benefit stability credibility provide recent crisis. but also clear financial crisis highlight weakness work develop inflation-targeting policy must continue, academic field central banks. for example, evident reason try get grip model interaction financial market macro economy good way before. financial factors, particular credit indebtedness, play large role model thinking. give impressive amount study produce every month area since financial crisis break out, i fairly hopeful possible gradually incorporate aspect fruitful manner practical inflation-targeting policy.7 but clearly remain lot do. but important continue develop inflation-targeting policy. the financial crisis regarded, would appear claim, sign inflation-targeting policy unsuccessful monetary policy “experiment” blind alley – case. important plan crisis management advance, rarely case i far mainly talk prevent crisis particular role monetary policy play. let go focus challenge regard manage situation crisis occurred. how one manage cross-border financial crisis – – question topical right probably remain long time come. my first thesis one allow financial system grow dependence financial agent different country increases, one carefully consider regulation institution need manage different crisis situations. a well make easy resolve crisis itself, clarity respect also affect bank financial institution develop operation also supervision best shaped. instead think term sequence integration – supervision – crisis management, one see direction, is, crisis management – supervision – integration (figure 1). my second thesis unfortunately rare do practice. 7 for example theoretical analysis consideration financial stability build model inflation targeting, see woodford, m., “inflation target financial stability”, forthcoming sverige riksbank economic review. 6 bi central bankers’ speech figure 1 bank regulation base reverse induction supervisioncrisismanagementintegrationtiming ofeventslogicofincentiveanalysissupervisionintegrationcrisismanagement inadequate plan crisis management monetary union this reason also apply nations, financial systems. during autumn, see yield government bond soar number euro area countries, particularly sovereign debt problems. it quite clear euro area lack necessary institution manage crisis situation. in unite kingdom, hand, yield rise way, despite weak public finance (figure 2). there may several explanation this, instance, investor confidence unite kingdom manage consolidate budget successfully. but i believe mainly euro area country lack defence mechanism unite kingdom has.8 the reason follows: when investor in, instance, italian government bond concern italy’s creditworthiness sell bond buy something else, german government bonds. then italian bond yield rise time liquidity leaf country. other investor become worry yield rise – value bond fall – therefore sell holdings, mean yield continue rise. this become spiral fall liquidity rise yields, difficult stop. the italian central bank unable much, cannot create liquidity euro. only european central bank, ecb, frankfurt this. the italian ask help, cannot much – least short term. and investor aware this, course. 8 see, instance, de grauwe, p., “the governance fragile eurozone”, ceps work document no. 346, may 2011. bi central bankers’ speech 7 figure 2 government bond yields, 10-year maturity per cent 01234567801234567808091011italyuk source: reuters ecowin. this situation similar one experience argentina, instance, “currency board” firmly tie domestic currency u dollar. in event crisis central bank could create currency – country similar problem physical currency run solution fly dollar bill federal reserve. now, course, fundamental problem italy, like argentina, lose competitiveness, deficit current account build debt market gradually lose confidence demand high high interest rates. competiveness need restore form internal devaluation. this unavoidable, take long time help acute liquidity crisis. the situation different unite kingdom. if investor concern british credit worthiness sell government bond example above. they receive british pound may also sell wish get rid british credit risk. but liquidity uk affect way italy – many pound uk before. what happen pound decline value relation currency uk government bond regard worth price. moreover, bank england create liquidity buy uk government bond prove necessary. there risk spiral fall liquidity rise interest rate way italian example. in addition, british competitiveness help weak pound. and investor know too. so uk bond yield rise way italian ones. on basis examples, one might conclude easy manage financial crisis one involve monetary union. this true, fairly trivial one beware make relate conclusion currency union harmful. the euro cooperation offer major benefit members, although mention much now. however, come crisis management currency union important conclusion draw. 8 bi central bankers’ speech the first one must course regulation monetary union enable one avoid crisis proportion see now. this creator union think initiate stability growth pact. however, pact work well intensive discussion therefore underway supplement new regulation guarantee member excessive budget deficit build excessive debt burdens. hopefully discussion bear fruit. however, far certain development see could avoid even stability growth pact upheld. low interest rate mean governments, also company household build debt. but efficient regulatory system would probably make crisis manageable. a second conclusion one refrain crisis resolution mechanism inherent national currency, one must replace something else. because crisis entail concern member state’s creditworthiness always risk. one must institutional framework manage investors’ concern regard rise bond yield in, instance, italy italian currency depreciate banca d’italia cannot create necessary liquidity. if institutional framework credible start, need use cases. it extent type framework european financial stability facility, efsf, mean become. it able buy government security issue euro area countries. however, difficult restore market confidence already seriously damaged. the institutional framework must place credibility crisis break out. this make crisis easy manage one might even prevent arise all. it probably case politician eu help increase market distrust way handle crisis. for example, understandable political point view want force private lender write loan greece. but economic perspective – long run also political – good idea. this mean italy spain pay much high interest rate – primarily one perceive risk italy spain unable service debts, market become uncertain whether politician intend take similar coercive measure here. if one suffer acute crisis, whether one create oneself not, one must consider carefully managed. if one create credible crisis resolution mechanism good time manage crisis, finally one last resort, ecb. the ecb monetary union’s central bank crisis union’s national central bank unable do. it always create liquidity buy security need therefore principle also attain credibility bank england unite kingdom. the problem ecb indisputable mandate this, eu member state differ view whether give mandate. the ecb save country make necessary adjustment legislation public finances, many quite rightly point out. but also risk consequence one refrain remain mechanism manage acute crisis. obstacle set crisis management mechanism one reason appear difficult set clear framework manage crisis advance is, i mention earlier, crisis occur rarely. “there crisis mandate period,” politician say swedish crisis early 1990s, discus new crisis legislation. and right, course. it take almost 20 year next crisis occurred, leave politics long ago. there another important reason, particularly several country involved. if one create framework manage crises, one unavoidably face question bi central bankers’ speech 9 cost divided, almost, completely, impossible agree advance. all crisis different. it may possible agree act problem arises, instance, negotiate how. one thus decide “ex ante preparation ex post burden-sharing”, “ex ante burden-sharing”. give this, interest note regard ecb actually crisis resolution mechanism form imply agreement “ex ante burden-sharing”. it write treaty european union exactly national central bank recapitalise ecb necessary. if security ecb purchase fall value ecb need capital, thus clearly stipulate extent different country shall contribute. it may country want allow ecb buy government bonds, others think excellent idea. so, paradoxically, may actual crisis resolution mechanism case lead deadlock risk aggravate crisis. crisis management mechanism equally important bank system let change focus country bank systems. but thesis i mention early same: when cross-border integration progress important – profitable society’s point view – create credible crisis resolution mechanism advance. but rarely never done. one sometimes talk europe’s “financial trilemma”.9 we europe want achieve continue financial integration increase financial stability, time want retain country's national sovereignty. the problem possible attain two goals, difficult attain three. if want combine financial integration continue national sovereignty over, instance, supervision crisis management, do far, difficult achieve meaningful financial stability – crisis currently go provide good example (figure 3). figure 3 if, hand, want prevent cross-border crisis time maintain national sovereignty, must accept reduce financial integration – example, strict regulation bank move financial asset country (figure 4). one see clear tendency direction current discussions. if one wishes, third alternative, retain integration time reduce risk crisis spread across national borders, one must consider let go national sovereignty allow 9 schoenmaker, d., “the financial trilemma”, economics letter 111, 2011, pp. 57–59. financial stability national sovereignty financial integration 10 bi central bankers’ speech supervision crisis management european level (figure 5). however, path consider politically viable present. figure 4 figure 5 the larosière group, give task financial crisis propose financial system europe managed, try suggest compromise: continue integration, slightly le national sovereignty slightly joint responsibility supervision work. this lead early “level 3” committee banking, insurance market supervision transform authorities. the idea give much power possible without change treaty european union. at time, european systemic risk board, esrb, created. this give warn recommendation member – central bank governor supervisory head – ass financial risk build europe. it possible vote authority esrb majority opinion applies.10 this prove important prevent deadlock otherwise common method consensus decision entail. both force speed action increase substantially. but concern one avoid crises, manage occur. nor larosière group discuss, marginally, crisis management wind insolvent banks. however, european commission’s newly-published proposal deal this, new uk u legislation arise since crisis. this is, course, important step right direction. great clarity regard bank wind great extent affect supervision design bank act. a i said, wise begin end.11 …but difficult cross-border agreement however, focus legislation, naturally enough uk u legislation, also european proposal, manage national bank distress. the cross-border problem avoid great extent, even commission’s report. the fact integrate financial system europe also require method resolve cross-border crisis remain discussed. and course connect i mention earlier, namely much sensitive issue discus cost divided. 10 the supervisory head right vote esrb. a 2/3 majority require recommendation decision publish warn recommendations. 11 the crisis legislation also relate another topical question, namely much venture capital bank consider need. if authority bank know happen crisis, also affect need risk-bearing capital banks. the desire able manage uncertainty crisis important motive behind increase capital requirement basel iii accord. if uncertainty reduced, capital need decline. but basel committee make connection. financial stability national sovereignty financial integration financial stability national sovereignty financial integration bi central bankers’ speech 11 but one unable manage even preparation procedure surround distribution cost crisis – know ex ante preparation ex post burden share – also consequences. if nothing discuss advance, natural consequence – know default option – cross-border bank distress divide along national boundaries, regardless organised. the branch network one country may, instance, suddenly find entirely without it system central administrative functions, costly build up. the fact become irrational substantially increase total cost wind bank become problem cannot resolved. fortis dexia, recent reconstruction autumn, say good example recent crisis. they divide accord national boundaries, least regard fortis appear agree good solution. in case, solution cost tax-payers unnecessary large amount money. what conclusion draw this? i believe one cannot agree different nation manage cross-border bank distress, probably well realise likely event bank divide along national boundary event crisis. this insight affect think regard supervision, turn affect demand make banks. perhaps one ultimately require bank organise national unit operate entirely independent one another? of course, line agree europe regard banks’ possibility operate national boundaries, natural consequence able discus rational solution advance. this reason course highly relevant u sweden, too. we number bank nordic baltic country significant important cross-border operations. i believe one require authority politician – country concern – able agree slightly good way wind bank distress cut along national boundaries. but become overly heavy political burden must expect country concern quite simply take part bank country – even solution much expensive total tax-payers. now, however, hope. just week ago financial stability board, consist ministry finance, central bank financial supervisory authority g20 countries, publish new norm manage crisis cross-border banks. for instance, discuss make bondholder bear share cost event crash. when translate legislation apply countries, manage important problem face wind large, cross-border banks. but still remain see whether one actually find princples cost allocate different countries. in current debate much capital bank need, may also worth remember good legislation one wind bank distress, le capital need hold. the capital regard buff necessary avoid tax-payers bear cost crisis. if one regulate various lender contribute, need buff reduced. with reflections, time wind up. not speech today, day time member executive board riksbank. a i said, thirteen eventful years. at present international debate intensive many tricky question resolve – least crisis management supervision financial markets. the job still interesting. but time everything, know best stop still fun. bi central bankers’ speech 1 k c chakrabarty: ten commandment successful bank career address dr k c chakrabarty, deputy governor reserve bank india, icici bank probationary officer convocation 2011, icici manipal academy, bangalore, 13 december 2011. * * * assistance provide ms.rakhe balachandran preparation address gratefully acknowledged. m chanda kochhar, md ceo, icici bank, shri t. v. mohandas pai, chairman, manipal global education services, dr k. ramnarayan, vice chancellor, manipal university, shri rajiv sabharwal, executive director, icici bank, distinguish guests, lady gentlemen, young friends. it indeed pleasure midst today. young people infuse energy vigour gather bright, young banker like also make learn experience. convocation always special occasion signify end beginning. an end – formal learn process and, hence, moment great satisfaction joy everyone involved. and begin – mark threshold next stage apply practically knowledge skill acquire formal learn process, thereby, acquire real world learn experience. i congratulate graduate ninth eleventh batch icici manipal academy especially thank ms. chanda kochhar give opportunity address young bud bankers. the icici bank probationary officer programme, i sure, effort “catch them young” create banker tomorrow – set new generation manager bank new times. nowadays, financial sector world undergo period rapid acceleration change, great challenge organization sector build institutional architecture enable sustain intellectual capital. this especially important time “creative destruction” – use joseph schumpeter’s classic phrase theory economic innovation – new ideas, new construct new expectation emerge. and this, turn, make role new generation manager institution demand banker yesteryears. the term “generation” refer common identity arise common experience. thus, identity gen y managers, perhaps are, would also arise common experience change world around us, product wide historical context. a know, financial sector reform since year 1991 herald dramatic shift way bank function operate india. the change environment internal compulsion arise great competition need improve market share profitability give rise quest great efficiency need reposition give reality environment internal strength weaknesses. but time, compulsion business must take away basic tenet good banking. understand inculcate certain quality help ensure one become successful banker year ahead this, incidentally, would theme address today. but, i delve that, know fully well would study graduation, let start explain bank importance society. what banking? banking, conventionally, define acceptance deposit money public purpose lend investment. these deposit repayable demand otherwise withdrawable cheque, draft, order otherwise. deposit accept 2 bi central bankers’ speech individual well firms. in sum, nature bank business summarise two words, i.e., “financial intermediation”, need carry efficiently (both operational allocational) stimulate real sector economy. another essential characteristic bank highly leverage and, hence, special need regulate protect interest depositors. a bank institution legal back bank regulator oversee financial solvency soundness, enable bank earn trust confidence public. you also aware bank india, elsewhere, take diverse form viz., bank form special statutes, company register company act, 1956 foreign company co-operative society register co-operative society act. bank classify base ownership pattern public sector banks, private sector bank foreign banks. some specialize institution icici morph banks. yet institution exim bank, sidbi nabard specialize trade, small industry agriculture, respectively. apart basic bank business, bank also undertake service safe custody valuables, grant issuance letter credit facilitate international trade, buy sell foreign exchange collection bills, among others. bank also act agent government entity undertake agency business. extend loan advance needy sector economy priority basis crucial function bank sector. keep view need indian economy, bank mandate extend 40 per cent net bank credit priority sector economy. the priority sector economy include, inter alia, agriculture, weak sections, small scale industries, education micro finance. these norm ensure adequate flow fund important needy sector economy. but also aware, years, bank transformed. it long “3-6-3” banking. bank sector become liberalized, competitive, stable, customer oriented, technologically advance also profitable. the prudential norm implemented, interest rate deregulated, asset quality improved, entry barrier liberated, new product introduced, capital infuse risk management improved. there also decline concentration bank business banks. financial industry move towards expand activity drive customer needs, financial innovations, technological change, consolidation, convergence, global competition financial inclusion. many challenge lie ahead stiff competition, stringent regulatory norms, shareholder demand high returns, also challenge globalization financial inclusion. thus, prospective successful banker future, one fairly good understand opportunity challenge accomplish job efficient way. importance bank in old day bank prevalent, people force borrow money money lender high interest rates. even today, rural unbanked area country, people dependent money lender credit. moreover, people save, use hoard money house despite risk robbery. the existence bank, legal sanctity, solution issues. bank extend loan advance affordable interest rate productive well consumption purpose start accept deposit public. the provision loan affordable interest rate help people smoothen income expenditure fluctuation one hand start remunerative economic activity other. apart safety provide bank money deposit public, interest offer bank deposit public act additional incentive deposit money bank sector. this inculcate save habit among public. the save people become productive part bi central bankers’ speech 3 economy. this one important reason reserve bank encourage nudge bank expand bank network unbanked village country. while social point view, distribution credit affordable interest rate important argument existence banks, economic point view, channelisation save investments. high save investment important stimulate economic growth. bank important conduit monetary policy transmission play important role payment settlement systems. the recent technological advancement bank sector atms, debit cards, credit card electronic transaction make transfer money across financial system easy convenient public. the electronic card point-of-sale terminal facilitate day day financial need customer without need carry paper money. the internet bank facility offer bank also help customer manage personal financial

bankers’ speech 1 peter praet: the state global economy speech mr peter praet, member executive board european central bank, 4th world policy conference, vienna, 9 december 2011. * * * i would like thank john hutchinson arnaud mehl contribution preparation speech. lady gentlemen, it real pleasure vienna exchange view future global governance. vienna certainly city long tradition discuss issue global dimension. follow invitation speak conference, i remember that, almost 200 year ago, famous congress vienna attempt forge come know “concert europe”. this mark creation new global order major turn point world history. the global economy today also turn point. what observe since unprecedented financial market tension mid-2007, merely unfold global financial economic crisis. we observe emergence new global order, occur fast pace anticipate prior crisis. the exact form new world take unclear. but need sound global governance, discus today tomorrow, become ever apparent. on economic front, several important change already occurred. the g20 replace g7 prime forum international economic cooperation. the financial stability board establish address vulnerability develop regulatory supervisory policy conducive global financial stability. body base bank international settlement basel, keen interest central bank community, also reform membership enlarge relevant emerge market players. in assess state global economy today, i would like emphasise crossroads. in respect, i would like make three specific points. firstly, i describe outlook risk global economy euro area. i discus interplay current prospect key policy challenges: namely global real financial imbalance well liquidity capital flow volatility. finally, i briefly comment major governance challenge eurozone. * let commence depict i see outlook key risk global economy euro area juncture. against background heighten uncertainty rise stress financial markets, global sentiment deteriorate recent months. it appear downside risk previously identify materialised. look ahead, short-term indicator well late survey data suggest global growth expect remain sluggish. however, look global economy whole mask considerable degree heterogeneity prevails. indeed, key characteristic global economy relate divergence global growth pattern advance emerge economy also within country groupings. in advance economies, growth sap headwind persist annual gdp growth expect potential. in particular, headwind relate continue need public private sector deleveraging well persistent weakness labour house market advance economies. these factors, combine ongoing tension financial markets, expect restrain global growth medium term. 2 bi central bankers’ speech conversely, emerge economies, growth remain relatively robust. while growth recently experience moderation, largely account weak external demand., assist alleviate overheat pressures. the resilience emerge economy throughout crisis impressive. however, emerge economy immune development part globe. more four year begin financial crisis, uncertainty continue remain high, substantial downside risk economic outlook notably euro area. downside risk particular relate intensification tension euro area financial market potential spillover real economy. additional downside risk also relate global economy, may turn weak expected, well protectionist pressure possibility disorderly correction global imbalances. * i would like focus key global policy challenge confront global economy. the first challenge persistence large real financial imbalance global level, key source vulnerability medium term. a figure worth recalling. combine together, current account deficit surplus main systemic economy project stand roughly 2% world gdp next five years. this le crisis (3% world gdp 2007), twice much late 1990s. a large share adjustment external imbalance since crisis cyclical, structural accord imf, u current account deficit project reach 3% gdp 2011, surplus roughly 5% 9% gdp china oil exporter respectively. they source tension could ultimately lead protectionist pressures. however, euro area whole balance current account position. global fiscal imbalance remain significant, mark degree heterogeneity advance emerge economies. consolidation effort require bring public finance sustainable path key priority advance countries. effort make adjust imbalance remain clearly insufficient. this raise risk, i refer earlier, disorderly unwind line, significant potential fallout global financial market global economy. at cannes summit 3–4 november 2011, g20 leader agree action plan lay foundation strong, sustainable balance global growth medium-term. this welcomed. all g20 member make commitments, sometimes imprecise. it often unclear commitment genuinely contribute rebalancing global demand patterns. for instance, g20 member explicitly reaffirm support solemn pledge leader toronto last year halve fiscal deficit 2013 stabilise public debt ratio 2016. large emerge market announce would enhance flexibility exchange rate regime, without indicate specific time-frame would occur. europe share commit accelerate deepen single market. more decisive policy measure rebalance global demand pattern still required, particular raise save deficit economy increase domestic demand surplus economies. all systemic economy could benefit effective multilateral surveillance along international responsibilities. now time lose sight need correct imbalance globally although attention – good reason – focus immediate challenges! * the second relate key global policy challenge relate best address global liquidity condition volatile capital flow constellations. ample global liquidity condition bi central bankers’ speech 3 potential push volatile capital flow emerge economies. if respond accumulate reserve cap exchange rate appreciation, widen global imbalances. while issue already discuss crisis, argue might exacerbate result policy response crisis. indeed, policy response sub-optimal global vantage point. many country continue accumulate large reserve hold limit currency appreciation. for instance, china’s reserve hold exceed usd 3 trillion; russia usd 400 billion; brazil, korea taiwan usd 300 billion. others adopt capital flow management measures, include high reserve requirement – sometimes – outright control capital inflows. some observer claim “currency wars” might break out. this effort international community good understand global liquidity developments, well deal global liquidity shortages, particular crises, g20, imf central bank community bank international settlement basel valuable undertakings. the agreement g20 leader action principle could help reaffirm benefit financial integration increase resilience volatile capital flow commendable. this agreement provide coherent conclusion guide country management capital flows. the first line defence excessive capital flow volatility comprise sound domestic macroeconomic policy framework institution well appropriate exchange rate regimes, financial regulation supervision. capital control measure temporary nature use last resort, give may delay necessary domestic policy implementation distort distribution capital flow across countries. * lady gentlemen, when delegate congress vienna first meet 1814, new world emerge would last almost another century barely discernible. the outbreak global economic financial crisis put u similar situation today. throughout world, citizen call upon policy-makers act decisively resolve crisis help global economy turn corner. all relevant authority take responsibilities. to ensure crisis fully address require ambitious strengthen economic governance. significant reform direction take place europe. the eu council european parliament agree legislative package significantly limit discretion national authorities. this include framework monitor wide range

challenges. in view ecb’s govern council, new fiscal compact comprise fundamental restatement fiscal rules, together fiscal commitment euro area government made, important precondition restore normal function financial markets. to accompany fiscal consolidation, bold ambitious structural reform essential. they immediately carry help euro area country improve competitiveness, increase flexibility economy enhance longer-term growth potential. we ecb take responsibilities. monetary policy euro area remain dedicate mandate, maintain price stability medium term. the policy measure take ecb result govern council’s outstanding 4 bi central bankers’ speech record past 13 year term price stability anchor inflation expectations. the ecb continue remain anchor confidence stability, global economy characterise mark uncertainties. this central contribution make foster sustainable growth, job creation financial stability euro area whole. thank attention i wish fruitful enrich conference.
