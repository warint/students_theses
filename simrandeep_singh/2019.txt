François Villeroy de Galhau: The euro area - staying the coursethrough uncertaintiesIntroductory remarks by Mr François Villeroy de Galhau, Governor of the Bank of France, at theBank of France Symposium & 34th SUERF Colloquium on the occasion of the 20th anniversaryof the euro, Paris, 28 March 2019.*   *   *Good afternoon everyone and welcome to Paris. This is not only the 34 SUERF Colloquium butalso the 10 Banque de France International Symposium. It is also Marc-Olivier’s lastsymposium and I would like to warmly thank him and the teams at SUERF and the Banque deFrance for their hard work. I also wish to express my gratitude to the speakers and moderatorsas key players in “staying the course through uncertainties”. In my opening remarks I willmodestly describe different types of uncertainty before discussing their possible implications forpolicy.   **1 – There are actually four different types of uncertaintyWe often talk about uncertainty as if it is a single phenomenon. There are, however, multiplesources and forms of uncertainty that have different implications for how policy makers can andshould respond. To introduce your discussions over the next two days, I will mention four ofthem.First, “Current state” uncertaintyOne form of uncertainty that we grapple with all the time is not being completely sure where weare economically. So-called soft data, such as surveys and sentiment indicators, and marketsignals do not always align with hard official statistics which are generally known with somedelay. Statistical techniques exist to try to combine these sources together into a “nowcast” butthe error bands around these central estimates are still quite wide. They also cannot deal withone of the most difficult problems: what to make of so-called “idiosyncratic factors”? Forinstance, to what extent is the recent stutter in the German economy due to the car industry andto the new emissions standards or to the low level of the Rhine and possibly climate change?These are very hard judgements to make.                             Second, “Future path” uncertaintyIf we are unsure about where we are, we are even less certain about where we are going, mostobviously because of shocks that we cannot precisely predict. A potential slowdown in China ordifferent choices over Brexit – which you will discuss today – are two such examples.Economic dynamics are also driven by underlying momentum that is very difficult to gauge. Is therecent growth slowdown temporary or will it persist? A temporary slowdown is, as you know, thebase case for the ECB, which recently revised down its staff macroeconomic projections for realGDP growth substantially in 2019 but only slightly in 2020.Third, “Strategic” uncertaintyIn some cases, the uncertainty we face is about what other policy makers will do. This isparticularly pernicious when unpredictability is considered a source of strategic advantage. Forinstance, a seemingly credible threat by one party to take actions that lead to mutualdisadvantage can prompt concessions from the other, (or not).  A former American President,thth 1 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
Richard Nixon, called this his “mad man” theory when applying it to the war in Vietnam and thereare echoes of this idea in current international trade disputes. Such behaviour underminesmultilateralism which has been an important source of stability and growth over many decades. Ifstrategic uncertainty is a source of unilateral advantage, it will not dissipate but remain a sourceof latent policy risk.Last, “Structural change and monetary policy” uncertaintyThere are fundamental structural changes occurring, notably in the euro area economy but alsoelsewhere, that are poorly understood. The ongoing demographic transition, for example, ischanging employment, investment and saving decisions, which will probably lower the naturalrate of interest.The monetary policy transmission mechanism also seems to be changing. A sustained period ofaccommodative monetary policy has boosted growth and employment and is finally showing upin nominal wage growth: this first part of the Phillips curve is at work. But higher nominal wageshave not yet been passed through to core inflation. It should eventually, but the more pertinentissues – of when and by how much – are unclear. There is, thus, not a single mechanicalrelationship between monetary policy instruments and inflation, rather a distribution of likelyresponses. Furthermore, differences in demographic trends and structural policy choicesbetween countries in the eurozone (or states in the US) may create or perpetuate someheterogeneity across large monetary areas, an issue you will discuss tomorrow morning.2 – How to respond to such uncertainties?Without pre-empting discussions, let me flag some possible responses.I’ll first, address the issue of policy uncertainty between central bankers. So far, it is,fortunately, the simplest one: we are not in a so-called “game of chicken” and clarity about policyintentions between ourselves are beneficial for all. The frequent exchanges we have at the BIS,G7, G20 and even events such as this Symposium, are valuable to create mutual trust and avoidthe possibility of large policy surprises. Our monetary policies are independent, and rightly so, butthey are concerted and we are committed to avoid currency wars. Clarity about our reactionfunctions clearly also extends to financial markets and the public at large.Second, how could we respond to current state and future path uncertainty? The textbookanswer, dating back to Theil and Tinbergen, is to work out your best guess and then act as if youare completely sure. This is sometimes described as the certainty-equivalent approach. Thereare, however, symmetry assumptions in this type of model that do not necessary hold in the realworld. Uncertainty around the central projection may be skewed in one direction.Applying the certainty-equivalence approach also assumes that upside errors are regardedequally to downside errors. But given that inflation is still below the objective, as are market-based long-term inflation expectations, upside shocks would be more welcome than equivalentdownside shocks at present.Let me at this point add some words on negative rates following my remarks Lisbon lastFebruary, and state the obvious: we are in March 2019, and no longer in March 2016 when wecut the DFR to –0.40%. This gap in time has two consequences:First, there were, at that time, significant deflationary risks, and we decided accordingly astrong calibration of our monetary answers. As these deflationary risks have now receded,there is obviously no reason to go more negative on interest rates.Second, we have three years more evidence on the combined effects of our variousunconventional monetary tools, including negative rates, on financial intermediation and theirimpact on the transmission of our monetary policy – the combined effects of which might 2 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
have evolved over time. So Mario Draghi rightly stressed that we need to further monitor thebank lending channel and to reflect on possible measures that we can take to preserve thefavourable implications of negative rates for the economy, while mitigating their possible sideeffects.Knightian uncertainty is different situation, for which assigning probabilities is not feasible, and isa concept that anyone trying to forecast the recent outcomes in the House of Commons wouldinstantly recognise. In such situations, it is usually argued that the best strategy is to try to avoidthe worst outcomes, as we have done in preparing for a no-deal Brexit. And sometimes you needto be bold to avoid truly bad outcomes, exactly as Mario Draghi did when he said that the Euro-system would do “whatever it takes”.Third, how should we respond to uncertainty about structural relationships? Uncertainty about thetransmission mechanism is often used to justify acting gradually. Sometimes described as“tiptoeing in a dark room”, a central banker following the Brainard principle attenuates hisresponse to inflationary shocks if he is uncertain about the precise sensitivity of inflation tomonetary policy. But the more cautious he is in the first step, the more ready he should be totake several additional steps: gradualism is not inaction.Structural shifts in the economy are also constantly changing economic dynamics andequilibrium relationships, such as r* (the natural rate of interest) and u* (the natural rate ofunemployment). But as John Williams of the New York Fed has pointed out, these stars aretoday more a fuzzy blur than a single bright point of light. So whilst they can help with the broadorientation of monetary policy, uncertainty about these stars is too wide to permit precisenavigation.Overall, therefore, the theoretical guidance on how to respond to uncertainty is itself open, to saythe least. My understanding of the present debates leads me to the following four pragmaticsuggestions that I hope can stimulate your discussions:1. Remain very clear about your objectives – uncertain times are not the right ones to createadditional doubts about, say, your inflation target – and about your capacity anddetermination to use your tools in a predicable sequence.2. But, whilst being consistent with your guidance, be very flexible in the precise calendar andcalibration of your implementation. In short, be as predictable as possible, but never beprecommitted.3. Act to prevent the worst outcomes occurring but without supplying complete insurance,which would create moral hazard.4. Never base policy on only one expected path for the economy. In conclusion, we cannot seek to control, or avoid, uncertainty; instead we must implementstrategies that are the most robust to it. The French philosopher Edgar Morin put it nicely: “Laconnaissance progresse en intégrant l’incertitude, non en l’exorcisant” – “knowledge advancesby integrating uncertainty, not by exorcising it”.With that in mind, let me wish you all a very productive symposium with lively and enlighteningexchanges of views.   Christine, the floor is yours. 3 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches

Page 2 of 11  Introduction  Tēna koutou katoa. Thank you for joining us today to discuss New Zealand’s new monetary policy framework.  The recent amendment to the Reserve Bank’s legislation sets up a Monetary Policy Committee that is responsible for a new dual mandate of keeping consumer price inflation low and stable, and supporting maximum sustainable employment.    The Committee’s deliberation process will ensure that all decisions benefit from a diverse range of views, and offer greater transparency and accountability to monetary policy decision-making. Before I outline the features of the new framework and its underlying principles, I would like to paint the backdrop to this institutional change.   The business of central banking is evolving as circumstances change.  Some of the change is favourable, some is confronting.   On the favourable side, we have low and stable inflation, low unemployment, and broad financial stability. This advantageous position must never be taken for granted. I thank all of the wise people – past and present – who have worked hard on creating the current environment. On the challenging side, in addition to maintaining the status quo, we have new and significant long-term economic challenges among which central banks operate.  For example, in the financial system alone, we must deal with global economic inter-dependence, dominant financial institutions, significant debt burdens, technological change that challenges employment and financial inclusion norms, climate change, and much more.  The list is long and the challenges have intergenerational implications. I spoke about many of these issues in a recent speech about the dangers of short-term thinking.1  The refreshed Reserve Bank Act and monetary policy practices, and the ongoing reviews of our legislation, position us to adapt to these changes. The aim is to ensure that the Reserve Bank can continue to achieve its fundamental purpose, which is “to promote the prosperity and well-being of New Zealanders, and contribute to a sustainable and productive economy”.2  Institutions, Legitimacy & Identity  Let’s take a step back and talk about the backdrop to recent and pending changes to the Reserve Bank’s frameworks.   The key role of a public institution is to bring to life the terms of a contract that arises between society and its representative government.  This ‘social contract’ will always evolve, with its terms negotiated via the democratic process.                                                             1 Orr, A., (2018), Geopolitics, New Zealand and the Winds of Change, Reserve Bank of New Zealand speech delivered to the "Shaping Futures National Conference" Financial Services Council in Auckland, 7 September 2018 2 Reserve Bank of New Zealand Act (1989).  
Page 3 of 11  Institutions must therefore adapt in keeping with shifting political, economic, environmental, and social realities, so as to serve the well–being of the people.  After all, it is from people that institutions derive their ‘social license’ to operate - their legitimacy.  Earning and retaining institutional legitimacy is an evolving challenge. Similar institutions may serve similar functions across countries, but they operate in a unique national and cultural context. Hence, they best earn local legitimacy when they appeal to a collective national identity.  It is therefore important to reflect on the national and cultural context in which the Reserve Bank of New Zealand exists.3  This is why we have chosen the significant Māori legend of Tāne Mahuta to tell our story during these times of change.  Central to the Māori belief system is the narrative of the earth mother / Papatūānuku and the sky father / Ranginui who needed to be separated to allow the sun to shine in so that life could flourish.   Tāne Mahuta – the god of the forest and birds – stepped up to the task and, after some false starts, achieved this with help from his wider whānau (family).4 A life of economic, social, cultural and environmental sustainability took hold. Knowledge, trade and exchange flourished, and Māori found affinity with the land, the sea, and the native flora and fauna around them.5  Thereafter, Tāne Mahuta served as the kaitiaki (guardian) of this ecosystem – protecting it against threats to its existence, and enhancing the well-being of all within it.  What does this story say about the role of the Reserve Bank and the journey of change it has embarked on?  No, we are not anointing ourselves a god. Instead we are using the legend of Tāne Mahuta to tell a story.   The establishment of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand in 1934 gave our country the flexibility and benefits of its own currency, monetary policy and financial system.  Sunshine was allowed into New Zealand’s own monetary and financial system, and the Bank was given the responsibility to act as a guardian of this system.6 I draw two significant lessons from the legend of Tāne Mahuta. First, while we all love progress, we resist change.  Just as Tāne Mahuta struggled to create change, we recognise there are many hurdles to overcome, many interests to balance, and many compromises needed to reach a collective greater good.  Sometimes change means letting go of, or carefully scrutinising, that which has worked in the past - so that we are more resilient for the future.                                                                3 The Journey of Te Pūtea Matua: Our Tāne Mahuta, Reserve Bank of New Zealand, September 2018, https://www.rbnz.govt.nz/news/2018/09/the-journey-of-te-putea-matua-our-tane-mahuta  4 Ibid. 5 Ibid. 6 For further historical background, see Wright (2006), The Policy Origins of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, RBNZ Bulletin, Vol. 69.

Page 4 of 11  Second, just like Tāne Mahuta, change cannot happen in isolation. The role of a kaitiaki is to protect.  However, the fulfilment of that role depends on the approval and help of others.   The Reserve Bank has a social license to serve as a guardian of our monetary and financial system because it is unique to the identity and heritage of New Zealand.     Te Pūtea Matua. It is New Zealand’s central bank.     The Changing Landscape of Central Banking  Let’s tie this discussion about legitimacy and institutional change to the current landscape of central banking. Over the past decade, countries have looked to central banks to mitigate the dire consequences of the global financial crisis (GFC). During, and after, the GFC, central banks around the world rallied to stabilise financial systems and provide renewed vigour to damaged economies.  This challenge remains, and securing sustainable prosperity for all requires our continued attention.   In the world today, the dynamics of global and national economies are interacting to a greater extent and, at times, working at cross-purposes.  Underlying these interactions are social and political movements driven by a desire for greater well-being, both for current and future generations.   More recently we have been confronted with the issue of climate change, and its complex and powerful economic and financial impact.  We have barely scratched the surface in understanding the intergenerational impacts of these developments. This desire for well-being is regularly reflected in discontent along the lines of economic, gender, racial, and intergenerational inequities - to name just a few. Therefore, ensuring social inclusion as a way forward in capitalist societies is necessary.  As such, these developments continuously alter the landscape in which central banks conduct their business. This is why we have been led to ponder the impact the Reserve Bank can have in securing the well-being of New Zealand’s current and future generations.  It is also useful to do so while the pervasive ill-effects of the GFC remain in our memories and continue to shape the policy landscape.       The success that central banks had in addressing the early impacts of the GFC, and their effectiveness during earlier decades in transitioning economies from high- to stable-inflation regimes, is due in large part to their ability to act decisively, within a clearly defined remit. They must continue to be empowered to do so.  The challenge for us now is a more nuanced one:7                                                             7 In New Zealand, the scope of this debate, is informed by the Bank’s remit and the letter of expectations (LoE) from the Minister of Finance to the Governor of the Reserve Bank outlining broad expectations of the Bank's relationship with the Minister and areas of particular interest. LoE 2018/19: https://www.rbnz.govt.nz/about-us/letters-of-expectations/letter-of-expectations-2018  
Page 5 of 11   Do the remits of central banks reflect the objectives most important to the welfare of their societies in the post-GFC world? And do they have the requisite policy instruments to address these objectives? 8     Are central banks using their influence in an inclusive and transparent manner befitting of the trust societies have invested in them?   Are central banks fulfilling their role as stewards of sound and efficient financial systems by creating effective regulatory regimes?   And is there alignment across a country’s economic policy establishment to offer a coherent and unified response to future crises? 9    These are hard questions that we continue to confront.  At the Reserve Bank we believe that it is timely to review our policy frameworks and the role we play in wider society to ensure we remain fit for purpose.  Over the past year, we have embarked on several review and public consultation processes. These processes – some of which are still underway – have spanned our monetary and financial policy frameworks, as well as the role of physical currency. We are not alone in conducting such reviews. Our counterparts in Sweden (Riksbank) and Norway (Norges Bank) recently have, or currently are, undertaking reviews of their monetary policy frameworks and legislation.10 11 The US Federal Reserve has initiated a review of                                                            8 Historically, central banking objectives have evolved with the wider political economy concerns faced by countries. See Smith, C, O. Aziz (2019),  Monetary Policy Objectives, Reserve Bank of New Zealand Bulletin, Vol. 82, No. 2 (forthcoming). 9 Paul Tucker argues that “[a] central bank regime for all seasons cannot be designed without a good fiscal constitution existing too. Setting boundaries to the authority of central banking needs to factor in what is on the other side of the border”, The Governance of Monetary & Financial Stability Policy, Banking Perspective, Quarter 2 2018 (http://paultucker.me/the-governance-of-monetary-and-financial-stability-policy/)  10 The Riksbank’s monetary policy was reviewed by Marvin Goodfriend and Martin King over 2010 – 2015 and a report published in 2016. The review was commissioned by the Committee on Finance of the Riksdag and made several recommendations. Following this review the Riksbank Executive Board has made several changes to its framework in May 2017, the rationale for these changes are further explained in a memorandum produced by the executive Board, and in the Riksbank Economic review. In addition, a parliamentary review of the Riksbank Act has been initiated. The recommendations from the Riksbank Act review are due no later than 31 May 2019.  11 The Norges Bank has had two reviews which have translated into changes in the Norges Bank Act, and the Regulation on Monetary Policy. The Gjedrem review was an external review conducted by the Norwegian Law Commission and chaired by a previous Governor Sevin Gjedrem.  ReFIT (Review of Flexible Inflation Targeting) was an internal review over 2013 to 2017 and explored possible improvements to the monetary policy framework in Norway. See: https://www.norges-bank.no/en/about/Research/ReFIT--Review-of-Flexible-Inflation-Targeting/ And https://www.regjeringen.no/en/aktuelt/report-of-the-law-commission-on-the-act-relating-to-norges-bank-and-the-monetary-system/id2558679/

Now enacted in law, New Zealand’s new monetary policy framework is being formally introduced on 1 April 2019.   I will now elaborate on the specifics of the revised monetary policy framework with reference to its history, locating it in the wider context of other external policy reviews and consultation processes that the Bank is involved in.   Reserve Bank Act 1989: Objectives & Accountability  The Reserve Bank Act of 1989 was introduced at a time when there was great uncertainty about economic conditions in New Zealand.  In the 1970s and 80s, our country, like many others, had adopted a variety of strategies to deal with high and volatile inflation; none were successful.  The 1989 Act gave the Reserve Bank operational independence to achieve the objective of price stability. A single decision maker model was introduced making the Governor responsible and singularly accountable for the substance of monetary policy.   The Policy Targets Agreement (PTA) between the Minister of Finance and the Governor set explicit goals for monetary policy to pursue.16  An agreement between a single decision maker and the government provided sufficient flexibility to make the appropriate revisions to the inflation target as we adjusted from high to low inflation.  Over time, there have been several revisions to the inflation target, settling in recent times on a band of 1 – 3 percent with a focus on the 2 percent midpoint.17                                                            12 Federal Reserve to review strategies, tools, and communication practices it uses to pursue its mandate of maximum employment and price stability, Press Release,  15 November 2018, (https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20181115a.htm)  13 Wilkins, C., A., Choosing the Best Monetary Policy Framework for Canada, Speech, 20 November 2018 https://www.bankofcanada.ca/2018/11/choosing-best-monetary-policy-framework-canada/  14  https://www.bankofcanada.ca/toward-2021-reviewing-the-monetary-policy-framework/ 15 Lagarde, C., The Financial Sector: Redefining a Broader Sense of Purpose, 32nd World Traders' Tacitus Lecture, London, United Kingdom, February 28, 2019 16 PTA’s were renegotiated between the Minister and Governor each time the latter was appointed or reappointed, although there is precedence to revisit the terms of the agreement during a change of government as well. 13 PTA’s were signed from 1990 onwards, each ratification reflecting incremental adjustments to inflation targets. See Wadsworth (2017), “An international comparison of inflation targeting frameworks”, RBNZ Bulletin 80(8) for more information. 17 In the versions of the PTA from 1990 to 1992, annual inflation was to be kept within a target band, initially 3 - 5 percent, then 1.5 – 3.5 percent before settling on 0 – 2 percent as inflation was initially 
Page 7 of 11  When you look at the contrast between inflation in the years before and after 1989 (figure 1), the Reserve Bank’s record of servicing its price stability objectives over the last 30 years stands on its own merit.  Figure 1: Annual CPI Inflation (target range shaded)  Source: Statistics New Zealand  Such has been the success and influence of New Zealand’s inflation targeting regime, that in 2014 – on the eve of the 25th anniversary of the Reserve Bank Act – the New York Times declared it to be “virtually an economic religion” and “global economic gospel” among the international central banking community.18 Amendment to the Reserve Bank Act  We have prospered in the certainty and security of a low and stable inflation regime for the past 30 years.  What then is the imperative for any change to the way monetary policy is conducted in New Zealand? Simply put: our Act has been amended to address emerging policy challenges, and to operate with greater transparency and accountability. To reinforce our societal legitimacy. The Reserve Bank Act now sets monetary policy with a dual mandate: to maintain price stability and support maximum sustainable employment.  The remit – which replaces the earlier PTA – provides the Bank with its specific inflation target and direction on how to consider its contribution to maximum sustainable employment.19 While unemployment is currently low in New Zealand, it is, and will continue to be, one of the defining issues of any society.                                                              brought under control. Through the mid-90’s onwards, 0 – 3 percent, then up to 1 – 3 percent (our current target) in 2002. The focus on the 2 percent midpoint was added in 2012.  18 Irwin, N., Of Kiwis and Currencies: How a 2% Inflation Target Became Global Economic Gospel, New York Times, Dec. 19, 2014. 19 The remit and charter can be accessed at: https://www.rbnz.govt.nz/monetary-policy/about-monetary-policy/monetary-policy-framework. 
Page 8 of 11  Labour market dynamics both within and across countries have changed significantly as a consequence of recent rapid globalisation, the impact of the GFC, and as ongoing technological developments have reshaped the needs of the workforce. Likewise, concerns about income and wealth inequities, low productivity growth, and the impact of population ageing, all intersect at some level with the functioning of the labour market.      Historically, the Bank has always taken labour market developments into account while formulating monetary policy.  Over time, “this has been encouraged by our increasingly flexible approach” to inflation targeting.20  The shift to a dual mandate is to acknowledge the impact monetary policy has on employment and economic activity, and also the prominence given to labour market outcomes when the Bank is formulating monetary policy.21  Our new mandate means the Bank is legally obliged to provide a more detailed assessment of, and outlook for, the labour market.22 This obligation recognises that ‘maximum sustainable employment’ cannot be measured using a single metric, and that there are limits to the degree to which monetary policy can affect employment outcomes.         Let’s now talk process. The changes enacted as part of the phase 1 review of the Reserve Bank Act made the processes and principles underlying the Bank’s earlier monetary policy decisions explicit. I mentioned that up until now the Bank had operated with a single decision maker model for monetary policy.  In reality however, successive Governors relied on internal advisory committees consisting of senior members within the ranks to discuss ideas, build consensus and guide decisions on monetary policy.23 The amendment to the Act formalises a Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) consisting of members internal and external to the Bank.24  A committee structure will add further rigour to monetary policy decisions, drawing on the diverse views and perspectives of its members.                                                               20 McDermott & Williams (2018), “Inflation targeting in New Zealand: An experience in evolution”, speech delivered to the Reserve Bank of Australia conference on central bank frameworks, in Sydney 12 April 2018. 21 The former being the stabilisation role of monetary policy. 22 Ibid. For example, the Bank has dedicated a chapter to output and employment in each Monetary Policy Statement since May 2018, and has also included tables and discussion of indicators of maximum sustainable employment.  23 This was formalised in practice, if not it law, by the creation of a Governing Committee in 2013. See Wheeler (2013) “Decision making in the Reserve Bank of New Zealand”, speech delivered to the University of Auckland Business School on 7 March 2013, and Richardson (2016) “Behind the scenes of an OCR decision in New Zealand”, RBNZ Bulletin 79(11). 24 With the majority internal (and including the Governor and Deputy Governor ex officio). 
Page 9 of 11  Figure 2: Secondary Instruments to Direct the MPC   The Act and remit set out the economic and operational objectives for the MPC respectively.  The charter governs the committee’s decision-making and ensures accountability.  The charter emphasises that the MPC should aim to reach decisions by consensus, informed by rigorous discussion taking into account a diverse range of views and perspectives on emerging issues. In the event consensus cannot be reached, each member has an equal vote to determine a decision.25   Furthermore, accompanying the remit and charter, is a code of conduct that sets the standards of ethical and professional conduct that must be adhered to by the Committee.26   All this sounds very technical, but these instruments bring to life the principles that underpin the Bank’s major monetary policy decisions.  An MPC with a diverse set of opinions that is committed to inclusive and constructive debate about important policy issues, will ultimately be of great service to New Zealand society.27  Interconnectedness of Institutions & Policy Regimes   The story of Tāne Mahuta is a metaphor for change, but also one for interconnectedness.  This is a theme I would like to end with. Each year, the Minister of Finance issues a Letter of Expectations that sets out the strategic priorities for the Reserve Bank. 28  In 2018, the Bank was given a renewed strategic direction underscoring the imperative for institutional change.  As the letter states, in fulfilling its monetary policy mandate, the Bank is expected to “support sustainable and inclusive growth”. And in promoting a sound and efficient financial system, the Bank is expected to contribute “to the living standards of New Zealanders by being a conscientious, high performing regulator”.29                                                             25 The charter refers to the provision in the Act for each member to have an equal vote to determine a decision. 26 Monetary Policy Framework, https://www.rbnz.govt.nz/monetary-policy/about-monetary-policy/monetary-policy-framework  27 Principles and processes behind monetary policy committee deliberation at the RBNZ, Forthcoming RBNZ Bulletin, Price, G., & Wadsworth, A., 2019 28 Letter of Expectations 2018/19: https://www.rbnz.govt.nz/about-us/letters-of-expectations/letter-of-expectations-2018  29 Ibid.

Page 10 of 11  The flagship strategic projects on the Bank’s current work agenda all align with the “Government’s broader economic objectives while maintaining the Bank’s operational independence”. 30 These ongoing projects at the Bank include: - the implementation of our new monetary policy framework  - the review of the Bank’s prudential and regulatory functions  - the bank capital adequacy consultation that is currently underway, and  - exploratory work on the emerging impact of technology on the Bank’s currency functions and research on digital currencies  The imperative for this work program also arises from the global policy environment that central banks are presented with: that is, balancing uncertain growth and continued low nominal interest rates - against inflated central bank balance sheets, and the ever-present threat of asset price bubbles. More specifically, as a small, open economy New Zealand is especially vulnerable to downturns in its trading partner economies. And with a high reliance on banks for overseas borrowing, we are vulnerable to the transmission of financial instability through the banking system.   This is why we are thinking holistically at the Reserve Bank about the collective impact of our various monetary, financial, and currency policy initiatives.  For example,   What effect do low nominal interest rates have on wider financial stability?   How can monetary-fiscal coordination be better managed, and in a low interest rate environment, what role will fiscal policy play in the event of a downturn? And,   Recognising that the “impact of bank failures would be broader and harsher the larger and more intertwined the failed banks are with New Zealand’s economy” what regulatory and prudential settings would mitigate the risk of failure?31    These are all immediate challenges being confronted by your team working at Te Pūtea Matua.  Furthermore, our mandate, to support sustainable and inclusive growth, and higher living standards, necessitates the Bank to work more interactively with wider society and public institutions. We will do so without loss of focus on our core activities.  Our Te Ao Māori strategy includes engagement with the ‘Māori economy’, which has undergone a rapid renaissance.32  This work is necessary and a gateway into assisting wider financial inclusion in New Zealand and the region.    We remain focused on our role in our region and the wider international economy.  The Bank is currently refreshing its international engagement strategy to give greater focus to New Zealand’s bilateral and multilateral engagements.33  We are working on our contribution to                                                            30 Ibid. 31 Bascand (2019), “Safer Banks for Greater Wellbeing”, speech delivered to the Institute for Governance and Policy Studies, Victoria University in Wellington, 26 February 2019 32 RBNZ’s Strategic Approach to Te Ao Māori, Forthcoming RBNZ Bulletin, 2019 33 One example being contributing to New Zealand’s progress towards the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Finally, underscoring our need to be a good global citizen, we have embarked on our climate change strategy, playing our part in the link between necessary global climate action and the role of the financial system.34      I want to assure you all that the Reserve Bank – Te Pūtea Matua – remains grounded and has not lost focus on its core business.   We are committed to meeting the currency needs of the people, ensuring low and stable inflation, maximising sustainable employment, and promoting a sound and efficient financial system.  These activities are necessary for economic well-being.   But, I also want to assure you we will work beyond just the ‘necessary’.   We will ensure that both ‘necessary’ and ‘sufficient’ work is done so that the Bank is best able “to promote the prosperity and well-being of New Zealanders, and contribute to a sustainable and productive economy”.35   I am told that the first step to running a marathon is to tell everyone of your intentions.  Commit.  You have just been told of our intentions to work collectively – locally, regionally, and globally – in pursuit of maximising our mandate.   We desire to be a great team and the world’s best central bank.

John A Rolle: The importance of financial inclusion in mendingsocial and economic disparitiesWelcome remarks by Mr John A Rolle, Governor of the Central Bank of The Bahamas, at theAlliance for Financial Inclusion (AFI) Convergent Meetings of the Digital Financial ServicesWorking Group and the Consumer Empowerment and Market Conduct Working Group, Nassau,26 March 2019.*   *   *Welcome to The Bahamas.We are pleased to host both the Digital Financial Services Working Group and the ConsumerEmpowerment and Market Conduct Working Group meeting in The Bahamas this week. TheCentral Bank of The Bahamas joined AFI less than one year ago, in order to benefit from astructured approach to promoting financial inclusion goals, and to learn first-hand from countriesthat are actively pursuing such ideals.The range of countries that make up this alliance illustrate aptly that financial inclusion is intendedto mend social and economic disparities that are often obscured in average measures ofeconomic wellbeing and income.The Bahamian experience draws this out.On a per capita basis, The Bahamas has the third highest GDP in the Western Hemisphere. Ourfinancial sector is highly developed, when considered in terms of the size of the deposit base andoutstanding credit of the domestic banking system, relative to GDP; and in terms of the share ofthe population that has access to basic banking services.Moreover, relative to the size of the population we enjoy the 35th highest density of bankbranches in the world and the 15th highest density of automated banking machines in the world.1From an identity perspective, members of the population do not have extreme difficultiesacquiring birth certificates or primary documentation needed to apply for identity documents.But financial access is very uneven.On many of our rural island communities basic banking services are not available, or onlyavailable in very constrained conditions. The rising costs of providing banking through traditionalphysical channels have further scaled-back this access. Also, high concentrationsSee the IMF’s 2018 Financial Access Survey Database: data.imf.org/?sk=388DFA60–1D26–4ADE-B505-A05A558D9A42. of undocumented immigrants are excluded from access tofinancial services, even when these services are available in the same spaces for documentedpersons.Equally problematic for countries like The Bahamas, there has been a dilution of access from thedisproportionate application of global anti-money laundering and counter financing of terrorismstandards, on low-risk, retail segments of our financial community. We are now attempting toreverse this through more proportionate risk-based systems.Beyond banking, affordability of access is more constrained in property insurance markets,where financial vulnerability is heightened because of the increasing frequency and intensity ofhurricanes, which can in a single season push households into ruin.Finally, relevant to the themes of consumer empowerment, we recognise the scope for improvedliteracy and conduct regulations to improve financial welfare. 1 / 2BIS central bankers' speeches
As it should be, political pressures to address financial inclusion deficits are mounting in TheBahamas, and there has to be comprehensive constructive responses. In the strategies that theBahamian Central Bank is formulating, we understand that the private sector will not optimallyachieve all of the outcomes that we desire. We recognise that an enabling environment thatembraces the aspirations of the Maya Declaration, with a focus on Fintech, to promote digitalinclusion is critical.This is defining very critical elements of our approach.However, we also have to identify those elements of both the policy space and technologyinfrastructure that ought to be supplied by the public sector. For example, the Central Bank ofThe Bahamas is engaged in the creation and promotion of a digital version of the nationalcurrency which is expected to close vital payments system gaps for The Bahamas that manycountries are able to leave up to the private sector to resolve. At the same time, the Bank hasvolunteered to coordinate development of a national financial inclusion strategy that would enlistall relevant stakeholders, and focus on more than just payments and banking.We are already seeing the benefits of our membership in the AFI, in bringing sharper focus to ourfinancial inclusion initiatives. In that spirit, we look forward to a continued build out of this networkof peers, capturing all of the accessible knowledge and experiences that you have to offer.Coming into these working group meetings I expect that we have broadly similar goals, andexpectations; and that there will be mutual gains from our exchanges over the next four days.Indeed, we have two very stimulating agendas.As we have received you as our guests, we hope too that you will find time to experience asampling of our culture and the beauty of our people and country.Welcome again and my best wishes for a productive week! 2 / 2BIS central bankers' speeches
Yandraduth Googoolye: Blockchain technology’s potential tobenefit society and the economySpeech by Mr Yandraduth Googoolye, Governor of the Bank of Mauritius, Prelude to Banquet inthe context of the ADC Global Blockchain Summit, Adelaide, 27 March 2019.*   *   *Honourable Steven Marshall, Premier of South AustraliaMajor General the Honourable Michael Jeffery, Forum PatronExcellenciesLadies and gentlemenAll protocol observedGood EveningI feel truly privileged to address such a distinguished audience.I would like to thank the Honourable Steven Marshall and the Australian Davos Connection for theinvitation which gives us such a unique opportunity to attend this ADC Global Blockchain Summitin Adelaide, the gem of South Australia.South Australia is a region that is known for its proverbial welcome and hospitality.  It is a regionthat is not only culturally and aesthetically marvellous but which also has to its credit someastonishing feats.Astonishing indeed is one of the anecdotes I have come across with regard to South Australia:  Ido not think that there is in this second millennium, any other place in the world where the iconicCoca-Cola has been outsold by 3 to 1 by the Farmers Union Iced Coffee. I hope there is somearound as I definitely look forward to having a sip of this beverage.Ladies and Gentleman, I shall now get back to the reason behind this august gathering, the ADCGlobal Blockchain Summit.  This platform stands out by the fact that it has brought togetherworld leading entrepreneurs, financiers, regulators, researchers, innovators and businessleaders to focus on strategies and practical applications for business growth.From what I have gathered, this is the largest and highest level of speakers ever assembled inSouth Australia for a Blockchain event involving C-level, owner, entrepreneur and minister levelparticipation from over 30 countries across various geographies.It is a privilege that we shall, across the days, hear and learn from the most respected authoritiesworldwide all that needs to be understood on one of the most intriguing yet promisingtechnological breakthroughs… I am referring to blockchain…Ladies and gentlemen, blockchain technology has tremendous potential to positively impact thesocial and economic landscapes.  Its attributes are several. Its feature of full transparencyacross networks makes blockchain stand out as one of the most likable and adaptabletechnologies out of different technologies available in the market. Add to this the element ofrobust security that makes blockchain networks virtually impermeable and you have a solutionthat simply stands out as the most favourable digital value-based technology.For me, as a central banker, there is one aspect of blockchain that I am very eager tounderstand. It is the fact that blockchain, by mitigating the burden on the financial industry, is agame changer in an environment where traditional financial transaction models are quiteexpensive. 1 / 2BIS central bankers' speeches
This shift in concept and the new patterns of behaviour and business this will create, is of topicalsignificance, the more so that we are stepping in the second generation of the internet which,from what we can foresee, will significantly bring down transaction costs within the banking andfinance industry.Alex and Don Tapscott, the world-renowned authors of the seminal book ‘The BlockchainRevolution’, have been adamant to underline that blockchain goes far beyond the second phaseof the internet.Allow me to emphasize Alex Tapscott’s view that, I quote,” With its advent, we will not need totrust each other in the traditional sense, because trust is built into the system itself.” Unquote.Just imagine exploring myriads of opportunities that blockchain is already opening up… Thisbeing said, the world is far from being filled with selfless individuals and we unfortunately mustalso come to terms with the fact that the genie is out of the bottle and that its powers must beproperly harnessed if we want them to be used constructively.Ladies and gentlemen, I am sure that I am not the only one within the audience for whom theADC Global Blockchain Summit is key to understanding the way forward regarding not only thebenefits and application but also the regulation of blockchain technology.This is of utmost importance if, like me, you are steering a central bank in a small island nationthat endeavours to use technology to build a better, brighter and more inclusive tomorrow for itspeople. At the Bank, we have set up a dedicated Blockchain Committee to see how best we canuse this innovative technology to pave the way for a modern banking landscape.Mauritius, where I come from, is working hard to give itself the means to achieve its socio-economic ambitions by exploring the potential of fintech for shaping an innovative banking andfinancial services industry.The Mauritian Government has set up a Regulatory Committee on Fintech and Innovation-drivenFinancial Services.  Another high-level team is also working on a strategic blueprint for financialservices with the support of world-acclaimed experts.May I take the liberty of paying tribute to two of these respected authorities who happen to be withus tonight… I have named Ms Loretta Joseph and Lord Meghnad Desai…Ladies and Gentlemen, I am certain that this ADC Blockchain Summit will provide us all with theanswers we are hoping for and that this unique platform will help us forge mutually beneficialrelationships between stakeholders and participants.I once again wish to thank the Honourable Premier Steven Marshall and the Honourable MichaelJeffery as well as the ADC organising team and sponsors for their priceless initiative andendorsement. I look forward to learning and discovering as much as I can on a technology that isset to take on the world.On this, Ladies and Gentlemen, I thank you for your attention. 2 / 2BIS central bankers' speeches
Yves Mersch: Necessity, proportionality and probity – central bankindependence in unconventional timesSpeech by Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, at theconference “The ECB and its watchers XX”, Frankfurt am Main, 27 March 2019.*   *   *IntroductionThe benefits of central bank independence have been established and demonstrated time andagain. Inflation is costly. History shows that governments lack the credibility to commit to time-consistent monetary policy, and often subordinate it to other priorities. Faced with elections,governments are tempted to boost short-term growth by stoking unexpected inflation. But in thelong run, this just raises inflation expectations without any benefit to growth. By delegatingmonetary policy to an independent, accountable central bank with a narrow mandate for pricestability, democracies have found a way to reduce costly inflation without incurring output lossesover the medium term.Despite this successful track record – or perhaps because of it – central bank independence hasbeen recently questioned. In particular, it is argued that central bank independence is onlyjustified if distributional effects are comparatively small. Critics claim that unconventionalmeasures have large distributional effects across households, industrial sectors and evencountries, and thus stray into the realms of economic and fiscal policy.This debate has led to a wealth of academic literature being published on the ideal conditions fordelegating powers and coordination between policies. To be clear from the outset: it is the taskof safeguarding the purchasing power of the currency that requires shelter from politicalinfluence. The same degree of independence is not necessarily justified for other policy areasentrusted to central banks that lie beyond this mandate.That is why I have repeatedly encouraged a functional approach to the concept ofindependence.Given my audience today, I will not discuss microprudential supervision or financial stabilityconsiderations. Instead, I will focus on practical advice on how we should act in the currentenvironment to best achieve our primary mandate and preserve independence – independencethat remains necessary to ensure long-run price stability.In this vein, I believe there are three watchwords that should guide our actions: necessity,proportionality and probity – as several judicial reviews have confirmed.NecessityTo put these watchwords in context, let me recall the economic conditions at the time the ECBdecided to implement unconventional measures.The euro area economy had undergone a double-dip recession. Inflation outcomes flirted withdeflation, and there were signs that inflation expectations were becoming de-anchored. Thetransmission of monetary policy across the whole euro area was impaired. Fiscal policy offeredlittle by way of countercyclical stabilisation. Traditional monetary policy had reached its limits,with nominal interest rates close to zero and some contemporary measures of real equilibriuminterest rates below zero.The choice for the ECB at the time was stark. We could either restrict ourselves to conventional123456 1 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
monetary policy, and fail to fulfil our price stability mandate. Or we could implementunconventional measures, and respect our mandate.I would argue that there was no real choice.The Treaty affords us broad discretion in our choice of tools to honour our price stabilitymandate. But it offers no discretion whatsoever in the choice of whether or not we fulfil thatmandate. These are the only conditions under which central bank independence is sustainable.That is the essence of my first watchword – necessity. By carrying out monetary policy using arange of additional tools that were legally available to us – and used successfully by other centralbanks in advanced economies – the ECB supported the recovery and helped ensure a sustainedadjustment in the path of inflation. We would not have managed this without unconventionalmeasures. I do not believe that central bank independence is sustainable if unelectedbureaucrats refuse to take the actions necessary to honour their legal mandate.It is true that some of these tools have been unpopular, but central banks are no strangers tounpopularity. Indeed, if acting in the best interests of long-term prosperity were always popular,monetary policy could safely be left in the hands of politicians.ProportionalityBut does necessity mean that all actions are justified when pursuing our price stability mandate?The short answer is no.Policymakers need to take into account not just the impact their tools have for their primarypurpose, but also any potential side effects. Policy needs to maintain proportionality – my secondwatchword for today.Proportionality is one of the basic legal principles of the architecture of the European Union. It isenshrined in the foundational Treaties and demands that the content and form of Union actionshould not exceed what is necessary to achieve the objectives of the Treaties. For monetarypolicy, proportionality implies that the ECB’s actions must, first, be suitable to address theidentified risks to price stability. Second, the ECB’s measures must be necessary to achievetheir intended objective. In other words, alternative monetary policy measures that entail morelimited action would not enable the objective to be achieved as effectively and rapidly. Third,proportionality stricto sensu implies that the expected benefits of the ECB’s actions mustoutweigh their costs.These principles provide for a hierarchy of tools, where unconventional measures should beused only once conventional measures have been exhausted.Let me address, then, the criticism that the distributional consequences of unconventionalmonetary policy undermine central bank independence.It is worth recalling that monetary policy always has distributional effects.Cutting short-term interest rates tends to reduce the income of savers and boost the income ofdebtors and the wealth of asset holders. It also affects incomes through the macroeconomiceffects on employment and wages. In short, not only does conventional monetary policy havedistributional effects, it partly works through causing them. In normal times, these effects areviewed as being of secondary importance to the aggregate welfare benefits of price stability. Inother words, they are proportionate.Moreover, any distributional consequences of monetary policy action need to be set against thedistributional consequences of inaction. Sudden, unexpected deflation has distributional7 2 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
consequences. Ten million more people are now employed in the euro area than whenunemployment peaked – this number would be much smaller had the ECB not acted, eventhough we only have a narrow mandate to maintain price stability that does not coveremployment.The ECB also attempted to minimise unwanted side effects by carefully designing our tools. Forexample, it became clear that our asset purchase programme (APP) was contributing tochallenging conditions in the repo market. By the end of 2016, around half of Germangovernment bonds were trading “special” – that is, at a premium to general collateral. Wemodified our securities lending programme, including by accepting cash as collateral, to mitigatethe impact of the APP on repo markets. Today, the share of specials is generally below 10%.In general, prevention is better than cure. That’s why we established many safeguards andrestrictions, particularly in our public sector purchase programme, to avoid interfering with fiscaland economic policy and providing monetary financing to governments. The stringent eligibilitycriteria and issue and issuer limits are examples of self-imposed restrictions which have beenvetted by the European Court of Justice. Independence and the prohibition of monetary financingprevent central banks from behaving as a fiscal substitute.We have also increased transparency and enhanced accountability measures – the necessarycounterparts of independence. Notably, this includes publishing the accounts of the monetarypolicy discussion in the Governing Council.The takeover of banking supervision was accompanied by additional and more far-reachingaccountability obligations, such as the Interinstitutional Agreement with the European Parliamentand a number of memoranda of understanding with other institutions. A separation principle wasestablished; and supervision does not have broad regulatory powers like in monetary policy.So while our unconventional measures undoubtedly have side effects, the essential point is thatthese side effects are not manifestly disproportionate to the primary objective of the measures –contributing to price stability. But we have to continuously monitor the ongoing appropriateness ofour measures in order to preserve the balance between costs and benefits. And while thegrowing number of new tools and activities has moved the actions of the central bank closer toother policy realms, the boundary was never crossed – as confirmed by the European Court ofJustice. Therefore, the use of such measures during the crisis does not represent a break withthe framework that justifies central bank independence.But we continue to assess the impact of our measures, and of negative interest rates inparticular, on areas such as bank profitability, and to consider whether our mix of policymeasures remains suitable and proportionate.ProbityMy final watchword refers not to how policymakers conduct policy, but to their personal conduct.At a time of increased external pressure on central banks, it is important that policymakers actwith probity.The Treaty affords significant personal independence to members of the ECB’s GoverningCouncil. These provisions play a vital role in our unique institutional framework, since monetarypolicy must be appropriate for euro area-wide conditions, which may be different from theconditions in a policymaker’s home country. By providing strong protections for sitting GoverningCouncil members, the Treaty aims to isolate them from political pressure.These protections also come with an obligation to act in a responsible manner at all times.Inappropriate behaviour by policymakers can damage the reputation of central banks and beused by politicians to build a narrative against independence. This is why we publish the89 3 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
calendars of the members of the Executive Board, as well as their speaking points when talkingbehind closed doors. In the long run, we can only remain isolated from political pressure if weseparate ourselves from political debate.ConclusionThe multiple crises of recent years have forced the ECB to venture into unknown territory to fulfilits primary mandate.Undesirable but unavoidable side effects of monetary policy measures and the expansion of ouractivities into the vicinity of other policy areas have led to attacks on the ECB’s independence.Although the highest Court confirmed that the unconventional measures taken by the ECB werelegal, the subjective – albeit erroneous – impression of a breach of mandate has been enough totrigger increased political pressure.The best protection against – unjustified – attacks on the independence of monetary policy istherefore a narrower mandate combined with a high degree of transparency and the strictinterpretation of legal limits. In this respect, a broader mandate in some jurisdictions warrants aclear distinction between government tasks and ancillary central bank tasks. As to supervisionoperational autonomy is of the essence but of a nature that is functionally determined. Monetarypolicy independence extends indeed to a broader regulation power and a role as “guardian of theTreaty”.For monetary policy this does not mean, however, that we will inevitably and over-hastily return tothe limited set of instruments and the balance sheet size of the pre-crisis period. Regulatorychanges and the enduring fragmentation of European financial markets may in the future requiresome adjustments to our operational framework for monetary policy within our well-establishedstrategy. However, whatever a future monetary policy framework may look like, it must be basedexclusively on the price stability mandate and set up within legal limits.Costs of inflation include the sub-optimal allocation of goods and activities, so-called shoe leather costs,distortions to the tax system and costs associated with the de-anchoring of inflation expectations.

Randal K Quarles: The Financial Stability Board in 2019Speech by Mr Randal K Quarles, Vice Chairman for Supervision of the Board of Governors of theFederal Reserve System, at the Joint Conference of the European Central Bank and the Journalof Money, Credit, and Banking, Frankfurt am Main, 28 March 2019.*   *   *It is a pleasure to be here today at the European Central Bank in my capacity as chair of theFinancial Stability Board (FSB) to help celebrate the Journal of Money, Credit and Banking’s(JMCB) 50th anniversary. The broad scope of the JMCB, and the diversity of its scholarshipparallels, in some ways, the FSB itself. As we dealt with the global financial crisis, the heads ofstate and government of the G20 tasked the FSB with identifying and addressing vulnerabilities inthe global financial system and developing stronger regulatory and supervisory policies to createa more resilient global financial system in the pursuit of financial stability. Our broad mandate hasconsiderable overlap with the fields that the JMCB covers within its pages. The FSB includes 24jurisdictions and 73 representatives, including all the members of the G20. Also similar to theJMCB, the FSB is celebrating an anniversary this year, with its creation having occurred 10 yearsago. We are a far cry from the JMCB’s 50 years, but I hope that in time our continuing work—andnot just our response to the late crisis—will prove valuable enough that we one day merit asimilar celebration.I am especially pleased to speak at this conference today because the FSB welcomes andencourages the participation of the academic community in tackling issues of global financialstability. I would like to see a greater and more direct contribution of academic subject-matterexperts to our work. You may have noticed that the FSB sent out a call for nominations lastmonth for academics to advise our work in evaluating post-crisis reforms—in this particularinstance, the evaluation that will examine the effects of the too-big-to-fail reform package that theG20 endorsed in 2010 and that the FSB and other standard setters have implemented sincethen. In our initiatives to examine the consequences of post-crisis reform, the academiccommunity can help advance the field with analytical tools and critical insight.The financial crisis exposed fault lines in the financial system that had to be addressedimmediately, comprehensively, and vigorously. The body of post-crisis regulation that resultedwas founded on the work of academics, including important papers published in the JMCB, andinvolved the energy and efforts of many standard setters, regulators, supervisors, and centralbanks. It was an exemplary feat of cooperation and coordination, and it has unquestionably madethe financial system safer and more resilient.Today, the post-crisis reform agenda has been largely completed. Basel III is final, the largestglobal banks have substantially more capital and liquidity, over-the-counter derivatives marketsare safer, and steps have been taken to address the risks of too-big-to-fail institutions. Throughgreater monitoring and policy measures, the FSB is addressing risks from nonbank financialintermediation. And there has been remarkable progress on the difficult and unglamorous task ofestablishing workable resolution regimes that are consistent with the FSB’s clearly definedprinciples. While we must still work to ensure full, timely, and consistent implementation of theagreed reforms, it is time for the FSB to turn more of its energy and attention to the future.In my time with you today, I would like to do two things. First, I would like to share with you myview on how the work of the FSB must evolve if we are to merit that future celebration and someof the core principles that I think should inform that work. After discussing those principles, I wantto focus your attention on some of the work priorities that the FSB will be addressing throughout2019 and beyond, including nonbank financing, fintech, and evaluating the too-big-to-fail reforms.Core Principles 1 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
Let me turn to the core principles—engagement, rigor, and analysis. These core principlesreflect goals that are both inward and outward looking. From within, FSB members have theoccasion to reflect on how our work is executed—that is, we must ask ourselves how we canaccomplish our mission more effectively, improving the financial sector’s ability to supporteconomic growth without threatening financial stability. Outwardly, we will endeavor to reach outto a greater number of constituents and stakeholders for their input on the important financialstability issues they are encountering. This is also a good time to inform a wider public audienceon the nature of our mission in a clear, articulate, and jargon-free manner.EngagementAs the FSB pivots away from the urgency of post-crisis reform development, it is an opportunetime to improve our efforts at effective engagement. Recognizing the wide-reaching effects of itswork, the FSB must seek input from a broad range of stakeholders, each of whom brings adifferent perspective to the issues under consideration. While we are directly accountable to theG20, we are, through the G20, accountable to all of the people affected by our actions. In myview, that means we must engage in genuine, substantial dialogue with all of these stakeholders,to a greater and more effective degree than we have in the past.To start, we can strengthen the role of the six regional groups that are a part of the FSBorganization. In 2011, the FSB established six consultative groups representing large regions ofthe globe—the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and North Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa, theCommonwealth of Independent States, and Asia. The intent was to expand its outreach programbeyond the membership in a systematic manner to better reflect the FSB’s global mission. Eachgroup meets once or twice a year and helps the FSB obtain broader input into its policydevelopment agenda. These groups should be re-engineered to not only promote implementationof international policy initiatives within their respective regions, but also to be in a strong positionto keep abreast of developments in financial markets and thus inform FSB policy. We haveinitiated a study of the operations of the regional groups that will help inform us on ways toupgrade their effectiveness as an outreach and feedback mechanism. I am particularly interestedin how we can take lessons learned from this study to move forward with our enhancedengagement.Engagement outside of the FSB is also very important to our mission. We currently engage withbusinesses, institutions, market participants, and academics on much of our FSB work. Forexample, we have in the past conducted public consultations on FSB policy recommendations,albeit sometimes with very short timetables. We have now established an expectation that publicconsultation will be at least 60 days. We need to give the public adequate time to comment onFSB proposals, which can, at times, be quite complex.Beyond public consultation, we must convene more meetings with the private sector andacademic community to build a more robust and meaningful dialogue. For example, we kickedoff the work we have undertaken at the behest of the Japanese G20 Presidency to studydifferences in regulatory environments and market conditions across jurisdictions that may havefinancial stability implications—often referred to as “market fragmentation"—by hosting aworkshop with key stakeholders and academics. This was quite successful, and I look forward tosuch interactions being the rule. In addition, we need to improve our interaction and cooperationwith other standard-setting bodies, such as the Basel Committee, the Committee on Paymentsand Market Infrastructure, the International Association of Insurance Supervisors, and theInternational Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO). While we have worked togetherin the past, we all owe it to the global community to seek out opportunities for improvedcooperation and engagement.To improve FSB transparency, we will be taking a number of important steps. For example, onFebruary 12, 2019, the FSB published a comprehensive work program on its website for the year1 2 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
ahead. This is the first time in the FSB’s history that the work program was disseminatedpublicly. Over the term of my chairmanship, I will continue to look for steps that will allow allstakeholders to have a more open window into the FSB’s decisionmaking process and products.I believe improved transparency into the FSB process is critical to our mission. I’m reminded ofLord Hewart’s famous—and oft-quoted—remark concerning the importance of jurisprudence tothe public: “Not only must justice be done; it must also be seen to be done.” We should be ableto apply this concept to the field of global financial standard setting.Rigorous VigilanceThe second principle I would like to discuss concerns how we assess and mitigate vulnerabilitiesin the global financial system. The post-crisis reforms addressed the fault lines that led to thecrisis and the contagion effects felt around the world, but they will never replace the need forvigilance. If we are not rigorously vigilant, we still risk another crisis. What we need are forward-looking methodologies that use the most advanced analytical tools to spot vulnerabilities well inadvance before they lead to widespread financial distress and economic costs. Here theacademic community can continue to contribute with cutting-edge and robust modelingtechniques.We can only mitigate financial vulnerabilities if we identify them accurately and in a timelymanner. As such, the FSB’s Standing Committee on Assessment of Vulnerabilities under theleadership of FSB Vice Chair Klaas Knot of the Dutch National Bank will be directing aconsiderable amount of energy to developing a cutting-edge framework for the identification andassessment of financial vulnerabilities. Again, the principles of transparency and engagement willshape the work of the group. It is important that a wide spectrum of financial participants bebrought into the process, from banks and nonbank financial institutions to financial regulators tonational authorities and multilateral standard-setting bodies and the broad academic community.This task is essential to the mission of the FSB; financial developments move at a rapid pace,and being able to quickly and accurately assess vulnerabilities is essential if we are to take actionto prevent future crises.AnalysisFinally, the FSB members must employ a critical eye toward the effects of the regulations thathave been put in place. Many of the reforms have been in place long enough for them to beevaluated. We can judge whether reforms are having their intended effects and making thefinancial system more resilient. Are any regulatory reforms causing unintended, adverse effects?Can we achieve the same, strong level of financial resilience with reforms that are more efficient,simple, transparent, and tailored? The FSB must champion efficient and effective regulation inorder to maintain public support for the progress we have made.Key Pieces of the FSB’s Work PlanNow I would like to turn to three prominent issues on the FSB’s agenda in 2019. I will start withtwo relatively new issues that continue to evolve and grow in sophistication: nonbank financingand fintech, and then I will turn to the important work we are beginning on evaluating the effects ofreforms aimed at ending too big to fail.FintechI will loosely define fintech as technology-enabled financial innovation that results in materialchanges to the provision of financial services. As is often the case when technological innovationmeets established business, fintech has attracted a great deal of attention, ranging from utopianclaims to hostile skepticism. Claims about fintech’s promise abound: it has the power andpotential to reduce economic inequality, increase financial inclusion, and boost economic growth.1 3 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
Through the introduction of new methodologies, greater information curation, and reduction inprocessing costs, fintech could potentially reduce financial volatility and vulnerabilities.We are already seeing significant changes to how many people around the world obtain financialservices. For example, in Kenya, a mobile payments technology has introduced mobile wallets tomillions of people, many of whom never had a bank account. In the United States, the largestmortgage provider is an online lender. In China, a technology firm started the world’s largestmoney market fund.Yet, alongside this growth in fintech, as my predecessor as FSB chair emphasized, we asregulators must ensure that as we maximize the potential benefits in the development of fintechwe minimize the potential risks and costs. The FSB monitors and analyzes the financial stabilityimplications of financial innovation as part of our mandate to identify and address vulnerabilities inthe global financial system. Let me outline two areas that we have started to examine in greaterdetail: the potential effects from the entry of large technology firms into financial services and thepotential effects from the growth in decentralized financial technologies.Over the last decade, the world has witnessed an explosion of large technology firms that areweaving themselves into our daily lives: for example, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Tencent, andBaidu. Some of these firms are increasingly providing some financial services, such aspayments, credit, insurance, and asset management. Their involvement can support financialservices broadly. For example, their technology may increase speed and efficiency, and theubiquity of their presence in our lives may allow them to offer financial services in a moreconvenient way or at lower cost to consumers. Further, as they are only dipping their toes intothe edges of the financial services water, the effects they have on the provision of financialservices could grow enormously if they were to dive in.Looking at the technologies that underlie some of the recent innovative financial products, we seea move toward decentralization—that is, a movement toward technologies that connect financialmarket participants directly without an intermediary. The potential areas of impact are broad:settling interbank payments; verifying and reconciling trade finance invoices; executing, enforcingand verifying the performance of contracts; and keeping an audit trail to deter money laundering.Both the potential entry of large, established technology companies into financial services andthe ability of technology to decentralize financial transactions raise a number of issues, some ofwhich may touch on financial stability. Technological innovation offers the promise of asubstantially more efficient financial system. But new systems, processes, and types ofbusinesses will bring with them novel fragilities. We continue to be responsible for ensuring thatthe financial system be sufficiently resilient that businesses and households worldwide need notfear the collapse of the system that serves their needs.These are open questions that need to be addressed, and because they touch on issues offinancial stability, the FSB is putting significant resources into understanding these potentiallyimportant developments. To be clear, we are not trying to oppose innovation, because innovation,including fintech, offers the world many potential benefits. As the group charged with ensuringfinancial stability, however, we have to work to ensure that we can reap the benefits offered bythese new technologies without harming financial stability. We hope to offer some answers tothese questions in the coming years and to do so in line with the principles I outlined earlier. Wewill address the questions with discipline and analytical rigor in a way that incorporates the viewsof the public and key stakeholders and that results in answers that are practical and intelligible.Nonbank Financial IntermediationThe second issue I would like to discuss is nonbank financing. Since the global financial crisis,nonbank financing has grown relatively rapidly, in both its absolute size and its relativeimportance in intermediating credit. In the jurisdictions that the FSB closely monitors, nonbank 4 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
financial assets are just under 50 percent of total global financial assets, a share that has grownby close to 5 percentage points since 2009. Nonbank financial intermediation (the artist formerlyknown as “shadow banking”) provides a valuable alternative to bank financing and helps tosupport real economic activity. Accordingly, the shift within the financial system toward nonbankfinancing represents a welcome increase in the diversity of the sources of lending to both firmsand households.Even though the core of the financial system is much more resilient than before the globalfinancial crisis, with strengthened bank capital and liquidity requirements, nonbank financing hasbeen a source of systemic risk. Nonbank financing often features high leverage, maturity andliquidity mismatches, opaque structures, and concentrated holdings of risky assets. Nonbankfinancing can also lead to lower lending standards, bidding up the price of risky assets andsending an encouraging signal to credit underwriters. All of these channels played a role in therecent global financial crisis. More recently, new forms of interconnectedness between nonbankfinancial firms and the banking system have emerged that could, in some scenarios, act aschannels for domestic and cross-border amplification of risks.Given these potential risks, and the large—and increasing—role for nonbank financing, we needto monitor closely its development. Is the growth of nonbank financing altering the existing marketstructures? Are there new vulnerabilities in the financial system? How will nonbank financingdevelop?To answer these important questions, the FSB is progressing on three related tracks. First, theFSB produces an annual report that outlines the developments in nonbank financing, detailing theglobal trends and potential risks. Second, the FSB promotes the resilience of nonbanks throughthe development of a range of policies to address systemic vulnerabilities where they arise, whilenot impeding the growth of sustainable nonbank financing models. In this way, we hope topromote resilient nonbank financial intermediation. The FSB, working alongside other standard-setting bodies such as the Basel Committee and IOSCO, is monitoring the implementation ofthese policies. Finally, knowing it is arrogant to expect that we got everything right the first timearound, it is imperative that we start analyzing the effectiveness of the policies that have beenimplemented. How should we alter our policies? Have we modelled the risks from nonbankfinancing accurately? Have we missed a crucial new source of systemic risk? These are allquestions that we must ask ourselves.Evaluation of Too-Big-To-Fail ReformsThe third issue that I would like to raise is the problem of “too big to fail"—that is, the perceptionby investors that some institutions will receive support from their governments if they becomedistressed. This weakens market discipline and allows such firms to become even larger, moreleveraged and more complex. To address this challenge, the FSB and other global standardsetters developed a framework and a set of policy measures intended to reduce the moralhazard risks posed by systemically important financial institutions. These measures are intendedto make the financial system more resilient, for example through higher capital and liquidityrequirements, while simultaneously allowing these institutions to fail without causing disruption tocritical services, such as payments. A key element of the FSB’s policy measures to address toobig to fail is its total loss absorbing capacity standard. Under this standard, the FSB introduced abail-in (in contrast to a bailout) strategy that necessarily employs a gone concern or post-failureloss-absorbing and recapitalization capacity for the set of global systemically important banks.Crucially, by raising resolution standards, we have improved the potential for non-disruptive bankfailure. The implementation of these standards is most advanced in the banking sector,especially for the largest globally important banks. The FSB established crisis managementgroups, collections of supervisors who monitor resolution plans of the firms. At the same time,we must be conscious that we have not actually tested the failure of a large bank in the 5 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
marketplace—surely a good thing!Standing over a decade on from the start of the financial crisis, we must ask ourselves, howeffective have we been at reducing the problem of too big to fail? Have we achieved our objectiveto reduce or eliminate the problem? Have we introduced new unintended risks to the financialsystem or costs to other financial market participants?To start answering these important questions, as part of its broader effort to evaluate the effectsof reforms, the FSB is launching an evaluation of the effects of these too-big-to-fail reforms. Weintend to bring analytical rigor to these questions, and we recognize that the academiccommunity has undertaken much work in this area. As a result, we will draw extensively onacademic advisors during all phases of the work we are undertaking. I also encourage otherexperts in this field to look closely to the consultative document that will be coming from the studynext year. We welcome the input as we undertake the study of this signature issue from thecrisis.ConclusionLet me conclude by reiterating some of the broad themes I intended to convey today. First, Itouched on some of the key principles that I hope will guide the FSB work while I am chair. Thoseprinciples include expanded engagement with a broad range of stakeholders and experts,rigorous and careful examination of financial vulnerabilities that may threaten our financialsystem, and analytical examination of past reforms to ensure that they are making the financialsystem as resilient as it can be in the most efficient manner possible.Second, I shared some of the key questions we are working on relating to the rise of largetechnology firms in the financial sector and decentralized financial technologies, the growingimportance of the nonbank financial sector, and our burgeoning efforts to look at how well wehave addressed too big to fail, the signature issue of the recent financial crisis.Moving forward there will surely be additional issues to address and areas to examine.a Duringmy time as chair of the FSB, I hope to make progress not only on the areas I have outlined but ona range of forward-looking issues and continue to demonstrate the value of the FSB. Internationalstandard-setting bodies serve an important role within our global financial sector, and I lookforward to the FSB advancing our progress and work in these areas.The document is available at www.fsb.org/2019/02/fsb-work-programme-for-2019/11 6 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
Richard H Clarida: Global shocks and the US economySpeech by Mr Richard H Clarida, Vice Chairman of the Board of Governors of the FederalReserve System, at "The Euro Area: Staying the Course through Uncertainties" BDFSymposium and 34th SUERF Colloquium, sponsored by the Bank of France and the EuropeanMoney and Finance Forum, Paris, 28 March 2019.*   *   *Good afternoon. It is a pleasure to be here at the Banque de France and take part in thisimportant symposium on the “Euro Area: Staying the Course through Uncertainties."Both in the financial press and in international policy circles, one hears a great deal about thespillovers of U.S. monetary policy to other economies. One hears somewhat less, though, abouthow global shocks affect the U.S. economy. So, in my remarks today, I will discuss how theU.S. economy’s increasing integration with the rest of the world has made it more exposed toforeign shocks, and I will focus in particular on the channels of transmission through which theseshocks operate. I will close with a few words on current prospects, in which global crosscurrentsare again posing challenges for the U.S. economy and monetary policy.Greater Integration between the United States and the Rest of the WorldThe U.S. economy’s integration with the rest of the world, both in terms of trade and finance, hasrisen substantially over the past 60 years. Since the 1960s, both U.S. exports and imports haveabout tripled as a share of gross domestic product (GDP), with their sum now about 30 percentof GDP—still relatively small by international standards, but certainly notable.Financial linkages have grown enormously as well. The United States has had open capitalmarkets for a long time, but the sum of U.S. external assets and liabilities has grown from about25 percent of GDP in 1960 to more than 300 percent today. And, reflecting the greater integrationof global financial markets, the correlation of U.S. and foreign equity and bond markets hastrended broadly upward for several decades.Channels of Transmission of Global Shocks to the U.S. EconomyThis increased integration I have described has heightened the exposure of the U.S. economy toexternal shocks. But what are the channels of transmission of these shocks to the UnitedStates?For concreteness, let us consider the case of a negative demand shock originating abroad, suchas a foreign recession. First, this shock affects the United States through direct trade links,lowering demand for U.S. exports and, thus, lowering U.S. GDP.Second, the foreign recession leads to lower interest rates abroad and, other things being equal,raises the value of the dollar, which in turn lowers U.S. exports and boosts U.S. imports. Thedollar appreciation also puts downward pressure on U.S. import prices and, thereby, inflation.The extent to which foreign worries lead to safe-haven flows may add to the dollar’s strength.Finally, there is contagion to U.S financial markets. Let me first elaborate on the exchange ratechannel I just mentioned. The traditional determinants of exchange rates—that is, differentials inexpected rates of return—apply to the United States as to other countries. But the U.S. economyis different because of the special role of U.S. government bonds as global safe assets. As aconsequence, an adverse foreign shock that damped the demand for risky assets would beexpected to trigger safe-haven flows that boost the dollar, weighing on the U.S. economy. Thespillover of risk aversion to U.S. markets might well also push down equity prices and widen1234 1 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
corporate credit spreads, adding to the contractionary pressures. However, the same safe-havenflows into Treasury securities would cause U.S. long-term yields to fall, mitigating these adverseeffects on domestic demand and activity.Historical ExperienceLet us consider some historical examples of the effect of adverse foreign shocks on the U.S.economy. The Mexican peso crisis of 1994 and ‘95 and the Asian financial crisis of 1997 through‘98 resulted in substantial hits to aggregate emerging market economy (EME) growth, but theyhad fairly muted effects on U.S. growth. In part, this limited response in previous decadesreflected the smaller share of the EMEs in the global economy and, as a related matter, in U.S.trade. Furthermore, the weight of EMEs in the global financial system was lighter in previousdecades, so their crises were less disruptive to global markets. Finally, even back then, thesafe-haven flows into dollar assets that I highlighted earlier were an important mitigating factor,pushing down U.S. long-term yields. To be sure, the Russian default of August 1998, followed bythe collapse of Long-Term Capital Management, had more-substantial effects on global marketsand posed greater risk to the U.S. economy, which triggered a policy response by the Fed inwhich the federal funds rate was cut 75 basis points between September and November of thatyear. Of note, after economic prospects appeared to stabilize, the Fed reversed those cuts in1999.In recent times, global shocks have also been consequential for U.S. economic prospects andmonetary policy. Examples include the 2011–13 euro-zone recession and the China devaluationand capital flight episode of 2015 and ‘16, when worries about a hard landing and renminbidepreciation, respectively, roiled world markets. Both of these shocks originated in economieswith large footprints in the global economy and financial system, and, as a result, they inducedsubstantial disruptions in global financial markets. During both episodes, U.S. stock markets felland the dollar appreciated, especially during 2015 and 2016. As ever, these negative shockswere associated with safe-haven flows that pushed U.S. Treasury yields down. Despite thedrop in yields, overall financial conditions in the United States tightened, weighing on aggregatedemand.Yet, in these episodes, accommodative policy responses in the United States helped ward offactual contractions of U.S. activity. During the 2011–13 euro-zone recession, the United Stateswas already pursuing very accommodative policies in the wake of the Global Financial Crisis, butthe timing of the maturity extension program and the third phase of U.S. quantitative easingsuggests they were helpful responses to the spillovers to the United States from this downturn.For the China episode of 2015 and ‘16, Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) statementsfrom the time indicate that concerns about foreign developments and their effect on U.S. financialconditions were a factor contributing to the delay in previously anticipated policy rate increases,thereby supporting the economy.The message from these recent episodes is not just about the importance of timely policyadjustments by the central bank. It is also about the importance of the enhanced resilience offinancial institutions that has been achieved since the Global Financial Crisis. Undoubtedly, thisresilience helped prevent adverse financial shocks from contributing to a more serious downturn.Recent DevelopmentsLet me conclude with some remarks on recent developments. U.S. and other financial marketsare attuned to a number of prominent downside global risks, which include Brexit, a sharpslowdown in global growth prospects, and trade tensions.Even though the Fed has been and is committed to a dual mandate to achieve maximumemployment and price stability, in today’s world, U.S. policymakers can hardly ignore these risks,567891011 2 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
and three of our most recent FOMC statements have highlighted concerns about globaleconomic and financial developments. In addition, in our policy statements, as well as in othercommunications, we have indicated that, in the presence of these risks and with inflationpressures muted, we can afford to be patient and data dependent as we assess in futuremeetings what adjustments in our policy rate might be necessary to sustain growth,employment, and price stability in the U.S. economy.ReferencesBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2018). “The Recent Rise in Oil Prices(PDF),” Monetary Policy Report.

A recent exception is Ferrara and Teuf (2018), who construct an international environment indicator, based on atextual analysis of Federal Open Market Committee minutes, and examine the connection between this indicatorand U.S. monetary policy. Among others, Kohn (2008) documents the increase in recent decades of U.S. trade links with the rest of theworld, including through internationally integrated production as well as the increased financial linkages of theUnited States with the rest of the world.Other countries that are also recipients of safe-haven flows include Japan and Switzerland.An additional channel I have abstracted from here is that of commodity prices, which often move significantly inresponse to foreign factors. Since the United States is both a large exporter of some commodities and a largeimporter of some other commodities, the overall implications for U.S. activity are likely to be mixed. In particular,the effects of oil prices on the U.S. economy have been quite extensively studied. For example, Kilian (2008) andKilian and Vigfusson (2017) present evidence on how increases in oil prices have historically adversely affectedU.S. economic performance, as the United States is a net importer of oil. More recently, as outlined in Board ofGovernors (2018, pp. 16–17), with the net oil import share trending lower in the United States, the drag on U.S.GDP from higher oil prices has likely declined.Most studies discussing contagion effects of the Mexican peso crisis focus on effects on other Latin Americancountries and do not highlight effects on U.S. growth. Studies on the effects of the Asian financial crisis on U.S.activity generally find from modest adverse to even slightly positive effects (see, for example, Duca, Gould, andTaylor, 1998; Harrigan, 2000; and van Wincoop and Yi, 2000). Duca, Gould, and Taylor (1998) called the effecton the United States “more of a swell rather than a tsunami” (p. 1). One study, Pollard and Coughlin (1999),found significant negative effects of the Asian crisis on U.S. exports in certain industries, but it also concludedthat this effect did not translate into much of an effect on industry outputs.Support provided by the official international financial community also helped mute global market disruptionsduring these EME crises.Dell’Ariccia, Zettelmeyer, and Schnabel (2002) argue that the more-substantial response of global financialmarkets to the Russian default was because investors were expecting Russia to be rescued from having todefault by the International Monetary Fund, and there was a global retreat from risk when that did not happen.Media commentary from 2015 and 2016 is replete with descriptions of the rout in global financial marketsresulting from financial turbulence in China. See, for example, Economist (2015).In May 2012, I gave an interview at the Council on Foreign Relations highlighting the potential risks to the fragileU.S. economic recovery posed by the euro-zone sovereign debt crisis; see Clarida (2012).The quantitative easing was important, because the United States had already reduced the policy rate to zeroand—as argued, for example, in Bodenstein, Erceg, and Guerrieri (2009)—the spillover effects of adverseforeign demand shocks to the U.S. economy are significantly amplified at the zero lower bound for the policy ratein the absence of other expansionary policies.234567891011 4 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches

     Page 2/9   Ladies and Gentlemen Welcome to the Swiss National Bank’s biannual Money Market Event. Tonight, we have chosen to focus on a subject that is becoming increasingly topical in light of developments in digitalisation: payment systems. This is a fascinating field, not just for the private sector, but also for central banks, as payment systems and monetary policy are closely interconnected.  The SNB’s monetary policy is designed to ensure price stability, which in turn maintains confidence in the value of our currency. At our quarterly assessment last week, we decided to leave our expansionary monetary policy stance unchanged. For the year 2019, we expect growth of around 1.5% in Switzerland, compared to 2.5% growth in 2018. The inflation forecast has been revised downwards. We now expect an inflation rate of 0.3% for 2019. The Swiss franc is still highly valued and the situation on the foreign exchange market remains fragile. In this environment, both the negative interest rate and the SNB’s willingness to intervene in the foreign exchange market as necessary remain essential. These measures allow us to ensure price stability – and thus fulfil our mandate in the interests of the country as a whole. Facilitating and securing the operation of cashless payment systems is part of the SNB’s mandate. And for good reason: A smoothly functioning payment system is critically important to the performance of an economy. Payments connect buyers and sellers; borrowers and lenders. The ability to make payments securely and irrevocably is fundamental to sustaining confidence in the financial system.  Digitalisation and the proliferation of mobile internet services are changing the way we pay for things. New applications and technologies promise ever faster, easier and cheaper pay-ment options via smartphone, tablet or smartwatch. The entire payments ecosystem is set to undergo profound change as a result.  My colleague Thomas Moser and I will take a more detailed look at how innovation is shap-ing developments in the payments arena. We will focus in particular on the challenges such innovation presents to central banks. In the past, payment innovations have often been driven by the private sector. Facilitating – and especially securing – the operation of payment systems has long been a fundamental task of many central banks, however. It is thus essential that all the various stakeholders maintain a constructive dialogue. In this spirit, once we have finished our presentation, we will be hearing the views of a panel of experts representing fintech, banking, infrastructure provision and the SNB.  To run efficiently, an economy needs functioning payment systems Payment systems play an important part in enabling economies to function smoothly. Allow me to illustrate this point with a brief anecdote taken from a book entitled ‘Across Africa’ by British explorer Verney Lovett Cameron. Cameron crossed equatorial Africa in 1875, and was the first European to do so. At one stage on his travels, he needed some boats. He managed to 
     Page 3/9   find a boat owner, but the owner demanded to be paid in ivory, which Cameron did not have. However, word reached him that there was a person in the vicinity who sold ivory. There was just one hitch: this person would only accept cotton cloth as payment, which Cameron did not have either. Eventually, Cameron came across somebody who owned cotton cloth that he was happy to part with in exchange for wire. Mercifully, Cameron had brought some wire with him. So he gave this man the required quantity of wire, took the cotton cloth, used this to pay for the ivory, and – finally – bought the boats in exchange for said ivory.1 This story brings home just how high the transaction costs of an exchange can be. If Cameron had not needed the boats so urgently, the transaction would presumably never have come to pass. What was missing was a generally accepted means of exchange, i.e. money. Cost efficiency as a driver of innovation Let us conduct a brief thought experiment. Imagine for a moment that the boat owner had accepted gold as payment, and that Cameron had had some with him. The payment process would have been good deal easier and faster, which would have benefited both parties to the transaction. Having said that, the transaction would still not have been entirely free of costs and risks. After all, who would have been able to guarantee via-à-vis the boat owner that the gold was genuine and of the desired purity? In addition, gold is heavy and involves transport costs, and the risk of loss due to accident or theft (especially when travelling) is considerable. The desire for cost efficiency and security has always been a major driver of innovation in the realm of payments. Way back in the 7th century BCE, the Lydian kings began issuing small, standardised gold coins and stamping them with royal emblems. By embossing the coins in this way, the kings could guarantee both the weight and purity of the gold coins they issued.2 In my first slide – a highly simplified depiction of the history of money – this is the initial phase: the transition from privately owned gold to gold coins guaranteed by the state. This was a milestone in the evolution of trade and prosperity. Later on, merchants invented payment instruments, including promissory notes and cheques; and, in the 17th century, the first privately issued banknotes emerged in Europe.3 These innovations significantly reduced the transport costs involved in making payments and simultaneously improved security. On my slide, this is the second phase: the transition from coins with intrinsic value to promissory notes, cheques and privately issued banknotes.    1 As reproduced in Rudolf Richter (1990), Geldtheorie – Vorlesung auf der Grundlage der Allgemeinen Gleichgewichtstheorie und der Institutionenökonomik, Berlin, pp. 120 et seq. 2 Specifically: electrum, a naturally occurring alloy of gold and silver. 3 The existence of paper money in China dates back to the 10th century. In Europe, the first banknotes were issued in 1661 in Stockholm. In Switzerland, the first banknote was put into circulation in Berne in 1826. 
     Page 4/9   Central banks play a fundamental role in payment systems Now, it is important to remember that neither the promissory notes nor the cheques – nor even the banknotes – of this era were actual money, but merely a claim on money. Such instruments could not be used to settle payment obligations with finality. There was always a risk that the borrower would not have enough precious metal to honour the payment obligation on the due date. The use of payment promises in trade thus entailed substantial credit and liquidity risk. These risks could undermine confidence in payment instruments, bringing trade to a standstill. And this, ladies and gentlemen, is where central banks enter the equation. Central banks can reduce payment-related risks very effectively. By establishing security and confidence, they contribute decisively to the efficiency of the payment system.  Today, money changes hands mainly via transfers or direct debits, with payments being booked directly to the commercial banks’ accounts at the central bank. Settling in electronic central bank money is equivalent to settling in cash; it is final and irrevocable. This approach reduces credit risk and inspires confidence – both in the payment system and in money itself. On the slide, this is the third phase: the transition from private promises to pay to central bank money – in other words, to today’s banknotes and the electronic sight deposits that commercial banks hold with their central bank. RTGS systems – a milestone in the evolution of cashless payments Let us now turn to Switzerland. For many years, the postal cheque service of Swiss Post was at the heart of the cashless payment system. This area only began to become attractive for banks as well from the middle of the 20th century. Around this time, so-called ‘bank clearing’ – Switzerland’s first interbank payment system – came into existence. This was an important step in the development of the cashless payment system. However, the predominantly manual nature of the system made it cumbersome. It could take up to four days to execute a payment, making efficient liquidity management virtually impossible for the participating banks. Furthermore, in the ‘bank clearing’ system, payments were settled on a net basis. In other words, incoming and outgoing payments were offset against each other, with only the net difference being transferred between banks at the end of the settlement period. In order to facilitate banks’ liquidity management, the SNB allowed them to temporarily overdraw their accounts before the end of the settlement period. This delayed settlement created credit risk for the SNB. These shortcomings prompted banks to seek new solutions. In 1987, a new payment system known as ‘Swiss Interbank Clearing’ (or SIC, for short), entered service. In SIC, payments in Swiss francs are settled between banks in real time and on a gross basis. This type of arrangement is referred to as RTGS. Each payment is settled individually via the sight deposit accounts at the central bank, provided that sufficient funds are available on these accounts.  
     Page 5/9   The advent of RTGS systems was a major milestone in the quest for efficient and secure cashless payments. It is no surprise, then, that RTGS systems have become the standard payment settlement mechanism in recent decades, with more than 100 central banks worldwide now operating them.4 The SIC system exhibits some specifically Swiss characteristics, not least the close partnership that exists between the banks and the SNB. SIC is owned by the Swiss banks but it is operated by SIX Interbank Clearing Ltd on behalf, and subject to the oversight, of the SNB. Another unique feature of Switzerland’s SIC system is that, unlike most RTGS systems, it is not used exclusively to process interbank payments,5 but also to settle retail payments – the exchange of payments on behalf of households, corporations and public bodies – individually and on a gross basis. Experience with the SIC system has shown that the combination of interbank payments and retail payments is beneficial. First, economies of scale can bring down transaction costs significantly. Second, the fact that retail payments are also settled in central bank money increases security. Moreover, SIC participants can optimise their liquidity management and reduce technical interfaces, since they can use a single system for all of their Swiss franc payments. The transition from net settlement with electronic money to the RTGS system is the last phase in the evolution of payment systems shown on the slide. SIC has proved itself to be an adaptable, secure and cost-effective system. Since the 1980s, payment requirements and the demands placed on payment systems have risen relentlessly. For one thing, the volume of transactions has increased hugely, especially in the retail sector.6 Equally, new payment instruments, such as e-banking, have emerged over the years.7 More recently, the ISO 20022 standard was introduced as a basis for the national and international harmonisation of retail payments, and SIC’s operating hours were extended to allow same-day settlement of retail payments. New challenges in the digital age  Ladies and gentlemen, digitalisation is bringing a whole new set of changes to payment systems. What implications will these changes have for the entire payments ecosystem? And what further adjustments will the cashless payment system have to undergo if it is to remain efficient and secure in the future?   4 Allsopp, Peter et al. (2009), The evolution of real-time gross settlement – access, liquidity and credit, and pricing, The World Bank Financial Infrastructure Series – Payment Systems Policy and Research, February 2009. 5 Interbank payments comprise payments relating to FX operations or money and capital market transactions, but also large-value payments transacted by the non-bank sector. 6 PostFinance’s decision in 2016 to settle all of its domestic payments via SIC in future has also significantly increased the volume of retail payments in the SIC system. 7 The recent SNB survey on payment methods shows that cash continues to play an important role in payments in Switzerland. However, a large proportion of payments by households is now conducted via credit card, and above all via debit card.

     Page 6/9   Before turning to these important questions, I should emphasise that I will not be talking about cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ether.8 The question I will focus on today is: how is digitalisation changing payment systems? One important finding is that the changes being wrought by digitalisation are affecting the entire payments ecosystem. Just as the cogs and wheels of a watch all mesh together, the changes unfolding in specific sectors are not occurring in isolation; they are interrelated, as the slide shows.  What is driving these fundamental changes? The initial impulse for transformation often comes from new technical possibilities such as smartphones and tablets, Big Data applications or artificial intelligence. These technologies are opening up new payment services for end clients (e.g. Twint) and new business models for companies. The mantra here is invariably faster, easier, cheaper. At the same time, technology is lowering barriers to entry for new players in the market for payment services, such as fintech companies. And finally, the payments infrastructure and regulatory framework play an important role, in terms of both securing the payment system and ensuring fair competition – which in turn should permit further innovation in the future. These changes are presenting major challenges for all stakeholders in the payments ecosystem (cf. slide 3). I would like to discuss four of these in greater detail. First, the central role of the client interface; second, the disaggregation (or ‘unbundling’) of value chains; third, digital ledger technology (DLT); and fourth, cyber risks. The first challenge concerns client contact and client data. For established providers of cashless payment services, such as the banks, the payment interface has long been an important client touchpoint. In the digital age, non-banks, such as large internet platforms and online retailers, can leverage payment data to target their clients with personalised products. As digitalisation progresses, the quantity and value of such client data are increasing. Established providers of payment services are having to confront the fact that competition at the client interface and competition for client data is intensifying. In the digital age, the wide network of branches which traditionally gave banks’ a competitive edge no longer provides that advantage. Developments in China show how quickly banks can lose their client interface to non-banks in the payments arena: Within a few short years, the online marketplace Alibaba and the news app WeChat have managed to capture more than 90% of the rapidly expanding mobile payments segment.9 The growing focus on the client interface and client data also represents a challenge for central banks. Gross misuse of data and a lack of reliability could seriously erode trust in payment systems – and ultimately in money itself. Even with the new technologies and   8 I covered this topic at our Money Market Event a year ago. I stand by the point I made then – namely, that cryptocurrencies are more like speculative investment instruments than stable payment methods. 9 Financial Stability Board (2019), Fintech and market structure in financial services: Market developments and potential financial stability implications, FSB White Paper, 14 February. 
     Page 7/9   possibilities coming on stream, payment transactions must continue to function and be secure. For payment systems to remain future-proof, in-depth discussions between the main stakeholders in the Swiss financial centre are therefore essential. The second challenge thrown up by digitalisation is the unbundling of the value chain. In the past, the value chain – from payment initiation, through authorisation and clearing to complaints processing – was largely concentrated in the hands of a single entity. Thanks to technical innovations, however, payment service providers are now unbundling and reconfiguring the value chain. For instance, they are taking the products of specialised providers – e.g. relating to FX transactions, payment guarantees or ‘mobile wallets’ – and combining them. Established providers of payment services are having to adapt to this unbundling. They are having to cooperate with new players, invest in their value chains and simultaneously satisfy demand for ever faster and easier payment methods. The central banks, too, face a challenge: they need to develop the core payment infrastructure in such a way that the unbundling of the value chain can be successfully navigated – without new risks being created.  As a result, we are seeing many central banks adapting their RTGS systems. For example, retail payments are increasingly being settled via RTGS systems (something which for a long time was unique to Switzerland), longer operating times are being introduced and settlement times are being shortened. These are major international trends, and we in Switzerland will have to think about how we wish to position ourselves. There is also the question of how to integrate the new players – the fintechs – into the payments infrastructure. In the next slide, the payments ecosystem in our two-tier financial system is presented in a simplified form. On the first level, via the RTGS (blue field), the central bank enables financial institutions to settle payments using secure systems and electronic central bank money. On the second level (green field), the financial institutions enable retail payments.  When it comes to integrating new players, there are currently two models: first, indirect access via the banks. This ‘open access’ approach, shown on the left-hand side of the slide under ‘Model 1’ (client –> fintech –> bank), is the one adopted by the EU. The new Payment Services Directive (PSD2) requires EU banks to grant fintechs access to bank accounts. The second option involves granting fintechs direct access to core payment systems. This ‘direct access’ approach is shown on the right-hand side of the slide under ‘Model 2’ (fintech –> RTGS). Switzerland has chosen this approach.  As the SNB announced at the beginning of this year, it will grant fintech companies access to the SIC system and to SNB sight deposit accounts, provided they have a fintech licence and their business model makes them significant participants in the area of payment transactions. The advantage of the direct access model is that it also allows retail payments made using 
     Page 8/9   payment solutions from new providers to be settled efficiently and securely in central bank money. This change creates a level playing field within the SIC system for existing and new providers – ensuring that the Swiss franc payment system remains efficient, secure and future-proof. The third challenge concerns the possible application of DLT to payment transactions. Switzerland, in particular, has witnessed the establishment of a fintech ecosystem in recent years, and we are a leading fintech hub. For central banks, DLT raises at least two fundamental questions. First, could it end up replacing current core infrastructure, such as RTGS? Various central banks have been experimenting with this idea, in close collaboration with private stakeholders. The results have yet to demonstrate that DLT is superior to a modern RTGS. Yet, in other areas of core infrastructure, such as securities settlement, it is entirely plausible that DLT-based systems could take hold. The second question is: How should existing systems based on conventional technology and new DLT-based systems interoperate? Should central banks or private sector players establish this link? Specifically, in this context: should central banks offer a digital token for certain DLT applications – such as securities settlement? Here, too, while a number of experiments are underway, there are currently no examples of such tokens having become established. Furthermore, private sector providers can themselves put their money in DLT systems by ‘tokenising’ it (e.g. in the form of ‘stable coins’).10 As you can see, ladies and gentlemen, there are a lot of questions still to be answered, and they will require careful analysis. Innovation is important, but it must not come at the expense of stability or confidence in existing payment systems. The fourth challenge relates to the downside of digitalisation: cyber risks. Cashless payments are a particularly attractive target for cyber attacks. A lot is at stake for central banks in this regard too, as a loss of confidence in the payment system could ultimately undermine confidence in money. Tackling such risks may open up new business opportunities. Achieving significantly greater resilience to cyber risks could give Switzerland an important competitive edge in the future. In particular, it might be worth investing in a new, robust and secure data communications infrastructure. Promising solutions are currently being developed right here on our own doorstep. For example, a team from ETH Zurich has created SCION, a new internet architecture which enhances the security and reliability of internet communications considerably. This technology could form the basis of a secure Swiss finance network. For the   10 While such tokens would be backed by an official currency like the Swiss franc, they represent a claim on a given private sector provider, not on the central bank. 
     Page 9/9   Swiss payments ecosystem in particular, this would allow secure and flexible communication between participants.  To meet these four challenges and prepare for the digital future, the Swiss financial centre needs to engage in an open dialogue on strategic options. It is important that we reach consensus on what a robust, attractive and future-proof payment system in Switzerland should look like. Which digital challenges can the interested parties manage on their own? And where might shared solutions be beneficial for all concerned? Ultimately, we have a common goal: to maintain confidence in our currency. Against this backdrop, an efficient and secure payment system will be as critical as ever in the years ahead. Conclusion Ladies and gentlemen, the SNB has a mandate to facilitate and secure the operation of cashless payment systems. It fulfils this task by acting as commissioning party for the SIC system, and guiding the latter’s ongoing development in conjunction with the banks. In so doing, it creates the conditions at the infrastructure level for efficient, secure and future-proof Swiss franc payments. The SNB acts in the interests of all stakeholders in cashless payment systems in Swiss francs. To this end, we are engaged in active dialogue with both banks and non-banks. This evening, we have given you the perspective of the central bank, however it is important to hear other perspectives, too. So I am particularly looking forward to our panel discussion. The noted economist and author Jürg Müller will act as moderator. After the discussion, our panellists, Thomas Moser and I will be happy to take questions from the audience. I hope we can all continue these conversations during the drinks reception.

Mario Draghi: Monetary policy in the euro areaSpeech by Mr Mario Draghi, President of the European Central Bank, at the conference "TheECB and its watchers XX", Frankfurt am Main, 27 March 2019.*   *   *The last year has seen a loss of growth momentum in the euro area, which has extended into2019. This has been predominantly driven by pervasive uncertainty in the global economy thathas spilled over into the external sector. So far, the domestic economy has remained relativelyresilient and the drivers of the current expansion remain in place. However, the risks to theoutlook remain tilted to the downside.The monetary policy measures we took at the last Governing Council meeting reflect thisassessment. In the face of a weaker growth outlook, they help maintain the accommodativepolicy stance that we managed to preserve last year as we rotated our instruments from netasset purchases to forward guidance. Our policy thereby continues to accompany the economyon its path towards our inflation objective.The outlook for the euro area economyWe expected the expansion to slow in 2018 as the business cycle matured and growth retreatedtowards potential. But as the economy weakened in the second part of last year, it was not yetcertain whether we were witnessing a temporary departure from this scenario, or a more lastingdeterioration in the growth outlook.The drivers of the deceleration back then appeared, to some extent, to be idiosyncratic andshort-lived, relating to the effect of emissions standards on the euro area car industry and anormalisation of world trade from its very strong growth rates in 2017.Yet it was clear that the loss of growth momentum could become more broad-based andpersistent if two risks were to materialise: first, if external demand were to remain weak; andsecond, if this were to spill over into domestic demand.In the meantime, the first risk has by and large been realised. The weakness in world trade hascontinued, which has significantly affected the manufacturing sector. Global goods importgrowth in January reached its lowest level since the Great Recession, on the back of risinguncertainty about trade disputes and a slowdown in emerging market economies, especiallyChina.As a result, growth in extra-euro area goods exports was negative at the end of last year for thefirst time since January 2016, and industrial production fell by 4.2% year on year in December –its largest decline since 2013 – before recovering somewhat in January. Indicators such as newexport orders, which have historically been closely associated with industrial production, remainin negative territory.So we are now seeing a more persistent deterioration of external demand. But a “soft patch”does not necessarily foreshadow a serious slump.During the four euro area business cycle expansions since 1970, there have been 50 softpatches – defined as a two-quarter growth slowdown – and only 4 recessions. In fact, the euroarea faced an analogous situation in 2016, when the economy also went through a soft patchtriggered by a contraction in world trade. At that time, the strength of the domestic economy wasable to shield the recovery from external uncertainties.The key question is whether, with monetary policy continuing to support the expansion, domestic1234 1 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
demand will remain as resilient today.The demand component typically affected most by a weaker global environment is investment.ECB internal analysis shows that the more exposed euro area listed firms are to foreign markets,the more sensitive they are to uncertainty when making their investment decisions. And there aresome signs that external demand may be affecting investment via manufacturing value chainswithin the euro area.In particular, both extra and intra-euro area trade slowed steeply last year, whereas in 2016 intra-euro area trade was robust to the external slowdown. Such a recoupling of intra- and extra-euroarea trade growth in a downward direction has not occurred since the start of the global financialcrisis. Intra-euro area exports of intermediate and capital goods were hit particularly hard, withcapital goods exports registering their strongest contraction since the sovereign debt crisis.A further rise in global uncertainty could therefore lead to a deceleration in trade and investment.But for now expectations for investment remain relatively robust. Though professionalforecasters have slightly downgraded their projections for investment growth this year – fromaround 3% to around 2.5% – the fundamentals are in place for investment to rebound, if globalgrowth stabilises.Capacity utilisation stands close to its long-term maximum, financing conditions remain veryfavourable and corporate leverage (as a percentage of total assets) has fallen to levels lastwitnessed in the early years of EMU – although gross corporate indebtedness (as a percentageof gross value added) still stands above its pre-crisis level. The latest surveys also suggestsome recovery in business sentiment.While consumption is typically less affected by external developments, its growth rate hasslowed over the last year. Higher uncertainty may have played a role, as reflected in the rise inthe household saving rate over the course of 2018. But the main drivers were idiosyncraticfactors unrelated to the global economy, coupled with country-specific factors in France and Italy.The most important issue for the consumption outlook is the labour market, since higheremployment has been the major driver of consumption during the current expansion. So far thelabour market has been resilient to the growth slowdown.While employment growth moderated in the second half of last year, in 2018 it was significantlyhigher than would be expected based on the static long-term relationship between employmentand GDP growth. As a result, real disposable income has remained resilient and households’assessment of their own financial situation, which is a good leading indicator of consumption,remains positive.The resilience of the employment-consumption relationship helps explain why, even as themanufacturing outlook has worsened, services have remained relatively robust. Services is themost labour-intensive sector and is associated closely with consumers’ expenditure.There are however lags between changes in GDP and in employment, and surveys onemployment, while remaining in expansionary territory, have decelerated since the middle of lastyear. So should the growth slowdown turn into a more persistent phenomenon, employment andconsumption are likely to be affected.All in all, the current data suggest that external demand has not yet spilled over significantly intodomestic demand, but the risks have risen in the last months and uncertainty remains high. Thisis why our medium-term outlook remains that growth will gradually return to potential, but therisks remain tilted to the downside.That outlook is also being buttressed by the pre-emptive reaction of stabilisation policies. Fiscal5678 2 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
policy in the euro area has become mildly expansionary, with the aggregate fiscal stanceexpected to be –0.4% of GDP in 2019 after five years of being broadly neutral. And our forwardguidance on monetary policy has been effective, as shown by the continuing easing of financialconditions since last December.The outlook for wages and inflationThe weakening growth picture has naturally affected the inflation outlook as well. Our projectionsfor headline inflation this year have been revised downwards and we now see inflation at 1.6% in2021. Slower growth will also lead to a more muted recovery in underlying inflation than we hadpreviously expected.Reflecting the weaker outlook, market-based measures of inflation expectations have edgeddown recently. The fall in market-based measures has mainly been driven by a decline in inflationrisk premia, a volatile component of overall inflation-linked swap rates, not by a drop in “genuine”inflation expectations. While a decrease in inflation risk premia may suggest that marketparticipants assign increased prominence to lower-than-expected outcomes of future inflation,survey-based measures have remained relatively stable.We therefore remain confident that the sustained convergence of inflation to our aim has beendelayed rather than derailed – meaning that we expect inflation to reach our objective at a laterdate than we previously foresaw. This view is based on our assessment of the resilience of thelabour market and therefore of wage growth. Wage dynamics have so far broadly withstood thegrowth slowdown.Growth in compensation per employee fell slightly in the last quarter of 2018 from 2.5% to 2.2%,but remains just above its long-term average. Unit labour cost growth rose to 2.4% in the sameperiod, partly driven by a fall in productivity growth reflecting the resilience of employment growthto the economic slowdown.The key question – and one currently being asked in many advanced economies – is why theselabour cost pressures are not already being reflected in rising prices. Underlying inflation hasmoved broadly sideways over the last year, repeatedly falling short of expectations and stayingbelow the levels recorded before 2008.Academic literature based on US data has responded by casting doubt on the link betweenlabour costs and inflation, in particular at shorter horizons. Studies find no conclusive results onwhether, empirically, labour costs tend to precede or follow prices. This has led to a debate asto whether “cost-push” models from wages to prices can still accurately describe the inflationprocess.There are certainly a number of forces at work today that make forecasting inflation morecomplex, not least the effects of globalisation and digitalisation. Yet research by ECB staff findsthat, unlike in the United States, the structural conditions for pass-through from wages to pricesremain in place in the euro area.Over the period from 1985 to 2018, there is a continuing link between labour cost and priceinflation in the four major euro area economies and across the three main sectors. Pass-through is on the whole strongest in the services sector, where wages account for around 40%of costs. That is important for the current inflation outlook given the resilience of services to thegrowth slowdown.What appears to be delaying the pass-through today is the fact that firms are absorbing labourcost increases by squeezing profit margins. This reflects two cyclical factors.First, the euro area is coming out of a prolonged period of low inflation, which historically leads to9101112 3 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
a slower pass-through. One reason is that price dispersion is narrower when inflation is low,implying that if an individual firm were to raise its prices, it would attract the attention ofconsumers and lose market share. Firms are therefore more reluctant to pass on cost increasesto consumers.The second factor is the softening of activity in 2018. Labour costs are typically passed on morestrongly to prices when demand is stronger, so the fact that the euro area has recentlyexperienced a negative demand shock is likely to have held firms back from raising prices.The delay in pass-through may also be explained by an additional factor, which is lower importedinflation over the last two years. This has been reflected, since late summer 2017, in a growingdiscrepancy between the growth of the GDP deflator and core inflation. The GDP deflator hasfollowed a more pronounced upward trend, rising from 0.6% at the end of 2016 to 1.5% at theend of 2018.One development that may have contributed to lower imported inflation was the appreciation ofthe euro exchange rate by around 8% in nominal effective terms over the last two years. ECBinternal analysis suggests that this had an impact on non-energy industrial goods inflation in2018, especially for durable goods.The upshot is that the pass-through of wages to prices is likely to be moderate until these variousfactors have played out. But there are several reasons to believe that they will unwind over themedium term.Our monetary policy will remain accommodative and will respond to any changes in the inflationoutlook. The effects of exchange rate appreciation have now reversed. Demand should recover,so long as the downside risks to our outlook do not materialise. And with stronger demand, firmsshould be able to rebuild margins.Moreover, even if the economy were to slow more than expected, the risks to wage growth maybe contained. Since the end of 2017, wage growth has been driven less by wage drift andmore by negotiated wages, which are more persistent and react more slowly to cyclical labourmarket conditions.Negotiated wages for 2019 have to a substantial degree already been set byprevious negotiating rounds.The outlook for monetary policySubstantial accommodation is still needed to secure the path of inflation convergence and this isreflected in our past monetary policy decisions. In parallel to winding down net purchases, wehave strengthened our forward guidance on interest rates and bond reinvestments. This hasallowed us to rotate the instruments used to set the policy stance, while leaving the stance itselfbroadly unchanged.Our forward guidance framework has been specifically designed to accompany the economy byfacilitating needed adjustments in the policy stance as the outlook evolves. It works along threemain dimensions.First, the state-based leg of our guidance ensures that interest rate expectations are anchored toour ultimate inflation objective, and thereby acts as an “automatic stabiliser” in the event ofdownside risks emerging. Second, the date-based leg provides extra information to focus rateexpectations over the near term.Third, since our forward guidance on reinvestments is tied to our guidance on rates, adjustmentsto rate guidance automatically entail a change of the reinvestment horizon in the same direction.This reinforces the easing impact of a flatter expected rate path by compressing the term1213141516  4 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
premium component of longer-term interest rates.We will continue monitoring how banks can maintain healthy earning conditions while net interestmargins are compressed. And, if necessary, we need to reflect on possible measures that canpreserve the favourable implications of negative rates for the economy, while mitigating the sideeffects, if any. That said, low bank profitability is not an inevitable consequence of negative rates.ECB analysis finds that the best-performing banks in the euro area in terms of return on equitybetween 2009 and 2017 share three key features: they have been able to significantly reducetheir cost-to-income ratios; they have embarked on large-scale investments in informationtechnology; and they have been able to diversify their revenue sources in a low interest rateenvironment.At its last meeting, the Governing Council decided, based on the weaker outlook for inflation, toextend the date-based leg of our rate guidance “at least through the end of 2019”. That in turnimplies that we will continue to keep the very sizeable stock of assets bought under the assetpurchase programme unchanged for even longer.The Governing Council also decided to launch a new series of targeted longer-term refinancingoperations (TLTRO-III) in order to preserve favourable bank lending conditions and maintain theefficient bank-based transmission of our policy.These decisions ensure that our policy stance remains accommodative in the face of a weakergrowth outlook. And the calibration of the remaining parameters of the TLTRO-III will reflect theevolving macroeconomic conditions.Our current reaction function is well designed to respond to further delays in inflationconvergence. In such a situation, just as we did at our March meeting, we would ensure thatmonetary policy continues to accompany the economy by adjusting our rate forward guidance toreflect the new inflation outlook.But the commitment to our objective also implies alertness to future risks and a readiness torespond to them should the medium-term outlook continue to deteriorate significantly. In thiscase as well, the ECB will adopt all the monetary policy actions that are necessary andproportionate to achieve its objective. We are not short of instruments to deliver on our mandate.See Draghi, M.

Mugur Isărescu: Central bank communication as a policy tool - anongoing challengeSpeech by Mr Mugur Isărescu, Governor of the National Bank of Romania, at "The 41th Meetingof the Central Banks Governors’ Club of the Central Asia, Black Sea region and Balkancountries", Istanbul, 25 March 2019.*   *   *As prepared for deliveryDistinguished audience,Dear colleagues,It is a great pleasure for me to address this distinguished panel on a topic that is both importantand challenging for central banking. The session’s title includes three key issues: effectiveness,knowledge and trust, all in relation to the manner in which central banks communicate theirpolicies and actions.I would like to share with you some general thoughts regarding these issues, as well as theNational Bank of Romania’s experience in this area over the recent years.More transparency, commitments tooViews and practices concerning transparency and communication have evolved dramatically inthe last decade. Not long ago, the conventional wisdom was that monetary policymakers shouldsay as little as possible, take markets by surprise and be rather cryptic. Things have changed, asthe more independent central banks also became accountable for the ‘public goods’ they werecalled to provide for: a credible and convertible currency, price stability, employment and growthin other cases, banking sector supervision and financial stability. People tend to take these‘public goods’ for granted, appreciating their importance only when lost.Clear communication of the central bank’s objectives, policy strategy and its decisions provedessential to anchoring inflation expectations and enhancing monetary policy effectiveness.However, most research works in this area show that increased transparency is not enough.A central bank must demonstrate commitment and ability to achieve its objectivesthrough a systematic implementation of its policies. The markets and the public at largeneed to be convinced by central banks through consistent and effective words and policy actions,formulated as plainly as possible, in order to build knowledge and confidence – all vital for aneffective management of public expectations.Despite a growing recognition of the importance of transparency in monetary policymaking, noconsensus has emerged yet – either among academics or central banks. There is still debate onwhat is the appropriate degree of transparency or the best communication path, so that the twofactors can contribute to an effective achievement of policy objectives as well as an efficientmarket functioning. The ‘best practice’ in the field depends, inter alia, on the size, structure andcomplexity of the economy, its global interlinkages and policy cycles, the monetary policyobjectives and strategies, the political environment and institutional framework of a particularcentral bank, as well as on the extent and nature of uncertainty faced by policymakers.When assessing communication, one should take into account various economic, political andinstitutional factors in addition to the elements of uncertainty a central bank faces, no matter howmodern the communication tools it employs. Thus, central banks may implement, successfully,different communication strategies that may be appropriate and optimal given the above- 1 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
mentioned factors.As most central banks, including the National Bank of Romania, have opened up a lot in recentyears – by reviewing, adapting and refining their strategies, using modern and social media tools–, an effective communication approach should always include a degree of flexibility inorder to respond to a rapidly changing economic environment, exceptional circumstances aswell as the level and appetite for financial knowledge in the society.Forward guidanceThe global financial crisis pushed central banks to expand and heavily use their monetary toolkitsbesides identifying new instruments for the more delicate financial stability area. One weapon intheir arsenal, involving a strong communication approach, was forward guidance, which wasput to good use in the monetary policy field as central bankers attempted to calm the markets.Wisely exploiting the power of words, forward guidance was aimed at improving monetary policytransmission by offering more than just a glimpse at the central banks’ next moves. Greaterpredictability of the reaction function or an associated timing for the next actions enable marketparticipants to better calibrate expectations. It worked in several instances.It also increased the initial framework to include, apart from the traditional policy rate, referencesto some other parts of the central bank’s toolkit (asset purchases), offering markets nice hooksto cling on in times of stress and heightened uncertainty.Was this a too adventurous path to embark on? The toughest challenge for monetary authorities,as financial markets become too addicted to central bank guidance, is to identify smart ways tocommunicate in due course how and in which manner the shift to normalisation will take place,while also clarifying the limits of their actions and influence. All for a pretty good reason: avoid apossible addiction crisis that could in itself lead to turmoil and volatility.The real test for forward guidance is not the manner or techniques used to disseminateinformation, it rather occurs when the forward guided policies are implemented. That is the pointwhere the actions meet or not the expectations fuelled beforehand. Forward guidance relies onthe central banks’ credibility, validated in time by matching its commitments, a quick adjustmentof messages, clear accountability for forecast errors and even for misjudgements. It is alsoimportant to explain the context in which they operate.In monetary policy communication, the guidance of expectations, constant explanations andeducational projects have been building knowledge and trust. Financial stability is a moresensitive area, though. Central banks often come across different views of other public actors:authorities, governments or parliament members.Post-truth environmentIn a world of uncertainty, with incomplete information about the prospects and state of theeconomy, information about central banks’ strategy is a necessary, although insufficient,condition for the general public and market participants to understand decisions and shape theirexpectations.A careful calibration of wording is needed, along with greater efforts to explain the role and limitsof central banks in the financial field, in order to secure confidence. All this becomes even morechallenging given the fast-moving, ‘post-truth’ environment plagued by populism. Asimpatience has filtered in many domains, an erosion of confidence in the independent,accountable public institutions has emerged, as did the risk of exposure to swings in theeconomy, due to a change in sentiment. 2 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
To cope with this, central banks across the globe have boosted their efforts to educate, increasefinancial literacy, outreach and dissemination capacities, while trying to deal with the growingchallenges related to fake news and negative campaigns.I would like to draw your attention to some recent, new tools – first, an ECB educationalproduct called ‘Visitor Centre...to Go’ that briefs in plain language the institutions’ keymessages and knowledge in an easy-to-carry format – a suitcase! Any ECB expert can use thiskit during visits to schools or universities. Secondly, an interesting way to counterbalance fakenews campaigns is the one used by the central bank of Ukraine – winner of 2019 CentralBanking Publications award for transparency. They created a page on their website as well asinfographics, with simple and relevant data, to dismiss fake news about local banks as the sectorwas struggling with a critical situation.Therefore, effective central bank communication for the whole spectrum of its policies is anongoing challenge.The National Bank Romania’s experienceAs regards the National Bank of Romania, one key challenge to policy communicationeffectiveness concerns the apparent divergence between actual inflation and thatperceived by the public. In a country that saw annual inflation running at 300 percent back inthe 1990s and succeeded to tame prices in the single-digit zone for over more than a decade,this divergence has gradually declined.This issue has steadily been in our focus. In 2005, two years before Romania’s EU accession,the shift to a flexible inflation targeting strategy and redenomination of the local currency broughtabout more discipline in communication and transparency. Thus, regular media briefings(almost every six weeks), more specialised publications, as well as educational materials,conferences and seminars, livestreams and online tools, dedicated outreach projectswhich put at good use our territorial network, increased social media presence withtweeting, videos, tutorials and educational games or blogging (actually, we were amongthe pioneers in blogging) became part of the National Bank of Romania’s standardcommunication practice.The diversification of instruments and audiences came in swiftly. Some steps came only recently(2016) – amid fears of misleading or misunderstanding by the general public that was yet tograsp the very essence of the banking and financial business, not to mention central bankactivities –, such as publishing the summary of accounts of monetary policy meetings and thepay thresholds or even regular parliamentary presence. As Romania’s financial literacy is thelowest among EU Member States, the National Bank of Romania has devoted specialenergy to promoting financial knowledge across the country via educational projects incooperation with the Ministry of Education, universities, academia or other authorities.As regards the forward guidance, I have to say it was not among the preferred options given thespecifics of monetary transmission mechanism in Romania, where the struggle was to copewith high currency substitution amid harsh transition from a controlled economy to functionalmarkets and with large capital inflows on the eve of EU accession. Our policy statements suchas the Inflation Report, the Financial Stability Report, the Annual Report, besides our regularbriefings, conferences or interviews have always offered clear perspectives.Nevertheless, as negative inflation numbers, short lived in our case, popped up, I believe it isimportant to deepen our understanding and address the causes of the public misperceptionsregarding the divergence between actual inflation and that perceived by the public in order to buildand strengthen confidence. 3 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
With inflation tamed in the single-digit zone and the Romanian leu fully convertible, the NationalBank of Romania’s increased transparency helped to boost the positive perception,strengthening our reputation.On the flipside however, oversized expectations have also emerged, with people demandinganswers and solutions from us to all the problems in the economy, hoping that the National Bankof Romania, like all central banks, could make up for the policies that naturally belong to otherinstitutions.People worry about price moves; a rise will boost emotions although today’s puzzle lies withprices’ stubbornness to stay too low for so long. But money loss gives them more shivers,pushing most into dire straits when that risk materialises. In an emotional and fretfulenvironment, any message about the safety of our pockets – the essence of financialstability – may be easily distorted, thereby fanning fears. Sometimes, central bankers’ talkseems too strong, on other occasions too vague for both markets and the public at large.Confronting volatility, uncertainties, mistrust or even panic and scepticism only via themonetary toolkit is not enough. Central bankers are struggling to address some of theseissues, to make them understood by using all the modern and persuasive communicationmethods or tools. Nevertheless, their effort is poorly matched by the fiscal policy and by the oftendelayed structural reforms.In our case, as the global financial crisis unfolded, it took a while until the loss of confidence inthe main actors of the financial industry filtered in to also affect the National Bank of Romania.Thus, a few years ago, the public perceptions started to be influenced by local fake-newscampaigns echoing the ‘post-truth era’ that pointed to the NBR as being ‘the banks’lawyer’.Moreover, as loose or uneven fiscal moves or reckless legislative initiatives hindered theefficiency of the overall macroeconomic policy mix in Romania, the central bank openly voiced itsconcerns regarding the sustainability and impact on growth potential of such populist measures,triggering harsh criticism from their promoters.The global crisis proved once again that price stability cannot be achieved in the context offinancial instability, whose resolution calls for far more than monetary policy words anddeeds and by far more knowledge and confidence.Austerity measures, the recession, slower-than-expected recovery, along with the view that thebanking sector alone is to be blamed for these misfortunes – even though in Romania,unlike elsewhere, no bail-outs were resorted to – created a mood that eroded the highprestige that the National Bank of Romania had enjoyed prior to the crisis. A reputation that hadbeen earned thanks to a more transparent, flexible, effective policy and to a greater openness tothe general public. We were not alone. That sentiment became mainstream across the globe, aswell.Central bankers are nowadays cornered to deliver more in their countries, to actively punish theoffenders of fiduciary and prove more empathic with debtors and, why not, more compliant andtolerant with populist measures that affect the financial sector and macroeconomic stability.Otherwise their independence would be put at risk, as it is already challenged by publicrepresentatives.Given the rapid change in perceptions in a ‘post-truth’ environment, with few impartial media andthe increase in populism, most central banks across the world, including the National Bank ofRomania, may face a possible delay in recovering the public trust to the pre-crisis levels. Even ifthey spoke more plainly or loudly, using all the modern communication toolkits, the slow bridging 4 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
of the trust gap should not crush the contribution of independent central banks to the efforts toavert crises, achieve economic progress and be an open and responsible institution in thesociety. And, in the National Bank of Romania’s case, its legacy is an important pillar ofRomania’s modernisation. 5 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
Peter Praet: Providing monetary policy stimulus after thenormalisation of instrumentsRemarks by Mr Peter Praet, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, atthe conference "The ECB and its watchers XX", Frankfurt am Main, 27 March 2019.*   *   *The financial crisis and its aftermath ushered in the need for central banks across the world tobroaden the means by which they achieve their statutory mandates. The ECB’s responses tothe first two phases of the crisis, namely the immediate aftermath of the collapse of LehmanBrothers and the euro area sovereign debt crisis, were largely centred on conventional toolsbeing used in unconventional ways. The key ECB interest rates remained the instrument foradjusting the monetary policy stance. Meanwhile, refinancing operations continued to be thevehicle for providing reserves to the banking system, but by adopting fixed rate tenderprocedures with full allotment, expanding the eligible collateral pool and offering additional longer-term funding, we provided the banking system with the ample liquidity it was trying to secure inan elastic manner. Unconventional tools – namely limited purchases of covered and sovereignbonds (Securities Markets Programme), as well as the announcement of outright monetarytransactions (OMTs) – were used to promote and safeguard the smooth transmission andsingleness of our monetary policy.Things changed during the third phase of the crisis. This phase was characterised by adeleveraging process that fed into a renewed macroeconomic downturn, producing a perniciouscycle of contracting credit growth and weak demand dynamics that required a forceful monetarypolicy response. Additional accommodation was initially provided by further reductions in the keyECB interest rates – eventually to negative levels – and the introduction of forward guidance ontheir expected path, while targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs) were conductedto support bank lending to the real economy. But with the deposit facility rate in negative territoryand limited scope for additional rate cuts, purchases of private and public sector securitiesbecame the tool for adjusting the level of monetary accommodation.Following its announcement in January 2015, our expanded asset purchase programme (APP)was recalibrated a number of times in response to changes in the inflation outlook. Theserecalibrations consisted of changes in the monthly purchase volumes, expansions in the list ofeligible asset classes and extensions of the minimum horizon over which purchases would takeplace. The aim of the APP was to prevent acute and persistent disinflationary pressures fromdestabilising medium-term inflation expectations and potentially spiralling into outright deflation.That intention was hard-wired in the conditionality – or, in academic parlance, the “policy rule” –that governed the forward guidance on the evolution of the APP from its inception. Theprogramme was to continue at a pre-set monthly pace of purchases until the Governing Councilsaw inflation on a sustained adjustment path towards levels below, but close to, 2% over themedium term.We’ve come a very long way since the APP was launched. Last December, we took a first stepon the path towards “normalisation” by completing the rotation of instruments from aconfiguration relying on the pace and horizon of monthly bond purchases to one founded onforward guidance on our policy interest rates as the principal instrument of monetary policy.There is an important distinction to be made here between the normalisation of the hierarchy ofpolicy instruments and the normalisation of the monetary policy stance – that is, the degree ofmonetary stimulus that we provide to the economy. The normalisation of instruments wasimplemented in such a way as to preserve the degree of accommodation necessary forcontinued inflation convergence even after the end of net asset purchases.Rotation back to the “normal” instrument of monetary policy123 1 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
When announcing our APP in January 2015, we made clear that we intended to conduct netasset purchases until we saw inflation on a sustained adjustment path towards levels below, butclose to, 2% over the medium term. While further accommodation was initially provided byadditional cuts in policy rates into negative territory, the APP became the tool for adjusting thelevel of monetary accommodation. In March 2016 we adjusted our forward guidance on the keyECB interest rates to imply a sequencing between the interest rate policy and the net assetpurchases, thereby exploiting the complementarities between these two key components of ourmonetary policy conduct. The APP enhanced the effectiveness of our forward guidance on policyrates via the signalling channel, underscoring our commitment to keep rates low for as long asnecessary to achieve the stated objective of our policy. In addition, the APP gave rise to aportfolio rebalancing channel; this put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, therebycomplementing the impact of forward guidance on short to medium-term interest rates. TheAPP, as well as the TLTROs, also resulted in a liquidity creation effect. In conjunction with ournegative interest rate policy, which increased the opportunity cost of holding reserves, theabundance of liquidity in the system reinforced the compression of longer-term interest rates.In assessing progress towards a sustained adjustment in inflation, the Governing Council wasguided by three criteria: convergence, confidence and resilience. First, headline inflation neededto be on a trajectory to converge to levels below, but close to, 2% by the end of a meaningfulmedium-term horizon. Second, we needed to be confident that the upward adjustment in inflationwould be realised with a sufficiently high probability. Third, the convergence of inflation towardsour aim needed to be resilient to the ending of net asset purchases.By June last year, substantial progress had been made on the inflation front in terms of our threecriteria. Inflation was projected to be on a gradual upward path, uncertainty around the inflationoutlook had narrowed sharply and the inflation trajectory was tested to be sufficiently robust to anending of net asset purchases. So the time had come to bring net asset purchases gradually toan end. We therefore initiated a rotation away from net asset purchases and back to interestrates as the principal instrument of monetary policy by signalling our intention to end netpurchases in December 2018, subject to incoming data, and by enhancing our forward guidanceon the key interest rates. We also expressed our intention to maintain our policy of reinvestingmaturing securities for an extended period of time after the end of our net asset purchases and inany case for as long as necessary.Our net asset purchases had borne fruit, and in December 2018 we assessed that they had setinflation on a sustained adjustment path towards our aim, but that continued inflationconvergence still required significant monetary policy stimulus. Our successive downwardadjustments in the volume of monthly purchases had supported our confidence that inflationconvergence would be sustained even after the end of net asset purchases, underlining theincreasing role of the stock of acquired assets in determining the stance of our monetary policy.In the process of rotating back to forward guidance on policy rates as our main instrument, it wasessential to preserve the degree of monetary accommodation required for continued inflationconvergence. To prevent the risk that our instrument rotation would leave expectations about ourkey interest rates – which since March 2016 were expected to remain unchanged “for anextended period of time, and well past the horizon of our net asset purchases” – without atangible anchor, we enhanced our forward guidance on interest rates when announcing ouranticipation that we would bring net purchases to an end. Specifically, we decided last June on anew conditionality formula for our forward guidance that – by and large – mirrored the one we hadused for steering APP expectations. This conditionality consists of both date and state-contingentlegs. The smooth financial market reaction to the end of net asset purchases suggests that ourenhanced forward guidance had the intended effect.Our reinvestment policy reinforces the effects of forward guidance on policy rates. Today, thestock of securities acquired under the APP has reached such a sizeable level that our456 2 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
reinvestment policy is sufficient to ensure the degree of continued duration extraction needed tokeep a lid on term premia. Keeping the stock of securities constant also contributes tomaintaining favourable liquidity conditions. Ample volumes of excess reserves ensure that theovernight interest rate stays close to the floor of the interest rate corridor, which is provided bythe deposit facility rate. This, together with forward guidance on the expected evolution of ourpolicy interest rates, reduces rate uncertainty across maturities and thus adds to thecompression of term premia brought about by the duration extraction channel.Preserving significant monetary stimulusAt the beginning of March this year the Governing Council was faced with a delicate call. On theone hand, the economic expansion was clearly losing steam and the sagging economythreatened to slow the pace at which inflation was expected to climb back to our objective.Indeed, for the first time in a number of projection rounds, the March staff projection exercise haddowngraded the inflation outlook uniformly throughout the horizon, including at the end point. Onthe other hand, there was no doubt that underlying conditions had come a long way since thestart of our asset purchase programme, in terms of both the overall progress achieved and theresilience of the economy to negative shocks. The weaker economic momentum had notfundamentally undermined the conditions on which progress towards our aim ultimatelydepends, but it was slowing the pace of inflation convergence.In the light of the downward revisions to the macroeconomic outlook, additional measures wereneeded to preserve the ample degree of monetary accommodation supporting inflationconvergence towards our aim. In March we adjusted our forward guidance on the key ECBinterest rates, our main instrument, while announcing some other measures to preservefavourable lending conditions and the smooth transmission of monetary policy.Long-term interest rates and, indirectly, financial conditions depend on market participants’expectations of the path that monetary policy interest rates are likely to follow. Today, this path isconstrained on the downside, as the overnight interest rate – which underpins the whole termstructure of risk-free interest rates – is already negative. So, under current conditions, ourindications regarding the most likely evolution of the policy rates are a key instrument for settingthe monetary policy stance.Our interest rate forward guidance consists of both date and state-contingent legs. The state-contingent leg expresses the anchor of our policy-setting: keeping inflation stably on its sustainedpath towards levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. It says that the policyrates won’t be raised until we are sufficiently confident that inflation will reach levels below, butclose to, 2% over the medium term.We further define our forward guidance with additional wording which we refer to as the date-based leg. Through that wording the Governing Council relays to the market information about itsexpectation of the earliest date at which, given the likeliest path for inflation, the state-contingentpart might dictate a first rate increase. As such, it is not a stand-alone proposition. It is aclarification about the rate path that we see as most consistent with the inflation outlook that weface, and with our commitment to achieve our policy objective over the medium term. The date-based leg of our forward guidance directly affects the formation of market expectations byclarifying the course of interest rate policy over a well-defined period of time. It influences the risk-free curve by truncating the left tail of the distribution of market expectations for policy rates.In the run-up to our March meeting, the state-contingent part of our forward guidance with its linkto the evolving inflation outlook had already influenced investor expectations a great deal. Asinvestors had been revising their outlook, the point at which they expected a first rate increasehad also been extending dynamically into the future, as they were internalising the GoverningCouncil’s commitment – expressed in the state-contingent part of forward guidance – to an7 3 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
inflation-dependent “policy rule”. The term structure of money market interest rates had beenshifting lower and flattening as a result. So, a gap had formed between the market-implied date ofa rate lift-off and the Governing Council’s indications, under its time-bound component of forwardguidance, of the earliest date at which such a lift-off was likely to occur. Since June 2018 thistime-bound part of forward guidance had signalled that policy rates were very likely to remain atpresent levels “at least through the summer of 2019”. In March we assessed the risks to pricestability and concluded that recalibrating the date-based leg of our forward guidance wasnecessary to preserve the appropriate degree of monetary accommodation. Therefore, wedecided to communicate that we now expect to keep our policy rates unchanged “at leastthrough the end of 2019”.Our reinvestment horizon is chained to our forward guidance on interest rates, as the fullreinvestment horizon is defined as “an extended period of time past the date when we startraising the key ECB interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary…”. By extending theearliest date for a rate increase, we effectively also pushed out the time over whichreinvestments are intended to continue. This will not only help to maintain favourable liquidityconditions but also reinforce the downward effect of our rate forward guidance on the risk-freecurve by supressing term premia.We also decided to launch a new series of quarterly TLTROs to help preserve favourable banklending conditions and support the smooth transmission of monetary policy. Bank fundingconditions – while still accommodative – could be affected by high refinancing needs resultingfrom maturing bank bonds and outstanding TLTROs. According to ECB staff estimates, aftertaking into account excess liquidity holdings, banks in the euro area face combined refinancingneeds of around EUR 800 billion from June 2020 to May 2021, amounting to around 20% of thecurrently outstanding stock of debt securities issued by banks in the euro area. This could giverise to “congestion effects” as banks try to issue large volumes of bank bonds in a short period oftime to replace maturing sources of funding. A rise in funding costs could affect banks’ ability toprovide sufficient credit to the economy. Especially in the current environment, it is imperative topreserve the favourable bank lending conditions that have been instrumental in spurring andsupporting the ongoing economic expansion and the gradual return of inflation towards ourobjective.The new series of TLTROs is intended to do just that. TLTROs are a flexible tool with a numberof parameters which can be calibrated to meet the needs of monetary policy at a given point intime. Starting in September 2019, banks will be able to borrow funds with a two-year maturity ona quarterly basis until March 2021. These operations will feature built-in incentives for creditconditions to remain favourable and will help to preserve a smooth and efficient transmission ofour monetary policy to the real economy. Counterparties will be entitled to borrow up to 30% ofthe stock of eligible loans as at 28 February 2019 at a rate indexed to the interest rate on themain refinancing operations over the life of each operation, with further details on the preciseterms of the new operations to be communicated in due course.Finally, we extended the fixed rate tender procedure with full allotment. This means that we willcontinue to provide banks with a liquidity backstop against sufficient and adequate collateral.These measures give us renewed confidence that growth will return to its potential level,supporting the continued convergence of inflation towards our aim.Concluding remarksOur monetary policy is bearing fruit, and we remain confident that the labour cost pressures thathave strengthened and broadened amid high levels of capacity utilisation and tightening labourmarkets will continue to support underlying inflation over the medium term. The process ofinflation convergence takes time. While the sluggishness of the transmission mechanism can inpart be attributed to the persistence of uncertainties related to geopolitical factors and the threat 4 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
of protectionism that still cloud the euro area economic outlook, persistent, patient and prudentmonetary policy creates the conditions for the fundamental economic relationships to prevail andfor inflation to converge to our aim in a sustainable manner.In any case, we stand ready to adjust all of our instruments, as appropriate, to ensure sustainedinflation convergence towards levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. All ourinstruments remain available following the return to rate forward guidance as our main policy tool.The activation of any existing or new instruments always depends on our assessment of therisks to price stability and our judgement of the effectiveness of those instruments in ensuring theconvergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2% in the medium term. In Marchwe judged that recalibrating the date-based leg of our rate forward guidance, complemented withthe announcement of a new series of TLTROs, was appropriate to respond to the weakereconomic momentum and the related slowdown in the pace of inflation convergence to our aim.Monetary policy acts in full independence, but not in isolation. The mildly expansionary euro areafiscal stance and the operation of automatic stabilisers are also providing support to economicactivity. Growth-friendly public finances based on sustainable fiscal plans and a soundcomposition of taxes and expenditures are essential for macroeconomic stabilisation and lastingeconomic prosperity. In order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy measures, otherpolicy areas must contribute more decisively to raising the longer-term growth potential andreducing vulnerabilities.I thank Danielle Kedan for her support in preparing this speech.For further discussion on the phases of the crisis, see Praet, P.

Christopher Kent: Opening panel remarks - FX Week AustraliaOpening panel remarks by Mr Christopher Kent, Assistant Governor (Financial Markets) of theReserve Bank of Australia, at the FX Week Australia, Sydney, 27 March 2019.*   *   *Thanks to FX Week for the invitation to discuss the FX Global Code.When the FX Global Code was launched in 2017, the aim was that it would promote a robust,fair, liquid and transparent wholesale market. To do that, the Code sets out principles of goodpractice.As awareness of the Code builds and more market participants commit to adhering to itsprinciples, standards will no doubt improve across the market. The Code has already gainedsignificant traction in the marketplace.A recent survey of market participants by the Global Foreign Exchange Committee (GFXC)confirmed that awareness of the Code within the industry was now very high. Almost all of thosesurveyed had read part or all of the Code. Furthermore, the vast majority of respondentsindicated that they expected or required their counterparties to adhere to the Code. Globally,there are now more than 800 firms that have signed Statements of Commitment to the Code andlodged them on public registers.So what do we need to do from here? Globally, it is clear that the sell-side have embraced theCode. What appears to be missing is comparable take-up from the buy side. This is as apparentin Australia as it is in other jurisdictions. To some extent, this could be just a lag as buy-sideparticipants take longer to complete the process of reviewing the Code and aligning theirpractices to it. Encouragingly, the GFXC’s survey showed that while current take-up from thebuy-side was low, many of the buy-side respondents indicated that they did intend to adhere andsome of those had already begun the process.More broadly, though, the GFXC is conscious that greater take-up from the buy-side will beneeded and the GFXC is actively looking at ways to achieve that end.For those in the audience from the buy-side the question I would put to you is: can you justify toyour stakeholders — whether they are your investors (if you are a fund manager) or shareholders(if you are a business) — why you have not adopted a set of principles which represent industrybest practice when you are managing their money?The widespread adoption of the Code will benefit everyone involved in the FX industry, regardlessof where you sit in the market.It is worth noting the Code is principles-based rather than rules-based. This is to encouragemarket participants to think about their practices and how their activities comply with theprinciples, rather than working narrowly to a set of rules. The Code’s application is also designedto be proportional to the FX business that a participant is involved in. Clearly, there are someprinciples that aren’t directly relevant to the buy-side. Most obvious are those principles that dealwith handling client orders or client mark ups.Ultimately, the Code’s principles are there to give market participants confidence in how themarket is operating. There are numerous ways the Code can promote confidence. It can help toimprove price competition as liquidity providers’ pricing practices become more transparent toclients.

Michelle W Bowman: Welcoming remarks - National AgriculturalCredit ConferenceWelcoming remarks by Ms Michelle W Bowman, Member of the Board of Governors of theFederal Reserve System, at the National Agricultural Credit Conference, Washington DC, 25March 2019.*   *   *Good afternoon. It is a great pleasure for me to join the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City inwelcoming you to the Federal Reserve Board for the 2019 National Agricultural CreditConference. For nearly 80 years, these meetings have been at the forefront of importantdiscussions for those with a stake in agricultural lending, with the first National Agricultural Creditmeeting held in 1941. At that time and with war looming, there was a clear need to ensure thatour nation’s farmers had the resources and capability to support the nation in the wake of thegreat depression, deflation, and the dust bowl. This meeting provided a vital forum for candidconversation, to exchange information, and to forge relationships that would enable lenders totake steps to ensure a sound future for agriculture—a future supported by the efficient andeffective provision of credit.In the decades since that first meeting, this conference has seen a number of boom and bustcycles in agriculture, most often the result of volatile swings in commodity prices, land pricevaluations, and borrowing costs for agricultural business owners. Through all of thesechallenges, this conference has provided an important opportunity to promote a greaterunderstanding of emerging issues in agricultural finance. Further, the success of these meetingslargely depends on the interactions of everyone here today, so I want to thank you for attendingand for participating. I am honored to welcome you to the first conference meeting to be held atthe Federal Reserve Board. And I’m pleased to support this group’s mission to foster discussionon issues pertaining to ag finance, and I look forward to meeting with you and learning from thediscussion.Today and tomorrow, we will discuss recent developments in agricultural credit markets. We willalso hear from presenters on topics that connect in various ways to the agricultural sector. I amespecially pleased to see there is a special focus on rural communities at this year’s meeting. Asmany of you know, this topic holds a special place in my heart. My family has deep roots in ruralKansas and a long history in farming, ranching, and ag banking. I have spent much of my life andcareer living, working, and raising a family in a rural area.Rural communities are critical for our nation for many reasons including food production andprocessing, manufacturing, and leading innovation in these industries. According to the U.S.Census Bureau, 97 percent of the country’s land mass is rural, and about 60 million Americanscall a rural community their home. To put that number in perspective, the rural population of theUnited States is larger than the combined populations of the New York, Los Angeles, andChicago metro areas. If we were talking about the economies of those great cities, we’d stresstheir regional differences, the complexities of demographic change, and the distinct challengeseach city faces to remain vibrant and innovative. When the focus shifts to the rural economy,however, the discussion tends to be overly broad and simplistic. The diversity and complexity ofour vast rural communities too often gets lost—and I think that needs to change.There are challenges in rural communities. We know them all too well. There is a notable gap inaccess to broadband. As of 2016, 31 percent of Americans in rural areas were not able toaccess broadband compared to just 2 percent of Americans in urban areas. This can have asignificant business impact on ag producers—for example, limiting access to internet-basedcattle auctions or inhibiting the ability of dairies to leverage technology to remotely access animalnutritionists to formulate feed to maximize milk production.12 1 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
Many rural schools struggle to attract and keep qualified teachers who can teach STEM andadvanced math classes. These subjects are vital to preparing our children for the opportunitiesand challenges of a more competitive and technological workplace.One in five people in rural areas have a bachelor’s degree, compared to one in three in urbanareas. This educational disparity helps explain why the employment-to-population and laborforce participation rates in rural areas are lower than in many urban areas. Another contributingfactor to low rural labor force participation is the opioid crisis, which the entire nation is strugglingto overcome.Policymakers need to be aware of and be willing to confront these issues. But let me be clear: Iam optimistic about the future of rural America. The narrative of rural decline is too sweeping andbrushes aside the diversity of the rural experience. Just as many cities thrive while othersstruggle, there are deteriorating rural communities and rural communities that are thriving andgrowing.So let’s build on these successes and highlight a few of the positives.Following six years of steady population losses, up through 2016, the rural population appears tohave stabilized. And while employment is growing more slowly in rural areas than in urban areas,rural unemployment has recovered and is now 1 percentage point below pre-recession levels.The rate of poverty in rural areas is also falling. From a peak in 2013, the rural poverty rate hasfallen 2 percentage points to 16.4 percent in 2017.There are also many creative and innovative rural communities. In manufacturing, innovationrates are similar for urban and rural manufacturers, although the services sector in rural areaslags its urban counterparts. And, I am greatly encouraged to see younger generations choosingto live in and return to their roots in rural communities, just as my family and I chose to do. Theseyounger generations are often seeking a rural lifestyle and a deeper connection to a smallercommunitya community where they can have a lasting impact. They are bringing with them thesame innovative spirit they bring to so many industries. For example, some of these youngentrepreneurs and farmers are capitalizing on the recent trend for broader access to locallyproduced and sourced food.Which brings us back to our focus today: agriculture is the foundation for many rural economiesand it is the central topic for this conference. Current conditions in agriculture appear to bestable, though at a low level of income, following sharp declines for several years from the peakin 2013. The prices of major agricultural commodities have also remained low in early 2019. Forexample, today, the price of corn is about 40 percent less than it was from 2010 to 2013.As noted in the Federal Reserve’s latest Financial Stability Report, farmland values are atexceptionally high levels, though down from their 2016 peak. And price-to-rent ratios are athistoric highs. At the same time, equity levels at many farms are higher than in the past. We alsosee above-trend yields are helping to support many operators, though working capital at manyfarms has fallen along with incomes. Although the increase in problem loans associated withlower incomes has been modest, the Federal Reserve is monitoring the risk that has emerged inrecent years.One risk that we are actively monitoring is the recent and devastating flooding in the Midwest andits effect on both agriculture and rural communities across the region. Our thoughts and prayersare with all those who live in the areas affected by this disaster. I would be especially interestedto hear your thoughts on how the flooding may affect agricultural operations and how lenders arecurrently responding.The topics you are discussing today are integral to my role as governor. On Thursday, I will be34567 2 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
visiting with and speaking to farmers and community bankers in Deming, New Mexico. Animportant part of my job is to hear directly from leaders like you and others across this country tobetter understand current challenges facing your communities, your companies, and yourindustry. My goal is to bring back the knowledge I gain from these discussions to inform andimprove our work to support both the financial sector engaged in agricultural lending and ourmission as the central bank of the United States.I hope that conferences like this will help generate a richer discussion about the challenges andunique advantages in rural America so we can develop more creative, effective and direct policyresponses. A deeper debate that, for example, distinguishes between low-density and higher-density rural areas, between rural communities that are relatively isolated and those that areconnected and close to thriving cities, will help us develop more durable solutions.Before I close, I want to thank you again, as well as the many people at the Federal ReserveBank of Kansas City and from the Federal Reserve Board who helped organize this year’sconference.

Kevin Stiroh: Policy efficiency in supervisionRemarks by Mr Kevin Stiroh, Executive Vice President of the Financial Institution SupervisionGroup of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, at the conference "Bank Regulation, Lendingand Growth", sponsored by The Bank Policy Institute and Columbia University’s School ofInternational and Public Affairs, New York City, 1 March 2019.*   *   *As prepared for deliveryIntroductionGood morning.  Thank you very much for the kind introduction.  I am very happy to participate in this conference on “Bank Regulation, Lending, and Growth,”sponsored by Columbia University and the Bank Policy Institute. The agenda covers a number ofimportant banking issues and I will talk about the idea of policy efficiency from a supervisoryperspective.Before beginning, let me emphasize that the views I express are my own and do not necessarilyreflect those of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System.Public policy strives to be efficient, but efficiency is not a simple concept, particularly in thecontext of the supervision of large financial firms where the world is complex, the official sectorhas multiple objectives, and impact lags are long and uncertain.  For example, supervisors careabout the safety and soundness of individual financial firms, about the provision of financialservices to support the real economy, about consumer welfare and financial inclusion, and aboutfinancial stability.  More generally, supervision and regulation are designed to both supportproductive financial intermediation and limit disruption and financial stability risks.Today, I will talk about a simple framework for one view of policy efficiency in a world of twopolicy objectives – financial intermediation and financial stability.  As in traditional finance theory,one can think about an “efficient policy frontier” that maps the trade-offs among these objectives. One might choose a set of policies that supports a high level of financial intermediation and alsoaccepts a higher risk of disruption or crisis.  This might be achieved, for example, with relativelylight oversight or low capital requirements.  Alternatively, one might choose a different set ofpolicies, such as more intensive oversight and stringent capital requirements that likely reducesrisk, but also limits intermediation.An efficient policy is one that minimizes risk for a desired level of intermediation—it is on theefficient policy frontier.  This efficiency idea is distinct from the policy choice itself, as any ofthese policy regimes can be efficient in the sense that risk is as low as possible for a desiredlevel of intermediation.  I’ll emphasize that this framework is agnostic to the merits of one policychoice or another.  That is, it is a positive framework and not a normative one, and I won’t look atthis from a normative perspective.  Policy preferences can vary and they are set bypolicymakers.I believe this simple framework is useful when assessing and discussing changes to supervisoryor regulatory policy that can be designed with different purposes in mind.  For example, a policychange could be designed to increase efficiency and move toward the frontier.  This could entailchanging rules, regulations, or supervisory practices in order to promote more financialintermediation without increasing risk.  Obvious examples could be eliminating a complexcompliance regime for an activity that banks no longer perform or reducing redundancy in datareporting.  It seems like a good idea to always pursue these types of efficiency gains.123 1 / 7BIS central bankers' speeches
Alternatively, a policy change could be designed to achieve a different risk and return profile.  Thiscould be a shift from a mix of policies designed to achieve a low-intermediation and low-riskoutcome to a mix of policies designed to support higher intermediation while accepting greaterrisk.  Either of these regimes can be efficient and consistent with policymakers’ preferences, butthe expected outcomes would be quite different.From a public policy perspective, in my view, it is important to be clear and distinguish betweenthese two types of policy change.  For example, one might expect a greater number of bankfailures during stress if there were less effective supervisory oversight or higher borrowing costsin a world with higher capital requirements. Those may not be desired outcomes, but they wouldbe predictable ones.  From a risk management perspective, this might be viewed as an acceptedrisk of a particular policy choice.  By contrast, a policy change designed to increase efficiencymight not come with those undesirable outcomes.In practice, however, it can be difficult to differentiate among drivers of policy change due tomeasurement and assessment challenges, the potentially long impact horizon, and differentviews from a social and private perspective.  I’ll turn now to describe this efficiency frameworkand then discuss some of the practical issues.Policy EfficiencyAs a point of departure, I’ll begin with an idea that I expect is familiar to most of you.  Standardfinance theory suggests that investors face a trade-off between risk and return that outlines theset of feasible options across portfolios.  An investor can choose a portfolio with higher expectedreturns and higher risk, or a portfolio with lower expected returns and lower risk.I think there is a useful analogy for supervisory and regulatory policy.  On one hand, the officialsector cares about the provision of financial services such as credit, deposit-taking, payments,and risk transfer, where effective intermediation supports economic growth and consumer well-being.  This is the basic function of the financial sector and can be thought of as the return onbanking.  On the other hand, the official sector also cares about reducing disruption in theprovision of those services and broader financial stability risks.  It is only a decade since thefinancial crisis in 2008–2009 that imposed such an enormous social cost on the U.S. economy,so those risks remain salient for many of us.In this context, the risk of disruption or a financial crisis matters because of the potentialreduction of necessary financial services and economic activity in the future.  As I discussed in atalk at this conference a few years ago, a short-term discussion of the balance between firmresilience and the provision of financial services may be reframed over a longer horizon as adynamic trade-off between the provision of financial services today and in the future.  Thisrisk/return framework extends that perspective if one cares about the volatility of those financialservices across different states of the world and over time.The idea of multiple objectives suggests a policy trade-off with an efficient frontier.  In thisframework, an efficient financial sector regime can only realize more intermediation if it accepts ahigher risk of financial instability and less intermediation in the future.  A second premise is thatthe official sector can impact outcomes relative to this frontier through a combination of rules,regulation, and supervisory policies.  For example, a reduction in loan documentationrequirements, risk management reviews and supervisory oversight might allow increased lendingin the short-run, but potentially lowers loan quality and increases risk over time. A particular set and calibration of policies is efficient if the only way to increase financialintermediation is to accept higher risk of disruption or crisis.  Equivalently, an efficient outcome isone where the only way to reduce risk is to accept less intermediation.  This is not to say that allcomponents of supervisory and regulatory policy come with this trade-off, but at some point,456 2 / 7BIS central bankers' speeches
policy interventions become less effective, intermediation costs rise, and a trade-off is likely toemerge.  Those points map the efficient policy frontier.  The official sector can either push thefinancial sector along a given frontier as policy preferences change or closer to the frontier aspolicy becomes more efficient.To be more concrete, consider the following chart with financial intermediation on the Y-axis andfinancial stability risk on the X-axis.  Point A represents the outcome from a conservative policymix with relatively low financial intermediation, but also relatively low financial stability risk.  In thisenvironment, supervisors might impose tight lending standards, so projects with positive netpresent value and low risk are potentially left unfunded.  You might see high capital charges onrelatively low-risk activities, restrictions or prohibitions on certain risky activities, or relativelyfrequent exams.  Intermediation and credit growth might be slow on average, but more stablewith less risk of a disruption to financial services or a financial crisis.By contrast, point B represents the outcomes from a less conservative policy regime thatsupports more financial intermediation, but comes with a higher risk of disruption or financialcrisis.  In that environment, banks might be more inclined to assume a “risk-on” posture withlooser underwriting standards, so riskier projects are funded.  Oversight would be low and bankswould feel less constrained.  On average, greater intermediation would likely support moreeconomic activity in the short-run but with a higher probability of disruption later on.Finally, point C represents an outcome from a policy regime that is not efficient.  A different mixof policies could increase intermediation or decrease risk (or both) with no associated trade-offs. Point C is never a good outcome.  Examples of such policies might be a burdensomecompliance regime for activities that a bank doesn’t engage in, redundant data requests from theofficial sector, or a risk management system that does not address the most material risks.To summarize, both point A and point B can be thought of as efficient outcomes, where the onlyway to support more financial intermediation is to accept higher risk.  To be clear, one point onthe efficient policy frontier is not necessarily better than another, and changes in policy to movebetween them reflect policymakers’ choices to promote social welfare.  By contrast, point C isinefficient, and changes in the policy mix that push outcomes toward the efficient frontier arelikely to be welfare-enhancing.  The official sector should always be looking for opportunities tomove the financial sector toward the frontier.As a practical application of this framework, consider the Federal Reserve’s commitment totailoring and ensuring that supervision is scaled appropriately to the risks associated withdifferent types of institutions.  Recent examples could include the stress testing distinctionbetween large, complex firms and large non-complex firms; expanded eligibility for the 18-monthexam cycle; relief from supervisory assessments, stress testing requirements, and otherprudential measures for bank holding companies with less than $100 billion; the Bank ExamsTailored to Risk (BETR) program; and the multi-agency proposal to better align prudentialstandards with the risk profile of large institutions. Tailoring allows different firms to operate with different parameters of the policy regime.  Thelargest, most systemically important firms, for example, impose larger potential risks to societythan other firms, which implies a different risk/return trade-off and policy mix than for smallerinstitutions.  Without the ability to tailor the regime to reflect the risks associated with differenttypes of institutions, we would likely be left with a one-size-fits-all approach that is not optimal forany type of firm or for the financial system as a whole.Discussion IssuesThe simple framework that I just described is just that—simple.  The real world is much morecomplicated, and I’d like to spend a few minutes discussing some practical issues.789 3 / 7BIS central bankers' speeches
Understanding the Trade-offThe chart presented above is clearly illustrative and actual policy analysis requires detailedestimates of the potential benefits and costs of each component and the cumulative effect.  Forexample, the Basel Committee published a framework to identify optimal levels of bank capitaland used that framework as an input into the calibration of Basel III capital requirements.  Thisapproach considered how the probability of a financial crisis varies with bank capital, the socialcosts of banking crisis, the link between bank capital and bank funding costs, and the impact ofhigher loan spreads on economic activity.Moreover, this efficient frontier is not fixed and is likely to vary over time as technology, officialsector tools, and bank business models evolve.  For example, technology-driven innovations thatrely on bigger datasets and more sophisticated predictive algorithms might change the risk/returnopportunities associated with certain intermediation services.  Similarly, supervisory innovationslike stress testing or more sophisticated horizontal assessments could make official sectoroversight more effective.  Finally, changes in business strategies like a shift to a more diversifiedbusiness model might change the overall risk of certain activities.  One can think of thesechanges as shifting the efficient policy frontier where there is more intermediation for a givenlevel of risk.  Alternatively, constraints on supervisory authorities or practices could shift thefrontier in the opposite direction if use of effective tools is prohibited.Given the complexity of these relationships, it is not surprising that there is a wide range ofestimates and theories about the optimal type and level of oversight of financial institutions. Nonetheless, we need to understand better these relationships in order to make policy choicesmore effective.  This is an area where I believe the official sector, industry participants, andresearchers can all continue to make progress.Social and Private PerspectiveA second interesting issue reflects the perspective on risk and return.  In traditional portfolioinvestment problems, it is clearly the risk and return to the private investor.  When thinking aboutpolicy, however, the appropriate perspective of the official sector is for society as a whole, whichlikely differs from the perspective of an individual firm.  That is, the official sector and privatesector might measure the axes differently—particularly the risk axis—because the official sectorcares about spillovers, externalities, and other market failures that private actors may ignore. This broader perspective is a critical part of the supervisory framework for large banks that wasimplemented after the financial crisis.  In particular, the official sector recognizes the potentialimpact that stress at a large bank could have on financial markets or the real economy.  As aresult, the Federal Reserve supervisory program pursues two complementary goals for largebank supervision—one, to enhance resilience to lower the probability of failure or inability toprovide intermediation services and, two, to reduce the impact on the financial system oreconomy in the event failure or material weakness does in fact occur.This difference in perspective potentially introduces some divergence in views and assessmentof what an efficient policy looks like.  A set of policies might be socially efficient—that is,  on thefrontier when risk and return are measured for society as a whole – but perceived as inefficientby the industry or the public, who may focus on the private impact on individual firms or sectors. This can lead to some debate about the stated goals and assessment of the efficacy of aparticular policy mix.  I believe this is an area where better communication can help and theofficial sector can be clear on expected outcomes and explain any divergence between socialand private perspectives.Distinguishing Policy Changes101112 4 / 7BIS central bankers' speeches
A third issue is that it is not always easy to distinguish policy changes that move outcomes alongthe frontier from policy changes that move outcomes toward the frontier.  For example, is theshift to an 18-month exam cycle for community banks or a shift to less frequent stress testing forsome banks an increase in policy efficiency or a shift to a different policy stance with differentrisk/return features?  As I mentioned, both can be defensible policy moves, but they do havedifferent implications.  Moreover, a given policy change might have both effects as the stance ofpolicy changes and the policy mix becomes more efficient.  The proposal around the stressedcapital buffer, for example, simplifies the capital regime and also relaxes some assumptions. Finally, these policy changes might interact and blend together.How do you know the policy intent?  The most obvious answer is to look at the stated rationaleand motivation associated with the policy change.  For example, the analysis by the BaselCommittee on the long-term economic impact of stronger capital and liquidity requirementsaccepted the potential costs of higher loan spreads and reduced output levels, so this can beviewed as movement to the left along a frontier. It is also useful to think carefully about the expected impacts—both desired and undesired—andmake ex ante predictions.  What is the likely behavioral response?  How might the balance sheetand the income statement change?  What might financial markets reflect?At the risk of taking this simple framework too far, let’s think about what might happen to marketindicators in each of two scenarios—a movement toward the frontier that makes policy moreefficient and movement along the frontier toward a less conservative policy stance.  If the formeris really an elimination of inefficient constraints (move from C to B, for example), one mightexpect equity prices and Sharpe ratios to rise, while CDS spreads or bonds ratings are flat asopportunities expand and risk doesn’t increase.  By contrast, in a movement along the curve, sayfrom A to B, one might expect equity prices to rise as intermediation opportunities increase, whileCDS spreads and ratings deteriorate as risk increases.  One might expect to see measures ofincreased distress in some states of the world over time. Of course, the world is much more complex and risks materialize over long periods of time inresponse to many factors, and there are important differences between social and privateoutcomes, but I think it is helpful to think through these types of signals ex ante.  By makingpredictions and assessing whether observed outcomes are consistent with those predictions,we can better understand the complex dynamics in financial institutions and develop betterpolicy.Resource EfficiencyFinally, I’ll emphasize that I have focused on one specific type of policy efficiency that looks at theability to achieve multiple objectives.  Alternatively, one could think about efficiency more directlyin terms of resources and burden, both on the private sector and the official sector.  Forexample, the Federal Reserve aims to minimize compliance burden while achieving its policygoals.   That perspective is about allocative efficiency of scarce resources and the deadweightloss associated with the misallocation of those resources.  As part of the official sector, we havean obligation to be good stewards of resources and should always try to achieve a given set ofpolicy objectives in the least-cost manner.ConclusionsTo conclude, I have suggested a simple framework to help distinguish changes in policy toachieve a different level of intermediation and an acceptable level of risk from changes in policyto increase efficiency.  The first reflects the preferences of policymakers, and the second shouldbe a standing goal.  While it is difficult to make this distinction in practice, I believe it is useful tokeep the difference in mind as we discuss and explain our work.131415 5 / 7BIS central bankers' speeches
In my view, communication is vital, and we should explain our goals as clearly as possible andacknowledge all expected outcomes of policy changes.  By recognizing the full set of expectedoutcomes, including those that are not desired, I believe we can more effectively communicatethe goals of supervisory policy, increase accountability and transparency, and better fulfill ourmission to promote a safe, sound and stable banking and financial system.Thank you for your attention.I would like to thank Jim Bergin, Dianne Dobbeck, Hampton Finer, Robert Fitchette, Lauren Hargraves, BevHirtle, Michael Holscher, Anna Kovner, Don Morgan, Siobhan Sanders, and Katherine TilghmanHill for helpfulcomments and discussions.Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Supervision and Regulation Report, November 2018 andU.S. Department of the Treasury, A Financial System that Creates Economic Opportunities, Banks and CreditUnions, June 2017.This can be thought of as determining optimal policy that considers the net benefits as in Bank for InternationalSettlement, An Assessment of the Long-Term Economic Impact of Stronger Capital and Liquidity Requirements,August 2010 or as promoting the sustained provision of financial intermediation across a wide rangemacroeconomic conditions as in Kevin J.

Philip R Lane: 2019-2021 strategic plan focuses on consumerprotection, resilience and BrexitIntroductory statement by Mr Philip R Lane, Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland, before theJoint Oireachtas (National Parliament) Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform,and Taoiseach (Head of Parliament), Dublin, 26 March 2019.*   *   *Chair, Committee members,I welcome the opportunity to meet with you today for our regular engagement. I am joined byDerville Rowland (Director General for Financial Conduct) and Ed Sibley (Deputy Governor forPrudential Regulation).The Irish economy continues to perform well. While I will return to Brexit-related risks later in thisstatement, our most recent projections are that underlying domestic demand will expand by 4.3percent in 2019 and 3.9 percent in 2020. Unemployment is projected to average 4.9 percent in2019 and 4.7 percent in 2020. The improvement in the labour market means that we expectwages to increase by 3.4 percent this year and 3.6 percent next year. Given the recentdowngrades in European and global economic forecasts and the list of downside risks, we willbe closely monitoring the impact for Ireland of any further deterioration in the externalenvironment.The mission of the Central Bank is to serve the public interest by safeguarding monetary andfinancial stability and by working to ensure that the financial system operates in the best interestsof consumers and the wider economy. In terms of policy priorities, our new strategic plan for2019–2021 highlights: (a) strengthening consumer protection; (b) resilience; and (c) Brexit. I willaddress the issues listed in your invitation letter by reference to these strategic priorities.Strengthening Consumer ProtectionThe protection of consumers is a priority for the Central Bank. Our aim is to enhance confidenceand trust in the financial system through high quality regulation, purposeful engagement, effectivegatekeeping, assertive supervision and robust enforcement. Consumer protection is thereforeembedded in every key area of the Central Bank’s work.For instance, the macroprudential mortgage measures are designed to both enhance theresilience of the financial system and protect borrowers from over-indebtedness. Our work onmortgage arrears has also involved considerable collaboration and coordination across all partsof the Bank and has been central to our analysis of non-performing loans (NPLs).Furthermore, the work of prudential supervision in driving the resilience of individual firms iscritical in ensuring that consumers can trust that deposits are safe, investments are protectedand insurance policies will pay out when a claim is due. In addition, prudential and conductsupervisors have a shared interest in: business model sustainability; governance, riskmanagement and control arrangements; and the culture of regulated firms.Our new strategic plan builds on our extensive existing consumer protection framework andreinforces our strategic focus on the conduct of firms. This is essential, given the wide range offinancial misconduct scandals internationally and domestically, including the Tracker Mortgagescandal. It is also reflected in the evolution of our supervisory approach in recent years tostrengthen its focus on conduct and cultural issues.The supervisory phase of the Tracker Mortgage Examination is now in the final stages.  As ofend-February 2019, lenders have identified nearly 40,000 customers who suffered unacceptable 1 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
harm from tracker mortgages-related failures. This overall number is unchanged since our lastupdate based on date at the end of December. Total redress and compensation paid hasincreased by €18 million since the end of December to €665 million now. By the end of thismonth, we expect the number of customer accounts awaiting redress to be down to about threehundred, which will be mostly paid in April.In finalising our supervisory work, our focus at all times is to ensure that all affected groups ofcustomers have been identified and remediated. This work has now been completed at themajority of lenders. In the case of the remaining lenders, we are working to ensure that thesehave addressed satisfactorily any remaining issues affecting groups of customers and all eligiblegroups of customers have been included for redress and compensation. We expect this work toconclude in the coming weeks, with a final report published thereafter. While the “project” phaseof our supervisory work is nearing completion, any further individuals or groups that are identifiedwill receive the same treatment under our standard supervisory approach.Finally, our enforcement work is ongoing. These investigations are detailed and forensic,involving the scrutiny of thousands of documents and the conduct of interviews to establish theexact circumstances of matters under investigation, including the actions of regulated entitiesand individuals.While we have a strong suite of existing powers, the findings of our Report into the Behaviourand Culture of the Irish Retail Banks last year set out additional reforms that include the proposedintroduction of a new Individual Accountability Framework. This would ensure clearer lines ofaccountability within firms, as well as providing for an enhanced Fitness and Probity Regime anda unified enforcement process. I appreciate the Committee is holding separate hearings on theserecommendations.Looking at the PCP market, staff from the Central Bank published an overview in an EconomicLetter last year.  Data to the end of June 2018 show 69,668 outstanding PCP contracts (with atotal value of €1,243 million) provided by banks. As part of the Central Bank’s Central CreditRegister (CCR) remit, from 30 June 2019, the CCR will collect information on personal contractplans from all lenders that provide loans.We are working on additional measures to strengthen consumer protection in the LicensedMoneylending sector. In 2018, we published the ‘Review of the Consumer Protection Code forLicensed Moneylenders Consultation Paper CP 118’, which proposed adding certain consumerprotection measures to this Code in order to raise the standard of consumer protection, whilerecognising the specific nature of the sector.   We plan to introduce regulations to replace thecurrent Moneylending Code in the second half of 2019.  In developing these additional measures,we recognise the vulnerability of the households that typically engage with LicensedMoneylenders and the high cost of moneylending loans.Resilience – Capital Requirements, Interest Rates and NPLsA core element of our strategic plan is to ensure that the financial system is resilient, so that itcan withstand future shocks and protect the wider economy from financial instability. The first setof issues you invited me to address – capital requirements, interest rates and NPLs – can all becaptured under this objective.In terms of capital, the domestic banking system is far more resilient than in the past.Its capital position (relative to risk-weighted assets) has improved almost threefold relative to2007.Reliance on short-term wholesale funding from international capital markets hasdeclined. The domestic banking system is now primarily funded by domestic customerdeposits. 2 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
Funding costs have declined and remain contained, despite recent market volatility.The Central Bank has also introduced a range of macroprudential measures that aim to buildresilience in the system. As mentioned above, these include the mortgage measures designed toenhance both bank and borrower resilience and mitigate the risks of credit-house price spiralsemerging. The countercyclical capital buffer (CCyB) – set at one percent with effect from July2019 – is a time-varying capital requirement designed to make the banking system more resilientand less pro-cyclical by requiring firms to hold more capital at the appropriate time so they areprepared for a downturn.  Finally, the Other Systemically Important Institutions (O-SII) bufferlooks to build additional resilience for institutions whose failure would have a systemic impact onthe economy and the financial system.In considering prevailing mortgage rates, a number of factors need to be taken into account.These include:historical default rates and the levels of NPLs in Irish residential mortgage portfolios;mortgages in Ireland continue to be issued at relatively high loan-to-value ratios, whencompared to levels within other jurisdictions;the small scale of the Irish market means that the cost base is higher, in view of theincreasing importance of fixed costs in banking (including the cost of IT systems);lower levels of mortgage switching in Ireland than that observed in many other Europeanmarkets; andthe limited number of banks reduces competitive pressures on pricing margins.Addressing NPLs in a sustainable way that provides strong protections for borrowers remains apriority. This is essential in ensuring the resilience of the banking system and borrowers alike,since elevated levels of NPLs compromise the capacity of both lenders and debtors to weatherfuture downturns. The Central Bank, as the National Competent Authority and as part of theSingle Supervisory Mechanism (SSM), continues to require banks to reduce NPLs in asustainable way. The stock of NPLs held by the retail banks has declined by €67.2bn (c.79percent) since the 2013 peak.Multiple tools have been used to enable this reduction, including: re-engaging with borrowers;restructures; accounting write downs; engaging through the Insolvency Service; loan sales; loansecuritisations; and seeking resolution through the courts.The approach taken by the Central Bank and other parts of the State consumer protectionframework has ensured that the reduction in the level of non-performing mortgages has beenprimarily achieved through the restructuring of loans. The Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears(CCMA) has played a critical role in ensuring that borrowers are protected. The CCMA, andwithin it, the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process, require that repossession be used only as alast resort. The number of mortgage accounts for principal dwelling houses (PDHs) in arrearsover 90 days continued to decline in Q4 2018, marking the twenty-first consecutive quarter of afall in the number of accounts in this category. The number of PDH mortgage accounts that wereclassified as restructured at end-December was 111,504. Of these restructured accounts, 87per cent were deemed to be meeting the terms of their current restructure arrangement, thesame as last quarter.Nonetheless, secured property lending does require that the underlying property can be re-possessed as a last resort.  The extensive protections that are in place for distressed borrowersdo not preclude loss of ownership – although the CCMA and related protections has meant thatrepossessions in Ireland are relatively low in an international context.  In 2018, 877 primarydwelling properties have been repossessed: one third as a result of court actions and theremainder through the sale or surrender of the property. 3 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
We are acutely conscious of the vulnerabilities of those borrowers at risk of losing their homesand maintain the focus of our supervisory work on ensuring all lenders adhere to the CCMA.Furthermore, we continue to urge all borrowers and lenders to engage and seek solutions thatminimise loss of ownership.Notwithstanding the extensive use of forbearance and restructuring, other tools also have a roleto play. In particular, the sale of loan portfolios to non-bank investment funds reduces the risk offinancial instability in the event of a future downturn, since the risk is spread more widely acrossthe financial system. In terms of national risk management, the transfer of credit risk and fundingrisk to investment funds that buy loan portfolios constitutes a national reduction in macro-financial risk, given that investors in these funds are primarily overseas.Critically, the sale of such portfolios does not affect statutory consumer safeguards – the stronglegislative framework ensures that borrowers benefit from the same consumer protectionsregardless of whether their loan is held by a bank or a non-bank.Our twin focus on resilience and consumer protection explains why we have grave concernsabout the “No Consent, No Sale” bill. Given that the consumer protection framework is identicalwhether a loan is held by a bank or a non-bank, the bill would not add any extra degree ofregulatory protection for consumers. At the same time, it would severely damage resilience,since the transferability of loans is a central feature in a modern financial system.  In addition toits impact on loan sales, the bill would limit the ability of banks to securitise loans or providecollateral to obtain liquidity from the inter-bank market or from the eurosystem.While these restrictions would be costly even under normal conditions and thereby raise theinterest rates charged to households,  their impact would be especially de-stabilising in a crisisenvironment, since the ability to restructure balance sheets and tap liquidity is essential toresilience under crisis conditions. While the bill makes an exception for a “failing or likely to fail”(FOLTF) firm, such a designation is only made once a crisis is well advanced, whereas financialstability is best maintained by ensuring that resilience-enhancing measures can be taken in atimely manner, with the strengthening of balance sheets during good times allowing the economyand the financial system to better withstand adverse economic and financial conditions.Building resilience is also critical for the credit union sector. The Central Bank recognises theimportant role played by credit unions in Ireland. Our vision of “Strong Credit Unions in SafeHands” underpins our statutory mandate to ensure each credit union protects the funds of itsmembers and the maintenance of the financial stability and well-being of credit unions generally.Our recent report on financial conditions in the credit union sector that was published inDecember 2018 highlighted strong reserves, sustained lending growth and a continued reductionin arrears.  However, financial challenges remain for the sector and individual credit unions interms of low loan to asset ratio (average c.28 percent), high cost income ratio (average c.74percent) and low return on assets (average 1.0 percent). As the Registrar recently highlighted, itis not the regulatory framework that inhibits future business model development.  Credit unionchallenges are commercial in nature. Overcoming these challenges on a sustainable basis willinvolve credit unions enhancing their competence and capability, addressing operationaleffectiveness and expanding revenue through loan growth and non-interest income.Credit unions benefit from a tailored and proportionate regulatory framework. With a loan to assetratio across the sector ranging from 11 percent to 73 percent today under the same lendingframework, some credit unions are faring better than others at meeting member lending needs.Additional lending capacity is currently being considered under an ongoing consultation on‘Potential Changes to the Lending Framework (CP125).  This additional capacity would facilitatefurther longer term lending on a prudent basis by credit unions while appropriately managingduration and concentration risks. It is clear therefore that credit unions have the required flexibilityto evolve their future business models. 4 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
Brexit preparations and the economic impact of Brexit on the Irish economyFinally, let me turn to Brexit. As is well understood by all here, any form of Brexit will be damagingfor Ireland, with a hard Brexit especially so. Recognising these risks, the Central Bank has beenfocused on Brexit risks since before the 2016 UK referendum.   We continue to analyse and workto mitigate the risks posed to the economy, consumers, the financial system, and the regulatoryenvironment.We have taken a transparent approach to this work, recognising the importance of and interest init. For the wider economy, the effects will be uneven, with indigenous sectors (such as agri-food)facing heightened risks of disruption to exports and supply chains.In recent months, we have stepped up our work on mitigating the most material ‘cliff-edge’ risksof a hard Brexit. From a financial regulation perspective, our work has sought to ensure that:the financial system is sufficiently resilient for a hard Brexit not to cause significant financialstability risks;risks to consumers are mitigated to the greatest extent possible; andwe are delivering a proportionate, robust, efficient and effective authorisation process in linewith European regulatory norms, for those firms seeking authorisation in Ireland as a resultof Brexit.The Central Bank – in conjunction with the wider European regulatory community and, in relationto required legislative amendments, the Department of Finance – has worked to ensure that thefinancial system is prepared for all Brexit scenarios. While a no-deal Brexit would constitute asevere economic and financial blow, our work to improve resilience over the last decade,including in driving the material reduction in NPLs, means that the shock should not be amplifiedby fragility in the financial system. We also continue to be busy in authorising and supervisingnew firms and new lines of activity.I welcome your questions. 5 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
Yves Mersch: Remarks at the "Challenges in Understanding theMonetary Transmission Mechanism" conferenceRemarks by Mr Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, atthe "Challenges in Understanding the Monetary Transmission Mechanism" conference, Warsaw,22 March 2019.*   *   *Should we radically rethink the role of cash to deal with the lower bound on interestrates?The lower bound on interest rates has been a major challenge for central bankers in the multiplecrises over the last ten years. It threatens the effectiveness of monetary policy by preventing itfrom steering financial conditions. Moreover, the continuous decline in both the real rate andconfidence in the central bank, as well as resistance at the retail level, raises the question ofwhether negative rates should be part of the standard toolkit of central banks.In the context of the Eurosystem’s asset purchase programmes, the combined package ofnegative nominal interest rates and lending schemes that incentivise banks to increase lending(e.g. the targeted longer-term refinancing operations, or TLTROs) have been an effective andappropriate way to combat these challenges. While cash represented the largest part of centralbank balance sheets before the crisis, other elements of the balance sheet have since gainedmore prominence in the operational framework of monetary policy.Some people want to abolish cash by taking advantage of recent technological advances, suchas distributed ledger technology (DLT), or replace public money with private money, in totaldenial of people’s trust in liabilities issued by central banks and the fact that their continueddemand for cash exceeds GDP growth. Others argue for the introduction of a dual currencyscheme where the central bank would divide the monetary base into two separate localcurrencies – cash and electronic money (e-money). E-money would be issued only electronicallyand would pay the policy rate of interest, and cash would have an exchange rate – theconversion rate – against e-money, which could be manipulated to match negative rates on e-money by setting the conversion rate for cash lower than one to one.I have experienced the nightmare of dual exchange regimes before the euro and I have doubtsabout these arguments. Our unconventional measures have proven sufficient to meet thechallenges of low inflation. The Governing Council has confidence in the sustained adjustment inthe path of inflation. Recent evidence supports the hypothesis that there is some substitutabilitybetween conventional and unconventional monetary policies.Additionally, while being able to set significantly negative rates may work smoothly in aneconomic model, I am less certain how the general public would react, particularly after millenniaof positive nominal rates. Not only would such rates be deeply unpopular, there may also beunintended changes in behaviour that could dampen the effectiveness of the measure.The fact that banks do not pass negative rates on to most depositors, and notably not tohouseholds, is a warning sign for central banks of how people may react if attempts were madeto extend the lower bound of rates downwards by replacing cash with some form of remunerateddigital currency. What assets the central bank ought to hold against these widely held liabilitiesdriving bank disintermediation and deleveraging?A potential decision to issue a central bank digital currency (CBDC) needs to be assessed inrelation to the impact on the financial system. In an extreme case, during a systemic bankingcrisis, holding risk-free central bank-issued CBDC could become vastly more attractive than123 1 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
bank deposits. There could be a sector-wide run on bank deposits, magnifying the effects of thecrisis.Even in the absence of a crisis, readily convertible CBDC could crowd out bank deposits –putting the two-tier banking system at risk. Then, the efficient flow of credit to the economy wouldlikely be impaired. The central bank – now holders of deposit funding – would have to decidewhich projects to finance, either directly, by replacing commercial banks, or indirectly, bydeciding which banks would receive funding. This would lead to a situation in which the centralbank pretends to know better than the established system of the decentralised allocation ofcredit.Overall, there is currently no convincing motivation for the Eurosystem to issue CBDC to thegeneral public. It is unnecessary and appears to be disproportionate to the aims put forward byits proponents. There is no need to fix something that is not broken. If anything, one couldimagine a digital representation of cash that replicates the features of cash in the reasonablydistant future, if people demanded it. And I have not even mentioned the insufficient robustnessor reliability of some technologies like DLT, or their energy insufficiencies and dependencies.How does technological change affect the monetary transmission mechanism andmonetary policy?Technological change has multifaceted effects on the transmission mechanism. It is importantnot to jump to conclusions, for example that, because the Phillips curve has become flatter,monetary policy needs to be more aggressive. Let me add that, beyond technological changes,additional liquidity demand factors also stem from regulatory change, fragmentation and the factthat the banking union is incomplete.I will consider how technological change affects the following three broad channels of monetarytransmission, without focusing on the consequences structural changes will have for theoperational framework:1. How policy rates affect market interest rates and financial conditions.2. Labour markets and the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU).3. Price-setting and the Phillips curve.Financial innovations have the potential to impact the way the economy is financedA change from bank-based to market-based financing has been taking place for some time in theeuro area, partly related to financial innovation. This has led to firms having a more diversifiedfinancing structure and has improved their resilience to shocks emanating from the bankingsystem. At the same time, corporate exposure to volatility in market rates has increased.Fintechs can lead to further bank disintermediation, but also financial deepening, by allowingotherwise constrained households and firms to borrow. In addition, fintech can strengthenunregulated lending activities, posing challenges to financial stability. This might affect thetransmission mechanism, although how it will do so is not yet clear.Labour markets and the NAIRUThe possible disruption from technological change is likely to be felt in labour markets. Email,videoconferencing, secure VPN connections and outsourcing across countries all enableservices to be provided from a distance, and permit a greater degree of flexibility in workingpractices – a massive socioeconomic shift.In the labour market the internet enables more services to be offered with less intermediation at45 2 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
lower prices. Fragmentation of labour time is shown in the diverging results of compensation peremployee and compensation per hour worked.For some workers this is a positive development, allowing them to participate in the workforcewhere previously they were excluded. For others, the greater individualisation can lead toinsecurity, affecting households’ income. More individualised roles can also weaken the power ofcollective bargaining to maintain the labour share of income.While the productivity-enhancing aspects of digitalisation might tend to raise potential outputgrowth, the effects operating through labour and capital are more uncertain, and might even workin different directions.There may be some substitution of labour for capital, with possible repercussions for thebargaining power of workers, and a shift in investment to the IT sector as a result of digitalisationand servicification. If there is a skill bias in the transition to digital technology, this could lead to agreater mismatch in labour markets, and therefore a higher NAIRU and lower potential outputgrowth.On the other hand, digital production and supply chains, and digital communication andconnectivity, would tend to lower the NAIRU and raise potential output, because of theproductivity increases resulting from faster collection and evaluation of data, and the greaterefficiency of digitally underpinned production.The overall effect of digitalisation and new technologies on demand and supply thereforedepends on many factors. These include the initial conditions: economies with high-qualityinstitutions and governance are likely to see faster adoption and implementation of digitaltechnologies and a faster impact on potential output.From a monetary policy perspective, it is important to monitor the digital transformation of theeconomy. Some economists argue that output, productivity, intangible investment and priceshave become more difficult to measure as a result of digitalisation. Literature suggests that, eventhough some mismeasurement exists, its impacts may not necessarily be greater than inprevious episodes of technological change.But the analysis is ongoing, with various opinions and sometimes conflicting results. Of course,the fast pace of change across all areas of the economy also requires us to update our tools formonitoring it, and leverage the opportunities modern technology gives us, including new andbetter data.Price-setting and the Phillips curveTechnological progress poses a particularly acute challenge because of its direct impact onbusinesses’ price-setting behaviour; behaviour that directly underlies the inflationary process.The growing importance of e-commerce, rapid product introduction and substitution, and thequality adjustment of new products also pose their own challenges for measuring inflation.Technological progress has resulted in the creation of products such as smartphones andinternet service providers that had no equivalent in the past; failing to properly measure thequality improvements in new products can result in an upward bias in measured inflation. On theother hand, the reduction in shelf-life of many products and the heavy discounting of less-fashionable older versions could instead create downward bias in traditional price indices.Technological changes to price and wage-setting behaviour have much deeper relevance forcentral banks than just the measurement of inflation. The speed and extent of how inflationreacts to shocks affects the optimal monetary policy response:678910 3 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
E-commerce may result in suppliers changing prices more frequently. Not only areAmazon’s prices more flexible than prices of brick-and-mortar stores, Amazon’scompetitors are forced to adjust prices more often for products that are also offered byAmazon.More frequent price changes result in a steeper Phillips curve – prices reactmore quickly and strongly to changes in costs and output. This could also mean that inflationreacts much faster to monetary policy.Since online stores effectively offer the same price across locations, e-commerce mayrestrict the ability of businesses to set prices that deviate substantially from those of largeonline retailers while reflecting local conditions. So prices may change more often, but theymay be more uniform, which in turn may restrict the ability of prices to reflect idiosyncraticand regional shocks.E-commerce changes not only how firms set prices but also how consumers shop. It hasrevolutionised the transparency of pricing both within and across countries, allowingconsumers to easily compare prices and swap one product for another. This can result inhigher demand elasticities, eroding the monopolistic and monopsonistic power of suppliersand reducing mark-ups. Profit margins at Amazon (less than 4%) are much lower than atWalmart (more than 20%). Such a change in demand elasticities and mark-ups can beviewed as a flattening of the Phillips curve.Finally, the emerging prevalence of e-commerce can create new opportunities forconsumers to switch their shopping outlets over the business cycle. For example, there isevidence that households actively exploit price differentials across stores and “trade down”in recessions (e.g. switch from a regular grocery store to a discounter). It could be predictedthat this switching will be amplified in the future because switching to an online store isparticularly easy. As a result, aggregate “true” inflation may be more cyclically sensitive thanis suggested by headline inflation.The impact of e-commerce on the slope of the Phillips curve is uncertain, and studies havegenerally struggled to find large effects on annual inflation. Given the overall difficulty in estimatingthe slope of the Phillips curve, this is not entirely a surprise.ConclusionsAs with measuring consumer price indices, the greater availability of more granular data hasenabled a much greater understanding of how businesses set prices. But while policymakersshould adapt policy to take into account changes in the underlying price-setting process, weshould also exercise due prudence, given the uncertainty surrounding model estimates.Price stability-oriented monetary policy needs to monitor innovations and their impact on financialconditions, economic growth and inflation. And we have to be mindful of changes in theinformation content of the indicators that central banks use as a basis for policy decisions (e.g.monetary aggregates and inflation rates).As the impact of innovations cannot be estimated in advance with sufficient certainty regardingthe direction, size and duration of the effects, and uncertainty therefore prevails, monetary policyshould act prudently and be forward-looking.See Argawal, R. and Krogstrup, S., blogs.imf.org/2019/02/05/cashing-in-how-to-make-negative-interest-rates-work/. Specifically, when setting a negative interest rate on e-money, the central bank would let the conversionrate of cash in terms of e-money depreciate at the same rate as the negative interest rate on e-money. The valueof cash would thereby fall in terms of e-money.See De Bortoli, D., Galí, J. and Gambetti, L.

    All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/default.aspx 2  2  A New Horizon? A few years ago, I spoke of the Tragedy of the Horizon – how the catastrophic impacts of climate change will be felt beyond the traditional horizons of most banks, investors and financial policymakers, imposing costs on future generations that the current one has no direct incentives to fix.1  Once climate change becomes a clear and present danger to financial stability it could already be too late to stabilise the atmosphere at two degrees. The paradox is that risks will ultimately be minimised if the transition to a low-carbon economy begins early and follows a predictable path. But for markets to anticipate and smooth the transition to a 2-degree world, they need the right information, proper risk management, and coherent, credible public policy frameworks.  Today, catalysed by the COP21 Paris Agreement, and national policies such as the UK Government’s Clean Growth Strategy, some of these elements are coming into place, creating a potential path to break the Tragedy of the Horizon. But the task is large, the window of opportunity is short, and the stakes are existential. In pursuit of that New Horizon, let me briefly discuss progress and prospects in three critical areas - reporting, risk and return.  First, reporting Three years ago in response to a call from G20 leaders, the FSB began addressing the financial stability risks associated with climate change by ensuring the market had the right information to price climate risk and reward climate innovation. The FSB established the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) led by businesses from a wide range of industries across the G20. Eighteen months later, the TCFD delivered to the Hamburg G20 Leaders Summit its recommendations for voluntary disclosures of material climate-related financial risks.  Since then there has been a step change in both demand and supply of climate reporting.  On the demand side, current supporters of the TCFD include three-quarters of the world’s globally systemic banks, 8 of the top 10 global asset managers, the world’s leading pension funds and insurers, major credit rating agencies and the Big Four accounting firms.2 In total, these financial firms manage almost US$110 trillion in assets.                                                        1 Carney, M.

    All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/default.aspx 3  3  As a consequence, the incentives for companies to disclose and manage climate-related risks have increased dramatically. Moreover, climate change claimed its first S&P 500 bankruptcy last year,3 climate-related shareholder resolutions spiked to 90 last year,4 investment managers controlling over 45% of global assets under management now back shareholder actions on carbon disclosure, and companies representing over 90% of all shareholder advisory services now support the TCFD.  Not surprisingly, the supply of disclosure is responding. Over 600 organisations, with a total market capitalisation of US$9 trillion, have endorsed the TCFD recommendations since 2017. The TCFD’s September 2018 Implementation Report assessed, using artificial intelligence, some 1800 companies, and analysed in detail an additional 200 of the largest companies, drawn from eight representative sectors from across the G20.5 In both cohorts, the majority of companies were already disclosing information in their 2017 filings that aligned with one or more of the TCFD’s recommendations. This is commendable given companies only had six months to respond to the final TCFD recommendations, but more progress is needed. In particular:  Financial implications are often not yet disclosed;  Disclosures are often in multiple reports making comparisons harder; and  Disclosure varies by industry and region, with higher percentages of European firms and higher shares of those on the climate frontline – such as the energy sector – disclosing more information aligned with the recommendations. The next milestone will be the TCFD implementation report for the G20 Leaders Summit in Osaka, which should set out:  The growing momentum behind disclosure;  The types of disclosures that are most decision-useful for investors; and  Best practice examples, including examples of scenario analysis so that firms can test their strategic resilience to different climate outcomes.                                                        3 WSJ.

As companies apply the recommendations and investors increasingly differentiate between firms based on this information, adoption will continue to spread, disclosure will become more decision-useful and efficient, and its impact will grow. As firms work to enhance their disclosures, they are being supported by various TCFD Preparers’ Forums from energy to finance.6 The TCFD will also continue to work with market participants to refine metrics so that they are consistent, comparable and decision-useful; and it will share best practices on the disclosure of risk management and governance. In the future, disclosure will move into the mainstream, and it is reasonable to expect that more authorities will mandate it. IOSCO could play a constructive role in coordinating such mandates and in any event, the current iterative process of disclosure, reaction and adjustment will be critical to ensure that these eventual market standards are as comparable, efficient and effective as possible.  Second, risk analysis The second step on the path to a new horizon is better climate change risk management.  Climate change creates both physical and transition risks.7 Physical risks arise from the increased frequency and severity of climate- and weather-related events that damage property and disrupt trade. Transition risks result from the adjustment towards a lower-carbon economy. Changes in policies, technologies and physical risks will prompt a reassessment of the value of a large range of assets as costs and opportunities become apparent. The longer meaningful adjustment is delayed, the more transition risks will rise.  Climate risks also have a number of distinctive elements, which, in combination, require a strategic approach. These include their:  Breadth, as climate risks affect multiple lines of business, sectors and geographies;   Magnitude, as the full impacts of climate risks are large, potentially non-linear and irreversible;  Foreseeable nature;                                                       6 For example the Oil and Gas industry group convened by the World Business Council on Sustainable Development and the Institute of International Finance for banks. 7 The other channel concerns liability risks. These stem from parties who have suffered loss from the effects of climate change seeking compensation from those they hold responsible. Such claims could arise well into the future, as the science and evidence of climate change hardens, though some are already taking action against companies on the grounds of failure to disclose the risks posed to their business models by climate change.

The nature of these risks means that the biggest challenge in climate risk management is in assessing the resilience of firms’ strategies to transition risks.  Part of the genius of the private sector-led TCFD is its recognition that disclosure needs to go beyond the static to the strategic. Markets need information to assess which companies can seize the opportunities in a low carbon economy and which are strategically resilient to the physical and transition risks associated with climate change.  The Bank of England has also become increasingly active in such assessments, consistent with our financial stability and prudential mandates. As the supervisor of the world’s fourth largest insurance industry, we know that general insurers and reinsurers are on the front line of managing the physical risks from climate change. Insurers have responded by developing their modelling and forecasting capabilities, improving exposure management, and adapting coverage and pricing.8 In the process, insurers have learned that yesterday’s tail risk is closer to today’s central scenario. Sadly with climate, history repeats not as a farce but as tragedy and with growing frequency. For banks, the financial risks from climate change have tended to be beyond their planning horizons. The PRA’s survey of 90% of the UK banking sector, representing over $11trn of assets, found that these horizons averaged four years – in other words, before risks would be expected to be fully realised and prior to ambitious climate policies taking effect. 9 That notwithstanding, the PRA’s latest survey finds that almost three quarters of banks are starting to treat the risks from climate change like other financial risks – rather than viewing them simply as a corporate social responsibility issue.  Banks have begun considering the most immediate physical risks to their business models – from the exposure of mortgage books to flood risk, to the impact of extreme weather events on sovereign risk. And they have started to assess exposures to transition risks in anticipation of climate action. This includes exposures to carbon-intensive sectors, consumer loans secured on diesel vehicles, and buy-to-let lending given new energy efficiency requirements.                                                       8 Prudential Regulation Authority.

    All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/default.aspx 6  6  Informed by these findings, the PRA will soon publish its final Supervisory Statement for banks, insurers and investment firms.10 This statement will set out the PRA’s expectations regarding firms’ approaches to managing the financial risks from climate change, including with respect to:   Governance, where firms will be expected to embed fully the consideration of climate risks into governance frameworks, including at board level, and assign responsibility for oversight of these risks to specific senior role holders;  Risk management, where firms will need to consider climate change in line with their board-approved risk appetites;   The regular use of scenario analysis to test strategic resilience; and  Developing and maintaining an appropriate disclosure of climate risks. Recognising the need for industry to build capacity and to develop best practices, the PRA has established a Climate Financial Risk Forum, jointly with the FCA, to work with firms from across the financial system.11 The responses to our supervisory consultation reflect the urgency and significance of the issues. Perhaps for the first time in financial regulation, firms are both thanking their supervisors for raising an issue and pushing us to go further; with some asking for more prescriptive recommendations and others for mandatory disclosures.12 Certainly, while climate risk management is improving, there is more to do particularly when assessing strategic resilience.  For companies, that means conducting scenario analysis.  The TCFD 2018 Status Report found that non-financial industries (energy, transport, building and agriculture) were the most advanced at measuring strategic resilience, including some examples of scenario analysis.13,14  The TCFD review found that the financial sector is also moving toward enhanced strategic analysis. For example half of all insurance companies reviewed used the 2°C scenario, and the majority of banks described the potential impact of climate-related issues on their businesses.                                                        10 Prudential Regulation Authority.

The materials and building sector also had the highest percentage of companies disclosing information about strategic resilience and most provided some information on the climate-related scenarios they used to make these assessments. 
    All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/default.aspx 7  7  However, the September TCFD report showed that while firms were starting to consider strategic resilience, few systematically conducted scenario analysis. Indeed, the PRA has found that despite the sophistication of insurers in modelling climate risks, there are still gaps in their own risk management. The PRA is increasingly focused on cognitive dissonance in some insurers whose careful management of climate risks on the liability side of their balance sheets is not always matched by similar considerations on the asset side. And the PRA’s banking survey last September found that, although almost three quarters of banks recognised the risks of climate change, only one in ten were taking a long term, strategic approach to them.  With that in mind, we expect firms to consider scenario analysis as part of their assessments of the impact of climate risks on their balance sheet and broader business strategy.  An important question is the form these scenarios should take. Climate scenarios aren’t forecasts, but data-driven narratives that help companies think through different possible futures. The scenarios should be comprehensive, rigorous and challenging. The assumptions and methodologies in the models – such as the assumed global temperature rise, the energy mix, or whether the transition happens smoothly or abruptly –  should be sufficiently transparent to allow for comparisons and external challenge. And finally, scenarios should be implemented consistently across the business, linking identification of risks and opportunities to both strategy and disclosure.  To do this, firms will need either to develop their own transition scenarios or build on commonly available models. The TCFD report signposts existing models that firms can use, and the PRA’s Climate Financial Risk Forum will work with industry to review tools and metrics, with the view to publishing reference scenarios and standard assumptions.15 For supervisors, assessing strategic resilience will require climate-related stress testing. This involves linking high-level data-driven narratives on the evolution of physical and transition risks to quantitative metrics to measure the impact on the financial system. Next month, the PRA will ask UK insurers, as part of a market-wide insurance stress test, to consider how their businesses would be affected in different physical and transition risks scenarios.  Testing the banks, and possibly other participants in the financial system, with climate-change scenario stress tests would have two objectives:                                                       15 The most widely used and well-known are the IEA transition scenarios, which model six different assumed pathways and associated temperature increases. For modelling physical risks, the IPCC’s four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) fix greenhouse emissions and analyse the resulting change to the climate.

To consider whether, across the financial system, financing flows are consistent with an orderly transition to the climate outcome set out in the Paris agreement. These long-term scenarios can facilitate discussions between firms and their clients about possible risks across different sectors and geographies; and 2. To consider whether the financial system would be resilient to shorter-term shocks – including a climate “Minsky moment” when climate risks materialise suddenly.  These long and short-term risks are, of course, linked – any overall misalignment with climate goals increases the short-term risks from a disorderly transition, possibly caused by extreme weather events or abrupt shifts in climate policy. A system-wide stress test can help supervisors and climate policymakers judge the adequacy of the current transition and whether further actions could be expected. As the Bank of England considers the timing and design of such a stress test, we are working with colleagues in the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) to develop a small number of high-level scenarios.16 And in our Climate Financial Risk Forum we will work with banks, insurers and asset managers to ensure these scenarios are rolled out effectively within their organisations. Together with our work on this year’s insurance survey, these initiatives will provide a basis for our future assessments of the system-wide exposure to climate risks.  The third and final area is return A new horizon brings new opportunities.  The IEA estimates that the low-carbon transition could require $3.5trn in energy sector investments every year for decades – twice the rate at present. Under their scenario, in order for carbon to stabilise by 2050, nearly 95% of electricity supply will need to be low carbon, 70% of new cars electric, and the CO2 intensity of the building sector will need to fall by 80%. With an estimated US$90 trillion of infrastructure investment expected between 2015 and 2030, smart decisions now can make sure that investment is both financially rewarding and environmentally sustainable.                                                       16 The voluntary network was set up by 8 central banks and supervisors in December 2017 at the One Planet Summit, and has since grown to 29 members, representing countries accounting for nearly half of global emissions, and five observers. It is a voluntary, consensus-based forum whose purpose is to share best practices, contribute to the development of climate- and environment-related risk management in the financial sector and mobilize mainstream finance to support the transition toward a sustainable economy. The analytical work is split into three work streams and the research will be published in April 2019: WS1 microprudential/supervisory; WS2 macrofinancial; and WS3 Scaling up green finance.

The European Commission’s Sustainable Finance Action Plan is developing a classification system for sustainable economic activities, a harmonised green bond standard and methodologies for low-carbon indices.17 The three major credit rating agencies have all integrated environmental risk and green certification into credit ratings. And international organisations such as the Climate Bonds Initiative (CBI) and International Capital Markets Association (ICMA) have developed definitional frameworks, certification and validation methods for green financing.18 This work is helping the green bond market to gather pace, with issuance quadrupling from $45bn in 2015 to $168bn in 2018.19 Last year also saw inaugural sovereign green issues from five countries.20 For investors, green bond markets offer stable, rated and liquid investments with long duration. For issuers, green bonds are a way to tap the huge US$100 trillion pool of patient private capital managed by global institutional fixed-income investors. The shift to the capital markets from banks will also free up limited bank balance sheet capacity for early-stage project financing and infrastructure lending.  Over the last two years, the City of London has been glowing green with sixteen renewable infrastructure funds with a value of $7bn listed on the LSE. The City has been the centre of a series of landmark global green bond issuances, from China’s first Green Covered Bond – the country’s first ever international issuance of a green bond – to the first green Masala Bond worth INR 20bn. In our view, such local currency green bonds will be particularly important to the climate transition in emerging market economies (EMEs).  However, while they are important catalysts, green bonds will not be sufficient to finance the transition to a low carbon future. They accounted for only 3% of global bond issuance in 2018.  Achieving the transition will require mobilising mainstream finance.  Advances in reporting and risk analysis are paving the way for investors to realise the opportunities in climate-friendly investment by re-orienting their focus to broader, more sustainable long-term value creation.  Such investment approaches are becoming increasingly common. There are now almost 2000 signatories, with over $80 trillion in assets under management, to the UN Principles for Responsible Investment (UN PRI), an international network of investors committed to considering ESG factors in their work.21   This swell of support is driven by the expectation that sustainable investment can generate excess returns in three ways.                                                        17 For more information on the Commission’s Sustainable Plan, see: https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/banking-and-finance/sustainable-finance_en  18 See: CBI https://www.climatebonds.net/about and ICMA https://www.icmagroup.org/green-social-and-sustainability-bonds/green-bond-principles-gbp/  19 Climate Bonds Initiative.

This makes them more strategically resilient and therefore able to anticipate, and adapt to, the risks and opportunities on the horizon, generating true alpha from ESG.  Second, strong ESG scores could signal that a firm is more naturally disposed to longer-term strategic thinking and planning. Climate disclosure is increasingly seen not only as necessary in and of itself, but also as informative about the extent to which companies are focused on long-term value creation.  And third, strong ESG firms may enjoy valuation premiums consistent with shifting investor preferences. Millennials, keenly focused on company values and sustainability, are set to inherit $24trn of wealth in the US alone over the next 15 years and will seek the investment opportunities to match.22 Already, assets are moving to ESG strategies at 20 per cent annual growth.23  A review of over 200 sources on ESG performance by Oxford University and Arabesque showed that in the overwhelming majority (88%) of companies that focused on sustainability, operational performance was improved, translating to higher cash flows.24 And meta-analysis of over 2000 studies confirms that the responsible, as well as the economic case for ESG investment is tangible. 90% of studies find that there is no penalty on return on ESG investment, and the majority suggest that focusing on ESG criteria generates a positive return.25 The outperformance of strong ESG companies is uncorrelated with underlying factors such as return on equity or capital employed, and reflects greater earnings stability and lower share price volatility. While “screening” - excluding poor ESG performers - is still the most common tool among investors, some research finds that a more proactive consideration of ESG factors may pay off. 26,27, 28 “Tilt” strategies, which overweight ESG stocks, and “momentum” strategies, which focus on companies that have improved their ESG rating, have outperformed global benchmarks for close to a decade.29                                                        22 Deloitte.

Given this growing track record, companies are developing ways to better score ESG performance and invest accordingly. For example, Arabesque uses machine learning models to assess the performance and sustainability of companies, and stock selection strategies to tailor portfolios to a wide range of investor ESG preferences. This week BNY Mellon adopted such an approach motivated in part by the EU’s Directive on Pensions (IORP II).30 Earlier this year UBS launched a pilot project that will allow investors to rate how much weight they want to place on different ESG factors.31 And last month, BlackRock launched six new Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) that combine an ESG uplift and a 30% reduction in carbon emissions.32 These sustainable building blocks can be substituted into many traditional portfolios, improving ESG scores and reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) intensity without sacrificing performance.  In the future, climate and ESG considerations will likely be at the heart of mainstream investing. Investors will tailor their investments and fulfil their fiduciary duties through: better quality and more widely available data on sustainability and performance; superior data analytics through the advent of AI and Machine Learning; and more informed judgements of strategic resilience.   Conclusion: a New Horizon  Financial policymakers will not drive the transition to a low-carbon economy. Governments will establish the climate policy frameworks, and the private sector will make the necessary investments.  Nonetheless, financial policymakers do have a clear interest in ensuring the financial system is resilient to any transition hastened by those decisions. Our role is to develop the frameworks for markets to adjust efficiently. A market in the transition to a two-degree world is being built. It will reveal how the valuations of companies could change over time as climate policies adapt and carbon intensity declines. It will expose the likely future cost of doing business, of paying for emissions, and of tighter regulation.  It will help smooth price adjustments as opinions change, rather than concentrating in a climate “Minsky moment”.  And it will allow feedback between the market and policymaking, making climate policy a bit more like monetary policy, with policymakers learning from markets’ reactions, and markets internalising policymakers’ objectives, strategies and instruments.                                                       30 See: https://www.bnymellon.com/us/en/newsroom/news/press-releases/bny-mellon-debuts-service-to-evaluate-environmental-social-and-governance-factors-in-investment-performance-03-19-2019-newsid-13.jsp  31 See: https://www.ubs.com/global/en/ubs-news/r-news-display-ndp/en-20190121-wef.html  32 See: https://www.ishares.com/us/strategies/sustainable-investing#esg

A virtuous circle is becoming possible where companies disclose more information, investors make better informed decisions, and sustainable investment goes mainstream.  But the speed with which this market develops will be heavily influenced by the coherence and credibility of climate policies. Finance will complement - and potentially amplify – but never substitute for climate policy action. The policy frameworks with the greatest impact will be: time consistent (not arbitrarily changed); transparent (with clear targets, pricing and costing); and committed (through treaties, nationally determined contributions (NDCs), domestic legislation and consensus).  As countries build their track records and their credibility grows, the market will allocate capital to deliver the necessary innovation and growth and pull forward the adjustment to a low carbon future.  The more prolific the reporting, the more robust the risk assessment and the more widespread the return optimisation, the more rapidly this transition will happen, breaking the Tragedy of the Horizon.    
Cleviston Haynes: Driving change toward the new economyAddress by Mr Cleviston Haynes, Governor of the Central Bank of Barbados, at the Opening ofthe 2019 Week of Excellence, Bridgetown, 25 February 2019.*   *   *Good Morning and welcome to the Courtney Blackman Grande Salle.When I spoke at this event a year ago, I drew attention to the difficult circumstances in which theBarbados economy found itself, the need for urgent decisive action by government and thecritical supportive role of the private sector and labour in meeting the challenges ahead. We canall agree that much has happened since that time. The newly elected political administrationquickly adopted the Barbados Economic Recovery and Transformation plan, with theendorsement of the International Monetary Fund. The Social Partners have been activelyengaged in helping to develop a programme that achieves its objectives while mitigating thepotential adverse effects on the most vulnerable.Already, we are seeing encouraging signs. Our public finances have been reordered to the extentthat we are on target to achieve a primary surplus of 3.3% of GDP for FY 2018/19. Tax refundpayments have resumed and the central government is now making payments on a timely basis.The implementation of the domestic debt restructuring has facilitated a reduction in the debt ratiowhich is now targeted to fall to 60 percent by 2033. Our demonstrated commitment toadjustment and structural reforms has garnered the support of the IDB and the CDB and ourGross International Reserves now exceed the benchmark of 12 weeks of import cover.Confidence, so necessary for investment and growth, is returning.However, we cannot relax as a sustainable path requires us to build on these successes andimplement reforms including those needed to strengthen the financial management of publicenterprises, improve the quality of service delivery within the public sector and enhance taxadministration. These reforms when fully implemented will be closely, no doubt, aligned with yourtheme of “Driving Change Toward the New Economy”.The new economy is knowledge-based and services and technology driven. It promotesinnovation and creativity. It is fast paced and customer-focused. The new economyis competitive and it calls for and requires resilience. It is characterised by volatility,uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity. It reminds us that change is constant.As a small open economy, we have transitioned from agriculture to one led by tourism andinternational business.  As demonstrated last year when government altered its corporate taxstructure to address external challenges in the international business sector, we have to beprepared to adapt to tectonic shifts in the economic environment. In this era of moderncommunications, competition may originate from within or outside our territorial boundaries. Wehave to be assessing constantly our ability to adapt to the threats posed by our competitors andto the potential shocks on the horizon. As an economy, we have to embrace emergingopportunities that promote diversification and enhance competiveness. Firms and industries thatare reluctant or unable to adapt risk extinction.Facing this new economy, therefore, requires change. The Barbados Economic and RecoveryTransformation (BERT) programme symbolizes one aspect of this change as we seek to restoreeconomic and fiscal discipline. However, there is also a need for a change in attitudes, a changein behaviours, a change in mind-set and a change in culture.  William Jefferson Clinton, the 42 president of the United States said that “In the new economy,information, education and motivation are everything.”nd 1 / 2BIS central bankers' speeches
If technology is what will drive this new economy, data is the fuel. Data and analytics will betterallow us to innovate and will inform real-time decision-making. From a Central Bank perspective,having timely and accurate data will allow us to monitor what is happening in the economy, torecognise trends and to make sound recommendations for public policy. More broadly, it will helpBarbados to better understand our markets, whatever the sector, and to target them moreprecisely, so that we can best utilise what are often limited resources. It will help us to navigatethe volatility, the uncertainty, the complexity and the ambiguity of which I spoke earlier.Whether your department or organisation provides the Central Bank with statistics directly, orwhether it is called upon to provide information to other agencies, such as the BarbadosStatistical Service, I encourage you in the public sector to cooperate, ensuring that the data youprovide is accurate and submitted in a timely manner. Remember, it is based on this data thatGovernment makes policy decisions: decisions about new taxes; decisions about expenditurecuts; decisions about capital projects.But using data to guide our decision-making is only half of the equation. The other half is ourability and willingness to embrace the changes that will come with the new economy. That is theeducation and motivation of which President Clinton spoke.Whether you are in the public sector or in the private sector, you will be called upon to do morewith less because of the fiscal and economic constraints. Public sector leaders who now havesmaller budgets need, therefore, to be more nimble and flexible, and to improve efficiency in theiroperations. New approaches to traditional tasks are now needed.The Bank is committed to playing its part in helping the new economy to become a reality bysupporting those who will power it. The financial sector is changing rapidly, and we have toadapt. Already, the Bank is working with government and the private sector to modernise theframework for payments. And, we are automating more of our internal processes and systems toimprove our service to you.The new economy is not something that will just happen. It is something that we have to makehappen. Let us use this Week of Excellence to jumpstart our thinking and our actions in this area.Let us use the opportunity provided by these difficult economic times to finally resolve some ofthe issues with which we have struggled in the past. I want to wish you a good week ofdiscussions and I look forward to the outcomes.I thank you. 2 / 2BIS central bankers' speeches
1    CENTRAL BANK OF KENYA  LAUNCH OF NSE LISTING RULES INCORPORATING LISTING REQUIREMENTS FOR GREEN BONDS  Wednesday, February 20 2019  Keynote Address by Dr. Patrick Njoroge, Governor, Central Bank of Kenya  659 words  Good morning!  First, I want to thank Geoffrey Odundo for getting me out of the office on this fine Wednesday morning. I had a choice between attending a meeting in my office – which overlooks a car park, by the way – and joining you, not just for breakfast, but to breathe some fresh air. This was a good choice of hotel, seeing as it is located in Central Park, which partly serves as a lung for this busy city. When I was appointed to this position, one of the things I sought was regular respite from the pressures of the job. I have told many of you the story before, of how Karura Forest and my Saturday morning runs there help clear my head. Some of you may have joined me on these runs.  I'm not just re-telling this story to prove my running credentials. Karura's existence, and the dogged work put in by the late Professor Wangari Maathai, brought home to Kenyans the value of protecting the environment. I need not remind you that she was also instrumental, three decades ago, in protecting Uhuru Park just next door, and keeping it safe for the people of Nairobi to use. This was years before climate change and environmental protection became buzzwords.   
2  Kenya was a leader in proving the fact that the environment matters. We have been leaders in establishing the principle that we have only borrowed this planet from our children. So we now seek to lead the world in proving that being green pays – that we can take the great strengths of the financial industry and its investment savvy and apply these to the task of protecting the earth and all who live in it.  Kenya, therefore, is one of the pioneers in establishing the green bond market. There is appetite for investing in Africa, in recognition that, of all the investment bets you can make, this is the one that is sure to come up trumps. There is also appetite, as I have mentioned, to use your investment muscle to do good – to help defend the planet against the ravages of climate change and environmental damage. These two impulses come neatly together when we seek to make Nairobi the global hub for green finance.  What must we do, then? What is my challenge to you? This – what we are doing here – is a vital component. We must develop clear guidelines on green finance. The temptation would be to be loose with definition and regulation, in order to ensure that Nairobi is the entrepôt in this new, and essential, field of finance. However, the entrepôt model can have its drawbacks. We must remember that sometimes these may bring the detritus of trade, much as they could bring in high quality commerce. We cannot accept, or afford, to give cover to those who only wish to burnish their greenwashing credentials.  Thus, we must look at the highest quality of green bond issuance. The guidelines that we are launching today should be guided by the Green Bond Principles, which outline clearly how projects are selected, and how proceeds are managed and used; as well as which information is disclosed to investors and how. We must also position Nairobi to be a global centre for the green assessment of bonds. Issues such as verification, consultant review and ratings

It is my hope that when we look back a decade or two hence, we will recall this morning fondly, saying to each other that 'we were there', when we set Nairobi on the path to being a capital of green bonds and green finance. And, incidentally, finding me will be fairly easy. I will be the retired old man reading a book under a tree in Uhuru Park!  Thank you for your attention.

It is great to be here and to hear yourperspectives.As Assistant Governor (Financial System) I oversee the Bank's work on financial stability. But what isfinancial stability and what is the Reserve Bank's role in it?The wellbeing of households and businesses in Australia depends on growth in the Australianeconomy. And a crucial facilitator of sustained growth is credit – flows of funds from people who aresaving to people who are investing. Credit provides households and businesses with the ability toborrow on the back of future expected income to finance large outlays, for example, the purchase ofa home or equipment to establish or grow a business. A strong and stable financial system isimportant for this flow of funds.There is no universal definition of financial stability but one way to think about it is to consider whatis meant by financial instability. My colleague Luci Ellis suggested that this is best thought of as adisruption in the financial sector so severe that it materially harms the real economy. This leavesunsaid where the disruption might come from, but we would all recognise the outcomes of financialstability when we see it. For example, while Australia was spared the worst impact of the globalfinancial crisis, internationally it demonstrated the impact that financial instability can have on growthand hence the wellbeing of households and businesses in the economy.Most of you will know about the Reserve Bank's role in conducting monetary policy. But another keyrole of the Reserve Bank that you might be less familiar with is promoting financial stability. In thisarea, we share responsibility with the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA). But it isAPRA that has responsibility for the stability of individual financial institutions and the tools that goalong with that. So how does the Bank contribute to financial stability? [*] [1] [2]
3/20/2019Property, Debt and Financial Stability | Speeches | RBAhttps://www.rba.gov.au/speeches/2019/sp-ag-2019-03-20.html2/14There are a number of things we do. We undertake analysis of the economy and the financial systemthrough the lens of financial stability, looking for financial vulnerabilities that could result insubstantial negative impacts on the economy, or economic vulnerabilities that could result in risks tofinancial stability. We work with other regulators to identify signs of increasing risks in the financialsystem and measures to address these risks. Where appropriate, we provide advice to governmenton the potential implications for financial stability of policies. And we talk about the risks we areseeing to help inform other regulators, participants in the financial system, businesses and thegeneral public of the potential risks that might have an impact on the economy.This last action – communicating the risks – is the key purpose of our six-monthly Financial StabilityReview (the Review). While any individual financial institution, business or household might think therisks they are taking on are appropriate, they may not be adequately taking into account the risksthat are arising at a systemic level from everyone's actions. The Review attempts to bring thissystem-wide view.Our most recent Review was published in October last year and we are currently in the process ofdrafting the next one, which will come out in April. So, for the remainder of my talk, I am going tocover some of the key risks that we see at the moment. Given the audience, I am going to focus onrisks related to residential and commercial property. First, I will give an update on recentdevelopments in these areas. Then I will talk a little about recent concerns around tighter lendingstandards. And I will finish up with a few observations on the property market in Western Australia.Household DebtSix months ago in the Review, we noted that global economic and financial conditions were generallypositive and that the Australian economy was improving. At the same time, housing prices weredeclining. In this context, we highlighted a number of vulnerabilities – issues that, were a shock tooccur or economic conditions take a turn for the worse, could manifest in a threat to financialstability. At that time, we highlighted two domestic vulnerabilities that are relevant to my talk today– the level of household debt, and the slowdown in housing and credit markets. Six months on,these vulnerabilities remain. If anything, they are a little more heightened.The Bank has highlighted the issue of household debt as a potential threat to financial stability manytimes over the past few years. Although it does not capture all the important information abouthousehold indebtedness, the ratio of household debt to disposable income is one summary indicator.This ratio is historically high (Graph 1). The household debt-to-income ratio rose from around70 per cent at the beginning of the 1990s to around 160 per cent at the time of the GFC. The ratiosteadied for a few years before starting to rise again around 2013 (around the same time thathousing price growth began to accelerate) and is now around 190 per cent.
3/20/2019Property, Debt and Financial Stability | Speeches | RBAhttps://www.rba.gov.au/speeches/2019/sp-ag-2019-03-20.html3/14Graph 1I have talked previously about some of the reasons why the debt-to-income ratio has risen so muchover the past few decades. In particular, a structural decline in the level of nominal interest ratesand deregulation have eased credit constraints and increased loan serviceability. And as householdshave been able to borrow more, they have been able to pay more for housing. One important driverof high household debt in Australia is, therefore, housing. There is very little debt related to non-housing loans such as credit cards or car loans.Just as housing costs have been an important driver of household debt, so has the ability to borrowmore influenced the price of housing. Over the past decade, housing prices in many parts ofAustralia have risen but the rise has been particularly sharp in Sydney and Melbourne, which accountfor around 40 per cent of the housing stock (Graph 2). More recently, housing prices have fallen.Since the peak in mid 2017, housing prices Australia-wide have declined by around 7 per cent. Thefalls in Sydney and Melbourne have been larger. The question we are asking ourselves is, given thehigh levels of debt and falling housing prices, are there any significant implications for financialstability? [3]
3/20/2019Property, Debt and Financial Stability | Speeches | RBAhttps://www.rba.gov.au/speeches/2019/sp-ag-2019-03-20.html4/14Graph 2The answer would be no at this stage – the impacts are not large enough to result in widespreadproblems in the financial sector. This is not to downplay the financial stress that some householdsare experiencing. But most of the debt remains well secured against property, even with the declinein housing prices. Total repayments as a share of income remain steady and a large number ofindebted households have built up substantial prepayments over the past few years. Broadly, thedebt is held by households that can afford to service it. Arrears rates, while increasing a bit over thepast few years, remain low. Banks are well capitalised and work over recent years to improve lendingstandards has made household and bank balance sheets more resilient. Loans at high loan-to-valuation (LVR) ratios and interest-only loans are less common than they were and most householdshave not been borrowing the maximum amount available.Apartment DevelopmentOne area that we have focused on in recent years in our analysis of financial stability risks isapartment development. There has been a substantial increase in apartment construction since thestart of the decade in the largest Australian capital cities (Graph 3). In Sydney there have been morethan 80,000 apartments completed over the past few years adding roughly 5 per cent to housingstock in Sydney. Melbourne and Brisbane have also seen relatively large additions to the supply ofapartments and, while the number of apartments being built in Perth has been small by comparison,this has been in the context of a fairly small apartment stock.
3/20/2019Property, Debt and Financial Stability | Speeches | RBAhttps://www.rba.gov.au/speeches/2019/sp-ag-2019-03-20.html5/14Graph 3Our main concern with this from a financial stability perspective is the potential for this large influx ofsupply to exacerbate declines in housing prices and so adversely impact households' and developers'financial positions. By its nature, high-density development can tend to exacerbate price cycles.Large apartment developments have longer planning and development processes than detachedhousing. Purchasing the land, designing the development, getting approvals through relevantgovernment bodies and then actual construction of the apartment block all take time. In a climate ofrapidly rising prices, developers are willing to pay high prices for land on which to build apartments.Households, including investors, are willing to purchase apartments off the plan, confident that theapartment will be worth more than they paid for it when it is finally completed. This continues aslong as prices are rising. This large increase in supply, however, ultimately sows the seeds of adecline in prices which, if large enough, results in development becoming unattractive, new supplyfalling and the cycle starting again.This presents two risks. The first is to household balance sheets. A decline in apartment prices couldnegatively impact households that purchased off the plan and are yet to settle. They might findthemselves in a situation where the value of the apartment in the current environment is less thanthey contracted to pay for it. And as market pricing falls, lenders will revise their valuations down
3/20/2019Property, Debt and Financial Stability | Speeches | RBAhttps://www.rba.gov.au/speeches/2019/sp-ag-2019-03-20.html6/14and so will be willing to lend less. Households will therefore have to contribute more funds, eitherfrom their own savings or loans from other sources.The second risk is to developers who are delivering completed apartments into the cooling market. Ifpeople who had pre-purchased are having difficulty getting finance, or decide it is not worth goingahead with the purchase, there would be increasing settlement failures. Developers would be leftholding completed apartments, reducing their cash flow and their ability to service their loans, andimpacting banks' balance sheets.Currently, the risks here appear to be elevated but contained. The apartment market is quite soft inSydney; apartment prices have declined since their peak, rental vacancies have risen and rents arefalling (Graph 4). In Melbourne and Brisbane, however, apartment prices have so far held up. Liaisonsuggests that settlement failures have not increased much and, to the extent that they have, somedevelopers are in a position where they can choose to hold and rent unsold apartments. Furthertightening in lending standards might, however, impact both purchasers of new apartments anddevelopers – I will return to this in a minute.Graph 4Commercial PropertyA final area worth touching on is non-residential commercial property.
3/20/2019Property, Debt and Financial Stability | Speeches | RBAhttps://www.rba.gov.au/speeches/2019/sp-ag-2019-03-20.html7/14Commercial property valuations have, like housing, risen substantially over the past decade, andmuch more than rents so that yields on commercial property have fallen to very low levels historically(Graph 5). This is particularly the case for office and industrial property. One reason for this is thatyields, although they have been historically low in Australia, are high relative to overseas and toreturns on other assets. Furthermore, some markets, such as the Sydney and Melbourne officeproperty markets, are experiencing strong tenant demand and vacancy rates are low. But the rapidincrease in commercial property prices over the past decade does pose risks. If transaction pricesand valuations were to fall sharply, for example, in response to a change in risk preferences, highlyleveraged borrowers could be vulnerable to breaching their LVR covenants on bank debt. This couldtrigger property sales and further price falls, exacerbating the cycle.Graph 5Lending StandardsWith that background, I want to turn to an issue that has attracted a fair bit of attention in recentmonths – the role that tightening lending standards might have played in the downturn in credit andthe housing market. We published a special chapter in the October 2018 Review on this issue andthe Deputy Governor discussed it in a speech in November last year so I will only cover it brieflyhere. [4]
3/20/2019Property, Debt and Financial Stability | Speeches | RBAhttps://www.rba.gov.au/speeches/2019/sp-ag-2019-03-20.html8/14Lending standards have been tightening since late 2014, well before housing prices in the easternstates started to turn down. The initial tightening occurred in December 2014 in response to veryfast growth in lending to housing investors and an assessment by APRA that banks' lending practicescould be improved. APRA required banks to tighten their lending practices in a number of areas,including interest rate buffers, verification of borrower income and expenses, and high LVR lending.The measure that got the most attention at that time, however, was the ‘investor lendingbenchmark’ in which APRA indicated that supervisors would be paying particular attention to anyinstitutions with annual investor credit growth exceeding 10 per cent. The idea was that it would betemporary while APRA worked with the banks on addressing lending standards.The benchmark and the tightening of standards didn't have an immediate impact on the pace ofinvestor lending. It didn't really start to bite until the middle of 2015 when banks introduced higherinterest rates for loans to investors. And at that point, growth in lending to investors slowed sharply(Graph 6).Graph 6Once things settled down, however, and banks were comfortable that they were well below thebenchmark, the growth in lending to investors started to pick up again. Then, in March 2017, APRAintroduced restrictions on the share of new interest-only lending as part of its broader suite ofmeasures to strengthen lending practices. As part of this, APRA reinforced its investor benchmark.While the interest-only measure was focused on reducing the volume of higher-risk lending rather
3/20/2019Property, Debt and Financial Stability | Speeches | RBAhttps://www.rba.gov.au/speeches/2019/sp-ag-2019-03-20.html9/14than lending to a particular type of borrower, there was a noticeable impact on the growth in lendingto housing investors since interest-only loans tend to be the product of choice for many investors.Both the investor lending benchmark and the interest-only lending benchmark have been removedfor banks that have provided assurances on their lending policies and practices to APRA. But theimprovements in lending practices implemented by the banks over the past few years have resultedin credit conditions being tighter than they were a few years ago. Application processes have beentaking a bit longer as lenders are being more diligent about verifying borrower income and expenses,borrowers are generally being offered smaller maximum loans and some borrowers are finding itmore difficult to obtain a loan. Banks are more closely adhering to their lending policies, resulting infewer exceptions being granted and there are fewer high LVR and interest-only loans beingapproved.There have been some concerns expressed that these developments have been a key reason for theslowing in credit growth over the past year. Coupled with possibly some increased risk aversion offront-line lending staff in the wake of the Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking,Superannuation and Financial Services Industry, the concern is that this has been impacting housingcredit growth and, by extension, housing prices. As concluded in the Banks' February Statement onMonetary Policy, and noted by the Governor in a recent speech, tighter credit conditions do notappear to be the main reason for declining housing credit growth. The evidence points towardsdeclining demand for housing credit as being a more important factor.Nevertheless, it is possible that tighter lending standards could be impacting developers ofapartments. This could be direct, reflecting banks' desire to reduce their exposure to the propertymarket, particularly high-density development. But it could also be indirect by banks tightening theirlending standards for purchases of new apartments, hence impacting pre-sales for developers andtheir ability to obtain finance. The Deputy Governor noted this in a speech in November 2018 andconcluded that this was of potentially higher risk to the economy than household lending standards.From a financial stability perspective, prudent lending standards are a good thing. They ensure thathouseholds and banks are resilient to changes in circumstances. But there needs to be a balance.The regulators are not proposing any further tightening in lending standards. And the appropriateamount of credit risk is not zero – banks need to continue to lend and that will inevitably involvesome credit losses.Western AustraliaFinally, I want to turn my focus to developments in Western Australia. As you will have seen fromsome of my earlier graphs, the Western Australian circumstances are somewhat different to those ofthe eastern capital cities. There are two aspects I would like to focus on – household resilience andthe commercial property sector.Housing prices in Perth have been declining for some years (Graph 7). The peak in housing prices inPerth was in the middle of 2014. This followed a period of strong housing price growth as thepopulation of Western Australia increased strongly during the mining investment boom and housing [5]
3/20/2019Property, Debt and Financial Stability | Speeches | RBAhttps://www.rba.gov.au/speeches/2019/sp-ag-2019-03-20.html10/14construction took longer to ramp up. When housing construction did respond, however, populationgrowth had slowed markedly and housing prices started to fall. Median housing prices have fallen byaround 12 per cent since 2014.Graph 7This has clearly been a difficult time for many homeowners in Western Australia. There are somehouseholds that are having difficulty meeting repayments, as evidenced by a rising arrears rate inWestern Australia (Graph 8). At this stage, however, the losses are not large enough to threaten thestability of the financial sector. We nevertheless continue to monitor the situation for any potentialsystemic impacts.
3/20/2019Property, Debt and Financial Stability | Speeches | RBAhttps://www.rba.gov.au/speeches/2019/sp-ag-2019-03-20.html11/14Graph 8Finally, office property in Western Australia has also been experiencing oversupply. Valuations havefallen over the past decade (Graph 9). Rents have also fallen reflecting a sharp increase in officevacancy rates in Perth's CBD over the past few years (Graph 10). This makes for a challengingenvironment for owners of these buildings, particularly for owners of older or lower quality officebuildings as tenants have taken the opportunity to move into newer buildings as rents have comedown. But again, while a difficult time for developers and owners of office buildings, the financialstability implications seem limited.

Whileso far, the financial sector has remained resilient, we continue to monitor developments in householddebt and in property markets for signs that these might have more broad ranging effects on thefinancial system.EndnotesI am grateful to Nicole Adams and Cathie Close for assistance with this speech.[*]https://www.rba.gov.au/speeches/2014/sp-so-fs-040614.html[1]While the Bank's objective for monetary policy is low and stable inflation, in setting monetary policy to achieve this ittakes into account its financial stability objective.

Denis Beau: Opportunities and risks of evolving sources offinancing for the economySpeech by Mr Denis Beau, First Deputy Governor of the Bank of France, at "Les Rencontres dufinancement de l’économie", organized by Option Finance, Paris, 26 March 2019.*   *   *Accompanying slides.Ladies and gentlemen, I am very happy to introduce the 6th edition of the Rencontres dufinancement de l’économie. As a backdrop to your discussions, I would like to focus on theongoing changes in the financing of the French and European economies and the relatedopportunities and risks, both from the point of view of a central bank, the Banque de France, andof a supervisor, the ACPR, which are responsible for ensuring the stability of our financial systemand for contributing to a financing of economic growth that is resilient to shocks and sound. Thisconcern for strong and effective financing of growth is highly topical for three reasons:- the downside risks to the euro area’s outlook for expansion have increased in recent months,– the digital revolution has started to spread widely across our economies, offering opportunitiesand gains but also raising threats for those who are unable to adjust,– the predominance of bank lending, which accounts for 60% of corporate debt in France [Slide1]. The remaining 40% stems from market financing, which is the exclusive preserve of largeenterprises. This situation is not unique to France. It is quite widespread in Europe, in contrastwith what prevails in the United States.Already, several factors, such as the search for yield driven by a low interest rate environment,new regulatory constraints on the banking system, and digitalisation, are changing the way inwhich financing is designed, produced, distributed and managed. This transformation isleading to a more diversified financing structure for our economies. Is thisdiversification desirable? Is this diversification sufficient?1. A desirable diversification of financing modes to spur growth and innovation, whichmust be further supportedMy answer to the first question is yes because too strong a reliance on bank financing mayconstitute a source of vulnerability for business development in the event of a shock affecting thebanking system. However, the relatively slow pace of development of this diversificationshows that it is not so simple to achieve, and that it should be further encouraged. A. In the short term, the efforts made to adapt the regulatory framework and standardisethe alternative sources of financing to bank lending should be pursued.In recent years, public authorities have made significant efforts to adapt the regulatory frameworkin order to support the development of alternative sources of financing to bank lending. Theseefforts must be pursued and matched by those of private players to standardise the market.Thus, since 2017, the European Union has established a set of new rules for the development ofsound securitisation, i.e. that is simple, transparent and standardised, to free banks’ balancesheet and thus encourage the issuance of new loans, while offering bond market exposure toborrowers which generally do not have access to such markets, such as SMEs. The potential fordevelopment is significant: in the euro area, ABS and MBS issuance is three times lower todaythan before the 2008 crisis.1 1 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
Other actions concern investment vehicles that enable companies to benefit from resourcesstemming from investors willing to take greater risks. For example, Euro Private Placements(EuroPP), for which a charter was drawn up in 2015, are now complementary to USPPs in theUnited States and Schuldscheine in Germany. Amounts issued by French companies totalledEUR 2.28 billion in 2018, but have been declining since the peak of 2015 (EUR 4.3 billion)because they do not offer sufficiently attractive interest rates. It is therefore important that marketprofessionals pursue their efforts to promote this type of investment and step up their actions tostandardise the market.Conversely, the growth of crowdfunding platforms, albeit modest, is rising in France, even if theeconomic model for these platforms has not yet reached its equilibrium, with EUR 402 millionraised in 2018, up 20% on the previous year, and a growing number of funded projects. Thisdevelopment benefited from the regulatory framework for crowdfunding implemented in 2014 andupdated in 2016. This French framework should be further relaxed with the PACTE Act.Eventually, a draft European regulation currently under discussion could partially replace theFrench framework with a harmonised European statute and thus promote the development ofcross-border transactions.As regards Initial Coin Offerings (ICO), which enable start-ups to raise crypto asset funds veryrapidly, their flows in France are still small (EUR 71.7 million during the first three quarters of2018, 0.5% of the world total) but are booming (4 times higher than in 2017). The legislativeframework, in preparation, will provide valuable benchmarks for investors, and is likely toincrease their confidence in the mechanisms associated with crypto assets and thus promotetheir development.B. In the longer term, the objective should be to strengthen capital to finance innovationIn an economy close to the “technological frontier", as is the case in France, the key to growthlies in business innovation, and therefore in equity financing in the long term: as innovation ismore risky, financing it must yield greater rewards.However, in France, household savings are only modestly invested in equity products, and this isreflected in corporate financing. [Slide 2] There is a significant contrast between the UnitedStates and France, where corporate equity accounts for 122% and 77% of GDP respectively.From this point of view, France is not different from the rest of the euro area with the exception ofGermany (80%).What are the solutions?At the national level, the PACTE Act proposes certain advances in life insurance, which is by farFrench households’ leading form of financial savings (EUR 1,700 billion at end-2018), inparticular to promote the Euro-Growth Fund by making it simpler and more understandable forsavers and to increase insurers’ investment in innovation financing. The French authorities arealso very careful that the current review of the Solvency II Directive is favourable to the long-terminvestment of insurers in equities.At the European level [Slide 3], we need to build a real “Financing Union for Investment andInnovation” to better steer our resources – a savings surplus of EUR 345 billion in the euro area– towards equity and innovation. This Financing Union must bring together and amplify existinginitiatives, the Capital Markets Union, the Banking Union and the Juncker Investment Plan.I would now like to answer my second question: is the diversification of sources of financingsufficient? From my point of view, the answer is no because diversification carries risks thatneed to be well managed.II. Diversifying sources of financing is a complex business whose success requires2345 2 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
managing all the traditional and new risks faced by intermediariesA. First, there are the risks linked to fast-growing private sector debtCorporate debt in France is growing much faster than in the rest of Europe [Slide 4]. We are nowsignificantly above the euro area average. This raises the question of the sustainability of thisdebt, and of the impact of an upward shock to interest rates or a downward shock to activity,especially in an increasingly uncertain macroeconomic context (trade tensions, Italian budget,Brexit, yellow vests).Given the situation, it was essential to avoid an infinite debt spiral. In December 2017, the HautConseil de Stabilité Financière, under the chairmanship of Minister Bruno Le Maire, thus decidedto lower to 5% of their equity the ceiling of the main banks’ exposures to the most indebted largecompanies. It also decided to raise the countercyclical capital buffer of French banks, by 0.25%in June 2018 and again by 0.25% in March 2020. This countercyclical buffer, expressed as apercentage of core equity and applied to French exposures, aims at enabling banks to build up acapital reserve to maintain their supply of credit in the event of a turnaround in the financial cycle,the buffer then being immediately released.However, these binding instruments apply only to banks, while non-bank intermediation is playingan increasing role in financing the economy. According to the ECB, the loans and deposits ofinvestment funds have risen threefold since 2011. Macroprudential policy thus needs to beadjusted to better take account of this new dimension. The HCSF is firmly committed to this goal.Its powers enable it to intervene outside the banking sector and it has started designing stresstests that cover all sectors.B. At the same time, a number of new, more structural risks are also emerging, broughtabout by digitalisation and global warmingDigitisation first gives a systemic dimension to cyber risk. The expansion of digital practicescontributes to the propagation of cyber risk and amplifies it, through the interconnectionsbetween financial institutions, but also between them and their service providers. The fact thatsome of these providers are Fintechs and Bigtechs, which are unregulated and not easilysubstitutable, is an additional vulnerability factor.To cope with these risks, we must resist the temptation to set up a bunker-style security system,which is a dead end, but rather imagine a system which combines openness and innovation.This is why we, at the Banque de France and the ACPR, are working with the other supervisorsof the Eurosystem to ensure that the entities we supervise take cyber risk into account and to setup a broad programme for protecting the infrastructures that we operate. Cyber security is one ofthe key priorities of the French Presidency of the G7 in 2019. The Banque de France alsocontributes to the work conducted in this wider framework by coordinating the preparation andimplementation of a cyber resilience test for the global financial sector.As regards the risks associated with climate change, they can no longer be ignored. Physicalrisks – which correspond to the rise in the frequency and severity of extreme weatherphenomena – are obviously the most visible and immediate for the financial sector. Transitionrisks – which stem from the adjustment to a low-carbon economy – are longer term andtherefore less visible. To better assess these risks, we need to both measure exposures andperform forward-looking stress tests.We also need to develop the considerable opportunities associated with the financing of thetransition to a low-carbon economy [Slide 5] – this involves finding close to USD 90 trillion by2030 – while preventing the risk of greenwashing.

about to join.ConclusionTo conclude and summarise my speech, the diversification of sources of financing holds thepromise of improving the financial system’s ability to support innovation and sustainableeconomic growth, as long as this diversification is encouraged and its risks are well managed.Given this promise, the slow pace of change, the modest progress towards a capital marketsunion, the complexity of the challenges of digitalisation and green finance should encourage us tocontinue to act with determination, patience and perseverance. On the way, we can seek supportand comfort in this quote by the former President of the Czech Republic, Vaclav Havel: “Hope isnot the conviction that something will turn out well, but the certainty that something makes sense,regardless of how it turns out".Thank you for your attention.Source: DealogicSource: Société GénéraleSource: Baromètre du crowdfunding en France 2018, Financement Participatif France and KPMGSource: Autorité des marchés financiersCurrent account surplus over the 12-month period ending in January 2019 (source: ECB)12345 4 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
Yandraduth Googoolye: Cross-border regulation in relation todigital assetsSpeech by Mr Yandraduth Googoolye, Governor of the Bank of Mauritius, at the ADC GlobalBlockchain Summit, Adelaide, 27 March 2019.*   *   *The Honourable Steven Marshall, Premier of South AustraliaMajor General the Honourable Michael Jeffery, Forum PatronExcellenciesLadies and gentlemenAll protocol observed1.    Introductory RemarksIt is a great pleasure for me to be in the midst of such an august gathering today.First of all, I would like to thank Honourable Steven Marshall MP, Premier of South Australia forthe invitation to attend this Summit 2019 and share my thoughts, as a central bank governor andregulator of the banking sector in Mauritius, on cross-border regulation of Digital Assets.I would also like to thank Loretta Joseph, Fintech Adviser to the OECD, for having facilitated myparticipation to this Summit.2.    Fintech and Digital assets and central bank digital currenciesFintech and digital assets are areas that the Bank of Mauritius has been following closely.  The international community has also shown keen interest in this sector.The Financial Stability Board (FSB), Financial Action Task Force (FATF), International MonetaryFund (IMF), Bank for International Settlement (BIS) and fellow foreign international standardsetters and regulators have shared their thought, concerns and recommendations regardingfintech and digital assets.We must obviously distinguish between digital assets and central bank digital currency.  Whilethe latter are usually created and issued by central bank and is legal tender, digital assets, on theother hand, are not “legal tender, and are not backed by any government or public authority” asthe Basel Committee on Banking Supervision clearly puts it.The FATF recommends countries to consider virtual assets as “property,” “proceeds,” “funds”,“funds or other assets,” or other “corresponding value”.”3.    The need to regulate Digital AssetsHistory has shown that regulatory gaps or vacuum have contributed to perpetuate fraud, led tofinancial crisis and undermined confidence in the financial services sector, amongst others.The BIS, in its September 2018 Quarterly Review, reported that news pointing to theestablishment of legal frameworks tailored to cryptocurrencies and initial coin offerings coincidewith strong market gains. 1 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
There is need, therefore, for Digital Assets to be regulated.  Indeed, regulation brings legalcertainty, legitimacy, trust and confidence in markets and will undeniably act as a catalyst inpromoting acceptance of digital assets. These regulations should, nonetheless, not be too intrusive, but rather, it must be optimal andenabling so as to promote innovation in this technology-driven sector.4.    International Standards and recommendation regarding Digital AssetsPrudential NormsThe Basel Committee on Banking Supervision has, on 13 March 2019, issued a Statement onCrypto-Assets wherein the Basel Committee opines that “the continued growth of crypto-assetstrading platforms and new financial products related to crypto-assets has the potential to raisefinancial stability concerns and increase risks faced by banks.”The Basel Committee has accordingly set out its prudential expectations related to banks’exposures to crypto-assets and related services.  The Basel Committee views that on accountof their high degree of volatility, crypto-assets present a number of risks for banks, includingliquidity risk; credit risk; market risk; operational risk (including fraud and cyber risks); moneylaundering and terrorist financing risk; and legal and reputation risks.The Committee therefore expects that if a bank is authorised and decides to acquire crypto-asset exposures or provide related services, it should at a minimum:Firstly, perform due diligence prior to acquiring exposures to crypto-assets or providingrelated services,Secondly, have a clear and robust risk management framework that is appropriate for therisks of its crypto-asset exposures and related services;Thirdly, publicly disclose any material crypto-asset exposures or related services as partof its regular financial disclosures and specify the accounting treatment for suchexposures;Fourthly, inform its supervisory authority of actual and planned crypto-asset exposure oractivity in a timely manner and provide assurance that it has fully assessed thepermissibility of the activity and the risks associated with the intended exposures andservices, and how it has mitigated these risks.As regulators, it is our responsibility to ensure that supervised institutions are operated safely andsoundly and comply with applicable laws.Within that framework, however, we also have a strong interest in permitting beneficialinnovations to flourish, while ensuring that the risks are appropriately managed.It is, therefore, of paramount importance to ensure that regulatory and supervisory structures areconstantly adapted to changing technologies and business models for them to remain effective. At the level of the Bank of Mauritius, our approach has been characterized by open minds andopen door policy. We welcome change in banks so long as they are able to demonstrate that therisks are being appropriately and adequately managed.   Moreover, as all prudent central banks, the Bank of Mauritius will also pay special attention to therecommendations of the Basel Committee and require banks operating in Mauritius to ensurestrict compliance thereto.  2 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
Addressing the concerns regarding Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing risksConcerns have been expressed to the effect that digital assets offer some form of anonymity toits holders if not properly regulated and controlled and may be subject to heightened moneylaundering and terrorism financing (ML/TF) risks.In an era where ML/TF risks are assuming increasing significance and may even result ininternational sanctions and loss of correspondent banking facilities, regulators need to beextremely vigilant.International Standard Setting Bodies have also identified the potential ML/TF risks that could risefrom digital assets and they have been prompt in providing necessary guidance. As far back as2015, the FATF identified certain key risks associated with Crypto Assets, including ML/TF, crossborder nature of operating systems and non-face to face client relationships which facilitatesanonymity. In October 2018, the FATF, recognising the need to adequately mitigate the money launderingand terrorism financing (ML/TF) risks associated with virtual asset activities, adopted, changes tothe FATF Recommendations to clarify how the Recommendations apply in the case of financialactivities involving virtual assets.The FATF recommended countries to ensure that virtual asset service providers are regulatedfor AML/CFT purposes, and licensed or registered and subject to effective systems formonitoring and ensuring compliance with the relevant measures called for in the FATFRecommendations. More recently, in February 2019, the FATF announced that it is setting out more detailedimplementation requirements for effective regulation and supervision/monitoring of virtual assetservices providers which are expected to be adopted at the June 2019 Plenary of the FATF. As the FATF Recommendations are globally accepted standards, it is very likely that, whenestablishing the regulatory framework for digital assets, countries will adhere to these standards.5.    The experience of Mauritius in regulating Digital Assets – Development of regulatoryframeworks in line with international standardsAllow me to share the experience of Mauritius in regulating Digital Assets.Last year, the Government of Mauritius took the initiative of setting up a Regulatory Committee onFinTech and Innovation-Driven Financial Services chaired by Lord Desai and comprisingamongst others Loretta Joseph, Rajesh Ramloll S.C., Deputy Solicitor General at the AttorneyGeneral’s Office, Mauritius, the Chief Executive of the Financial Services Commission, othereminent experts from in fintech regulation, blockchain as well as artificial intelligence industry andmyself.  The Regulatory Committee was tasked to advise on the development of a regulatoryframework for fintech in Mauritius.The Regulatory Committee identified priority areas in the fintech space to be considered forregulation in Mauritius and recommended the approach to be adopted in regulating this emergingsector of activities.Further to the report of the Regulatory Committee, the Financial Services Commission,Mauritius, which is the integrated regulator for the non-bank financial services sector and globalbusiness in Mauritius, was identified as the most appropriate authority in Mauritius to promote theregulatory framework for digital assets in Mauritius. In September 2018, the Financial Services Commission issued Guidance Note on the 3 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
recognition of digital assets as an asset-class for investment by sophisticated and expertinvestors.Subsequently, on 05 November 2018, the Financial Services Commission issued a ConsultationPaper seeking feedback from stakeholders and the public on the proposed regulatory frameworkfor the Custodian Services (Digital Asset) Licence, which allows its holder to provide custodyservices for Digital Assets.The Consultation Paper has now been translated in a set of Rules which became effective asfrom 01 March 2019, thereby positioning the Mauritius IFC as the first jurisdiction globally to offera regulated landscape for the custody of Digital Assets. The Financial Services Commission has ensured that the distinct regulatory frameworks are inline with international standards set by institutions like the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the FATF.Mauritius has participated fully in discussions at the level of the OECD on the governance andregulation of Digital Financial Assets and the regulatory framework for this activity segment hasbeen developed in reference to these international consultations and the FATFRecommendations have been fully considered in the regulatory approach taken by Mauritius toregulate the custody of digital assets as a business activity.As technology is a constantly evolving affair, we need to be at the forefront of the latestdevelopment. This requires specialized skillsets which might not be available in all regulatorybodies, thereby heightening the need for continued upskilling and capacity building. 6.    Cross-border regulationWith the globalisation of financial services, collaboration has always been a requirement forfinancial services regulators across the globe. The need for cross border cooperation betweenfinancial services regulators is becoming even more crucial in relation to fintech.Adherence to a common set of standards will foster standardization of the regulation acrosscountries and facilitate cross-border regulation of digital assets.Obviously, cross border regulation implies cooperation and collaboration between regulators.It is common practice for financial services regulators to sign Memorandum of Understanding(MoU) with their counterparts for cooperation and exchange of information in the field ofconventional financial services.These MoU may now have to be extended to collaboration in Fintech and financial innovation.It may be foreseen that such collaboration will improve the cross-border regulation of fintech anddigital assets through:a.    Harmonised/Equivalent fintech regulatory frameworks across jurisdictionswhich is an effective tool against regulatory arbitrage and will enable licensedfintech business to have access to other markets;b.    Bridging the expertise gap between jurisdictions for efficient frameworkdevelopment; andc.     Capacity building and knowledge sharing in the field of fintech supervision forfinancial services regulators.Concluding remarks1 4 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
The launch, in January 2019, of the Global Financial Innovation Network aims at acting as anetwork of regulators to promote information and knowledge sharing on emerging innovationtrends as well as promoting joint policy work and regulatory trials by enhancing collaborationbetween regulators on key policy questions with the view to support the work of standard settingbodies, amongst others.All of us in this room who have a keen interest in promoting financial innovation shouldcollaborate and support this initiative in the hope that a standardized and agreed sets ofprinciples and practices for fintech and digital assets may unfold soon for the benefit of themarket participants and regulators alike.Summits, similar to this one, acts as incubators for sharing our thoughts and vision for thisinnovative sector.  I am confident that this Summit will foster cooperation and collaborationbetween regulators, investors and international organisations.  I wish us all success in this area.  GFIN has been established by an international group of financial regulators and related organizations is anindication of the willingness of the global community to promote financial innovation in an efficient and orderlymanner11 5 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
Øystein Olsen: Managing natural resources - lessons from NorwaySpeech by Mr Øystein Olsen, Governor of Norges Bank (Central Bank of Norway), at the seminar&quot;Preparing Mozambique for natural gas&quot;, Bank of Mozambique, Maputo, 27 March2019.*   *   *Accompanying slides.Let me start by expressing my heart-felt sympathy for the victims of the cyclone that struck yourcountry. I am both honoured and saddened to be here at this difficult time. I can hardly imaginethe pain and sorrow so many of your people are now experiencing.Mozambique is a country of great beauty and is now an emerging leader in the natural gasindustry.. For Norway, on the other hand, petroleum production peaked some years ago. As anation, we have benefited tremendously from the revenues and the activities. Let me share someof our experiences with you.Norway is a small, open economy, which was transformed by the discovery of oil on ourcontinental shelf almost 50 years ago. Back in 1970, the year after the first discovery, incomelevels were relatively low compared with other western countries. That picture has changedcompletely. Today, Norway ranks among the richest countries in the world.For some countries, natural resource discoveries have been identified as a curse. For Norway,the discovery of oil has been a blessing. We have managed to transform oil and gas resourcesinto real and financial assets. Luck has been supplemented with what I dare to claim is sensibleresource management, based on a well-functioning democracy and longstanding andtrustworthy institutions.The first point I would like to emphasise is related to ownership of the natural resources. At anearly stage, it was concluded that such resources belong to the Norwegian people.Direct government participation in the industry and an extraordinary tax rate on oil companyprofits, currently 78 percent, ensure that most of the resource rents flow into government coffers.The government also has direct ownership stakes in the most profitable oil fields.Chart: From natural resources to financial wealthPetroleum revenues have been redistributed to all inhabitants in form of investment ininfrastructure and public services, such as education and health care. At the same time,revenues have been put aside.This brings me to my second main point. It is important to remember that although revenuesfrom the extraction of a depletable resource count as income in the national accounts, theserevenues are of a special kind. In many ways, it would make more sense to view them astransformation of wealth – from natural resources in the ground to financial assets. This is theidea behind the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund, known as the Government Pension FundGlobal.Chart: The petroleum fund mechanismAll oil revenues are channelled to the fund. The fund’s capital is invested abroad, mainly inequities, but also in bonds and real estate. Investments are spread across most markets,countries and currencies to achieve broad exposure to global growth and value creation, andensure good risk diversification. 1 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
The fund was established in 1990, during Norway’s deepest recession in the postwar period. Atthe time, it was not obvious that the fund would gain much in value. The government ran budgetdeficits in the following years. The first capital transfer to the fund was made in 1996, reflecting anet fiscal surplus. From then on, the value of the fund started to increase rapidly. Higher oilrevenues towards 2000 led to calls for higher spending. Political pressure to spend moreevolved. A fiscal rule was established in response to this development. The aim was to phasepetroleum revenues into the economy gradually.The fiscal rule guides the annual transfers from the fund to the fiscal budget. It limits averagepetroleum revenue spending over the cycle to the expected real return on the fund – currentlyestimated at 3 percent – over a business cycle.The rule established a long term petroleum revenue spending strategy. The government maydeviate from the 3 percent rule depending on the circumstances. If the economy is facing asevere downturn, there should be room for a more expansionary policy. During the great financialcrisis, the Norwegian government was able to allow public spending to increase in order tocounteract the downturn. More recently, petroleum revenue spending over the fiscal budget hasbeen less than 3 percent of the value of the fund. This has happened in a situation where theeconomic cycle has turned up at the same time as the value of the fund has increased rapidly.Fiscal restraint has proved to be a wise policy.Together, the oil fund and the fiscal rule have shown themselves to constitute a robustframework. This framework enjoys cross-party support. After the fiscal rule was introduced in2001, all succeeding governments have based their policy on this guidelineThe advantages of this framework are many. First, it allows us to separate spending fromincome. When we smooth petroleum revenue spending over time, we reduce the risk ofcrowding out private businesses. At the same time, we protect public budgets from substantialfluctuations in revenues.Second, the considerable savings amassed in recent years mean that future generations willalso benefit from petroleum revenues. Norway’s petroleum wealth does not only belong to thoseliving today. We try to be good stewards, like the farmer who cares for the soil and passes it onto succeeding generations so they too can harvest from it. In the case of Norway, we pass ournatural resource wealth on to our descendants in the form of financial assets.Chart: The GPFG – Governance modelBefore continuing, let me say some words about the fund’s governance structure and theinteraction between the Norwegian parliament, the Ministry of Finance and Norges Bank. NorgesBank has been tasked with managing the fund since its establishment. The legislative basis forthe fund is decided by the parliament, while the Ministry lays down the management mandatethat is issued to Norges Bank. Moreover, the Ministry has established a practice wherebydecisive changes are submitted to the parliament for approval.According to the management mandate, the Norges Bank shall seek to achieve the highestpossible long-term real return with moderate risk. The mandate sets the benchmark index andtracking error limits. In addition, the mandate imposes constraints on the fund’s investmentuniverse. The investment strategy is largely determined by the mandate. The role of the Bankand its Executive Board in formulating and elaborating the management mandate is to advise theMinistry. This is an important job.For the Ministry, the formulation of the management mandate, reporting and supervision will beimportant tools for ensuring that investments are managed in line with objectives. Thanks to itsextensive reporting, the fund enjoys a reputation of being one of the world’s most transparentsovereign wealth funds. For a fund with the entire population as actual owners, transparency is 2 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
vital for ensuring democratic control and confidence in investment management.Chart: A large fundSince the first transfer to the fund was made in 1996, the value of the fund has risen to almostthree times mainland GDP. During periods of substantial oil and gas revenues, large capitaltransfers have been made to the fund. In this chart this is shown as the dark blue bars. Thereturn on the fund has been solid, as shown as the light blue bars. The accumulated incomefrom financial assets makes up a significant part of the fund’s current value. The yellow bars inthe chart show fund withdrawals used to finance the structural non-oil budget deficit.Both returns and exchange rates vary over time. Rising equity prices have generated substantialgains for the fund in recent years. But this means we must also be prepared for losses whenmarkets turn, as they did last year.As I have said, Norwegian society has gained in several ways from petroleum extraction. Theearnings from selling oil and gas are only a part of the story. The emergence of a highlyadvanced and skilled offshore industry is another part. This is the third experience I would like toshare with you. From the start of Norway’s petroleum era, we needed foreign technical expertise.Foreign oil companies were required to develop the petroleum fields in partnership with a state-owned oil company. Just as important as a certain degree of national control was the transfer ofknowledge.There was also a clear expectation from the very beginning that Norwegian industry and serviceproviders should be involved. The timing was perfect. In the 1970s, the Norwegian shipbuildingindustry faced a sharp drop in demand for ships. The industry had resources and skills that couldbe reoriented to production of platforms and other oil industry inputs.Since then, Norway has benefitted greatly from the opportunities that the petroleum sector hasprovided. The spillover effects from the oil sector to the wider Norwegian economy aresubstantial. Oil-related jobs can be found throughout the country. More than 10 percent of allemployed persons in Norway either directly or indirectly work for the oil industry. Innovation andskills development in the industry have also benefitted other sectors.From where Norway stands today, one may get the impression that our history as an oil nation isonly a story about success. This is not the case.Chart: Oil and gas revenues and government spendingPolicymakers’ handling of Norway’s newly discovered petroleum wealth got off to a rather bumpystart. During the first 25 years of oil production, Norway experienced two deep recessions. Bothdownturns were rooted in wildly optimistic income expectations. In the 1970s, public spendingsurged before oil export revenue started to kick in. Eventually the government had to tighten fiscalpolicy. In the 1980s, a credit-fuelled consumption boom in the private sector led to necessarycut-backs after the oil price plunge in 1986. The turbulence made clear how vulnerable a smalleconomy is to terms of trade disturbances. Let that part of our history stand as a warning. Butlessons were learned, and formed the basis for the framework that was put in place from 1990and onwards.During the past 50 years, Norway has experienced how oil prices can change almost overnight inresponse to international politics, economic disturbances or disruptive technologies. Recently, anew risk factor has emerged. Impacts of global warming are high on the international agenda.Policy measures and shifts in consumption patterns and production methods towards loweremissions will reduce demand for fossil fuels. The change to a more climate-friendly policy mayhave a considerable impact on petroleum prices. 3 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
Looking ahead, Norway must now be prepared for a time when the petroleum industry is nolonger expanding, but gradually declining. We will need innovation and growth in other industriesto pick up the slack. We have always known that oil and gas activities will be phased out sooneror later. Oil and gas are non-renewable resources. A stricter global climate policy or a green-technological breakthrough may mean that this will occur sooner than foreseen earlier.In contrast to Norway, Mozambique is at the beginning of its gas era. I hope the lessons fromNorway can give you some guidance on your way forward.One main lesson is that depletable natural resources must be viewed as part of a country’swealth. Revenues from extracting oil and gas is just a transformation of this wealth and shouldbe managed with a long-term prospective.At the same time, the development of oil and gas reserves can have valuable spillovers to therest of the economy. Not only demand from the petroleum industry, but also innovations andtechnological skills developed in the industry can be of great value to other sectors. Theproductivity gains to the economy can be more long lasting than the petroleum industry itself.And never forget: The real test of how a petroleum producing country has managed its fortune,will come when the boom in the petroleum industry ends. Oil and gas resources do not lastforever. Emphasis should therefore be given to further development of human capital as theprimary source of long-term prosperity and wealth.Thank you for your attention. 4 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
Peter Praet: Interview with Bloomberg TVInterview with Peter Praet, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, andBloomberg TV, conducted by Ms Jana Randow on 27 March 2019 and broadcast on 28 March2019.*   *   *The President is talking about mitigating the side effect of negative rates. Does thatmean tiering is coming?Praet: Well, I think don’t rush. I think it’s a bit premature to take that conclusion. What is clearnow is that the perspective of low rates for longer has triggered that debate about the side effectsof negative rates. I think it’s fair to say that this issue has to be analysed carefully. But you needin any case to find a monetary policy case; you cannot just conclude let’s do the theory becausethe economy is slowing down and the rates are low for longer. I think it’s fair to say that we haveto go into this issue but we need to have a convincing monetary policy case to do that.Now, when you look at the economy today and the lending channel, we don’t see any particularproblem in the lending channel today. As we know with the weakening economy it may happen inthe future so you have to be ready and to look at the possible instruments or decisions you mayneed to take in case. So readiness, yes, but I think don’t rush too quickly to conclusions but it’sfair to say that the conversation has started.If the conversation has started, does it mean that interest rates will stay low for evenlonger?Praet: I think it’s difficult to say today. When you look at prices, market prices, yes the date of thefirst lift-off has been pushed further by market participants, so this debate on the tiering has beencoming. As I say, the perspective of rates for longer is something you have to look at, all theconsequences of that.Does tiering make the tool of negative interest rates less effective?Praet: The negative rates have been extremely useful to support the economy basically becausethe opportunity costs of saving have been low. So you push people either to spend or to go intomore risk and supporting the economy, going into investment and all that. We have been bigeffects of the negative rates on the economy, which is good also for the banks themselvesbecause if their customers do better it’s also good for them. The question that comes today isthat with the slowing of the economy, because of international and geopolitical factors, you getlower growth, then you get also the negative effect of the rate situation on the intermediationmargin. That’s how the debate has been triggered. Now, on the economy you have to see howthe things will evolve.Now, German Bunds are yielding negative; is that a red flag for the ECB?Praet: Well, it reflects concerns because basically, our policy – our communication has notchanged recently. We have this forward guidance which basically says that the rates are going tostay at the present level until through the end of the year. But the recent increase of Bund priceswhere the rates really fell to zero or even negative rates, reflects concerns in the market andsome flight to safety. So they reflect a concern about the economy in general, yes, so it’s anindication of uncertainties in the market, yes.Are you particularly concerned about Germany?Praet: I am not particularly concerned about Germany. I think balance sheets in general of NFCs 1 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
– non-financial corporations – of households and of the state actually are in good shape. I thinkthis is a country that can absorb a number of shocks. Of course on the other side the Germaneconomy is very much depending on manufacturing, as we know that manufacturing has beenreally hit by the international uncertainties related to protectionism and also the slowdown inChina and also the UK. One has to say that in the UK there has been a visible slowdown ofinvestments, so the investments have come to a halt. Germany of course is a big exporter ofinvestment goods, equipment goods and Germany has been hit already today by the Brexit-related uncertainties. So yes, I think the country is resilient. On the other hand, they’re exposed tomanufacturing. I think they can go through but it’s of course a more delicate phase in thebusiness cycle for them.What about Italy?Praet: Italy is another case. It’s a different case. Italy is weak since a long time so Italy has anumber of recessions before. They had I would say three recessions. They have a newrecession now. I think it’s a difficult case where you need really more structural reforms ofcourse, but that’s a different sort of situation.Talk to me about risks: there is China, there is trade, you mentioned Brexit. What is yourbiggest concern?Praet: Yes, well, the concerns in general are of political nature. I think the persistent character ofall these uncertainties, and you listed a number of uncertainties, are weighing on economicsentiment and business sentiment in general. So you can say it’s only for the persistence ofthese uncertainties, at some point have real effects. For a time, businesses continue theirinvestment plans and it is business as usual but at some point it hits confidence and has realeffects. That worries me indeed. It’s about time that we reduced a little bit this political uncertaintyWhat can the ECB do to do that?Praet: Well, there is so much that a central bank can do. We have a mandate which is pricestability so we use the instruments we think are the best suited to reach our objective but it’s onlylimited. If you get fundamental uncertainties related for example to the trade regime and theBrexit-related problems, the central bank cannot do much about this. It also needs to besupported by other policies in general.Do you have anything specific in mind?Praet: Well, I think it’s time that this Brexit ends and I hope in a satisfactory and orderly way. Thatwould probably restore confidence quickly if you do it in an orderly way. It could be the other way,but these things really sends very, very negative signals for everybody to say how is it possible tohave so much uncertainty lasting so long about that issue. That’s one example. The otherexamples in the trade sphere, it would be of course very good for confidence if the tradenegotiations between US, China ended in a satisfactory way. Also we have uncertainties aboutthe trade regime Europe is having with US, so these uncertainties really dent confidence. Theyhave an impact on confidence and that’s the worry.The ECB have been working on a lending programme and I want to talk to you abouttiming. The announcement of the programme came a lot sooner than many peopleexpected. The start of the programme will be somewhat later than people expected. Whyis that?Praet: Well, what we call the TLTRO, the funding for lending, is a very flexible instrument andthere are many parameters in that instrument. What we have decided in the Governing Council isto disclose some of the parameters. First is the TLTRO is available; that means it’s basically afunding instrument. So borrowers, banks will be able to borrow for two years up to two years. 2 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
This is a funding side. It basically responds to the concerns that we have about congestion onthe bond market, linked to two cliff effects; one cliff effect will be in June of next year, the other,March of the following year. That we have addressed.The other issue with the TLTRO is to what extent do you want to use it as an instrument tosupport lending conditions? That’s the incentive scheme that you need to put in place. That’spremature because you want to have more clarity about the evolution of the economy and thelending part that supports the economy. For the time being now we don’t see anything special interms of lending, banking intermediation to non-financial corporations or for households. Thingsare okay on that side. Of course the central bank pre-emptively has to look how the situationpotentially will evolve and with the weakening of the economic growth you must be ready to actthe instruments needed if you want to support lending. I would say in terms of pricing, for theTLTRO you want to first make an assessment; what is the pricing that corresponds the best tothe problem you want to address? If it’s lower lending at that time, the pricing has to take that intoaccount. It’s a bit premature now so we’re going to decide in due time, as we say.Can you translate due time? How much time do you have?Praet: The first allotment will be in September of this year so you have to do it before. That will bedecided maybe, I don’t know, but maybe I will be gone. That means for the Governing Council ofJune, because we also will have the projections at that time. That would be one opportunitybefore September, but this being said, the Governing Council can always decide to change theincentive scheme of a programme. We did it in the past, given the evolution of the economy. Wecan do it in the future. As I said it’s a very flexible instrument so you can do that, but it must beadapted to the problem you want to address, which is a monetary policy issue that you have tohave in consideration.You’ve talked to the banks about this tool in the past. Do you have any idea about take-up? What’s your estimate?Praet: Well, you see, the TLTRO-II is extremely advantageous for banks because they canborrow money at minus 40 basis points, so there is still a maturity of about one year. There is noincentive to go in a new one for a bank that could borrow at minus 40 except if you put thecondition at minus 40, of course. But you see here, there is no need to rush for the banks. Theymaybe use it as a funding instrument but in terms of supporting lending for the time being, it’s notthe primary purpose; it’s something we keep, we are aware of course of the slowdown of theeconomy, of the downside risk that we flag so that instruments can be designed and calibrated ina proper way when times come. That’s a little bit what we have now, so the fact that the take-upfor the September is far away, but for the September allotment it’s not a major issue therebecause that’s more a funding device. The question will be how you price it and what are theconditions of the pricing? That will depend on the assessment of the Governing Council about thelending conditions in general.Now, we’ve talked about the risks to the economy. You’ve talked about what you’ve doneso far and what’s in the pipeline. If the Eurozone was heading for a recession, if thesituation deteriorates significantly, what’s actually left for the ECB to do?Praet: We don’t like to speak too much about the toolbox. There are many questions about thetoolbox and they say, oh, what is this mysterious toolbox and all that? Once you start talkingabout something, you get a lot of speculative attitudes and speculation about what we do andhow far you are going to go. You just say the path we always control that when we need to dosomething with our mandate, we find a way to do that. I think more realistically the situation whichis more in probabilistic terms is an economy that will not recover in the coming quarters,because that’s our scenario, and basically what you would see is an increase of credit spreads.You would see some impairment in the lending conditions, the standards would tighten. Then the 3 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
appropriate instruments are for example the TLTRO and how the central bank can influencelending conditions. That’s how the tiering discussions came back to see if at some point theconditions evolved in such a way that you see some impairments in the lending part or on thecorporate bond markets. Then the central bank may wish to use some of these instruments.That’s the context. Speculating about the big crisis, I think that’s something I don’t want to do.Is QE still a possible tool?Praet: Well, we say that all instruments are available, even new instruments are available; QE isof course available as we say, but I think it’s needless. All the instruments are available as wesaid, even new instruments are possible, but I think it’s not a time to speculate about this.You are looking back to eight years at the ECB and I am just wondering, what was yourworst possible day on the job?Praet: I don’t have a worst day at the ECB, really. I thought about these things, now that I’mreaching the end. I had difficult days, that yes, sometimes because of the sovereign debt crisis. Iwould say a worst day, you know what helps very much in difficult circumstances, and I must notcomplain; it’s basically when you work in a group, in a team and it makes a whole difference. Ihad it all my life; also in the banking crisis in Belgium, it was sometimes extremely stressful.When you are in a team it changes totally the situation at least for me. I cannot speak about theworst day.If you really push me, the thing about the worst day, I would immediately say when there wasless unity. You see, these are the situations where the stress goes up; because you feel that theteam is disunited. Well, I don’t see that really as a worst day because the team was in general,the team – that means the Governing Council – was very strong even for those having differentopinions. There was a sense of unity in general in the Council, believe it or not, but that’s how Ifeel.Now, your successor is already known; Philip Lane from Ireland. Any preference as towho will replace Mario Draghi?Praet: No, I have nothing to say on this. It was a fantastic cooperation with Mario, but that’s for theothers, that’s for the politicians to decide. 4 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
Luis de Guindos: International spillovers of monetary policy andfinancial stability concernsSpeech by Mr Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the European Central Bank, at the conference“The ECB and its watchers XX”, Frankfurt am Main, 27 March 2019.*   *   *IntroductionIt is a great pleasure for me to speak at this year’s ECB Watchers Conference. Given the topic ofthis session, I will start by referring to our recent findings on international spillovers of monetarypolicy and the related financial stability concerns for the euro area. I will then focus on ourfinancial stability assessment at the present juncture. In doing so, I will briefly refer to ananalytical tool we have employed to monitor and assess the banking system’s resilience.Globalisation has not only caused inflation and output to become increasingly synchronisedacross countries. Equity prices and financing conditions have become more synchronised, too.Most of this synchronisation stems from (common) global shocks, but the effects of internationalspillovers of monetary policy are less obvious.In my talk today, I will touch upon issues surrounding these international spillovers, and whetherthey are of concern for the financial stability of the euro area.In a globalised and financially integrated world, spillovers from the monetary policy of one countryto other economies are unavoidable.We can identify at least three international transmission channels:1. The “aggregate demand” channel, through which monetary policy affects domestic demandand, thus, the demand for foreign goods.2. The “exchange rate competitiveness” channel, through which monetary policy affects theexchange rate, meaning it changes the price of domestic goods relative to foreign goods.3. The “financial channel”, through which monetary policy affects domestic financial conditions.When there are strong financial connections between countries, these conditions maychange abroad as well.From these transmission channels, let me focus on the “financial channel” for the remainder ofmy talk.Financial spillovers from US monetary policy to the euro areaMeasuring international spillovers is not easy, because global shocks lead to economies movingin a synchronised manner for reasons unrelated to monetary policy.In line with previous evidence, recent ECB research identifies large financial spillovers from USmonetary policy to global financial conditions, including euro area financial conditions.More specifically, over the course of one month, monetary policy tightening by the FederalReserve System drives up euro area corporate bond spreads just as much as US corporatebond spreads. It also triggers declines in euro area stock markets of a similar magnitude to thedeclines in US stock markets.However, the financial spillovers from ECB monetary policy to US bond spreads, or to foreignequity markets, are found to be less impactful. This asymmetry in the international impact of US12345 1 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
monetary policy and euro area monetary policy is rooted in the dominant role of the US dollar inglobal financial markets.Furthermore, our analysis shows that there are only limited spillovers from the monetary policyof the Federal Reserve to euro area inflation and output. This suggests that ECB monetary policyactions are, by and large, able to shield the euro area economy from spillovers from USmonetary policy.But undoubtedly, there is evidence that US monetary policy is a driver of a “global financialcycle”.In step with such a financial cycle the risks to euro area financial stability can change as well.Current financial stability concerns in the euro areaAs you know, our characterisation of the main risks to euro area financial stability has remainedbroadly unchanged over the recent years. We see four main risks: The most prominent riskstems from the possibility of a disorderly increase of global risk premia. The second risk isrelated to renewed debt sustainability concerns, for sovereign debt in particular. The third risk isthat banks’ intermediation capacity may be hampered by their continued low profitability. Finally,we are of the opinion that possible liquidity strains in the investment fund sector constitute agrowing risk. All four risks are intertwined and would have, if they were to materialise, thepotential to be mutually reinforcing.In 2018, a growing economy and improved banking sector resilience were important positivefactors supporting financial stability. Now, however, the assessment is affected by a weakeningeconomic growth outlook for the euro area. In the latest ECB staff macroeconomic projections,expected real GDP growth was revised downwards, and the outlook continues to be viewed astilted to the downside on account of persistent uncertainties related to geopolitical factors, thethreat of protectionism and vulnerabilities in emerging markets.In my view, the deterioration in the growth outlook increases the risk of financial instabilityparticularly via two main channels. First, low economic growth raises concerns about sovereigndebt sustainability. And second, it further dampens profitability prospects for the banking sector.A weaker growth trajectory will challenge euro area sovereigns’ ongoing deleveraging. Lowgrowth and elevated public sector debt also leave a number of euro area countries vulnerable tohigher funding costs. Furthermore, threats stemming from rising protectionism around the globe,and high political uncertainty within Europe, may amplify potential corrections of sovereign bondrisk premia. These risks notwithstanding, market-based indicators of stress in the euro areasovereign bond markets have remained relatively contained in 2019, and debt sustainabilityconcerns have remained country-specific. Looking ahead, as growth prospects moderate it isimperative that fiscal buffers are rebuilt in countries where government debt still is too high.A prolonged period of low economic growth also poses challenges for euro area banks. Over thepast ten years following the great financial crisis, funding strains and subsequently hamperedbank intermediation capacity related to low bank profitability have figured prominently in our riskassessments. The low growth and inflation environment will probably exert downward pressureon the risk-free rate component of bonds across maturities. As a result, profitability stemmingfrom the maturity transformation business may come under renewed pressure – not least asretail household deposits tend to be bound at zero. Furthermore, should downside risks to theeconomic outlook materialise, higher loan loss provisions may further compress bankprofitability.Accommodative monetary policy has greatly supported bank profitability in past years. In fact,conventional and unconventional measures have improved the quality of credit overall, thereby67 2 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
reducing provisioning needs. Our measures have also increased the demand for loans, whichhas more than offset the negative effect of compressed margins. Furthermore, structural factorsare also weighing heavily on euro area banks’ profitability.In an environment where cyclical factors may exert further downward pressure on bankprofitability, banks would need to step up their efforts to overcome structural challenges. Suchmeasures may include cost reductions – including lower staffing costs and streamlining ofbranch networks, enhanced digitalisation – implying initial, one-off large-scale investments,revenue diversification and the reduction of the stock of non-performing loans in the six countrieswhere levels are still high.A number of regulatory and policy measures could help to improve the institutional setting inwhich the banking sector operates and facilitate banks’ efforts to adjust their business models.Such measures should include completing the banking union (in particular the establishment of aEuropean deposit insurance scheme), the subsequent removal of the remaining non-harmonisednational options and discretions, and making progress with the capital markets union. This couldfoster further consolidation, including across borders, and address the problem of overcapacityin the euro area banking system.Assessing the financial stability of the euro areaBeyond regular monitoring activities, financial stability analysis entails assessing the impact onthe financial system of risks materialising, including risks related to international spillovers. Suchassessments can also help inform the calibration of possible appropriate macroprudential policyresponses.The stress-testing framework is an important analytical tool to quantitatively assess financialsystem vulnerabilities and risks. Stress testing exercises of the banking sector assess thesector’s resilience and how it performs under adverse circumstances, thus providing a measureof the severity of these risks. Individual bank results provide further information about banks’potential capital needs. Stress tests can therefore show how the financial system will react whenrisks, such as those relating to spillovers, materialise.In order to enhance its stress-testing capacity, the ECB has invested in an analytical frameworkthat not only tracks the resilience of the banking sector but also accounts for how it interacts withand feeds back in to the economy as a whole.This framework complements the EU-wide stress tests conducted under the aegis of theEuropean Banking Authority (EBA), which are predominantly microprudential in nature.Our so-called macroprudential stress testing loosens the assumption that banks’ balance sheetsare constant. As banks are hit by, say, negative (spillover) effects from the global environment,they may react by deleveraging their loan books. This type of stress testing also accounts forwhat implications banks’ reactions would have for the real economy. In other words,macroprudential stress tests consider the adverse credit supply shock that may lead to anamplification of the macroeconomic effects of the global shock, which, in turn, could furtherdamage banks’ balance sheets. By modelling the negative feedback loop between the bankingsector and the real economy beyond the first round of shocks, we believe the exercise becomesmore realistic.A macroprudential stress test of banks directly supervised by the ECB, using the baseline andadverse scenarios of the recent EBA stress test, confirmed the general resilience of the euroarea banking system. Results, however, point to an additional fall in GDP of 1.6% across theeuro area, on top of the GDP shocks of the adverse scenario over the three-year horizon.This stress-testing framework can also inform the calibration of macroprudential policies with the8 3 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
aim of limiting unintended spillovers to other parts of the financial system or the real economy.In the spirit of pre-emptive macroprudential policy, these exercises can emphasise the need forthe timely build-up of capital buffers, which can then be used to absorb losses when risksmaterialise, before they affect growth and employment.Finally, the stress-testing framework can be used to analyse the spillover effects of themacroprudential policies themselves.For instance, another finding of the framework is that capital-constrained banks are more likely toreduce their foreign exposures than their domestic ones. We are particularly concerned aboutspillover effects of macroprudential policies within the euro area, because the build-up of acapital buffer in one country should, to the extent possible, not impair the functioning of financialintermediation in other euro area countries.ConclusionLet me conclude by emphasising that, in a globalised and financially integrated world, the euroarea is not immune to spillovers from other regions, in particular to shocks emanating from theUnited States.But we are convinced that we have the appropriate policy tools to largely shield the euro areaeconomy and financial system from such spillovers. Monetary policy and macroprudential policyhave different objectives and, therefore, different sets of policy tools.Cyclical factors, such as compressed interest margins, pose challenges to banks’ operatingenvironment, but the gains have so far greatly offset the losses. In turn, euro area banks need toaddress their structural fragilities, which partially explain the very low price-to-book ratios of euroarea banks when compared with their international peers.ReferencesAvdjiev, S., Bruno, V., Koch, C. and Shin, H.

In fact, a sufficiently long horizon is crucial to capture the spillovers thatare economically relevant. Results over shorter horizons typically differ.

Neely(2015) finds spillovers of a similar magnitude. Curcuru et al. (2018), in contrast, find that during a one-dayperiod, ECB announcement surprises spill over to US Treasury yields in a similar manner as Federal OpenMarket Committee announcement surprises spill over to German Bund yields.See, for example, Kim (2001), Georgiadis (2016), Chen et al. (2017) and Iacoviello and Navarro (2018). The12345678912 5 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
results for conventional and unconventional monetary policy are similar. Rogers et al.

1/9  The Thai Economy: The Current State and the Way Forward Speech by Dr. Veerathai Santiprabhob Governor of the Bank of Thailand Japanese Chamber of Commerce (JCC) Thailand Dinner Talk 27 March 2019  JCC Board of Directors, JCC members, Distinguished guests,  Ladies and gentlemen, Good evening to you all, Thank you very much for inviting me once again to give a talk at the Japanese Chamber of Commerce Thailand. This event is a great opportunity for us all to exchange our views and ideas on the Thai economy and its prospects as we move forward into the year 2019. Your opinions and feedback are undoubtedly valuable to policymakers, like myself, and I look forward to a very engaging session tonight. Japan and Thailand have been in long-standing diplomatic relations for more than 132 years—and even much longer from a trade perspective, dating back to as early as 1600s. Time has shown that while the Thai economy has encountered many challenging transitions, business partnerships between Japan and Thailand have continued to remain strong, fostering economic opportunities for both our nations throughout the present day.  As you all know, this year is a very special one to all of the Thai people as well as the Japanese people as both our countries will hold national celebrations for our respective head of state in early May—to celebrate and honor the coronation of His Majesty the King Maha Vajiralongkorn and the ascension of Crown Prince Naruhito to the Imperial throne.   This year also marks a significant transition for Thailand to return to democracy as the general election was just held over the weekend.  Ladies and gentlemen, Undoubtedly, one of the most pressing questions many audiences here today are wondering will certainly be on the implications of the outcome of the election and how that will impact the Thai economy. Unfortunately, it is too early for us to make a call as we still await 
2/9  ratification of the election result, formation of the new government, appointments of key members of the cabinet, and announcement of the economic policy. So instead, today I want to focus my talk on long-term perspective of the Thai economy and highlight key qualities of our economic resilience that have allowed the Thai economy to endure a number of domestic and external shocks—many of which in the past, I believe, were much more challenging compared to the impending political change post-election.  But before speaking about long-term perspective, allow me to talk briefly on our short-term outlook as our Monetary Policy Committee has just recently revised our economic projections. Looking back the past few years, the recovery of the Thai economy had been largely driven by improvements on the external front from the recovery of global demand. Growth drivers were unbalanced; exports of goods and services acted as the main drivers of growth while domestic sectors were well-below historical average. Last year marked a turning point as growth became more balanced. Private consumption strengthened, supported by improvements in employment in major sectors as well as government measures to support low income groups, such as the state welfare card project. In addition, private investment expanded with increased investments in machinery and equipment along with greater construction activities as the overall growth became more broad-based. We have seen markedly increasing interest from foreign investors, especially in the EEC area.  Consequently, in 2018 the Thai economy expanded on a solid footing, with growth of 4.8 percent in the first half, before moderating in the second half due to slowing global demand. This weaker global demand was largely a result of slower economic growth in a number of major trading partners; a number of country-specific transitory factors; and uncertainties surrounding trade tensions between the US and China. Nevertheless, thanks to more balanced growth engines, the Thai economy grew 4.1 percent in 2018, an improvement from 4.0 percent growth in 2017. It was also the first time in a decade that the Thai economy registered consecutive annual growth of 4 percent.  Looking ahead, the Thai economy is projected to continue to expand around its potential, with growth this year will slightly moderate to 3.8 percent as slower growth of major trading partners weighs on the export sector. Domestic demand would remain the key growth driver, as 
3/9  private consumption continues to be supported by government welfare measures and underpinning factors, such as employment and consumer confidence, remain strong. Furthermore, private investment is expected to continue to improve, aided by more investments in the EEC area, further progress in the public-private partnership infrastructure projects, and relocation of production bases to Thailand in industries such as electronics, automotive parts, and rubber. Meanwhile, the tourism sector is expected to continue to expand mainly due to improved confidence and return of Chinese tourists. It is expected that the number of foreign tourists will exceed 40 million this year.  Ladies and gentlemen,  Although our outlook indicates a sustained growth, a number of risk factors remain. These include  (1) The potential impacts from US protectionist policies and trade tensions with China, which so far have had mixed effects on the Thai economy. The direct effect of US safeguard measures on certain products led to slowdown in exports of solar cells and washing machines, though they have had small impact on our overall exports 1. Meanwhile, US trade measures against China could have indirect impact on Thai exports as a number of Thai firms are part of Chinese production and supply chain networks; potential reduction in Chinese exports has reduced the demand for Thai supply. Furthermore, the measures can lead to trade diversion, the consequence of which remains to be determined. On one hand, the Thai economy may benefit from new investments from relocation of Chinese factories. Thai firms may be able to supplant Chinese competitors in exporting to the US. On the other hand, trade diversion can lead to increased competition within Thailand as excess supplies of goods from China are diverted to the Thai market and priced at discount to compete with local products.  Besides, prolonged uncertainties surrounding trade measures had led to unusual front-loading of exports in 2018 and will weigh on export growth in 2019—just when the global demand has begun to moderate. It can also impair business sentiments, preventing firms from taking on new investment projects. Ultimately, as the US-China trade disputes remain unresolved and the US’s inclination for further trade                                          1 Both products make up less than 1 percent of Thailand’s total exports 
4/9  protectionism remains, such as potential US auto tariff measure, trade disputes will certainly be the key concern for all authorities.  (2) Slowdown in the Chinese economy is another concern. While the slowdown may be in line with the Chinese authorities’ goal of restructuring the economy towards a long-run sustained growth model, in the short-term it can have significant impact on the Thai economy. This is because of high degree of linkages in terms of supply chain and production networks, tourism, and property investment. For instance, China is Thailand’s second largest export partner following the ASEAN region, making up about 12 percent of our exports in term of value while the Chinese tourists represent nearly 30 percent of total foreign tourists. Besides, slowdown in the Chinese economy may contribute to higher volatility of the Chinese Yuan; the movements of which can influence movements of the Baht and other currencies in the region. Against this backdrop, short-term slowdown in the Chinese economy needs to be closely monitored. (3) Geopolitical risks in many parts of the world remain elevated. These include long-standing issues such as the US-North Korea relations, Middle East conflicts, and development on Brexit. In addition, new sources of fragilities continue to emerge, such as the recent disputes between India and Pakistan and Venezuelan political tensions. While some of these conflicts may not be directly related to the Thai economy, the presence of geopolitical risks could introduce bouts of uncertainties and impair sentiments, leading to capital flow volatility in Thailand and other emerging market economies. (4) Lastly, on the domestic political front, given the unofficial result of our general election over the weekend, uncertainties remain on how a new coalition government is to be formed. The result of which will play a big part in determining major government policies going forward.  Ladies and gentlemen, Talking only about short-term risk factors may curb the appetite of many in audience tonight. So, let me now turn to the long-term perspective on the Thai economy. Despite the risk issues highlighted, I am confident that the Thai economy possesses the resilience to support long-term growth and cushion against these risk factors. Recent history has shown that the Thai economy has the resilience to withstand adverse events and has 
5/9  been quick to recover. Over the past ten years the economy has had to endure a number of shocks—externally, from the global financial crisis of 2009 to the beginning of quantitative tightening; and internally, from the domestic political turmoil throughout the decade, big flood of 2011, to the passing of His late Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej in 2016. And yet, over the past decade the Thai economy grew on annual average of 3.3 percent; it registered positive current account surplus in eight of the last ten years; and the Thai Baht has been one of the most stable currencies in the region.  The economy has been able to overcome these challenges, because it possesses a unique set of qualities, qualities that contribute to our resilience. These key qualities are macroeconomic stability, diversified growth engines, and ability to adapt to new challenges. Ladies and gentlemen, Having sound macroeconomic stability is important for an economy to ensure confidence and provide environment conducive to growth. It also acts as a critical buffer, especially for small open economy, against episodes of external shocks and capital flow volatility. The Thai economy possesses macroeconomic stability in at least four key areas: (1) Our external stability remains strong, with ample foreign reserves, covering 3.4 times short-term external debt. Our current account surplus has been in the positive for five consecutive years and is projected to be around at 34.5 billion USD this year, or around 6.4 percent of GDP. In addition, the economy has low dependency on external financing, with external debt to GDP ratio below the median level of emerging market economies2.  (2) The banking sector is robust, with high capital adequacy ratio and stable domestic funding. At the end of 2018, the capital adequacy ratio of the banking system stood at 18.3 percent, a level well above minimum international requirement and among the highest in the region. Meanwhile, loan growth has picked up in line with our economic expansion while level of non-performing loans has stabilized.  (3) The fiscal position remains strong and has sufficient space to support the economy in case of downturn. Public debt to GDP is around                                          2 Thailand’s external debt to GDP is 35.3 percent as of 2018 vs the median of 37.8 percent for EM economies. IMF data calculated by BOT 
6/9  42 percent, a level below the commonly accepted threshold of 60 percent. Meanwhile, the enactment of Fiscal Responsibility Act would ensure fiscal discipline through improvement in spending transparency and limit conduct of open-ended populist policies.   (4) Domestic price pressure remains moderated and stable, largely as a result of slow recovery in the global oil price and positive structural factors, such as globalization and technological advancement. Low and stable domestic price pressure will continue to provide favorable environment conducive for economic activity.  While the overall macroeconomic stability is sound, pockets of risk remain. In response, the Bank of Thailand took on a number of actions including implementation of new limits on credit card and personal loans to address problem of household debt; establishment of debt clinic to help restructure debt for individuals with multiple creditors; and tightening up of mortgage loan underwriting standards to curb speculation in the housing market. Along the same line, on the back of strong economic performance and ample liquidity, the Monetary Policy Committee raised the policy rate in December of last year largely to preempt potential build-up of financial vulnerabilities from investor’s “search-for-yield” behavior and underpricing of risk during prolonged period of ultra-low interest rate. Ladies and gentlemen,   Let me now turn to the resilience supported by having diversified growth engines, which in turn enable the Thai economy and its agents to mitigate adverse events.  While I previously stated at the beginning of my talk that drivers of growth have become more balanced, structurally—being a small open economy—export performance still plays an important role as the main growth driver. But, looking closely at our export portfolio, you would find that it is well-diversified and can provide cushion against market-specific or product-specific risks. This is because Thailand has established export ties with over 80 countries; and exporters have become less reliance on major economies. Just over ten years ago, exports to G3 economies made up around 40 percent of total export value while those to ASEAN economies stood at 21 percent. In contrast, the ratios today stand at 31 percent and 27 percent, respectively. In terms of product mix, the economy neither depends on a specific commodity nor on a particular manufacturing sector. This has allowed for growth and 
7/9  development of new industries to serve both domestic and external demands. Certainly, efforts to attract new investments in the EEC area will further enhance our ability to diversify, with establishment of industries of the future.  The tourism industry is another well-diversified sector. With many unique destinations and attractions, the tourism industry is able to cater to wide range of customers in term of pricing and activities—from luxurious wellness centers for medical tourists to affordable accommodations for first-time foreign travelers. In fact, recent tourist patterns may have indicated that there is no longer low season in Thailand. The number of incoming foreign tourists has become relatively stable throughout the year with different mixes across different seasons. More importantly, given the choice of attraction and selection of price range, Thailand is in a unique position to attract many first-time foreign tourists, especially those rising middle class from China, India, Indonesia, and Vietnam.  Last but not least is the ability for the economy and Thai people to adapt to change. The notion of adaptability is important for economic resilience not just to respond to adverse events and uncertainties but also to cope with disruptive changes, especially against the backdrop of changing landscape brought about by technological advancement.  Speaking on behalf of the Thai people, I believe our history has played a big part in influencing our actions and our mindsets, allowing us to cope with new challenges. Specifically, Thailand’s long history as an open trading nation—having limited resources and military strength, and operating under the landscape of continued foreign threats—has implanted the mindsets of the Thai to be open-minded and receptive to new opportunities while flexible in our approach to adversities.  It is with this mindset that has allowed our nation to adapt to changing environment and withstood various threats. Looking ahead, our resilience will certainly be tested by disruptive changes brought about by technological advancement. Thus far, the Thai people have shown that they are able to adapt and be receptive of new opportunities that have come with new technologies. This can be seen in the remarkable rate of adoption of the PromptPay faster-pay service since its launch just over two years ago, with now over 47 million subscribed accounts, a large number considering the total population of Thailand is just over 66 million. During that same period, usage of digital 
8/9  payment almost doubled, reaffirming receptiveness of the Thai people to new payment channel. Moreover, the Thai population is digitally engaged, ranking among top countries with the highest number of social media users3. This has created opportunities for new platforms to emerge and innovations to prosper.  Besides the people, increasing number of Thai businesses have incorporated new technologies into their work processes. Over the past few years, manufacturers have invested heavily in machineries and systems to increase utilization of automation as evidenced by increasing robot installations in Thai factories4. Firms in non-manufacturing sector are also moving fast in adopting new technologies—from banks and telcos offering more efficient digital financial services; shops abandoning physical storefront and employing e-commerce and social-commerce platforms; and to firms advertising through social media platforms. To encourage further technological adoption and improve adaptive capabilities, to ultimately build resilience, it is also important that regulatory environment is conducive to fostering innovations. And it is with this goal of facilitating innovative environment that the Bank of Thailand took on a number of initiatives in recent years. These include  Continuing regulatory reform on foreign exchange regulations to remove outdated requirements, allow for greater flexibility in foreign exchange management, and improve ease of doing business;  Relaxing money transfer business ownership requirements to allow for greater competition and reduce cost of cross-border money transfer;  Streamlining our regulatory sandbox scheme to allow new fin-tech products to reach market faster;  Collaborating with the banking industry to explore use of central bank digital currency for domestic wholesale banking settlement operations; and                                           3 For instance, Thailand is ranked top ten in number of Facebook users according to Statista (2019). https://www.statista.com/statistics/268136/top-15-countries-based-on-number-of-facebook-users/ 4 According to International Federation of Robotics, Thailand’s robot sales increased by over 30 percent between 2015 and 2017 and are expected to grow at an annual average of more than 20 percent over the next three years.

9/9   Promoting adoption of interoperable e-payment infrastructures within Thailand as well as among regional partners In summary, the ability to adapt to new environment along with having macroeconomic stability and diversified growth engines have enabled the Thai economy to have the resilience to endure adverse incidents and will safeguard us from impacts from future uncertainties and disruptions.  Ladies and gentlemen,  I have now come to the end of my talk. Let me give you a brief summary of what I have said today. The Thai economy is expected to continue to expand, though at a slightly slower pace, with domestic demand being the main drivers of growth. The risks and concerns going forward include prolonged trade disputes, slowdown of the Chinese economy, geopolitical risks, and transition of the Thai political landscape. Nevertheless, with the economy possessing three important qualities of resilience, namely macroeconomic stability, diversified growth engines, and ability to adapt, I am confident that the Thai economy can withstand various challenges in the years to come. Again, it is my great honor to be here this evening with our long-time friends who have supported Thailand’s economic and financial development. Let me assure you that the Bank of Thailand will continue to strengthen our economic resilience and stay firmly committed to our principal mandate to support sustainable economic growth while maintaining price and financial stability.  Thank you.

     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/default.aspx 2  2   Introduction   It’s a pleasure for the Bank of England to host this workshop on Investing in Ethnicity & Race.  To pursue its mission, Bank of England must reflect the diversity of the people it serves.   That hasn’t always been the case.  Historically, central banks were run by the City for the City. The Bank’s first female Court member, Frances Heaton, was appointed only in 1993, while our first Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) member, Lord Morris, followed five years later.  I’m the 120th in a very long line of male, white Governors of the Bank.  Over the last five years the Bank has implemented a concerted strategy to increase diversity and foster inclusion.  These initiatives have had a material impact on all aspects of diversity at the Bank.  We are now reinforcing them to further improve the retention and progression of BAME colleagues in particular, and to deepen progress on inclusion more generally.  The Bank values diversity for at least three reasons.  First, it is the right thing to do: a public institution should reflect the public it serves.  Second, diversity helps to build the trust we need to fulfil our remits.  The decisions that the Bank takes impact every UK citizen, but not everyone wants to be steeped in fan charts and stress testing.   The conventional central banker approach is to build trust through a track record. In recent decades this has been supplemented by greater transparency.  But trust is also grounded in familiarity.  People trust individuals, places and things that they know.    Better reflecting the diversity of the people we serve can reduce misperceptions that we are experts making esoteric decisions in an ivory tower for the benefit of others.  Broader outreach to all strata of society across the country can reinforce these benefits.  Diversity can make our communication more effective. Homogenous organisations are more likely to fall afoul of the ‘curse of knowledge’, where people assume that their audience has the same information and base level of understanding as themselves. By drawing on alternative perspectives, we can craft our messages so that they resonate with more people.   
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/default.aspx 3  3   Third, greater diversity leads to better decision making.   Homogenous groups are vulnerable to over-optimism, bias and groupthink.  They easily become rigid. In contrast, diverse teams can adapt better to change.  Such resilience is particularly important in a world where information is super abundant and certainty is absent, and it is especially relevant in finance where most decisions are taken under uncertainty.  But diversity alone is insufficient.  For its benefits to be realised fully, diverse teams must be supported by the right frameworks. Research on central bank committee design shows that diverse decision‐making bodies benefit from:  Having a clearly defined policy objective;  Having relatively small policy committees, with external members;  Publishing policy decisions, and;  Allowing for external scrutiny. How the Bank of England is becoming more diverse  Five years ago we made Diverse and Talented one of four pillars of our strategic plan.  Our aim was not just to increase diversity; but also to choose inclusion.  Inclusion unlocks the true value of an organisation’s diversity. Only through inclusion can people realise their full potential. That’s why the Bank is focussing on building a culture that values diverse ideas, encourages open debate, and empowers people at all levels to take initiative.  Our strategy has three elements:  Inclusive recruitment,  Inclusive culture, and  Inclusive communications. First, inclusive recruitment We are fishing from a larger pond.  In recent years our graduates have come from 40 different universities, a six-fold increase in the past decade.  Of our 2019 intake, due to join us in September, 46% of graduates are female and 39% are declared BAME students.  This compares to a BAME share of 20% five years ago.   To support diverse recruitment at all levels our managers are now required to undertake unconscious bias training.  We use anonymous CVs for internal and external recruitment and strive for balanced shortlists and interview panels.  
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/default.aspx 4  4   In 2016 we setup a formalised talent management process for all employees, to ensure everyone has equal access to opportunities to discuss their careers.   To enable us to continue to hire graduates from a broader set of disciplines and train them as economists and technical specialists we have introduced our Central Banking Qualification, in which new hires can earn Masters Degrees in Central Banking.  And now around half of our graduates study economics, with the remainder plucked from the sciences, business and the humanities.  To help develop the next generation, we are working with schools and universities to encourage a more diverse set of students to study economics and finance. We provide free classroom materials through our econoME initiative, and by the end of 2018 one quarter of all state secondary schools had registered for the programme, reaching an audience of 90,000 students. Over the past year we have made more than 300 school visits, of which 75 were by the Bank's committee members, including myself.  Second, fostering an inclusive culture  As we attract a more diverse workforce, we’re taking a number of initiatives to enable and encourage participation.   Traditionally central banks have been notoriously hierarchical and deferential.  To break down these barriers, we have changed how we make decisions to ensure that everyone participating has the same information at the same time, and can put forth their views.  We have an ‘author in the room’ policy so that expert staff can always explain their papers in person and challenge conventional wisdom.    Our core values (which include being Inclusive and Collaborative) are embedded in everything that we do, including feeding directly into the performance management and remuneration of all colleagues.   We are proud to have a number of thriving and influential employee network groups including Women in the Bank, LGBT+ and Allies, Bank of England Ethnic Minority (BEEM), Mental Health, Disability, Carers, Parents, and three Faith Networks. The Employee Network Groups help Bank colleagues bring their whole selves to work. I will talk more in a moment about the important work our BEEM network does to support BAME colleagues.  Third, inclusive communications  Inclusion also means engaging with all our stakeholders, internal and external, and being aware of the many ways in which the economic situation affects different people.  Active engagement with a range of expert and non-expert stakeholders across the UK has always been important, but it is taking on new prominence in the information age. 
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/default.aspx 5  5    Our agents and Bank officials meet thousands of business contacts across the UK each year to take the temperature of the UK economy.  Our new Open Forum and Future Forum events do this on a large scale by bringing together thousands of people from the community to discuss the economy, the financial system and the Bank’s role in promoting the good of the people of the United Kingdom.  We listen to the views and concerns of local business leaders, technology developers, representatives from the voluntary and education sectors, unions and the wider public and explore how the Bank can maintain stability and reduce uncertainty.   Inclusive communications also requires more tailored content.  Our visual summaries of our Inflation and the Financial Stability Reports, explain how developments in the global economy and financial system affect the outlook for inflation and financial stability without the need for dense text.  Deploying social media, including Facebook and YouTube, can make our messages available directly to a broader audience.  New digital products, such as KnowledgeBank, use accessible language and engaging visuals to help us tell a story about what the Bank does.    Our strategy is working, with major progress over the past five years.  For example, female representation in senior roles at the Bank has increased from 17% in 2013 to 31% today, and is on track for our target of 35% by the end of 2020.1   BAME representation below senior management is 19%, up from 13% in 2013.   In 2018 we were one of the first organisations to conduct a special Cognitive Diversity Survey.  Our results indicate colleagues are generally positive about inclusiveness at the Bank on every metric measured.   In 2018 we were one of the first organisations to conduct a special Cognitive Diversity Survey to gain a better understanding of how our colleagues feel about working at the Bank. The survey measured seven inclusivity metrics including interpersonal interactions, flexible working, communication with leaders as well as recruitment and promotion, and results are cut across twelve different aspects of diversity. Our results indicate colleagues are generally positive about inclusiveness at the Bank on every metric measured by the survey.   And 80% of colleagues in our annual employee survey reported they think the Bank takes diversity seriously, 7 percentage points higher than the UK average. And 87% of Bank colleagues say they are treated with respect as an individual, 6 percentage points higher than the UK average.                                                        1 See also my letter to Nicky Morgan, Chair of the Treasury Select Committee, on 4 July 2018. 
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/default.aspx 6  6   Let me now turn specifically to ethnic diversity at the Bank.  Investing in ethnicity2  Our diversity and inclusion strategy has had a positive impact on BAME diversity at the Bank of England.  Since we implemented name-blind recruitment processes in March 2018 around one quarter of all recruitment offers (internal and external) have been to declared BAME candidates. But there is scope for further improvement.   The turnover rate of declared BAME colleagues is higher than that for the Bank as a whole – 9.2% compared with 7.5% as of January 2019.  While BAME representation at senior levels has increased from 2% to 5% since 2013, we still have some way to go to meet our ambitious target of 13% by 2022.     The Bank’s experience is consistent with that of other organisations as documented by “The Middle” (a thorough, evidence-based research report on progressing BAME Talent in the Workplace commissioned by the Black British Business Awards).3  This study concluded that across organisations the challenges were greatest in retaining and promoting ethnic minority professionals from middle management to senior executive roles.  We’re pleased that the changes the Bank is already making are consistent with the report’s recommendations.  To maintain momentum, the Bank recently created a BAME Diversity Taskforce, chaired by Deputy Governor Sir Dave Ramsden and attended by members of both Court and our BEEM network. This Taskforce is now focusing on:  First, supporting the progression of BAME colleagues to leadership roles by rolling out inclusive leadership training for all colleagues and having all senior management including the Bank’s Governors participate in our Sponsorship programmes and mentoring schemes.   Second, supporting our ethnic minorities network (BEEM), which has achieved much since its foundation in 2012. This includes implementing reciprocal mentoring of 150 of our BAME colleagues each year.  BEEM has also set up, with HR, the Bank's African/ African-Caribbean scholarship programme. Launched in 2015, we have awarded 10 scholarships and 8 bursaries to talented students studying a range of subjects from Chemical Engineering to Politics and International Relations.                                                         2 See also my letter to Nicky Morgan, Chair of the Treasury Select Committee, on 19 March 2019. 3 See ‘Progressing Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) talent in the workplace through collaborative action’, “The Middle” Report, available online at: https://www.thebbbawards.com/middle-research/  
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/default.aspx 7  7   We have recently decided to provide a seat at the table for our BEEM network at senior committees whenever diversity issues are discussed. And we have launched ‘Let’s Talk About Race’ workshops to help senior leaders become more comfortable talking about these issues.   Third, we are ensuring greater accountability for BAME progression throughout the organisation.   The Bank has published a huge amount of diversity data externally and internally since we first set diversity targets five years ago. We published our BAME pay gap for the first time in our 2018 Annual Report. We are currently reviewing the metrics we report to make sure they identify hotspots in terms of BAME recruitment, progression or retention.   All managers’ participation in the inclusion agenda is assessed as part of annual performance reviews, and Executive Directors have specific diversity performance objectives.  Finally, I am very pleased to announce today that the Bank is signing the Race at Work charter.  This Charter commits organisations to five initiatives to improve ethnic diversity in the workplace.  The Bank now has all five in place.4  Conclusion   Choosing inclusion means listening and learning from others.  That’s why it is so valuable to have forums like today.   We are fortunate to have with us this morning representatives of so many organisations who have championed diversity and inclusion for many years.   We look forward to learning from all of you so that we can build a more diverse and inclusive Bank of England to serve better all the people of the United Kingdom.                                                        4 See https://race.bitc.org.uk/issues/racecharter.  The commitments ask signatories to 1) Appoint an Executive Sponsor for race; 2) Capture ethnicity data and publicise progress; 3) Commit at Board level to zero tolerance of harassment and bullying; 4) Make clear that supporting equality in the workplace is the responsibility of all leaders and managers; and 5) Take action that supports ethnic minority career progression. 
Benjamin E Diokno: Continuity, collaboration and a better futureSpeech by Mr Benjamin E Diokno, Governor of Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP, the centralbank of the Philippines), at the 1st Fintech Alliance Summit, Manila, 26 March 2019.*   *   *FinTech Alliance Philippines Chairman Lito Villanueva, Fintech Alliance Philippines members,industry partners, fellow Monetary Board Members, Ms. Tess Espenilla and family, colleagues from the BSP, and workers in government, friends from the media, esteemed guests, ladies andgentlemen, good morning.I am honored to be your keynote speaker during the 1 FinTech Alliance Summit. This is myfirst time, as BSP Governor, to address the country’s leading companies in the financialtechnology sector.As such, today is an opportune time to share with you that I FULLY SUPPORT AND WILLCARRY FORWARD OUR FINANCIAL INCLUSION  AGENDA so that financial services are mademore accessible to a greater number of Filipinos.  In fact, I expressed the same during my firstpress conference as BSP Governor earlier this month. Thus, I am indeed glad that you chose“Inclusion and Digital Transformation” as conference theme because this is truly in line with mypolicy priorities.                                                                     Launch of the Governor Nestor A. Espenilla, Jr. Institute for Growth and NationalInclusion, Transformation and Empowerment (IGNITE)I understand that most of you here had the great opportunity to work closely with mypredecessor, the late Nestor A. Espenilla, Jr., who championed financial inclusion and digitaltransformation.  We are all undoubtedly inspired by the life and work of Gov. Nesting. It is thus fitting that later thismorning, we shall witness the launch of the Governor Nestor A. Espenilla, Jr. Institute for Growthand National Inclusion, Transformation, and Empowerment or IGNITE.IGNITE is a multi-stakeholder, research-based and data-driven advocacy. It is a socialtransformation platform that leverages on technology to empower financially unserved andunderserved Filipinos for more inclusive growth.I hope that with IGNITE, we can open a world of new possibilities and better opportunities to thefinancially excluded. As plans are being finalized, let us continue putting our collective energiesbehind this project, and to push forward our inclusive growth agenda at full speed.To Ms. Tess Espenilla and family, may you take comfort in knowing that his legacy continues tolive—and today it once again speaks to us—urging each and every one of us to do our share tomake our society more inclusive. Together, let us leverage on technological innovations to helpfuel the financial inclusion movement, just as Gov. Nesting would have wanted.BSP Approach to Digital TransformationWe pursue inclusion amid a global financial ecosystem that is in a state of digital transformation.Of course, you are all well aware of that—as fintech firms are a big reason for it.This transformation has completely altered the business landscape and has moved traditionalfinancial institutions to adapt and innovate. Furthermore, increasing consumer demands forbetter financial products and services have driven digitalization to become a strategic priority forboth financial and non-financial corporates. There is no denying it. The digital revolution hasst1 1 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
arrived. And it is here to stay.Digitalization is expected to become an essential aspect of how we do business, almost as amatter of routine. Digital transformation should therefore spur a complete change in mindset toallow for continuous and consistent innovation. We should allow ourselves to think differently, togrow in the midst of change. As H.G. Wells, a futurist English writer, said in his timeless quote,“Adapt or perish, now as ever, is nature’s inexorable imperative.”Rightfully so, the same applies to financial regulatory authorities. Today’s rapid digitaltransformation requires not just new regulations but demands fresh and bold approaches. Ladiesand gentlemen, I am proud to say that BSP remains a thought a leader in this regard.To note, in its 2018 Global Microscope report, the Economist Intelligence Unit said the BSP “hasbeen ahead of the curve in identifying opportunities and setting guidelines for financial inclusion.”The research arm of The Economist Group also recognized that BSP’s focus on “creating adigital finance ecosystem has led to the introduction of a sound payments infrastructure thathelps various financial sector players to reduce their costs and further their outreach.”Said recognition is a reflection of BSP’s proactive approach to digital transformation. Needless tosay that we support responsible fintechs, given their link to increased efficiencies and greaterdepth of outreach, which are often considered as pain points of legacy financial institutions. Welikewise welcome the growth opportunities brought about by the entry of a growing number offintech firms into the financial services space.In light of these developments, the BSP remains committed to establishing a regulatoryenvironment that allows digital transformations to thrive. At the same time, we are mindful ofattendant risks and any unintended consequences that technological innovations may bring,especially when it comes to consumer and data protection.Because of this, a deliberate part of our strategy is to further deepen our financial education andconsumer protection initiatives. This balanced regulatory approach is anchored on the coreprinciples of risk-based, proportionate and fair regulation; active multi-stakeholder collaboration;and, consumer protection.These principles are pragmatically implemented through our flexible “test and learn” approach indealing with increasing digital transformations in the financial system. This provides anopportunity for fintechs to participate in the financial system thru collaborations with banks andother financial industry players to achieve greater scale, within the regulatory environmentestablished by the BSP.     In addition, we are likewise coordinating and cooperating with other domestic and foreignregulators for possible information sharing and referral system especially focused on fintechfirms. The ultimate objective of our regulatory approach to digital transformation is to be aware ofrisks and employ mitigating actions as needed, but only in a manner that also allows benefitsleveraging on these innovations.In the last three years, the BSP has been preparing the groundwork for an expanded digitalfinance ecosystem, one marked by diversity of players responding to the varying needs ofbusinesses and individuals, especially those that have been traditionally unserved.We issued rules to open up the electronic payment rails to more players, (Cir. 980 and 1000);provided guidelines on virtual currency exchanges as an emerging alternative remittancebusiness model (Cir. 942 and 944); allowed banks to exponentially expand reach by tappingubiquitous retail outlets as cash agents (Cir. 940); and provided greater clarity on customeronboarding for low-risk clients who need formal financial services but lack conventional 2 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
identification documentation (Cir. 950 and 1022).BSP Legislative Advocacies Bearing FruitWhile these issuances have helped create an enabling environment for innovations to flourish,BSP recognizes that ushering the country to a new era of digital transformation and inclusivegrowth requires new regulatory tools. With the commitment and perseverance of mypredecessors as well as the support of our lawmakers and the National Government, ourlegislative advocacies have borne fruit with the passage of the landmark laws for the financialsystem.In October 2018, Republic Act (RA) No. 11127, or the National Payment Systems Act (NPSA)was signed into law. The NPSA is a comprehensive legal framework supporting the twinobjectives of maintaining a payment system necessary to control systemic risk and providing anenvironment conducive to sustainable growth.It fosters a level playing field for all participants under a single overarching legal and regulatoryframework. This will bring about greater efficiencies, foster digital innovations and promote“coopetition”– a combination for cooperation and competition – in the financial services industry.To cope with all these rapid technological changes, there is clearly a need to make BSP morecapable, efficient, agile, stakeholder-oriented and future-ready. We, therefore, cannotoveremphasize the critical importance of the amendments to the BSP Charter with the signing ofRA No.  11211  just last month.The new BSP Charter embodies a package of reforms that places central banking in thePhilippines at the forefront of modern central banking, improves the BSP’s corporate viability, andenhances its capacity to craft proactive policies amid rising interlinkages in the financial marketsand the broader economy.Under our new Charter, the BSP shall continue fostering price and financial stability, with a clearview that our efforts are ultimately aimed at enhancing the economic wellbeing of Filipinos.BSP is also working closely with the Philippine Statistics Authority and other governmentagencies on the successful implementation of the Philippine Identification System, as providedunder RA No. 11055 signed by the President in August 2018.PhilSys aims to provide every Filipino a unique and verifiable digital ID and is envisioned to be aplatform for innovations in consumer service delivery. With PhilSys, all Filipinos can have thetools to meaningfully participate in the gains of an increasingly digitalized economy.We believe that with these regulatory and legislative initiatives, the requisite foundation for digitaltransformation has been put in place to support industry players called to respond to the needs ofFilipino consumers.Collaborating and Innovating with PurposeWhether you are a market pioneer or a startup, Financial service providers must recognize thattapping into the latest technology will not be enough; greater collaboration and more meaningfulpartnerships present the best path towards financial inclusion and inclusive growth.Strategic partnerships between agile fintechs and experienced financial institutions in the sharedfinancial space will help unlock doors to new, untapped possibilities. Greater collaboration istherefore needed to help scale innovative products and solutions and enable it to reachpreviously unchartered territories.While this remains easier said than done, the life-changing impact of technology–especially for 3 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
those living in underserved and unserved communities–should be reason enough to drive greaterand more meaningful collaboration among firms.As we commend its promised benefits, let us not forget that innovation is not the end-goal, but ameans to an end. We must innovate with a purpose to serve the common good and withcustomer-centricity as a guiding principle. Digital innovations should drive inclusivity, improve customer experience, and deliver realwelfare-enhancing benefits for all Filipinos. Only then can we truly say that technology-enabledinnovations have delivered on their promises.Conclusion: A Challenge to Provide a Better FutureAs I come to the end of my talk, I would like to share with you my philosophy that has served mewell in my decades-long career as a public servant. And since you will be talking about inclusionand digital transformation extensively later today, I think you will also find wisdom in the Oath ofthe Athenian City State. I chanced upon it when I went to Syracuse University for my Ph.D. It is apowerful oath of citizenship, engraved prominently in the dignified beauty of the foyer of MaxwellHall, housing the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs. It reads:“We will ever strive for the ideals and sacred things of the city, both alone and with many; we willunceasingly seek to quicken the sense of public duty; we will revere and obey the city’s laws; wewill transmit this City not only, not less, but greater and more beautiful than it was transmitted tous.”Though I left Syracuse University in 1981, what I learned at Maxwell remains vital to my life. I sawthe words as transcending generations and an appeal to the conscience of every citizen, of ourjoint responsibility to spend a lifetime to lift the people around us. To take on the challenge totransmit our country, the Philippines, “not only less, but greater, better and more beautiful than itwas transmitted to us.”Whatever you do, you do it for the person who comes after you. Gov. Nesting had done his part. Now, the world is your (digital) playground. Go transform it! Together, let us provide our fellowFilipinos a better future!Maraming salamat at mabuhay ang Pilipinas!Fintech (financial technology) refers to the integration of finance and technology in a manner that drives thetransformation or disruption of the traditional processes in financial service delivery.  New business modelsdriven by fintech can create new risks in different segments of the financial system, or accentuate some existingrisks.1 4 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
1    Dear Minister Bytyqi,   Dear Mr. Marco Mantovanelli, Director of the World Bank for Kosovo and North Macedonia, Dear Mr. Patrick Etienne – Country Director, Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO) Dear Ms. Lori Michealson, representative of the US Embassy  Dear President of the Board Mr. Mrasori, Dear representatives of financial institutions, Dear students and teachers,  Dear representatives of media Ladies and Gentlemen,  It is my pleasure to welcome you to this event marking the Global Money Week in the function of financial education, with our main affiliates, the Ministry of Education, the World Bank, the Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO) and the European Fund for South East Europe, who I would like to take this opportunity to thank for the unreserved support to advance developments in the financial sector in Kosovo in general and financial education in particular.  This year, Global Money Week is especially important for two reasons:  Firstly, for the fact that with the activities that we will organize this week, we have brought the Republic of Kosovo to the attention of the international arena, where the activities that we will organize this week can be followed 
2  internationally through "live streams" from central banks, regulators and international organizations dealing with financial education issues; Secondly, for the fact already announced by the CBK that 2019 will be the year of consumer protection and the activities that we will organize in the field of financial education will be in the function of consumer protection. In the present environment, where we are all witnessing the financial stability that Kosovo enjoys, placing Kosovo's financial system at a level that is comparable not only with the countries of the region but also those of the European Union, the financial education has occupied a specific place on our development agenda. Moreover, the financial services sector has a strong share in economic growth, job creation, building of vital infrastructure and sustainable development for Kosovo. Services and products of the financial sector affect the life of every citizen of Kosovo. Therefore, we are grateful, to all our associates, some of whom are here with us today, for the support they have provided to the Central Bank and other relevant institutions in building a financial market that treats consumers fairly, encourages financial involvement and helps citizens to make effective use of financial services. One of CBK's strategic goals is to encourage the development of a sound financial system in the Republic of Kosovo and to further develop the financial education function with a view to creating a sound financial culture that helps all stakeholders to make the right decisions on the basis of sufficient knowledge. This knowledge can only be gained through adequate financial education, which is consequently transformed into financial behaviours. This would be the optimum reality that all of us present today aspire, but have we managed to accomplish it? The Central Bank is developing the financial education in the function of three main dimensions: 
3  - in the function of financial stability,  - in the function of consumer protection, and - in the function of financial inclusion.  These three dimensions actually cover the whole process of financial activity, from the first confrontation with the financial product/service to the realization of the right/obligation in this report. Financial education in the function of financial stability is built on the premise of mutual trust. Financial education is the core of trust building. Without trust there can be no financial stability. If we look from the social welfare point of view, it is very important whether the citizens are able to properly manage their finances. But on the other hand, the benefits of financial knowledge extend beyond the balance sheets and income at the individual or the household level to the promotion of a stable financial system and efficient resource allocation within the real economy.  Financial education in the function of consumer protection is an active process in which information communication is only the beginning, while the ultimate goal is a positive long-term financial behaviour. Customers' decisions on the use of products and services are made on the basis of complete and reliable information as well as on their understanding of this information, therefore the presentation of this information by financial institutions is critical. Moreover, such an approach leads to a fair competition of all stakeholders in the financial sector. The CBK is committed to contributing to economic growth in the country and to work towards raising quality across the financial sector and above all to contribute to consumer protection. As a result, with the support of the European Fund for Southeast Europe "EFSE", we will implement the 
4  project "Improving the transparency of the banking market through building a platform for comparing interest rates for banks". This platform will enable citizens to make decisions based on complete and clear information, presented on a unified platform for all banks. This platform will also help increase a sound competition in the banking sector. Another important project is the Collection of Books for Financial Education designed for the lower cycle of primary schools, which in cooperation with the Ministry of Education will be distributed throughout all Kosovo schools. Kosovo students will have the opportunity to get familiarized with the economic-financial educational concepts that are important to be installed in early education.  The third dimension, the one on financial inclusion is a continuous process of advancing financial infrastructure in order to increase the availability of financial products and services at the lowest cost. Financial intermediation has advanced rapidly through the proliferation of financial services and products but only at the basic level. Building a financial market that treats consumers fairly encourages financial involvement and helps citizens to make effective use of financial services as the main premise of financial inclusion. Therefore CBK has orientated the financial education program in the function of financial inclusion in order to stimulate sufficient demand for a wide variety and wide range of services and products. Therefore, with the support of the World Bank and the Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO), we have managed to design the "Greenback Project" targeting Remittances as a very important category of revenues in Kosovo, awareness of senders and receivers of remittances, so that the destination of this category of revenues is transformed from consumption to investment. In addition, the Remittance and Payments Program will help the CBK to further advance the payment system 
5  infrastructure, in particular, the broader aspect and the cost-effectiveness of small payments.   All of us that are here today agree that through financial education we have managed to address many challenges within the three dimensions, but there is still work to be done. The financial system is constantly evolving towards expanding more complex financial products and services, so the financial education program should respond proactively to this new dimension. This proactivity imposes the need for the National Financial Education Strategy, for which I consider that now it is the time to start the dialogue. I consider that today's signing of the Agreement of Understanding between the Central Bank and the Ministry of Education will be a good start in this regard.   In conclusion, please allow me to thank the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology, the World Bank, the Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO), the EFSE for the excellent cooperation in achieving the present results and all you representatives of other relevant institutions for the future cooperation. Thank you very much! 
Sabine Lautenschläger: Cross-border banking since the crisis –lessons for supervisorsStatement by Ms Sabine Lautenschläger, Member of the Executive Board of the EuropeanCentral Bank, at the 10 Years Vienna Initiative - Anniversary Conference 2019, Vienna, 27 March2019.*   *   *The crisis has shown that the banking sector is deeply interconnected worldwide, and that abanking crisis can quickly spread from one country to another.It also laid bare a number of weaknesses in the global regulatory framework. But after long andtough negotiations, we agreed on the Basel III framework, which addresses most of theweaknesses found in global regulation. It will help make global financial markets safer byensuring that global banks and banks with cross-border activities have to comply with a commonframework of minimum capital, liquidity and risk management standards.The crisis clearly showed that supervision should not stop at national borders. And it alsoshowed us that cooperation between home and host supervisors is key to understanding therisks banks are exposed to when doing business across borders.In recent years, cooperation between supervisors has increased significantly, on the back of newglobal and European standards for home/host cooperation. Cooperation between supervisorshas become natural; in fact, it has become essential. This cooperation has been institutionalisedvia supervisory colleges and crisis management groups.Standards now apply when information is exchanged between host and home supervisors, andwhen joint fact findings and assessments are due. And various criteria now apply whensupervisors from different countries have to agree on joint action regarding banks.Of course, it is easier to cooperate in theory than in practice. And it is easier to cooperate innormal times than in times of crisis.The Vienna Initiative was an important example of cooperation in crisis times. And with theVienna Initiative 2.0 in particular, we have seen how important it is to provide structures andplatforms for home/host cooperation. It is undeniable that, in times of crisis, the interests of homeand host supervisors may diverge. But without cooperation, it would be very difficult to maintainfinancial stability.Breaking this kind of prisoner’s dilemma requires trust. But trust cannot be built over a few daysof talks at the height of a crisis. Trust requires us to understand each other’s priorities andconstraints. And this takes time. In a way, this should be seen as an investment. As a supervisor,you should invest your time in building trust with other authorities. It will pay off.In practice, the fact that this lesson has not been fully learned, means there are still obstacles tocross-border banking.In Europe, we have gone one step further in ensuring that banks in the euro area are supervisedaccording to one approach – an essential part of the response to the crisis was to create a singlesupervisor for the euro area.The single rulebook forms the basis for this supervision. But this rulebook is not as single assupervisors would like. There are still some important areas in urgent need of harmonisation, notonly to ensure a level playing field, but also to promote cross-border banking. 1 / 2BIS central bankers' speeches
I will mention just a few:Fit and proper rules are not harmonised at all.Many crisis-related supervisory competences are not harmonised.There are still some options and national discretions open to Member States, which meansbanks can be treated differently for reasons other than the underlying risks.We see that cross-border banking has recovered elsewhere but not in Europe. European banksstill lag behind in this respect. In part, this is also due to ring fencing, which limits banks’ ability tofreely move liquidity and capital within groups in Europe.I understand that taking the first step in eliminating ring-fencing is daunting. Host countrysupervisors fear being left to foot the bill of costly crises. For small economies, or largeeconomies with a large number of foreign banks, this is a challenge. But it is a challenge weneed to find a common solution to. And we need to find this solution before the next crisis hits. 2 / 2BIS central bankers' speeches
Dimitar Radev: Accession to the euro area - a catalyst for social andeconomic prosperitySummary of a statement by Mr Dimitar Radev, Governor of the Bulgarian National Bank, at theAnnual Government Meets the Business conference, Sofia, 29 January 2019.*   *   *During the Annual Government Meets the Business conference dedicated to Bulgaria’s path tothe eurozone, the Bulgarian National Bank’s Governor, Mr. Dimitar Radev, outlined the activitiesof the central bank in this process and the anticipated effects for the economy and the businessfrom the national currency’s entry into the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM II) and the adoptionof the euro in Bulgaria.Provisionally, the work will be conducted in two stages: a short- and long-term. The short-termstage is linked to the preparation for simultaneous accession to the Banking Union and lev’s entryinto ERM II. The second stage is Bulgaria joining the euro area.Mr. Radev underlined that the BNB is currently focused on the first stage, the outcomes of whichwill determine the next steps to follow. In terms of content, the first stage consists in joining theSingle Supervisory Mechanism and the Single Resolution Mechanism.As regards the Single Supervisory Mechanism, the BNB is concentrated on three work blocks.The first one is creating the necessary regulatory framework. Overall, work in this direction wascompleted with the adoption of the necessary package of legislative amendments by the NationalAssembly at the end of last year. The second block relates to synchronising the BNB supervisorypractices with those of the ECB. This includes an enormous amount of activities, among whichsupervisory regulations, statistics, and IT systems. The BNB’s efforts in this area are a logicaldevelopment of the banking sector reforms launched in 2015. The third work block is linked toorganising and conducting the asset quality review and the stress test, which is a widelydiscussed topic. The preparatory phase in this respect has been completed. The banks that willbe covered by the review and stress test have been designated, as well as the auditors,methodologies and macroeconomic scenarios used for the stress test purposes. The results areexpected to be announced in July, Mr. Radev said.Work on the Single Resolution Mechanism has been organised in very much the same way. Anessential element in the first work block in this area – amendments to the legal framework – isthe preparation of a Draft Law amending and supplementing the Law on the Recovery andResolution of Credit Institutions and Investment Firms. The part involving the BNB was finalisedat the end of last year and is due for submission to the National Assembly with legalamendments likely to get adopted by the end of this quarter. The BNB Governor also outlined thesecond work block in this direction, on which the BNB is currently working, i.e., the overallframework of determining the amount of funds to be contributed by banks to the SingleResolution Fund and the amount and way of transferring funds from the Bank Resolution Fund inBulgaria, which was set up in 2015, to the Single Resolution Fund. The third work block coversthe overall activity of planning and conducting resolution activities, including the distribution ofresponsibilities and tasks between the Single Resolution Board and the BNB after our countryjoins the Banking Union.With regard to the expected effects on the economy and the business, the BNB Governorhighlighted that it was positive to reaffirm Bulgaria’s strategic course, and that the process isalready being filled with content and specific timeframe. The whole process stands as a positivecounterbalance against the more general uncertainty from the global and European economicenvironment. 1 / 2BIS central bankers' speeches
Among the more direct positive effects from this first stage on the path to the euro area is theanticipated improvement of the country’s credit rating, as announced by the credit agencies,should the process run successfully in the short-term. That would improve the funding conditionsin the country.At the same time, the effects of joining ERM II will not be tangible in regard to the macroeconomicpolicy and neither will our monetary regime change. The BNB Governor made it clear that theonly exit from the current regime would be the replacement of the lev with the euro at thecurrently fixed exchange rate.The whole process of accession – first to the Banking Union and ERM II, and next to the euroarea – could not substitute for the good macroeconomic practices and business projects, Mr.Radev said. A country refusing to comply with this is sure to suffer serious economic andfinancial difficulties whether inside or outside the euro area.The two proven pillars of good macroeconomic policy in Bulgaria are the fiscal stability and themonetary regime stability. Should these conditions, together with the continuous improvement ofinstitutions, be present, the preparatory process and subsequently the accession to the euroarea would be a catalyst for the social and economic prosperity of our country. 2 / 2BIS central bankers' speeches

Many other parts of the national accountsmeasure of output – gross domestic product (GDP) – are actually doing reasonably well. Outside themining sector, where some large projects are still winding down, business investment is growing at asolid pace. Transport and renewable energy projects have been quite important. Public demand,both consumption and investment, is supporting growth.There are also some areas of weakness outside the household sector, such as the drought-affectedrural sector, which is weighing on exports at the moment. Droughts and other recent naturaldisasters clearly pose difficulties for those directly affected. But the underlying trends in the broadereconomy are not determined by these events. So in the main, outside the household sector, theeconomy is not doing too badly.The Labour Market has Unambiguously ImprovedThis makes sense, because employment has been strong and someone must be hiring all those extraworkers. Over the past year, total employment has increased by more than 2 per cent. Theunemployment rate declined by ½ percentage point over 2018, reaching the level of 5 per centbefore our forecasts implied it would (Graph 1). This is a good outcome. Youth unemployment hasdeclined and most measures of underemployment have also come down a bit. [*]

We can see this either by looking at the industry thatpeople say they work in, or we can use the ABS's new Labour Account to triangulate this informationwith what firms say their industry is. Either way, we see jobs being added in a range of industries.Employment in health care and social assistance has been increasing for a while; the rollout of theNDIS is an important driver of this, but not the only one. More recently, we have also seenemployment increase in a number of business services industries. Construction employment had alsobeen strong for a while, reaching the highest share of total employment in more than a century ofrecords.

The employment and unemployment datacome from the ABS's survey of households. But a survey of businesses, also from the ABS, tells usthat the number of job vacancies has been a very high share of the total jobs available. Separateprivate-sector surveys of businesses tell us that many firms plan to hire more workers. Many of ourown liaison contacts also tell us that they are hiring.And as the labour market gradually tightens, we are beginning to see the effects in wages growth.This has been low for some time, but is gradually trending up now, especially in the private sector(Graph 3). Part of this shift is that fewer workers are subject to wage freezes than was the case ayear or so ago. Minimum and award wage rises have also increased. Along with other countries, it'staking longer and a lower unemployment rate to start seeing faster wages growth than historicalexperience might have suggested. Indeed, we still think Australia is a little way off the levels of theunemployment rate that would induce materially faster wages growth. But as the experience of othercountries has also shown, if the labour market tightens enough, wages growth does eventually pickup.

Spending on less discretionaryitems like food has been less affected.There has been a deal of talk about the possibility that ‘wealth effects’ from declining housing pricesmight be weighing on spending. It's important to remember, though, that people's reaction to a fallin prices is likely to depend partly on how far prices had increased previously.
3/26/2019What's Up (and Down) With Households? | Speeches | RBAhttps://www.rba.gov.au/speeches/2019/sp-ag-2019-03-26.html6/17Graph 5Some recent work by colleagues at the Bank suggests that the link is a bit more subtle than simplythat increases in wealth boost spending directly (May, Nodari and Rees 2019). It isn't so much thatpeople wake up one morning, realise their home is worth more, and decide to go out shopping.Rather, if their home is worth more, they can borrow more against it, which matters for somepeople's decisions to buy a car. And because rising housing prices usually occur in the context ofhigh rates of transactions in the market, spending on home furnishings tends to rise and fall withhousing prices. So when housing prices decline, turnover also declines. This means there are fewerpeople moving house and realising their old couch doesn't fit or they need new furnishings in theextra bedroom.Slow Income Growth is a Drag on Household SpendingBeyond this specific link to housing turnover, some slowdown in consumption spending is not entirelyunexpected. For several years now, we have been calling out the issue of weak income growth andhow it might test the resilience of household consumption spending. This is a particular issue in thecontext of high household debt and the need to service that debt.One aspect of economic theory that actually works in practice is the observation that people try tosmooth their consumption in the face of fluctuating incomes. Income growth is noticeably morevolatile than consumption growth. So the usual pattern is that gaps between the two resolve withshifts in income growth, not shifts in consumption growth.
3/26/2019What's Up (and Down) With Households? | Speeches | RBAhttps://www.rba.gov.au/speeches/2019/sp-ag-2019-03-26.html7/17But there might be limits to how long households can continue expanding their consumption fasterthan their income is rising. People are still saving, and they can do so at a slower rate. But at somepoint they might conclude that this is not temporary and that low income growth will persist. At thatpoint they would be likely to adjust their spending plans. Consumption growth would then slow.So we need to establish how household income growth might indeed return back towards currentrates of consumption growth or even higher. To do that, we need to understand why it has been soweak.Labour Income Growth Has Recovered SomewhatFor some time, part of the story had been that labour income growth was weak. This has been trueacross several dimensions. First, the growth of wage rates for particular jobs has been slow(Graph 6). This is the measure of wages growth captured by the ABS's Wage Price Index (WPI). Itcaptures changes in wages paid for a fixed pool of jobs. As I already mentioned, growth in thismeasure has started increasing, though only gradually. It is still well below what one might expect inthe longer run, if inflation is to average between 2 and 3 per cent and if productivity maintains asimilar average growth rate to its average over the past decade or so.People's actual incomes include bonuses and other non-wage labour income, and average labourincome depends on whether the mix of jobs in the economy is changing. For a number of years,these factors combined to make average earnings per hour, as recorded in the national accounts,increase much more slowly than the mix-adjusted WPI measure. It isn't unusual for growth in thismeasure of earnings to differ from growth in the WPI. They are compiled on different bases. But inthe years following the end of the mining investment boom, this gap was persistently negative, andquite large.

It's hard to pinpoint howimportant this effect was, because the weakness in average earnings growth was seen in someindustry-level data as well. So at least some people would have had to be switching to lower-paidjobs in the same industry. Another factor that might have been at work was that fewer people wereactually switching jobs than in the past. Surveys that track people through time, such as the HILDAsurvey, show that people who change jobs often see faster income growth in the year they switched,than people who didn't change jobs (Graph 7).

Many firms report that they find it hard to findsuitable labour, at least for some roles, and that this is a constraint on their businesses, thoughusually not a major one (Graph 8). But when we ask our contacts what they are doing about thisproblem, paying people more is not the first solution they think of. Even poaching someone fromanother firm by enticing them with higher pay is not that common. The evidence from our liaisonprogram suggests that it has long been the case that firms first resort to other strategies to deal withlabour shortages, and only turn to faster wage increases when the shortages are severe andpersistent (Leal 2019).

Slow wages growth is still a concern, but in terms of itscontribution to income growth, it is less of a puzzle than it was a few years ago. Instead we need toseek the source of the more recent weakness elsewhere.Non-Labour Income Remains WeakIf we break household disposable income growth into its components, we can see the drivers of themore recent weakness (Graph 9). Labour income is not especially strong, but it no longer seems atodds with growth in employment and other information about wages growth. Rather, growth in othersources of income has been weak for some time, and this has continued more recently.

It turns out that a confluence offactors has resulted in growth in most of these categories of income being weak recently. In somecases, this is a trend change that is likely to persist. Some others are driven by shorter-term factorsthat could reverse in coming years.Social assistance payments have been relatively flat for a number of years (Graph 10). As the labourmarket has strengthened and unemployment has come down, it is not surprising that some forms ofsocial assistance have not been growing. But there are a few other things going on at the same time.Firstly, the rate of growth of age pension payments has slowed, though it is still positive. There are anumber of probable drivers of this, including the increase in the eligibility age, as well as morepeople above the (higher) eligibility age remaining in the workforce rather than drawing a pension. Itis also possible that, as time goes on and the people who are retiring have had longer to accumulatesuperannuation balances, more people are receiving a part-pension together with an income streamfrom their superannuation.
3/26/2019What's Up (and Down) With Households? | Speeches | RBAhttps://www.rba.gov.au/speeches/2019/sp-ag-2019-03-26.html12/17Graph 10Secondly, in recent years, growth in social welfare spending by the government has come from newprograms (like the NDIS) that are counted as government consumption, not household income, inthe national accounts. So while both disability payments and other payments to families with childrenhave been broadly constant in dollar terms for several years, government consumption has beengrowing strongly over the same period. If we adjusted for this, the growth in the social assistancecomponent of household income would look much closer to its average over the past, rather thanwell below average.These factors all relate to the design of programs assisting households, and how they are classifiedin the national accounts. So we would not expect them to reverse all of a sudden. This implies thatwe should also not expect that measured household income from this source will bounce backstrongly any time soon.Rental income has also been a bit weak (Graph 11). This is not surprising considering that rents havebeen rising only slowly in most cities, and falling for a few years in Perth. But rental income is onlyearned by 15 per cent of taxpayers, and lower cash rental income for landlords is also lower rentpaid by renters, leaving them with more money to pay for other things. So the weakness in rentalincome is unlikely to be a large driver of any slowdown in consumer spending. Income from otherkinds of investments has also been a bit weak, but has recovered a bit lately. [1]

This can be a volatile type of incomeand sensitive to conditions in particular sectors. The farm sector represents a large share ofunincorporated business income, compared with their share of the economy. So one reason this typeof income has fallen has been the effect of the drought on farm incomes. A recovery here willdepend on how soon normal seasonal conditions return. Much of the rest of unincorporated businessincome comes from sectors related to the property market, including building tradespeople and realestate agents. They are also seeing lower incomes, as both construction activity and the volume ofsales of existing homes decline. Again, it can be envisaged that these sources of income mightrecover at some point, but not in the very near term.Tax and Other Payments are Dragging on DisposableIncomeWhen we think about household income available for consumption and saving, economists usuallytalk about household disposable income. This is income net of taxes, net interest payments and afew other deductions like insurance premiums. Income payable – the things deducted from grossincome to calculate disposable income – increased by nearly 6 per cent in 2018. This wassignificantly faster than growth in gross household income.
3/26/2019What's Up (and Down) With Households? | Speeches | RBAhttps://www.rba.gov.au/speeches/2019/sp-ag-2019-03-26.html14/17Despite the relatively weak picture for household income growth, the tax revenue collected fromhouseholds has grown solidly in recent years. It's normal for growth in tax revenue to outpaceincome growth a bit: that is how a progressive tax system works. A useful rule of thumb is that, inthe absence of adjustments to tax brackets to allow for bracket creep, for every one percentagepoint of growth in household income, taxes paid by households will on average increase by about1.4 percentage points. That's an on-average figure, though. The actual ratio can vary quite a bit.In the past year, taxes paid by households increased by around 8 per cent, more than double therate of growth in gross household income of 3½ per cent. So the ratio is more like a bit over two-to-one at the moment, rather than 1.4 to one. That is at the high end of the range this ratio reaches,but as this graph shows, it is not unprecedented (Graph 12). But this effect has cumulated over time,so that the share of income that is paid in tax has been rising (Graph 12, bottom panel).Graph 12What is noteworthy is that for all of the past six years, growth in tax paid has exceeded incomegrowth by an above-average margin, at a time when income growth itself has been slow (Graph 13).
3/26/2019What's Up (and Down) With Households? | Speeches | RBAhttps://www.rba.gov.au/speeches/2019/sp-ag-2019-03-26.html15/17Graph 13There are likely to be several things going on here. Aside from the usual bracket creep, somedeductions and offsets have declined, boosting the overall tax take. Interest rates on investmentproperty loans are now higher than for owner-occupiers, but overall the interest rate structure onmortgages is lower than it was a few years ago. So landlords will have lower tax deductions forinterest payments on loans on investment properties. At the same time, the significant run-up inhousing prices in some cities over the past decade will have increased the capital gains tax liabilitypaid by investors selling a property. Turnover in the housing market has declined. But as best we cantell, the price effect has dominated the effect of declining volumes, and total capital gains tax paidhas increased.Compliance efforts and technological progress in tax collection have boosted revenue collected froma given income. The Tax Office reports that its efforts to raise compliance around work-relateddeductions have boosted revenue noticeably (Jordan 2019). The next wave of this effort, focused ondeductions related to rental properties, could result in further boosts to revenue.
3/26/2019What's Up (and Down) With Households? | Speeches | RBAhttps://www.rba.gov.au/speeches/2019/sp-ag-2019-03-26.html16/17Some of these drivers boosting tax paid could persist for a while, but they aren't permanent. Forexample, the earlier period of strong housing price growth will only increase capital gains taxrevenue if the asset was owned during that period. It can be expected to become less important, thefurther into history it passes. Similarly, increased compliance increases the level of tax paid on agiven level of income. It is not a change in the trend growth rate in tax paid. That said, the effectcould last for a while as efforts shift to different aspects of compliance.Some Recent Policy Changes Might Mitigate the Drag onConsumptionThe net of all these effects is that household income growth has remained slow even as labourmarket conditions have been improving. Unlike slow wages growth, though, it is less clear how muchweak non-labour income growth will weigh on consumer spending. As I already noted, slow growthin rental income for landlords means that tenants have more money to spend on other things. Someof the weakness in social assistance payments is because new programs are being delivereddifferently from existing ones, and so they are classified as government consumption. The netbenefit to the recipients could be the same or higher.So there might be reasons to think that weak non-labour income growth is less worrisome than weakwages growth. But you would not want to rely on that possibility to underpin your views on theoutlook for consumption. So this is an area we need to watch closely. Household consumptionspending is a large part of economic activity. A significant retrenchment there would lower growthand feed back into a weaker labour market, as well as into decisions to purchase housing.Parting ThoughtsMy talk today has deliberately not overlapped with what the Bank has recently said about thehousing market. But I think it's clear that conditions in the household sector more broadly are highlyconsequential for the housing sector and thus this audience. Whatever other forces might beaffecting housing market developments, fundamentally demand for housing rests on the householdsector's confidence and capacity to take on the financial commitments involved in the purchase orrental of a home. Without enough income, and so without a strong labour market, that confidenceand capacity would be in doubt. This is not the only reason we are watching labour marketdevelopments closely. But the nexus between labour markets, households and housing are crucial toour assessment of the broader outlook.Thank you for your time.

Luljeta Minxhozi: The importance of educating young people inGlobal Money WeekAddress by Ms Luljeta Minxhozi, First Deputy Governor of the Bank of Albania, to the openingceremony of the Global Money Week in Albania, Tirana, 25 March 2019.*   *   *Dear Deputy Minister of Education, Youth and Sports,Dear Chairman of the Albanian Association of Banks,Dear students and teachers,Dear old and new friends of the Bank of Albania,On this first day of the Global Money Week, I wish you a warm welcome to the central building ofthe Bank of Albania and thank you for participating and engaging in our activities.This is the 12th year the Bank of Albania engages, like many other central banks across theworld, in financial education efforts for the public in general, with a particular focus on the younggeneration.  This marks also the sixth year of Bank of Albania’s engagement as the organiser ofthe Money Week.This has become an annual meeting place for all stakeholders having an interest in this beautifuland important, at the same time complicated and challenging field. Like many other centralbanks, the Bank of Albania has assumed a proactive role in enhancing financial literacy. Thiscommitment is fully in line with the spirit of transparency toward the public and raising itsawareness on economic and financial issues, which have an impact on the day-to-day living foreach and every one of us.Over these 12 years, with support from the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports and theAlbanian Association of Banks, numerous educational activities and projects have been designedand implemented. They have been tailored to target different age groups, and consist of a varietyof activities such as training for teachers and journalists, brochures for the general public,dedicated programmes for high schools, such as the “Personal Finance in Your Hands”, theeducational package for the elementary schools and the Albanian Money app.The Museum of the Bank of Albania reflects perfectly our efforts for enhancing knowledge aboutmoney. The multifunctional Museum provides visitors with a platform that helps them to learnabout the monetary history in Albania, as well as the functions and importance of the centralbank, and to become more financially literate.The Money Week is a global celebration campaign built to inspire children and young people tolearn about money matters, livelihoods and entrepreneurship, hence becoming responsible andfinancially capable citizens in the future.Starting today, the Money Week will be celebrated in 169 countries across the world, until 31March 2019. This is a Child & Youth Finance International (CYFI) initiative, with the support of theOrganisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and over 53 thousandinstitutions and organisations and over 32 million children and young people participate in thisyear’s edition.The slogan for this year is ‘Learn.Save.Earn.’ Around this slogan, partner institutions organiseawareness-raising and educational activities. As active participants in the Money Week activities,we have chosen to focus on educating the young people and encouraging them not to use the 1 / 2BIS central bankers' speeches
outdated terms “new lek” – “old lek” in our day-to-day financial interactions.Our slogan for this year is “Too young to speak in old lek”This is the overarching theme for most of our contest categories. I take this opportunity to thank,on behalf of the Bank of Albania, all the participants and I exhort them to be an active part in theefforts for eliminating such outdated terminology.The Bank of Albania, with long-standing support from the Albanian Association of Banks, and theprecious support from the Ministry of Education, Sports and Youth, will organise a series ofawareness-raising activities for children and young people on such topics. Thus, during theWeek, a number of activities will be organised such as lectures, contests, visits to commercialbanks and the Museum of the Bank of Albania, aimed at involving as many students as possible.In all educational activities of the Bank of Albania, including these contests, we appreciate andencourage inspiration, originality and proactive thinking.The submitted projects for all the categories, whose winners are present today, feature all theseelements. I take this opportunity to personally congratulate all of them for their qualitative workspresented during the submission phase. Their work and engagement are a source of constantinspiration for the Bank of Albania to introduce increasingly ambitious projects.The projects category targeted sixth graders, the photomontage category targeted ninth gradersand the videos category targeted high-school students. The participation rate was very high, witharound 340 students from 40 schools.   I would like to extend my special thanks to the teachers and professors, whose commitment andpassion is a key and necessary element for the realisation of these educational projects.Lastly, I would like to thank you all for the insofar commitment, and invite all the participatinginstitutions to continue the cooperation in the future, with a view to advancing our financialeducation efforts for the children and young people, contributing, in turn, to the livelihood of thesociety in Albania.Thank You! 2 / 2BIS central bankers' speeches

I cannot imagine a better place to talk about digitalisation and its potential effects on the economy.  One example of technological advances and the effects of digitalisation is right here – in our mobile phones. Four out of five Swedes in the age range 16-85 had access to the internet via a mobile phone in 2018.1 It is difficult to imagine, but to-day's smart phones actually have greater processing power than the computers that enabled the Apollo moon landing in 1969!2 Smart phones also give us access to inconceivable amounts of information and entertainment that did not even ex-ist in 1969. The answer to a question is only a few clicks away.  As a consumer it is easy to see the value of these technological advances, alt-hough we do not in our daily lives use the capacity for anything comparable to the giant leap for mankind the moon landing entailed…  The new technology provides us with entertainment, but not only that. It also af-fects our working lives and the economy in general. Rapid developments in tech-nology gradually lead to higher productivity and increase our welfare, but they are also a source of concern for many people. Will my job still exist in the future, or will it be done by a robot or an algorithm? How can my company compete in these days of rapid technological advances?                                                            * I would like to thank Erik Frohm for helping prepare this speech, Elizabeth Nilsson for translating and Meredith Beechey-Österholm, Charlotta Edler, Rebecka Hallerby, Jesper Hansson, Åsa Olli Segendorf, Marianne Sterner and Ulf Söderström for valuable comments. 1 Refers to Statistics Sweden's figures on private individuals’ access to and use of IT. 82% of all Swedes in the age range 16-85 years had access to the internet via a mobile phone in 2018. http://www.statistikdata-basen.scb.se/pxweb/sv/ssd/START__LE__LE0108__LE0108D/LE0108T14/?rxid=8f4a0041-1be9-4ed3-b6fb-182251a2b5cd 2 https://www.zmescience.com/research/technology/smartphone-power-compared-to-apollo-432/ 
       2 [12]  My speech today will not provide all the answers. Instead, I intend to discuss my thoughts on how digitalisation can affect various parts of the economy and what role it plays for monetary policy. Can the Riksbank attain its target of 2 per cent even in a world of digitalisation? Is it still desirable to aim for this target? My reply to both of these questions is yes, but I will return to that later. Focus on digitalisation – where are we now? What is digitalisation and how does it differ from the concepts of automation and technological advances? Jesper Roine, professor at the Stockholm School of Eco-nomics has divided them up in a useful manner.3  Automation – a machine doing the work of a person.  Digitalisation – converting information to a digital form.  Technological advances – broader concept that covers the other two but also other things.  The concepts are of course related. Digitalisation can enable automation and is an example of technological advances. In this speech I focus on digitalisation, but will also touch on the automation that follows on from digitalisation. I wish to include in the concept of digitalisation here machine learning, artificial intelligence, 3D printers and the use of cloud services and Big Data. A common collective name of-ten used for several of these technologies is Industry 4.0 or the Fourth Industrial Revolution.  Will productivity increase?  How far have we come with regard to the digitalisation of the business sector? One hears an awful lot about technological developments in the media and in business journals. From what is written one might easily gain the impression that we can do more and faster. But official data on productivity does not confirm this. The fact that statistics and reality sometimes appear to be disconnected from one another is nothing new. In 1987 economist Robert Solow wrote “you can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics”, when describing the emergence of information and communication technology (ICT) and the relatively low productivity growth in the United States in the 1980s.  If we look at Sweden, productivity growth in the business sector has been very weak since 2006, a year or so before the global financial crisis occurred. We have often had to revise down our productivity forecasts as a result of the surprisingly weak development. Productivity has also shown weak development in other de-veloped countries recently, which indicates that it is the result of a joint trend.  There are many possible explanations for the decline. Some economists, such as Robert Gordon, say we are in a period of very low productivity growth that will be the new normal for a rather long time. According to this point of view, a large share of the fruits of digitalisation have already been harvested. As early as 2005, for instance, several economies had adapted their business methods and models                                                            3 Roine (2016). 
       3 [12]  to the internet. The conclusion of this point of view is, put simply, that more re-cent innovations have not been as significant as those during earlier industrial rev-olutions.4 Others, such as Andrew McAfee and Erik Brynjolfsson at MIT, say that the effects of digitalisation have passed under the radar and that we will see major produc-tivity increases in the future when the new technologies are used more broadly in the business sector.5 Economic historian Joel Mokyr also points out that the pro-ductive potential in new technologies will lead to strong pressure for change in the economy.6  As you can hear, there are very differing views on the subject and the assessment of future productivity growth is a question we are constantly struggling with. We are in the “installation phase” Personally, I think that that model from Bart van Ark (2016) is useful when consid-ering the different views. This distinguishes between an “installation phase” and a “deployment phase” for new technology.  The first phase involves exploring new markets and growth is limited to a couple of companies. During the second phase the markets are consolidated and there is broad growth in the economy.  One can imagine that Brynjolfsson and McAfee consider we are in the first phase, while Gordon thinks we have already passed the second phase.  My assessment is that we are probably somewhere in the installation phase with regard to digitalisation. I base this on some, few, companies having seen their market power increase in recent years.7 These companies are often known as “su-perstars” and have high profit margins and have experienced high return on in-vested capital. They are often multinational corporations that sell products and services all over the world. At the same time, it appears as though smaller compa-nies have fared less well. The difference in productivity between superstars and ordinary companies has also increased.8 When we talk to companies in our Business Survey, they largely confirm this pic-ture. The companies that have long been subjected to international competition on global markets have a greater tendency to regard digitalisation as an oppor-tunity than the consumer-related companies with most of their operations in Sweden.  Change is a necessary condition for a prosperous society... Regardless of what stage of technological development we are at, it is clear that technological advances revolutionise lives and entire societies. The internal com-bustion engine transformed transportation in society. Electricity gave us light,                                                            4 Cowen (2011). 5 Brynjolfsson and McAfee (2011). 6 https://voxeu.org/article/technological-progress-thing-past 7 See, for instance, De Loecker and Eekhout (2017, 2018). 8 OECD (2015). 
       4 [12]  heat and energy. Digitalisation, and above all the internet, has given us almost di-rect access to enormous amounts of information. Each new innovation replaces other products or changes their areas of use. Our behaviour changes and we make new demands of companies and decision-mak-ers.  In some branches the changes have been particularly marked over the past dec-ade. One example is traditional media. More people are reading the news online or on Twitter instead of printed newspapers or listening to podcasts instead of the radio and watching YouTube instead of TV. The financial sector has also experi-enced a major revolution. Fewer and fewer transactions are made with cash and banking services that were previously provided at bank offices have moved online. Swish payments are now as common as cash payments.9 In a few years’ time, it may be the case that the use of cash is at such a low level that the general public no longer has access to any form of central bank money that can be used to make payments in ordinary shops. This would be a step into the unknown, and is some-thing I have mentioned on earlier occasions when I discussed the potential intro-duction of an e-krona.10 Change and “creative destruction” are positive in the long run.11 It is important to point this out, even if it seems obvious.  In 1850, almost four in five people in Swe-den worked in the agricultural sector. It was hard work, done under difficult con-ditions and entailed long working days. Just over 100 years later, less than one in five people in Sweden were working in agriculture. Many had instead sought their fortunes in the growing industrial sector, which reached an employment peak in the mid-1960s. Gradually, jobs in the industrial sector were then replaced by jobs in the service industries, including the public sector. This process has continued during the 1990s and 2000s and in 2018 more than 50 per cent of all private sec-tor employees in Sweden were working in service industries. At the same time, GDP per capita has shown rapid trend growth from 1850 until now. Productivity growth means we have time and money over to invest in other things than work and output. Ultimately, it increases our welfare, makes our workplaces better and improves our health. A somewhat hackneyed but nevertheless descrip-tive quote from Nobel Prize winner Paul Krugman is “Productivity isn’t everything, but, in the long run, it is almost everything”.12  ...but also creates distinct challenges Despite changes and productivity improvements in the long run lying behind al-most all of the growth in welfare, there are of course important challenges in the short run. Behind every statistic there are people and families. Owning horse-drawn coaches when the internal combustion engine was commercialised or be-ing a seamstress when Spinning-Jenny came into operation was probably quite tough. Similarly, there can be major upheavals in our lives if driverless trucks push                                                            9 Sveriges Riksbank (2018a). 10 Skingsley (2018). 11 The concept of creative destruction was coined by Joseph Schumpeter in 1942. 12 Krugman (1997). 
       5 [12]  out lorry drivers or software and algorithms take over administrative tasks. Or, to take changes in my own job as members of the Executive Board of the Riksbank, when a combination of algorithms, machine learning and Big Data become better than human analysts at making forecasts, or even designing well-balanced mone-tary policy. Such changeovers can create gaps between different sections of the population. Those with the right skills to make use of the technological developments will find it easy to get jobs and can see their salaries rise because of higher productivity. In economist speak this is called being a complement to technology. Routine and less complicated work tasks can be replaced by automatic processes, which leads to lower demand for these jobs and thus lower wages. Such jobs are substitutes for technology. Then there are also jobs which are not tangibly affected by tech-nological developments. These are jobs with a high service content and many hu-man elements. Psychologists, preschool teachers, health and medical care special-ists and hairdressers are the examples usually put forward as difficult to replace with automatic processes and AI.  I am fairly convinced that we in Sweden can use today's technology as comple-ment to the strengths we already have. Smart automated solutions give us more time and resources to invest in other important issues. They also give us new tools to manage new challenges. What is obvious is that we cannot stand still in terms of competence. We must embrace life-long learning as a motto.  Otherwise there is a risk of further differences between those who have skills that benefit from the new technology and those who are replaced. How long these dif-ferences prevail will depend on how quickly people with outdated skills can adopt new skills, change their way of thinking and benefit from the new conditions. But, as I said, this isn't really anything new. As we saw earlier, the agricultural society was replaced by an industrial society that has been replaced by a services society. The number of jobs has not declined and GDP per capita shows a rising trend. But we need to also see the human fates beneath the statistical surface. The fact that welfare is increasing on a general level does not mean that the changes are being made without any frictions at individual level. The effects of technological advances may be different from be-fore An important difference between the current technological developments and the previous revolutions is that the new economy requires increasing elements of purely human traits. Muscle power was needed in both agriculture and the manu-facturing industry. Both sectors had many routine and relatively simple work tasks. But in the new economy creativity, inventiveness and the “human touch” are considered important. These are abilities that often require adaptation to the situation, they are difficult to teach and therefore difficult to copy, even with new technology. The new skills we need to acquire make high demands of our educa-tional systems and of skills development in companies and in the public sector. And if technological advances continue at a rapid pace, we must all be ready to update our knowledge. 
       6 [12]  The effects of digitalisation can also be much greater than the effects of earlier in-dustrial revolutions. Online robots and AI have the potential to replace large sec-tors of the human workforce. Some analysts think that the whole labour market will change fundamentally, and that this will be fairly soon.13 In such a situation, it will not only be groups of employees with different skills that will be polarized. Here I am not even talking about the most dystopic forecast for the future – of an almost omniscient artificial intelligence with its own agenda that takes over the world. Instead I mean a changeover to where many tasks and jobs are no longer done by people. Such a development will create tension between those who own capital in the form of equity and funds and those who do not. This is because the capital owners will receive the productivity gains generated by the machines.  Digitalisation can lead to concentrated product markets. There are other problems with digitalisation for market economies. We see al-ready now social networks like Twitter, Facebook and Instagram dominate their respective markets. Few people use search engines other than Google. These companies are not only dominant in their respective fields; they also determine who may market themselves or express themselves on their platforms. In this way, they govern how other companies reach out to prospective customers.  Of course, size and influence need not necessarily be negative from a competition perspective. The problems arise when new companies experience difficulty start-ing up their operations and are forced to deal with various entry barriers to be able to “challenge”14  the established players on the market in question. Both economies of scale and network effects can function as entry barriers, however. Starting up a new Facebook would be difficult and require major investments, but it is not impossible.15  A further problem that can arise from digitalisation is that companies can use the different price comparison sites to observe one another’s pricing. One often claims that these platforms are really good for consumers trying to find the lowest prices, but they also make it easier for companies to monitor one another’s prices and coordinate their prices with one another.16 This can be a problem from the point of view of competition. Challenges can be tackled The short-term challenges I have described should not be underestimated. They are real problems that affect real people. And problems experienced now are not helped by knowing that humanity will benefit in the long run. But what is the best                                                            13 Stefan Fölster replicated a study by Frey and Osborne (2013) using Swedish data and found that more than 50 per cent of all jobs could be replaced by digital and automated technology in the coming 20 years. A study by the OECD shows instead that around 35 per cent of Swedish professions have a high or significant risk of automation.  14 Baumol et al (1982). 15 Facebook was far from the first social network. In Sweden there were similar platforms such as Skunk, Lunar-storm, MySpace and other local variations such as Apberget https://www.svd.se/lunarstorm-tillbaka--men-vad-hande-med-skunk#sida-2 long before this. However, none of these platforms succeeded in becoming as large or maintaining popularity for as long as Facebook.  16 The European Commission found in a branch study that a majority of companies monitor their competitors’ prices. Two thirds use software to automatically adjust their prices when other companies adjust theirs.   
       7 [12]  way of dealing with these problems? I think there are three areas that are particu-larly important. However, I say this in the knowledge that they are far beyond the Riksbank's sphere of influence. Others hold the tools and the responsibility for them.  I would say that opportunities for education and life-long skills develop-ment are entirely decisive here. Even highly-educated professional groups, who have previously had a low level of unemployment, will need further development many times during their professional lives. Quite simply, we need to embrace a life-long learning to be able to meet and benefit from technological advances.  Taxation and income transfer systems are primary tools to change the gaps in society that follow on from digitalisation.  New technology also brings new actors and some of these have become very large. Markets characterised by high entrance barriers, synergies and network effects can easily be concentrated in the hands of a few domi-nant actors. The competition authorities in different countries must therefore have cross-border cooperation to monitor and when necessary regulate various markets and in this way safeguard the interests of the general public.  Effects of digitalisation – a conceptual framework for monetary policy So far I have focused on the potential effects of digitalisation and what problems they can entail. I have also taken up various areas where I think we need to meet and make use of the technological advances. But we also need to investigate what effects digitalisation has had on the Swedish economy and to ask ourselves what monetary policy should do. This is often a question that is not so easy to answer, as structural transformations and their effects can be difficult to identify, despite often affecting the economy over long periods of time.  For a general description of how digitalisation can affect inflation, one can use a model that we presented in our Monetary Policy Report in February 2015.17 It pro-vides a general view of the channels through which inflation can be influenced when a change such as digitalisation occurs.  Firstly, digitalisation affects companies’ output capacity via automation, which re-duces their cost pressures in total. Secondly, consumers can more easily find in-formation through price comparison sites or e-commerce platforms. This can in-crease competition and reduce the companies’ mark-ups when costs increase.18 Thirdly, the consumer price index (CPIF) is directly affected by lower costs for in-formation and communication technology.                                                             17 See Monetary Policy Report, February 2015. 18 Apel et al (2014). 
       8 [12]  Productivity and the labour market Let's begin with companies’ production capacity and the consequences for the la-bour market. In the manufacturing industry digitalisation appears to have to in-creased productivity, but this is not the case in the service industries. The devel-opment in employment appears to have been poorer in professions where digital-isation has been stronger. The labour market appears to have become more po-larized as a larger number are either employed in high salary or low salary profes-sions.19  Companies responding to our own Business Survey often confirm that digitalisa-tion leads to a competence shift in the labour force. They see a substantial need to recruit specialists with, for instance, digital competence and they have less need to recruit general staff.20  In consumer-related sectors companies believe to a greater extent that digitalisa-tion will lead to fewer employees within a few years, while the responses from manufacturing companies are more neutral. The explanation is often that the manufacturing industry has already made major changeovers and that digital technology is already a complement to large groups of employees. In the retail trade there are larger groups of cashiers, stocks workers and shop assistants who can be replaced by automated solutions. Consumer behaviour Digitalisation also affects us as consumers. The use of internet and online shop-ping have increased in Sweden and are at a high level compared with other Euro-pean countries. We now have access to more information than before and can compare prices of various products and various sellers very quickly.  Previously, if you wanted to buy a new pair of shoes you had to go into several shops to compare prices. First you needed to have an idea of where to find a spe-cific model of shoe, say a pair of Converse all-stars in size 39, and then you needed to travel round to find the best price. Now you can quite simply visit a price comparison site online and enter the name of the model and get price infor-mation, stocks status and suggested sales points that are online. This has reduced the search costs enormously.21  Companies’ pricing At the same time, e-commerce is changing the playing field for many trading com-panies and changing their pricing. Why should customers pay more for something in a shop when they can buy it cheaper online?                                                            19 Heyman et al (2016).  20 Sveriges Riksbank (2018c).  21 The Swedish Competition Authority commissioned researchers Niklas Rudholm and Charlie Lindgren to analyse how price transparency through price comparison sites affects prices and price spread between companies.  They used information from the comparison site Prisjakt to compare how prices of games differ between various online traders. They saw that the development of prices for a particular product was highly correlated among the largest companies. This indicates a reduction in price spread. 
       9 [12]  The studies comparing pricing in shops and pricing online for the same company point to the differences between the two sales channels being less than one might believe.22 Nevertheless, there are differences. Within e-commerce prices are changed more often, the cost increases are passed on to consumer prices faster and the margins tend to be somewhat lower23,24.  In Sweden, e-commerce now accounts for almost 9 per cent of all turnover in the retail trade, according to the Retail and Wholesale Research Institute (HUI). But there are substantial differences between different branches. In the music and film branch the majority of income is from online sales, while e-commerce is much less common in other branches.25 Despite increasing in significance, digital-ised goods have not affected CPIF inflation more than before.  When we talk to companies about how the use of digital technology will affect their future prices, there is a clear difference between consumer-related compa-nies and business to business companies. In the consumer-related companies, sales prices are expected to fall somewhat, while the others consider that the new technology will make it possible to raise prices as it will strengthen the companies’ positions on international markets.  Digitalisation and an inflation target So how shall we take digitalisation into consideration in our monetary policy and our forecasts? Well, to a great extent it is a question of qualitative assessments of what effects are reasonable. But that sounds simpler than it really is. As I said be-fore, structural changes can affect the economy over a long period of time. Even afterwards it is difficult to know how much a specific factor has affected the la-bour market or inflation, for instance.  We have seen in our own evaluations that lower price mark-ups as a result of, for instance, digitalisation, may have contributed to holding back inflation, particu-larly during the period 2014-2015. At the same time, the most important reason for the low inflation during this period appears to have been low domestic cost pressures.26 And as resource utilisation has increased, inflation has also risen to-wards the target. It is evidently possible to attain a quantified inflation target.   When I follow the debate on monetary policy in Sweden, the argument keeps cropping up that the two-per cent target for inflation will be impossible to attain as the economy becomes increasingly digitalised. However, one should also look at events in other developed countries with similar targets. Because of course Sweden is not alone in being affected by digitalisation. There does not seem to be any clear relationship in these other countries between for instance the spread of e-commerce and inflation.  However it is possible that the lack of simple correlations in data hides some causal relationship. Better indicators of the spread of digitalisation may give other                                                            22 Cavallo (2017). 23 Cavallo (2018). 24 Gorodnichenko and Talavera (2017). 25 Swedish Trade Federation (2018). 26 Sveriges Riksbank (2018b). 
       10 [12]  results. My point is therefore that it is up to the critics to present proof of why more digitalisation would necessarily mean that inflation was held below the tar-get for a long period of time. In the longer run inflation is determined by the mon-etary policy that is conducted on average and its effects on inflation expectations. A better explanation for the differences in inflation rates between countries around the world is therefore that they conduct different monetary policies. Having a credible benchmark for price setting and wage formation facilitates long-term planning for both individuals and companies. The inflation target is needed in particular when the world is changing rapidly as a result of major upheavals such as digitalisation. The alternative would be a less stable development and poorer opportunities for good economic growth.  Clear game rules for a smoothly-functioning economy Let me summarise my thoughts: My assessment is that digitalisation contributes to a new way of producing, pricing and demanding goods and services. By main-taining a stable rate of inflation close to our target, monetary policy helps this changeover. To do so, we need to understand the development of economic ac-tivity, as well as the effects of structural changes in the economy.  What we know is that labour markets change. They become more polarized, which makes it more important for people to update their skills to the new cir-cumstances. The game plan for companies is changing. E-commerce can for exam-ple mean that companies’ prices change more often and become more sensitive to shocks. Increased consumer power and greater competition slow down prices and thereby margins for the companies. The changes are necessary to increase our welfare, even if they create problems for some people in the short term. To manage these challenges, we should jointly strengthen the opportunities for education and skills development, even out some of the gaps arising during the upheavals and safeguard the interests of the general public by strengthening competition on the new markets.  In a changing world we need to have clear game rules to ensure the economy functions smoothly. Reliable price stability, in terms of purchasing power, is one such game rule. It makes it easier for individuals and companies to plan for the fu-ture, it improves price setting and wage formation and thus contributes to more stable economic activity. So, attaining our inflation target of two per cent will help to accomplish the changeover following on from digitalisation.

Shaktikanta Das: Opportunities and challenges of FinTechKeynote address by Mr Shaktikanta Das, Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, at FinTechConclave 2019, organized by NITI Aayog, New Delhi, 25 March 2019.*   *   *I am extremely happy to participate in NITI Aayog’s FinTech Conclave 2019 and share mythoughts on the technological revolution that is shaping the future of finance. I am particularlythankful to Shri Amitabh Kant, CEO of NITI Aayog for having invited me to such an augustgathering. As I understand, this Conclave is woven around the theme of Indian FinTechecosystem as well as steps required to help achieve the potential that the sector offers towardsgrowth, employment and inclusion. Given the wide canvas that FinTech encompasses, I haveorganised my thoughts on some of the core issues in this area.2. In general, FinTech stands for financial technology and describes technologically enabledfinancial innovations. From ‘start-ups’ to ‘big-techs’ to established financial institutions, all the keyplayers are harnessing this technological edge along the financial services’ value chain to provideagile, efficient and differentiated experiences to the end-user. This movement has the potential tofundamentally transform the financial-landscape where consumers will get to choose from alarger set of options at competitive prices and financial institutions could improve efficiencythrough lower operational costs. As a country that is determined to achieve universal financialinclusion at affordable costs, this is a defining moment for us, and we should seize theopportunity.FinTech Experience in India3. India has been at the forefront of this revolution. A recent global survey ranks India second interms of FinTech adoption, with an adoption rate of 52 per cent. It is reported that there are asmany as 1218 FinTech firms operating in India which have created a large number of jobs. Theyare also generating a healthy appetite for investment.4. The Reserve Bank has over the years encouraged greater use of electronic payments so asto achieve a “less-cash” society. The objective has been to provide a payment system thatcombines the attributes of safety, security, enhanced convenience and accessibility, leveragingtechnological solutions that enable faster processing. Affordability, interoperability, and customerawareness and protection have also been other focus areas. Banks have been the traditionalgateway to payment services. However, with the fast pace of technological changes, this domainis no longer the monopoly of banks. Non-bank entities are cooperating as well as competing withbanks, either as technology service providers to banks or by directly providing retail electronicpayment services. The regulatory framework has also encouraged this enhanced participation ofnon-bank entities in the payments domain.5. In recent years, a focussed effort has been made to develop a state of the art nationalpayments infrastructure and technology platforms, be it Immediate Payments Service (IMPS),Unified Payments Interface (UPI), Bharat Interface for Money (BHIM), Bharat Bill Pay System(BBPS), or Aadhaar-enabled Payment System (AePS). This has changed the retail paymentsscenario of the country. The total volume of retail electronic payments witnessed about nine-foldincrease over the last five years.6. Let me now mention some numbers with regard to digital modes of payment. The NEFTsystem handled 195 crore transactions valued at around Rs.172 lakh crore in 2017–18 growingby 4.9 times in terms of volume and 5.9 times in terms in terms of value over the previous fiveyears. Similarly, the number of transactions carried out through credit and debit cards in 2017–18was 141 crore and 334 crore, respectively. Prepaid payment instruments (PPIs) recorded a1 1 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
volume of about 346 crore transactions, valued at Rs.1.4 lakh crore. Thus, the total cardpayments, in volume terms, stood at 52 percent of the total retail payments during the year2017–18.7. Developments in the spheres of banking technology and trade finance have beencommendable as well. Alternative models of lending and capital raising are coming up and havethe potential to change the market dynamics of traditional lenders and the role of traditionalintermediaries. Crowd-funding, which entails raising external finance from a large group ofinvestors, is at a very nascent stage in India. The peer-to-peer (P2P) lending for which RBI hasissued Master Direction in October 2017 has the potential to improve access to finance for smalland medium enterprises. Eleven entities have been licensed to operate P2P platform. TheReserve Bank has also granted licenses and permitted seven purely digital loan companies(NBFCs) to commence operations. Although they are purely digital players operating throughmobile applications, we have ensured that they have at least one physical presence forcustomers to reach out to in case of need.8. Furthermore, seven payment banks have commenced operations. These technology-ledbanks use FinTech, both while onboarding customers as well as while carrying out operations.9. Invoice trading is another nascent area of FinTech application in India. It assists MSMEs whichoften have working capital and cash flow problems due to delayed payments. The Reserve Bankhas set up the Trade Receivables Discounting System (TReDs), which is an innovative financingarrangement where technology is leveraged for discounting bills and invoices. Three entitieshave been authorised for this purpose and the volumes are slowly gaining traction.10. Another initiative has been laying down a regulatory framework for Account Aggregators (AA).A total of five entities have been given in-principle approval as NBFC-AA and are expected tocommence their operations during 2019–20.11. To further deepen digital payments and enhance financial inclusion through FinTech, theReserve Bank of India (RBI) has also appointed a five member committee under thechairmanship of Shri Nandan Nilekani.12. While opening a new world of opportunities, the FinTech revolution has its own share of risksand challenges for the regulators and supervisors. Early recognition of these risks and initiatingaction to mitigate the related regulatory and supervisory challenges is key to harnessing the fullpotential of these developments. I would, therefore, like to give a bird’s eye view of theseopportunities, risks and challenges, especially in the Indian context as also the policy roadmapthat we have in mind.Opportunities, Risks and the Way ForwardLet me first highlight the opportunities in the area of digital onboarding and financial inclusion.Digital onboarding and financial inclusion13. There are two broad areas that merit attention in the Indian context: the first is regardingimproving the accessibility of financial platforms using FinTech; and the second is aboutanalysing potential risks that may arise out of FinTech adoption. Designing suitable financialproducts that cater to specific needs of the financially excluded population, digital onboarding andboosting the quantum of investments are vital in achieving the first objective. Effective utilisationof Aadhaar eco-system may provide incentives for the people to adopt digital platforms as it ishappening in the case of direct benefits transfer (DBT). The central KYC registry is a significantstep in this regard – about 100 million KYC records have already been uploaded onto thisplatform. We also need to ensure multi-lingual financial literacy and a robust grievance redressalmachinery to effectively handle inter-regional disparities and to offer online dispute resolutions. 2 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
RegTech and SupTech14. As regards potential risks and their mitigation, RegTech and SupTech have an importantrole. Regulators and supervisors have to undertake accelerated off-site surveillance. This alsobrings in the need for a transparent, technology and data-driven approach. To serve this need,new fields called RegTech and SupTech are coming up. Both the technologies aim at improvingefficiency through the use of automation, introducing new capabilities and streamliningworkflows. In the Reserve Bank, we have been using SupTech for data collection and analysis.The examples are Import Data Processing and Monitoring System (IDPMS), Export DataProcessing and Monitoring System (EDPMS) and Central Repository of Information on LargeCredits (CRILC), to name a few. Also, the risk-based supervision of banks is extensively data-driven and is an example of SupTech. The future of RegTech and SupTech technologies,however, lie in big data analytics, artificial intelligence, machine learning, cloud computing,geographic information system (GIS) mapping, data transfer protocols, biometrics, etc.15. A strong risk culture – in which risk detection, assessment and mitigation are part of the dailyjob of bank staff – will be central to the success of managing the emerging risks. Similarly,systemic risks may arise from unsustainable credit growth, increased inter-connectedness,procyclicality, development of new activities beyond the supervisory framework and financialrisks manifested by lower profitability. Risks for FinTech products may also arise from crossborder legal and regulatory issues. Data confidentiality and customer protection are major areasthat also need to be addressed.16. The Reserve Bank has encouraged banks to explore the possibility of establishing newalliances with FinTech firms as it could be pivotal in accelerating the agenda of financial inclusionthrough innovation. It is essential that flow of investments to this sector is unimpeded to realiseits full potential. It is imperative to create an ecosystem which promotes collaboration whilecarefully paying attention to the implications that it has for the macroeconomy.17. In order to ensure an orderly development of FinTech, to streamline their influence into thefinancial system, to protect the customers and to safeguard the interest of all the stakeholders,we need to have appropriate regulatory and supervisory frameworks. Such frameworks shouldaddress associated risks while keeping in mind the growth requirements of this sector. TheReserve Bank’s working group on FinTech and digital banking (Report of the working group onFinTech and digital banking, November 2017) suggested the introduction of a ‘regulatorysandbox/innovation hub’ within a well-defined space and duration to experiment with FinTechsolutions, where the consequences of failure can be contained and reasons for failure analysed.A ‘Regulatory Sandbox’ would benefit FinTech companies by way of reduced time to launchinnovative products at a lower cost. Going forward, the Reserve Bank will set up a regulatorysandbox, for which guidelines will be issued in the next two months.Conclusion18. In conclusion, I would like to say that FinTech has the potential to reshape the financialservices and financial inclusion landscape in India in fundamental ways. It can reduce costs andimprove access and quality of financial services. We have to strike a subtle balance betweeneffectively utilising FinTech while minimising its systemic impacts. By enabling technologies andmanaging risks, we can help create a new financial system which is more inclusive, cost-effective and resilient.Thank you.EY FinTech Adoption Index 2017, Available at www.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/ey-fintech-adoption-index-2017/$FILE/ey-fintech-adoption-index-2017.pdf2312 3 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
RegTech is an application or platform which makes regulatory compliance more efficient through automatedprocesses and lowers the costs of compliance. RegTech focuses on technologies that facilitate the delivery ofregulatory requirements more efficiently and effectively.SupTech is technology to be used by the regulators and supervisors to support supervision. The objectives ofSupTech are seamless and straight-through data collection / reporting, data analysis and decision making,streamlined licencing, market monitoring and surveillance, KYC / AML / CFT, cybersecurity data or evidencebased policy making.23 4 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
Carlos da Silva Costa: Portugal - reform and growth within the euroareaOpening speech by Mr Carlos da Silva Costa, Governor of the Bank of Portugal, at the Bank ofPortugal-International Monetary Fund conference "Portugal - Reform and Growth within the EuroArea", Lisbon, 25 March 2019.*   *   *As prepared for delivery.Good morning,It is with great pleasure that I welcome you to our joint conference with the International MonetaryFund on the paths for reform in Portugal, as a euro area member. Growth periods like the one we are currently in involve a greater propensity to take on excessiverisk and to postpone structural reforms. We also know regulation tends to be procyclical,meaning that it is loosened when it should be tightened and vice versa. This is why it is crucial inthe current environment to bear in mind the lessons from the last crisis and, above all, to preventthe resurgence of the factors that led up to it.With this in mind, I think now is an important time to speak about: 1. the process leading up to the crisis that hit the Portuguese economy, 2. the adjustment initiated with the financial assistance programme, and 3. the current challenges to sustainable growth.Before the assistance programmeThe process that led Portugal to the most recent assistance programme started in the mid-1990s, in a context of broad internal and external balance.Financial liberalisation and the prospect of joining the euro made financing cheaper and moreaccessible, bringing about a strong credit expansion and a fall in the household savings rate.Between 1995 and 2007, credit to the private sector, measured as a percentage of GDP, almosttripled from 52% to 131%. During the same period, the household savings rate almost halved,reaching 7% in 2007. The largest slice of credit was channelled to financing consumption andlow-return investments, largely in non-tradable sectors.Credit to the private sector grew much faster than GDPLoans to non-financial corporations and households, as percentage of GDP  1 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
Source: Banco de PortugalIn parallel, the rise of Asian competition in the low-technology sectors and the challenge posed bythe enlargement of the EU to Central and Eastern European Countries, which captured foreigndirect investment in the medium-technology sectors, brought difficulties to Portuguese exports.Such reshuffling of comparative advantages had a bearing on the performance of firms operatingin the tradable sector.As a result of these different shocks, Portugal lost export market share in international markets,imports grew and the current account deficit deteriorated, without a corresponding expansion ofthe economy’s growth potential. Between the mid-1990s and the eve of the global financial crisisin 2007, the Portuguese current and capital account went from near balance to a deficit of 8.6%of GDP, whereas gross external debt rose from approximately 60% to 195% of GDP. At thesame time, annual potential growth declined from around 3% to just below 1%.Domestic demand grew faster than potential output, contributing to external deficits 2 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
Source: Banco de Portugal and Statistics PortugalExternal indebtedness was to a large extent intermediated by the Portuguese banking system.Banks raised (mostly short-term) funds in the euro money market and converted them into (long-term) loans to the private sector, creating an important maturity mismatch in their balancesheets. The loan-to-deposit ratio for the whole banking system rose from 89% in 1998 to 156% in2007.A macroprudential policy and a countercyclical fiscal policy would have helped contain the risksassociated with the expansion of domestic demand. However, macroprudential policy wassimply not part of the standard toolbox and the mostly pro-cyclical fiscal policy that was followedaggravated the macroeconomic imbalances. In the period from 1995 to 2007, the budget deficitaveraged 4.3% of GDP, and was always above the Maastricht threshold of 3% of GDP. When the international financial crisis broke, the weak potential output growth and rising externalindebtedness fuelled investors’ doubts about the capacity of Portuguese economic agents to paytheir debts. Between 2009 and 2011, external financing to banks fell by around 30 percentagepoints of GDP. As a result, banks had to turn to the Eurosystem, whilst at the same time thevolume of Portuguese sovereign debt placed with domestic banks increased.In the first half of 2011, following twelve months in which interest rates on ten-year governmentdebt had almost doubled to just over 9%, mounting doubts among investors about thesustainability of the public finances and external debt lead to a shutdown of access tointernational funding markets. Recourse to external financial assistance became unavoidable,under a programme negotiated with the European Union and the International Monetary Fund.This was not the first time Portugal had to resort to official financial assistance. As many here inthe audience will remember well, we had already negotiated adjustment programmes with theIMF in 1977–1978 and 1983.The root cause of the accumulated imbalances was then essentially the same: excessivedomestic demand growth in relation to the productive capacity of the economy, leading toexternal debt accumulation.  3 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
However, given that we were not part of a monetary union and had full monetary autonomy in the1970s and 1980s, the symptoms of the crisis and the policy prescriptions produced at the timeshow some important differences when compared to the most recent crisis episode.In a context of monetary sovereignty, the imbalances translated into currency depreciation,international reserves depletion and high and rising inflation rates. With monetary policy fully available at national level, financial repression was the name of thegame. The policy prescription consisted of interest rate increases, credit growth targets, capitalcontrols and the devaluation of the escudo to contain domestic demand and restore exportcompetitiveness. As a result of the adjustment strategy, the real value of wages, pensions and savings declinedsharply and wealth was transferred from creditors to debtors. Money illusion blurred theperception of the adjustment costs and of the fundamentally unbalanced burden-sharing. Also,as nominal variables were targeted and competitiveness was restored in the short term,structural supply-side imbalances and long-term competitiveness failed to be properlyaddressed. As a consequence, the country’s competitiveness remained fragile and anchored inlow wages.In the first decade of the 2000s, being part of a monetary union facilitated a longer and largeraccumulation of imbalances. Nominal stability, low interest rates and ample credit availabilitycreated the illusion that credit constraints had disappeared and masked persistent losses ofcompetitiveness for more than a decade. The symptoms of the emerging crisis no longer included persistent exchange rate pressure,reserve depletion or high and rising inflation, but rather a sudden unwillingness on the part ofinternational investors to finance the Portuguese economy. Without the monetary instrument, money illusion was no longer there and the policy prescriptionhad to be different. As a result, the need for deleveraging and structural supply-side reformsbecame inescapable. The financial assistance programmeThe execution of the economic and financial assistance programme set out in 2011 broughtabout noteworthy progress:The budget deficit declined significantly, which created the conditions for the currentdownward trend of sovereign debt;the private sector initiated a deleveraging process; andthe banking sector became more robust, with stronger liquidity, higher solvency and, in themost recent period, improved asset quality.This success was based on three key factors:first, political ownership, socioeconomic awareness and social dialogue. Policymakerswere committed to the programme’s goals and showed deep knowledge of the virtuousresponse mechanisms to be activated in the critical sectors. On the other hand, the publicunderstood the urgency and even-handedness of the programme. The politicalcompromises achieved between policymakers and social partners were key to ensuring abroad and collective ownership of the programme, which in turn determined its effective andtimely execution. second, the positive, intense and fast response by the export sector, which grew byaround 45% in real terms between 2008 and 2017. This contributed to the correction of the 4 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
current account deficit, to put external debt on a downward trajectory, and to mitigate theimpact of lower domestic demand on the non-tradable sector. This positive response by thetradable sector was much stronger than expected and was not driven exclusively by foreignmarkets’ growth, given that there were important market share gains during this period.third, the maintenance of the general public’s confidence in the financial system, asevident in the consistent stability of aggregate deposits. This allowed the financing of theeconomic activity to proceed without major disruptions and prevented the resort to capitalcontrols. The fear and deposit drain observed in other economies that were subject toassistance programmes did not occur in the Portuguese case. This was not by accident,since there was an active and persistent effort by the authorities to preserve confidence inthe financial system throughout the implementation of the programme.After the assistance programmeThe macroeconomic adjustment initiated by the economic and financial assistance programmehas continued after the programme ended in 2014, with encouraging results. GDP has been growing at an average annual rate above 2%, reflecting the continued dynamismof the export sector and, more recently, the rebound of private investment. Fiscal consolidationproceeded, with the budget balance expected to be around –0.5% in 2018 and public debtentering a downward trend. The current and capital accounts were kept in surplus and the clean-up of banks’ balance sheets has intensified, with NPLs declining from over 50 billion euro in June2016 to about half this amount in end 2018.Despite the undisputed progress, there is no room for complacency. The history of the past 40years teaches us that the initial impact from an assistance programme will only be sustainable ifthere are structural changes that foster higher potential growth. Over the recent past, Portuguese per capita GDP has remained 30–40% below the EuropeanUnion average, without converging towards the richest economies. A lasting trajectory of growthand convergence towards our European partners depends on our ability:to promote efficient resource allocation, namely through sustained maximisation ofinvestment returns, and reallocation towards the tradable sector;to reach higher levels of productivity;to generate and maintain high levels of employment; andto ensure that the combination of capital and labour generates an output that is desired andvalued by the market.Public policy has a key role to play by upholding continued structural reforms that will, inter alia,help:  increase aggregate savings in the economy; strengthen firms’ capitalisation; provide, through capital markets, adequate instruments to finance innovation and exports; promote regulatory and tax predictability and, more generally, a business-friendly legalframework; the separation between firm ownership and firm management; red tape reduction; and a better functioning of the judicial system. Such reforms are, on the one hand, imperative for pursuing the correction of the macroeconomicimbalances that led Portugal to the past crises and, on the other hand, extremely hard to 5 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
implement after the conclusion of the assistance programme.Why do I say that structural reforms are extremely hard to implement in the current context? Letme highlight three critical challenges.1. First, in the current context of strong global competition, firms need to adapt permanently tothe fast-changing competition, requiring accordingly adaptable support services by the State.This means that we need a State that is lean and efficient, while being able to safeguardsocial cohesion at the same time.2. Second, transferring resources towards the tradable sector is crucial for avoiding a return toexternal imbalances, but may jeopardise social cohesion. Indeed, adapting to competition isalways challenging and there are losers in this process. These situations have to besupported by sustainable social safety nets.3. Finally, in the absence of a sense of emergency, of imminent financial market pressure andof money illusion, reform ownership by policymakers and social consensus become muchharder. The costs from each reform become clearer and must be carefully balanced byperceived offsetting benefits.The nature of these challenges transcends pure economic models, encompassing socialequilibria. Overcoming them requires, thus, social and political consensus, only attainablethrough an open, broad and informed debate.I am confident that this conference will contribute to such a debate and that by the end of the daywe will have gained many useful insights into what paths to take for effective reform and thestrategies to adopt in order to remove the obstacles in the way.Thank you very much for being here. 6 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
1 | Page    The Bahamian Payment System Modernisation: Advancing Financial Inclusion Initiatives  By John A Rolle* Governor  *As prepared for delivery.  Central Bank of The Bahamas Blockchain Seminar 18 March 2019  Introduction Inclusive of a digital version of the Bahamian dollar, the Central Bank of The Bahamas has defined several evolved objectives for the Bahamian payments systems.  On some levels The Bahamas is positioned to use new technology to accelerate this transformation.  It brings into focus the need for new policies and regulatory reforms to address best practices in the digital supply of financial services, consumer protection in its multifaceted forms, cyber security, and more.   There are multiple, complementary objectives within our digitisation and reform initiatives. These include:   Making the payments system more efficient.   Using technology to achieve more inclusive, cost affordable, even access to financial services, across all islands of The Bahamas; providing access that avoids discrimination on the basis of immigration or residency status.  Strengthening national defenses against uses of the financial services infrastructure for money laundering and other illicit ends; including activities that thrive more easily in cash intensive environments. Selected Payments System Indicators By international standards, The Bahamas has a very developed financial system.  However, the averages obscure gaps in who have access to services over our disperse geography, and the 
2 | Page  inefficiencies that constrain services delivery.12  Banking presence is sporadic on the Family Islands, and absent altogether in a few cases.3  At the national level, trends point to increasing use of electronic payments (see Box 1), but anecdotally the costs of settling transactions is a drag on the speed of change.4  Cost aside, accelerated change could be also encouraged through increased comfort around accepting and making digital payments; and placing these capabilities universally within the reach of more consumers.5 In 2018, the Central Bank conducted a baseline survey on financial literacy and garnered metrics that speak to financial inclusion, along the lines of templates used for the OECD countries (Table1).  Although this survey does not capture what is happening among undocumented persons, it indicates a high degree of awareness and high degree of access to basic deposit facilities in The Bahamas. Just above 90 percent of the respondents had knowledge of savings accounts and debit cards. Yet, only about 80 percent of such persons had use of a savings account.6  Only about 70 percent of these individuals used a debit card; and fewer than half possessed a credit card.  Improvements must be sought in all of these estimates, along with much higher rates of access and usage for personal investment products. Fintech Driven Financial Inclusion  The payment system modernisation initiative (PSMI) is to provide both the incentives and the means to spur more widespread adoption of electronic payments, and to enable greater general access to financial services over digital platforms.  Ultimately this means approaching 100% access to digital services; universal access to banking services of a deposit maintenance nature; and fully enabled electronic payments capabilities.  Reducing the size of legitimate but unrecorded economic activities will also be necessary, admitting particularly micro, small and medium-sized businesses into the digital space.                                                            1 In 2013 estimates, Svirydzenka (2016) ranked The Bahamas at 40th out of 183 countries in terms of overall financial development but at 15th in comparative access to financial institutions—which took account of the density of the physical banking infrastructure.  The relatively lower development index compared to access was due among other reasons to lower ranking on all other metrics including the efficiency of financial institutions (44th out of 183) access to financial markets (54th out of 183) and the efficiency of financial markets (in the lowest quartile). See: Katsiaryna Svirydzenka (2016), “Introducing A New Broad-based Index of Financial Development,” IMF Working Paper (WP/16/5). 2 On a per capita basis, for 2017 there are 26 bank branches for each 100,000 persons in The Bahamas, the 35th highest in the world (see IMF Financial Access survey for 2018 at http://data.imf.org/?sk=E5DCAB7E-A5CA-4892-A6EA-598B5463A34C), even though for efficiency reason this estimates is lower than the 35 to 40 branches per 100,000 persons averaged during 2007-2014.  There has also been growth in the number of ATM available, near 155 per 100,000 persons the 15th highest concentration in the world, according to the IMF’s (2018) data. 3 Berry Island, Mayguana, Acklyns, Crooked Island. 4 The Bahamian data reveal an increasing volume of transactions occurring outside of the physical branches at ATMs (which is still cash unfortunately), increasing use of credit and debit cards for electronic payments, and declining reliance on check writing. 5 Anecdotally, wire transfer costs have also slowed the transition from out of the use of checks for payroll processing for some firms.  Also, the merchant fee for accepting credit and debit card payments which can average between 2% and 5% of the transactions value, can act as a disincentive for firms that might cling exclusively to cash receipts. 6 See The Bahamas Financial Literacy Results 2018 (https://www.centralbankbahamas.com/news.php?id=16402&cmd=view). 
3 | Page  For what needs to be accomplished, how results are measured and how The Bahamas progresses in comparison to other countries, we will be guided by established international frameworks and standards; and we will take full advantage of technical assistance from the network of like-minded peers and supportive agencies.  In this regard the Central Bank’s 2018 membership in the global Alliance for Financial Inclusion (AFI), will yield returns in terms of how we build capacity to regulate and create more enabling frameworks to spur beneficial developments in the Fintech space.  Recent Bahamian Policy Reforms In The Bahamas, we have already made some progress on financial inclusion initiatives, but with much more to be accomplished.  Throughout recent regulatory reforms, the Central Bank was guided by the principle that access to payment services should not discriminate between whether the products originate from banks or from other regulated entities; and that the range of access that users of cash currently enjoy in services should also persist when the products are digitised.  Also, irrespective of whether consumers avail themselves of mobile payment services or traditional bank deposits, the ease of access and risk tailored customer due-diligence should be similar. One of the early outcomes was that the Central Bank was able to establish regulations to license non-banks to provide electronic money services to the public.  There are already two firms that have either provisionally or fully met the requirements for licensing.  In addition, several existing money transmission businesses are in the process of developing digital payment solutions. On ease of access, streamlined customer due diligence standards were introduced in 2018 under revised AML Guidelines7 which simplify the identification and address verification requirements to establish deposit accounts and to access other services from financial institutions.  It shifts more emphasis to the important transactions monitoring process after the accounts are established.  Further, it limits enhanced due diligence processes to relationships which banks assess to be higher risk. For very low-value stored products the identification process need not be invoked.8  In this regard, forthcoming clarification to be issued to banks will also suppress practices that mandate proof of employment as a pre-requisite to open an account.   Not all banks have converged to these new standards, but we are actively pursuing this transition.   The next easing, which the Central Bank undertook was to remove Exchange Control restrictions from non-resident access to Bahamian dollar (B$) deposit facilities.  Irrespective of their immigration or work permit status these persons can open and maintain B$ deposit accounts with balances of up to $50,000 without approval from the Central Bank.  As part of the Get Money Smart financial literacy program, and working with commercial banks we are formulating a new public education campaign focused on these changes.  The literacy campaign                                                            7 The guidelines (see: https://www.centralbankbahamas.com/legal_policies.php?cmd=view&id=16883 ), which apply to entities supervised by the Central Bank: banks, credit unions, MTBs and payment services providers. These have been issued under provision in the amended Financial Transactions Reporting Act 2018. 8 In the AML Guidance Notes these would be accounts that carry $500 or less and for which the monthly reload capacity is $300 or less. Monitoring of transactions for AML purposes, still applies for all accounts which financial institutions maintain.  Where higher risks are assessed supervised institutions may also  invoked processes that go beyond identification, such as verification of sources of income or wealth.

Near-Term Priorities   There are necessary further reforms that the Central Bank will target in the near-term.  Under the Payment System Act, the Bank will propose new regulations to strengthen consumer protection, along evolving best international standards.  These would apply to savings and checking accounts; debit and credit cards, and to stored value products, where the common thread is the actual or potential use of such facilities to effect payments.  The Central Bank will also promote direct participation of credit unions and non-bank payment services providers in the payments and settlement system.  This would apply to the retail clearing house (the ACH) and to the wholesale RTGS.9 The draft new Central Bank Bill provides that all of these entities would be allowed to maintain settlement accounts with the Central Bank to clear payments.  As the largest originators and recipients of payments, the Public Treasury and the National Insurance Board are being invited to become direct participants in the RTGS and ACH systems.  Mechanisms will also be explored to determine how international banks might participate directly in Bahamian dollar payments and settlements, to facilitate their own local needs or those of clients who maintain a nexus to the local economy.  Project Sand Dollar Highlights Through Project Sand Dollar, the Central Bank will develop and pilot a general purpose, digital version of the Bahamian dollar—that is, with both wholesale and retail applications. As the draft Central Bank Bill anticipates, the Bank would have statutory authority to issue currency in digital form and to develop regulations to govern the instrument.  The pilot would allow the Bank to enhance the digital system before it is deployed nationally.  To stay focused on the challenges that an archipelago poses, and to tackle gaps in access to services in remote communities, Exuma has been identified as the pilot community. The Bank will also explore how to enlist other selected islands that have suppressed or no banking presence.  The digital representation of the B$ will be identical to, and not a separate version of the currency. It will align with all of the statutory rules that govern existing liabilities of the Central Bank; always exchanged at one for one with existing notes, coins and balances. The design will also incorporate best international practices around AML and CFT risks.  Anonymity is not a feature.  This framework will rely intimately on the national identify infrastructure, when permitting users to hold and exchange digital money. A t the onset, it will use KYC and identity features incorporated into the system design, and adopt the wider public identity system as it becomes available.  A blockchain infrastructure has been proposed for the digital currency, with performance capabilities that would adequately satisfy the Central Bank’s requirements for swift processing of payments.                                                            9 This would not impose any change on the current ownership of the ACH, which is by the commercial banks. 
5 | Page  There will be an extensive public education process for all stakeholders potentially impacted by this transformation.  Also, from the outset, this project will engage with banks and other payment services providers, so that interoperability standards can be perfected.   Design Features of a Digital Currency There are important design features of a digital B$ that are intended to reflect the Central Bank’s role as a sponsor of financial sector development.  This is essentially a public good that is being provided. Geographic fragmentation cannot assure that the private sector, acting alone, would achieve the level of inclusion and access which all communities in The Bahamas deserve.10 This instrument is intended to complement and not replace existing banking services. Its use will be optimised when persons in remote communities are able to deploy it to establish and maintain deposit accounts and other services at banks. Those who use central bank sponsored digital wallets would not see their funds treated as interest bearing deposits.11 However, the Central Bank will explore future innovations that would allow mobile wallets holders to invest in Government securities.   While it would be possible to maintain mobile wallets independent of a bank account, the Central Bank intends to impose a ceiling on how much digital currency could be maintained in mobile wallets. High volume use will require a passthrough flow of funds to personal bank accounts. Business accounts would always fit this profile. The wallet’s integration with commercial banks or other licensed entities would be required in order for account holders to have access to foreign exchange services. The interoperability feature means that the digital B$ would be available for use across all payment platforms and within existing or proposed wallets of private services providers and financial institutions. Although the consumer public would have the default option of establishing a wallet account with the Central Bank, they would be enabled to use the currency within any product developed by regulated private wallet providers.  Over time, it is expected that the Central Bank would play a diminished role in providing front-end solutions and be left to focus on maintaining the digital ledger for the currency. At the policy level, the Central Bank is also putting emphasis on a system that would allow for effective maintenance of monetary and financial stability, safeguards to ensure aggregate stability in the deposit base of commercial banks; data privacy and data sovereignty for consumers and an aggressive cyber security posture.                                                            10  A Bank for International Settlements Publication (2018) by the Committee on Payments and Markets Infrastructures indicates that central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) are being widely explored around the world, but mostly for limited wholesale use in interbank markets.  (BIS (January 2019), “Proceeding with Caution - A Survey on Central Bank Digital Currency”, https://www.bis.org/publ/bppdf/bispap101.htm). In many cases this reflects the wide availability of private e-money solutions that leave little value-added for central banks to operate in this space. Presumably, other policy complexities, and technical and operating risks, also explored by the BIS, limit many central banks’ interest in maintaining retail accounts for users of digital currency. (see BIS, March 2018), “Central Bank Digital Currencies”, https://www.bis.org/cpmi/publ/d174.htm).  11 This preserves the level playing field that prevents payment services providers from paying interest on stored value products. It also avoids any expanded mandate for the Central Bank to intermediate savings at direct costs to the Bank or in competition with other financial institutions. 
6 | Page  Conclusion and the Way Forward The near-term actions for the Central Bank is to complete the contractual on-boarding of our technology solutions provider, and then to deepen the preparation and outreach process for the pilot. The government is a lead stakeholder and critical sponsor of national initiatives that will help transform the domestic financial services sector and the payments system. The Central Bank will stay actively engaged with the Government to ensure that the legal framework evolves in step with payments system needs; that The Bahamas achieves the financial inclusion outcomes that are desirable for our archipelago and to ensure that the commercial sector benefits from a more efficient and secure infrastructure.  The other key stakeholders, with whom engagement and outreach will intensify over the remainder of this year are the local financial institutions and public and private enterprises of all sizes.  There will be much more to reveal about project Sand Dollar.    
7 | Page  Appendix of Tables and Boxes.  Box 1: Profile of The Bahamian Payments System  The Bahamian payment system is continually evolving, showing shifts towards greater use of electronic transactions, and out of branch access to banking services.  Both consumers and business firms are using these electronic options in increasing numbers. In 2017, 56.8% of commercial banking branches were located in the capital, while the remaining 43.2% were in found in Grand Bahamas and the Family Islands.  This was still a shrunken access from as many as 88 branches in 2008 to 74 outlets at the end of 2017. As to access to ATM terminals, 71.5% were in New Providence, 13.8% in Grand Bahama and the remaining 14.6% were in the Family Islands.  Under electronic payments, between 2013 and 2017, payment card usage rose by 138% and 203.2%l respectively, with equally impressive growth in the number of merchant terminals able to process such payments. There has also been a significant increase in the use of online banking by both consumers and businesses.

9 | Page    Box 2: Using Global Standards and Peer Support to Guide Bahamian Guide Financial Inclusion Initiatives   In August 2018, the Central Bank joined the Global Alliance for Financial Inclusion (AFI), an international network of central banks and financial sector regulators across from more than 90 emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs).  The goal of AFI is to assist members to improve financial inclusion in an environment supported by peer feedback, technical assistance and training as needed.  In keeping with the high-level commitments of the AFI membership the Central Bank of The Bahamas has adopted the MAYA declaration12 that required the Bank to identify measurable goals to promote national financial inclusion.13   The Bahamas has identified seven broad goals, which include development of the digital version of the currency, advancing financial literacy, consumer education and empowerment, contributing to a national financial inclusion strategy (which takes a wider perspective than just banking services), and promoting the development of national digital identify infrastructure.  The Bank also has an obligation to improve compilation of data on financial inclusion.  AFI has recognised that Fintech innovations offer opportunities to accelerate financial inclusion progress.  In 2018, the Sochi Accord14 was adopted to heighten this focus. The Accord speaks, among other things, to building capacity to understand and promote Fintech developments, using Fintech solutions to help bridge gender divides in financial access, and ensuring that and official infrastructure is developed to support Fintech applications.  The case studies that emerge from AFI member countries particularly highlight the role of a digital ID infrastructure, and there is a recognition of the potential to develop electronic KYC on-boarding solution for banks.  Just on the heels of the Sochi  Accord, the IMF and the World Bank promoted the Bali Fintech Agenda listing high-level principles that align with the AFI approach, again stressing the supportive public framework of reform that could allow EMDEs take advantage of Fintech to promote inclusion and and other financial development results. The adoption of best practices is also urged to manage the multi-faceted risks of technology, and thwart the use of Fintech for illicit means.  A recurring thread in both the IMF and AFI’s work is for EMDEs to encourage and explore Fintech solutions that would solve or reduce the de-risking threats around threatened access to correspondent banking relationships.                                                             12 The Maya Declaration was endorsed by AFI in 2011 at the Global Policy Forum (GPF) in Riveria Maya, Mexico. It requires AFI members to make measurable commitments in four broad areas:  (i) create an enabling environment to harness new technology that increases access and lowers the cost of financial services; (ii) implement a proportional framework that advances synergies in financial inclusion, integrity, and stability; (iii) integrate consumer protection and empowerment as a key pillar of financial inclusion; and (iii) use data for informed policymaking and tracking results.

The Relevancy of good Corporate Governance  Presentation by Mrs. Leila Matroos-Lasten, Acting-President of the  Centrale Bank van Curaçao en Sint Maarten,  given to the Supervisory Board of the LAAD Americas N.V.  Willemstad - March 7, 2019   
Good morning ladies and gentlemen, First of all, allow me to thank you (the Board of LAAD Americas N.V.) for having invited me to introduce this morning the very important topic which is the Relevancy of Good Corporate Governance. As the Regulator of the financial sectors of the monetary union comprising the countries Curaçao and Sint Maarten, the Centrale Bank van Curacao and Sint Maarten (the Bank) is entrusted, amongst other, with the supervision of the banking and credit institutions. As such, its supervision is primarily geared towards the promotion of the stability, integrity, efficiency, safety, and soundness of the financial sectors of the countries in general and the safeguarding of the interest of stakeholders of the banking and other credit institutions in particular. The key for the success or failure of the entities supervised by the Bank is at the end of the day - Corporate Governance. Corporate Governance, according to the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and as adopted by the Bank, can be defined as a set of relationships between a company’s management, its board, its shareholders and other stakeholders which provides the structure through which the objectives of the company are set, and the means of attaining those objectives and monitoring performance. It helps define the way authorities and responsibilities are allocated and how corporate decisions are made. Thus, Corporate Governance is the driving force of every company, whether a bank or production company. Corporate Governance became even more important following the financial crisis which unfolded, after the collapse and scandals surrounding several renowned financial/ banking institutions and companies such as Lehman Brothers, Bear Sterns and Barings Bank in the period 2007/2008. As a result, the “Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development” (OECD) updated its widely accepted and long-established principles for good corporate governance to assist governments worldwide in their efforts to evaluate and improve their frameworks for corporate governance and to provide guidance for participants and regulators of financial markets. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, responsible for the international standards and guidelines on banking supervision, which has adopted the OECD principles of corporate governance, also updated its own set of Corporate Governance guiding principles for banks worldwide to assist Banks and Supervisors further. The Bank, having a keen interest in sound corporate governance has therefore adopted the internationally accepted Basel committee’s guiding principles of good corporate governance in its admission requirements for local and international banks and its Corporate Governance Guidance Notes for the Supervisory Boards of Supervised Financial Institutions by choosing for a two-tier board model consisting of a Managing Board and a Supervisory Board. This despite the fact that our General Law on 
companies permits a one-tier board. (which will be elaborated later upon by Mrs. Hammoud and Mrs. De Windt). According to the Bank, an institution's Supervisory Board is ultimately responsible for the conduct and affairs of the supervised institution. It is the Supervisory Board’s duty to oversee management affairs and to monitor the institution's direction and, hence, its adherence to its overall policy. By doing this, the Supervisory Board determines how the institution will conduct its business in the long term. In general, the Supervisory Board establishes or approves and monitors the policies by which Management will operate. The Supervisory Board should set the “tone at the top” and oversee management’s role in fostering and maintaining a sound corporate and risk culture. In favorable times the Supervisory Board contributes by setting the tone and direction, it oversees and supports Management’s efforts by testing and probing their recommendations before approving them. The Supervisory Board should also ensure that adequate systems and controls are in place to identify and address problems before they become a threat for the viability of the institution. In adverse times the Supervisory Board should be even more actively involved with the institution assisting it with the undertaking of the necessary corrective actions and, when needed, to keep the institution on track until effective management can be reestablished. The Supervisory board is considered therefore by the Bank as an extension of its supervision within the regulated entities because well-governed banks contribute to an efficient and cost-effective supervisory process which permits the Bank to place more reliance on the bank’s internal processes which may result in less need for supervisory intervention. In this respect we consider communication as key for an adequate supervision of the institutions supervised by the Bank. Therefore, we applaud the contribution of LAAD in its communication towards the Bank by having annual presentations of LAAD’s results, where a representative of the Managing Board is always present to explain the results and developments in the markets. The Bank furthermore welcomes periodic exchange of information between the Bank and the Supervisory Board of LAAD (for example on the strategy, risk assessments performed, Statement of compliance etc.) as this will assist the Bank further in its supervisory task. To keep up with worldwide Corporate Governance developments, the Bank is continuously enhancing its risk-based supervision framework. Its Corporate Governance Notes (which date back to 2001) are currently being updated to reflect the tasks and responsibilities of the Supervisory Board more clearly. With actualization of the National Ordinance on the Supervision of Banking and Credit Institutions at the end of 2015, the supervisory framework of the Bank was further strengthened allowing it to impose fines and penalties in case of non-compliance with our laws and regulations. With the institution of the Conduct Supervision department, more emphasis is being 
placed by the Bank on the supervision of the behavior of the institutions boards in the execution of their responsibilities. I hereby conclude my introductory remarks and pass the word now to Mrs. Mayesi Hammoud who will elaborate further on Corporate Governance aspects as established by the Corporate Law of Curaçao. I wish you further a pleasant stay on our island and hope that the discussions of this morning will be very fruitful. 
1  TALKING POINTS FOR THE PRESENTATION ON SECTION 33C OF THE BANKING ACT National Assembly Departmental Committee on Finance and National Planning  Dr. Patrick Njoroge, Governor, Central Bank of Kenya February 26, 2019  Hon. Members, I am delighted to appear today before this Departmental Committee on Finance and National Planning. I am grateful to you for the flexibility you allowed in arranging this meeting. At the outset. I want to make three points.  First, I acknowledge the letters I received in the recent past requesting me to appear before this Committee.  I want to state our desire to meet with you, only that the scheduling did not allow this to happen sooner as I indicated in my replies.  In replying to the letter of February 5, 2018, I indicated our desire to appear before the committee as soon as we could, and I also answered some of the questions. Hon. Members, I am prepared to address the remaining concerns.  Kulingana na methali “Mgeni njoo, mwenyeji apone”.  Second, I want to assure Hon. Members that the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) serves the public interest.  Everything we do is according to its mandate, ultimately for the prosperity of all Kenyans. On the specific questions, we are responding to the current challenges which are not only national but global—terrorism, money laundering, and corruption—and whose consequences are dire.  Third, we serve always and everywhere in accordance with the Constitution and all applicable laws. Nevertheless, a collaborative effort with all bodies is called for. In particular, we appreciate the National Assembly’s role and welcome its support.  If you will allow me, Hon. Members, I will now explain the recent Amendment to the Banking Act, (Section 33C) how CBK has acted to implement it, the difficulties in implementing this Amendment, and what is at stake. I will also explain the background to CBK’s circular on large cash transactions. You will see that, as never before, we are looking over the edge of an abyss. The economy has taken many blows over the years and proved resilient. This one though would be self-inflicted.  *** On October 1, 2018, following the coming into force of Section 65 of the Finance Act (2018) the Banking Act was amended to include a new Section 33C.  In one stroke, Kenya was on the brink of rolling back key instruments in the fight against corruption, money laundering, and financing of terrorism, bringing to nought the hard-fought gains.  The amendment refers directly to cash transactions but has far-reaching implications. 
2    Has CBK acted to implement the Amendment? Yes, CBK first saw the amendment after it had become effective, but embarked on understanding and implementing it.  To be clear, CBK had not been made aware or otherwise consulted in formulating the amendments, so we had no lead time.   
3   The initial objective was to gather in one place all regulations concerning cash deposits and withdrawals.  Significant difficulties emerged right away, one of which is that the stipulated timelines were impossible – the existing regulations just could not be brought together, reviewed by the public, reviewed by the Attorney General, then brought to Parliament and then made effective all within 30 days.  In fact, theoretically it takes a minimum of 90 days but in practice recent legislations have taken 11/2 years and more.  In the circumstances we sought guidance from the Attorney General.  There have been further developments that I will come back to later in my presentation.  Why is it impossible to implement the Amendment?  What difficulties arise?     The Amendment requires bringing together a variety of requirements in the Banking Act and other laws on deposits and withdrawals.  Requirements set by banks for their customers, their terms and conditions, would also need to be wrapped in (including ATM limits, hours for accessing the bank).  POCAMLA also has requirements on cash transactions, and these will conflict with the Amendment.  Similarly by treaty, Kenya is subject to the resolutions of the UN Security Council, including on aspects of cash transactions.  The amendment would conflict with that. 
4   The Amendment does not ensure the safety and soundness of bank transactions. In addition, it does not allow the needed flexibility even in cases of “clear and present” danger.  Can I describe Kenya’s AML/CFT framework? Yes, I will, but we must first acknowledge that Kenya remains vulnerable to risks from money laundering and the financing of terrorism, by virtue of its location, advanced financial sector, cash-based economy, and instances of the underlying crimes. To set the stage, I will first describe the tenets of an effective AML/CFT framework.      The framework is intended to protect the financial sector from abuse.  An effective framework strengthens the sector’s integrity, and that illicit funds do not flow through the financial sector.  The tenets of effective AML/CFT include: KYC/customer due diligence measures; monitoring of transactions; report of large cash transactions; record keeping; and criminalizing money laundering and terrorism.  Kenya has sought to apply this according to international best practices.  As mentioned, Kenya’s AML/CFT framework is aligned to international best parctices and it is embedded in several complementary elements.  
5    Cash monitoring is essential, as criminals performing illicit activities prefer using cash.      
6   Majority of suspicious transactions are triggered by unusually large cash transactions.  CBK Circular No 1 of 2016 reminded banks of the requirements under POCAMLA on large cash transactions e.g. to determine the legitimacy of funds.  The Circular was informed by:  Findings from target inspections had revealed that corruption proceeds had been transacted through large cash transactions.  Failure by institutions to obtain information to determine legitimacy of customer transactions.  Comply with international best practice on large cash transactions.  Comparative studies on how other jurisdictions treat large cash transaction.  What is the impact of Circular No.1 of 2016? The circular is part of measures to enhance the effectiveness of monitoring cash transactions.  As explained, monitoring each cash transaction is an essential pillar of an effective AML/CFT framework.  What fraction of our population are affected by this requirement? First, only 0.68 percent of all bank accounts in Kenya have a balance of more than 1 million, and therefore only they are capable of transacting above that threshold. Secondly, most customers can immediately answer the necessary questions. Nevertheless, innovations by banks can simplify the process further.  What would happen if we removed this pillar?  Would it not lead to all the money in mattresses and in foreign safe havens coming back to our banking system? “Governor, hakuna pesa mashinani”. This is a false hope. What is certain is the AML/CFT framework would collapse. The consequences would be severe and immediate. 
7    The consequences would also be felt in every corner of our country, by every citizen.     
8   The Dusit Hotel attack: Certain cash transactions in December 2018 allowed the terrorists to finance their operations. As a consequence, 21 innocent lives were lost on January 15. Every Kenyan, was affected.  If we could only turn back time…   External transactions would be inhibited: You will not be able to send or receive money from outside Kenya, except under very stringent conditions; You will no longer be able to use your credit card for international transactions, including when you travel; International payments, including school and university fees for children, as well as medical fees, will become near-impossible.   Impact on the economy would be severe: The Goldenberg scandal is a cautionary tale. Despite the pronounced good intentions of the architects, the Goldenberg scandal devastated the economy to the weakest it has ever been. As much as 25 percent of GDP was looted, GDP growth fell to its lowest in Kenya’s history, inflation surged to an all-time record of 61.5 percent in January 1994, Treasury bill rates rose to a record 85 percent in July 1993, and the exchange rate depreciated by 142.6 percent between December 1991 and December 1993. Further, the banking sector weakened significantly and several banks collapsed.  The poor and vulnerable persons were hit hard, as the price of essential commodities rose significantly. Allowing illicit funds to move back freely will have comparable effects.     
9  Hon. Members, I am about to finish. As I mentioned earlier, these matters have been brought before the courts for determination. A Petition was filed on November 30, 2018 (High Court of Kenya at Nairobi Constitutional Petition No. 426 of 2018) challenging Section 65 of the Finance Act 2018 that introduced Section 33(C) of the Banking Act. The Attorney General is the first respondent and the National Assembly is the second respondent, while the Central Bank of Kenya is the first interested party. The High Court under its special Constitutional jurisdiction under Article 165(2)(d) will determine the matter and give an interpretation. The various parties have filed their submissions and the matter is scheduled for hearing on March 29, 2019.  We await a determination by the court.    I thank you for your attention.   
1  Honourable Minister Shala, Honourable Chairman of the CBK Board, Mr Mrasori, Honourable Deputy Governor, Representatives of Financial Institutions,  Honourable participants, ladies and gentlemen,  I am pleased that today we are all together marking the World Consumer Rights Day, which is now transformed into an annual activity for the Central Bank of the Republic of Kosovo. The special feature of today's organization is that this is happening within the activities of marking the 20th anniversary of the establishment of CBK, so we are in a good moment to reflect on the development of Kosovo's financial system over these 20 years and our orientation for the development of this sector in the future. Kosovo started developing the financial system in 1999, at a time when everything had to be developed from the outset. The first years of CBK's operation were mainly related to the construction of the basic infrastructure necessary for the functioning of the financial system, starting from the regulatory and supervisory framework, the payment system and so on. Over time, together with the highly valued support from our international partners, CBK managed to advance its capacities at the same level with the central banks of countries with a longer tradition of the financial system. CBK went through different development stages, and so did the financial institutions operating in Kosovo. The first years of their operation were quite challenging, because they operated in an environment of high uncertainty and significant lack of information. Nevertheless, the improvements made in the 
2  financial infrastructure and in the overall business environment in Kosovo, together with the growth of maturity of financial institutions and CBK during these 20 years, have resulted in a modern and sound financial system that is successfully implementing its role of financial intermediation in support of the sustainable development of the country's economy. Nowadays, our financial system is generally characterized by steady growth of activity and a very satisfactory level of financial health indicators. Whereas, in the first years of operation of the financial system, the focus was on creating the conditions for providing basic financial services for the country's economy, now we have reached a level where more attention is given to the quality of these services, where undoubtedly, activities aiming consumer protection of financial services occupy a very important place. For us, consumer protection activities represent a daily task that we exercise with the utmost seriousness, and this day will be used as an opportunity to make a general reflection on these activities. Consumer protection is not a single action, but an entire process that promotes responsible behaviour of financial institutions by incorporating various aspects that, besides protecting the respect of contractual customer rights, also help customers in selecting adequate financial products and contribute to maintaining the solvency of customers.  Therefore, given the importance and complexity of consumer protection, CBK has organized consumer protection activities in two main pillars, consisting of consumer complaints and financial education. By reviewing complaints, CBK intends to ensure the implementation of all contractual rights and obligations between financial institutions and customers, in 
3  cases where customers consider that such a thing has never happened. In recent years, the number of financial institutions’ customers lodging a complaint to CBK regarding the implementation of their contractual rights has increased. We consider that the increase of the number of complaints directly reflects the higher awareness of customers about the right and the possibility of complaining, which is contributing to the better protection of their rights, but it is also contributing to the rectifying and advancement of internal processes in financial institutions in providing and further developing financial services as well as avoiding various errors. Consumer complaints represent a very important source of information for CBK, which often takes them into account during the supervisory activities of financial institutions. In addition to activities to address possible violations by financial institutions in relation to consumer rights, CBK is working intensively on financial education of the public, which aims to increase the level of public knowledge about financial products and their rights in relation to the financial institution. Also, in addition to its activities in promoting financial education, CBK continuously encourages financial institutions to increase their activity in support of increasing public knowledge about financial products, as well-informed customers take reasonable action and contribute directly to further development and maintenance of financial stability. CBK also gives its contribution to consumer protection as a member of the Consumer Protection Council, an inter-institutional body that aims to provide a harmonized and comprehensive approach to ensure consumer rights protection in Kosovo. The establishment and functionalization of this council indicates the orientation of the institutions of the Republic of Kosovo, which have put consumer protection at the top of their priorities. 
4  At the conclusion of my speech, I would like to emphasize our commitment in ensuring a financial system to the country's economy, which contributes in the best way possible to the economic development of the country and, at the same time, conducts the financial intermediation activity while respecting all legal and regulatory provisions.

2 Macroprudential Policy: Past, Present and Future Kia ora tatou, it is great to be here with you today to talk about the important role of macroprudential policy in the management of financial stability.1  It is six years now since macroprudential policy was established in New Zealand via a policy memorandum with the government in May 2013, and loan-to-value ratio (LVR) restrictions were first implemented in October 2013.2 At its introduction, we committed to reviewing the policy’s efficacy after five years; most of my talk today is drawing on that recently completed review and the lessons we drew for how we use macroprudential policy in the future.3   Macroprudential policy in some ways is new wine in old vessels. Direct restrictions on the borrowing capacity of households, such as the LVR instrument, are novel for New Zealand’s recent history. More than 30 years ago the removal of a wide range of restrictions on borrowing, including interest rate controls and government directives on bank lending to various industries, led to significant improvements in the efficiency of the financial system.   We don’t want to undo the fruits of these reforms, so why did we bring lending restrictions back?  International experience and research has demonstrated that good regulations – including macroprudential policy such as targeted borrower restrictions – are beneficial for promoting financial stability. And financial stability is very worthwhile, because wellbeing is seriously harmed by financial crises. With evidence from over 140 banking crisis around the world over the past fifty years to draw on, we can clearly see the immense impact those countries experience in terms of lost economic growth, increased public debt and unemployment rates. Furthermore, these adverse economic impacts tend to be more severe for the most vulnerable in society, which ultimately translates into a deterioration in social cohesion and the quality of life. While in New Zealand the lack of recent severe downturns could cloud our sense of risks, the international evidence demonstrates their profound economic impacts and serves as a lesson for us too. My speech from earlier this week outlined the Reserve Bank’s overall prudential framework for safeguarding financial stability.4 Macroprudential policy is one key part of this prudential framework. We want to use macroprudential tools when risks are particularly high, to build resilience among banks and households, and to mitigate the economic cost of a future crisis.5 My talk will cover three broad issues. Firstly, how does macroprudential policy mitigate risks to the financial system? Secondly, looking back, has the Reserve Bank’s macroprudential policy enhanced 1 I am very grateful to Bruce Lu for considerable assistance in the preparation of this speech, along with valuable comments from other Reserve Bank colleagues. 2 The loan-to-value ratio is a measure of the size of the loan relative to the value of the borrower’s collateral held against the loan, usually expressed as a percentage. 3 Lu (2019) assesses the effectiveness of loan-to-value restrictions in enhancing financial stability, and looks for any side effects. Ovenden (2019) discusses the Reserve Bank’s strategy for operating macroprudential policy. 4 Bascand (2019). 5 Macroprudential policy in the New Zealand context refers to policies with a time-varying dimension, although internationally the term is broadly used to refer to prudential policies that are focused on the financial system.  
3 Reduced lendingAsset prices go downDefaults go upBanks need more capitalBank funding costs go upfinancial stability, and were there any side effects? Lastly, I want to discuss how macroprudential policy should be governed, and the Reserve Bank’s approach to using the tools. Part 1 – The role of macroprudential policy To start with, let’s take a look at how systemic risks are created from the boom and bust in the financial cycle, and how macroprudential policy can increase resilience of banks and households when those risks are high.  When the economy is doing well, banks face competitive pressure to relax their lending standards. When homeowners experience house price inflation, their access to credit will generally increase. As a result, lending to less credit-worthy borrows can increase to an extent that is harmful to society (figure 1), without individual lenders bearing the full cost of higher debt levels.  It’s no surprise that those dynamics can apply in reverse when the economy weakens: as household incomes fall, the ability of borrowers to service debt is undermined, and defaults increase. This produces losses in the banking system and can trigger a fire-sale of housing, which compounds the downturn in house prices. In this situation, the banks respond by become significantly less willing to lend, making the downturn in the economy more severe and the recovery slower than it need be. Figure 1: Boom-bust financial cycles Based on a large sample of downturns across many countries, we understand that the occurrence of a house price bubble and strong credit growth in the upswing of a financial cycle tend to be followed by deeper recessions, in terms of lost GDP per capita and increased unemployment (figure 2).6 6 Jorda at al. (2013), Bridges et al. (2017), and Aikman et al. (2018). For an overview of financial stability risks from housing market cycles, see Thornley (2016). Figure 2 shows that a recession tends to be more severe, in terms of lost GDP per capita, if it is immediately preceded by an asset price bubble, and be even more severe if preceded by both an asset price bubble and strong credit growth.

4 Figure 2: The role of asset bubbles and credit in the severity of recessions (1870-2013)     Source: Jorda et al (2015)Our prudential framework for safeguarding financial stability is more than just our macroprudential policy (Table 1).7 Our framework includes a minimum level of capital and liquid assets that banks must hold, to ensure they remain solvent and can retain market confidence during periods of severe stress. We call these our baseline prudential buffers. In cases of bank distress or failure, there are procedures in place to carefully manage the situation and limit the impact. We use macroprudential policy to build an additional layer of protection if risks are particularly high at a point in time.  It’s important to remember that macroprudential tools are complementary to a strong set of baseline prudential buffers, and will be ineffective at promoting lending during hard times if banks are unable to remain solvent or retain market confidence. And prompt use of macroprudential tools reduces the likelihood that prudential buffers are drawn on.  The Reserve Bank’s LVR policy, that’s our loan-to-value ratio policy, is the most well-known tool of macroprudential policy and upholds lending standards during the credit upturn, thereby lowering the debt burden of households ahead of a downturn. In the macroprudential toolkit8, we also have capital and liquidity tools that build additional buffers for banks, putting them in a better position to keep lending to the economy when things turn sour.  While the liquidity tool – minimum core funding requirements – is in place, we haven’t adjusted it so far to limit risks to financial stability. So in practice our active use of macroprudential policy pertains only to LVRs. In addition to its financial stability role, the Reserve Bank also has responsibility for price stability. Macroprudential policy and monetary policy are set for different objectives, but they do interact. For example, the official cash rate (OCR) may be raised in response to an upturn in the economic cycle, which generally helps with the macroprudential objective by moderating credit and house price growth. However, the impact of macroprudential policy on inflation is much smaller than the OCR, and the policy is not a lever for achieving inflation or employment goals. In general, macroprudential policy and monetary policy tend to be complementary, and together will maximise both financial stability and price stability. 7 Bascand (2019) explains in more detail how our regulatory tools fit together and complement one another. 8 A memorandum of understanding between the Reserve Bank and the Minister of Finance lists four macroprudential instruments. These are the core funding ratio, the countercyclical capital buffer, the sectoral capital requirements, and the LVR restrictions (English and Wheeler, 2013). -6-4-20246810-6-4-20246810012345RecessionBubble, low creditBubble, high creditYearsfrom crisisPercentage change in real GDP per capita

6 As with all interventions, the financial stability benefits of macroprudential tools need to be weighed against their potential cost to efficiency. As such, it’s vital to review such tools, and publish the results to increase accountability and transparency, and to build lasting legitimacy in the eyes of the public.  Part 2 – Have the LVR restrictions enhanced financial stability? New Zealand was among the leaders in macroprudential policy when the LVR restrictions were first introduced, and since 2013, borrower-based tools have gained greater acceptance internationally, including in the UK, Ireland and Canada. While a few Southeast Asian countries have used the LVR tool since the 1990s, it was the global financial crisis - referred to as the GFC - that made the world more conscious of financial stability risks, leading to a greater acceptance of mortgage lending restrictions. And that takes me to our review of the LVR policy and its effectiveness by looking at the implications for financial stability, financial system efficiency and other public policy objectives.9   Our analysis showed that as a result of introducing the LVR policy, resilience of the banking system has increased. And while it’s more difficult to pinpoint, we also found that the policy has had a significant benefit in mitigating the risk to the economy from financial cycles. As you might expect, the restrictions have lowered the LVRs of mortgage borrowers. The share of the stock of mortgages with a LVR of above 80 percent has declined from 20 percent in 2013 to an average of 7.5 percent in the past two and a half years (figure 3). This fall has reduced the proportion of loans that would be in negative equity given a house price decline, meaning that the credit losses on banks’ mortgage portfolio would be lower in a stress event. Figure 3: Share of the mortgage stock with LVR above 80, by value Sources: RBNZ LVR Lending Positions Survey Not only that, the policy has lowered the magnitude of a potential house price correction, which further mitigates potential credit losses. It has achieved this by reducing the number of distressed borrowers who would be forced to sell their homes and by lowering house price inflation during the housing market upswing, thereby bringing house prices more in line with economic fundamentals.  9 Lu, 2019. 05101520253005101520253020102012201420162018%%80 < LVR ≤ 9090 < LVRIntroduction of restrictions on high-LVRlending
7  We estimate that, had we not imposed the LVR restrictions, mortgage losses in a severe economic downturn involving a fall in house prices would absorb nearly all the capital banks hold against their housing loans (figure 4). Under the current environment, mortgage losses in a severe downturn are estimated to be lower, showing that the LVR policy has improved the resilience of the banking system. Figure 4: Modelled credit losses as a share of housing capital requirement   Source: Lu and Bloor (2019). Improving the resilience of banks is only one objective of the LVR policy – the other goal is to reduce the potential for the financial cycle to impair economic performance.  International evidence show that economies with high household debts relative to disposable incomes have suffered larger declines in consumption during the GFC than less indebted economies.10 The other major factor driving the collapse in consumption in many economies is the large fall in house prices. These dynamics have worsened the impact of the GFC. A more severe economic downturn will weigh on wellbeing, but will also lead to a deterioration in banks’ non-mortgage assets. For example, in Ireland private consumption fell sharply over the GFC with retail sales declining by almost 20 percent annually by 2009, which led to widespread defaults on business loans. By 2013, more than 40 percent of SME loans in Ireland were in default. Our modelling suggests that the LVR policy has slowed the growth in household debt in New Zealand. A lower level of household debt and more durable house prices should insulate domestic demand, and the wider economy, against financial instability. Side effects of LVR intervention Up to now, I’ve talked about the benefits of the LVR policy, but we need to acknowledge that all regulations have the potential for unintended impacts in the process of achieving their objectives. The LVR restrictions have the potential to undermine financial system efficiency by restricting lending to some borrowers who are able to comfortably service the loan, but who have insufficient housing equity to meet the LVR requirements. This is why the Reserve Bank allows a speed limit of high-LVR loans under the policy, which are available to borrowers at the discretion of their bank.                                                            10 Floden, 2014 and Cecchetti et al., 2011. 01020304050607080901000102030405060708090100CurrentCounterfactual%%
8  The LVR policy can also work against the social objective of housing affordability. To be clear, the Reserve Bank does not have housing affordability as an objective, but it is sensible to be aware of the impact of our actions on the other goals of the government. A uniform calibration for the LVR restrictions, as was the case in late 2013 and 2014, is likely to restrict the access to credit for first home buyers, who tend to have less savings for a deposit and have not benefitted from previous house price appreciation. These controls that restrained first home buyers were necessary to protect the financial system, and to stop buyers from taking on too much debt and becoming distressed. In contrast, the effect on investors from a uniform LVR policy tends to be weaker in a rising market. We’ve recalibrated the LVR restrictions over time to target the riskier forms of investor lending, as the emerging evidence points to greater risks associated with highly leveraged investors. This also had the effect of rebalancing the burden of policy away from first home buyers. The share of new mortgages going to first home buyers has risen from 10 percent in 2014 to 17 percent by the end of 2018, a historically healthy level. In the recent years, first home buyers have accounted for the lion’s share of the high-LVR lending permitted under the policy (figure 5).  Housing affordability remains an important challenge for public policy, and structural reforms are necessary to improve affordability in the long term. The LVR restrictions are for the purpose of enhancing financial stability, and aren’t suitable for addressing broader social challenges. Figure 5: First home buyer high-LVR lending  Exemptions can be used to mitigate the tension between the LVR and other public policies, so long as they do not undermine the financial stability objective. For example, the exemption on construction finance has helped to address concerns that the LVR policy is hindering new housing supply. The Reserve Bank’s consultation with stakeholders in all macroprudential policy interventions helps to inform the design of policy, including the exemptions. Between November 2015 and September 2016, the Reserve Bank implemented targeted LVR restrictions for Auckland borrowers, owing to high risks of a severe house price decline in Auckland that would heavily affect the financial system. This move was effective in moderating the risk in Auckland. However, market intelligence suggested that Auckland investors increasingly purchased in other regions, which contributed to housing market exuberance in the rest of New Zealand. With high risk lending continuing to rise elsewhere, this tells us that a regional policy may be ineffective at reducing vulnerabilities at the national level. The likely spill-over effects would need to be considered carefully before using a regional policy in the future.  010203040506070800102030405060708020142015201620172018%%Share of all first home buyer lendingShare of all high-LVR lending
9  Figure 6: Annual house price inflation in urban areas  Source: Real Estate Institute of New Zealand  An underlying concern we had with the LVR policy is that risky lending could shift from banks to non-bank lenders who are not constrained by the policy. While there has been some growth in mortgage lending by non-bank lenders since 2014, their funding of purchases in the housing market remains very low. Non-bank deposit takers account for less than one percent of total mortgages with an LVR of more than 80 percent (figure 7). This evidence suggests that the LVR restrictions policy has remained effective for a longer period than we had initially thought. Figure 7: NBDT mortgage stock by LVR, and NBDT share of total high-LVR mortgages  Part 3 – Strategy for macroprudential policy The experience we have had in operating macroprudential policy is invaluable for developing an effective policy strategy. I want to touch on the principles of good governance, before discussing our operational strategy, and the outlook for macroprudential policy.  Principles of good governance In this context, governance relates to the process for making macroprudential decisions, and mechanisms for holding decision-makers to account for those decisions. The Phase 2 Review of the Reserve Bank Act is considering the suitable governance framework for macroprudential policy. 05101520253035InvercargillDunedinQueenstownChristchurchNelsonWellingtonPalmerston NorthNapierTaurangaHamiltonAucklandWhangarei%Aug-15Dec-1600.20.40.60.811.21.41.602004006008001,0001,200Jul-14Nov-14Mar-15Jul-15Nov-15Mar-16Jul-16Nov-16Mar-17Jul-17Nov-17Mar-18Jul-18Nov-18Mar-19%$m<70 LVR70-80 LVR80-90 LVR90+ LVROtherNBDT share of total LVR>80 loans
10  The operational independence of the Reserve Bank is a guiding principle of the Phase 2 review, and we strongly agree that this is important for a functioning governance framework. The cost of a macroprudential intervention, in terms of reduced credit availability, are highly visible, while the longer-term financial stability benefit is hard to measure. Clearly, deploying macroprudential policy when it is needed does not make you popular, and therefore elected politicians may have difficulty committing to what is required for a long-term financial stability objective. Internationally, macroprudential tools are used far less actively in jurisdictions where the government is heavily involved in decision-making.11  We think that operational independence is key for all macroprudential instruments. The Phase 2 review raised the option of political oversight for borrower-based tools, like the LVR restrictions. The rationale is that, because these tools incur a direct distributional cost on affected households, elected politicians are needed to maintain legitimacy. However, in the Reserve Bank’s view, the controversial nature of these tools strengthens the case for operational independence, to ensure that the tool can be used promptly when necessary. That said, the accountability and transparency of decision-makers plays a particularly important role in macroprudential policy, because financial stability is inherently difficult to quantify as an objective. The Reserve Bank has been transparent in explaining its policy decisions in consultations and the Financial Stability Reports, although transparency was more limited prior to policy action. To fill this gap, the Reserve Bank has recently published a macroprudential framework document that explains our strategy for using the tools. The government has recently announced an in-principle decision to change the governance framework for prudential policy. We agree that the governance framework can be improved by moving from the single decision-maker model, where all powers related to prudential policy rest with the Governor, to a governance board. A governance board allows for more rigorous testing of decisions from a diverse range of perspectives, provides for more external input, and can insure against extreme preferences by individuals - the board model is also widely understood and used. We can see the Reserve Bank Board taking responsibility for the macroprudential framework and scrutinising the operation of macroprudential policy by the Governor and his staff for which the Board will ultimately be responsible. As I have acknowledged earlier, macroprudential policy can produce tension with other objectives of public policy. This reinforces the importance of consultation with the government, in line with our current practice, although there needs to be a clear boundary between consultation and decision-making. The Phase 2 review raised the option of assigning a formal advisory role to an interagency committee, which could be well placed to consider the potential tension between macroprudential policy and other government policies. However, in our view, an interagency committee runs the risk of undermining accountability, and its added value may be limited given that the Reserve Bank already consults extensively on macroprudential decisions. The Phase 2 review of the Reserve Bank Act will have a significant bearing on the future of New Zealand’s financial system, and it’s important that you have a say - I encourage you to take a look at the consultation material on the Treasury’s website.                                                             11 Edge and Liang, 2017. 
11  Decision making for macroprudential policy So how do we operationalise our macroprudential policy in line with the principles of transparency, accountability and rigorous decisions? Well, the Reserve Bank’s decision-making follows three steps (figure 8). Figure 8: Operation of macroprudential policy   Firstly, we assess the nature of the risks facing the financial system, or systemic risk monitoring, by using a range of quantitative indicators.  We look at the probability of a correction in the credit cycle. A number of studies have identified house price overvaluation and household debt as reliable predictors of a correction in the credit cycle.12 Next, we assess the current resilience of the financial system to a correction. To do this, we monitor banks’ lending portfolios, their capital positions, and undertake stress tests of banks. Finally, we examine the feedback effect of the identified risk with the wider economy. The main indicator for this assessment is bank lending standards, which could undermine the resilience of the financial system over time, and increase vulnerabilities in the housing market and wider economy.  After considering all this information, we can judge whether these risks fall into the purview of macroprudential policy. That said, no set of indicators can mechanically capture the nature of risks, and reasoned judgements will always form a part of our decision-making. The second step is policy choice, where we consider what an appropriate policy response might look like. Macroprudential instruments can be categorised into capital and liquidity tools that are focused on improving bank balance sheets, and borrower-based tools that improve household resilience. Three capital and liquidity instruments are available, including the countercyclical capital buffer, the sectoral capital requirement and the core funding ratio. These tools build additional buffers for the banking system to absorb adverse shocks. In a downturn, these buffers reduce the risk of bank failure or deleveraging, and can be cut to support the supply of credit to the economy. The single borrower-based instrument we have is the LVR restrictions. In our view, a debt-to-income (DTI) tool would be a useful addition to our macroprudential toolkit. The Phase 2 review will consider the appropriate instruments to be included in the Reserve Bank’s future toolkit.                                                            12 Borio et al. (2018) and Aikman et al. (2018). 1. Systemic risk monitoring•Probability of a correction•Resilience•Feedback effect2. Policy choice•Capital and liquidity tools?•Borrower tools?3. Policy assessment•Consultation•Decision•Ongoing assessment
12  Our choice of tools depends on the risk we face. On the one hand, if we are concerned with low resilience on bank balance sheets, capital-based instruments may be the most effective tool. On the other hand, the LVR restrictions are more effective at restraining exuberance in the housing market and household debt, and at insulating the economy against adverse shocks.  It's worth noting that all tools come with possible costs to financial system efficiency. For example, capital and liquidity tools increase the cost of credit provision for banks, while borrower-based tools curtail credit availability. Both of these effects could reduce short-run economic growth. We need to choose the right tool for the job to have confidence that the benefits to financial stability exceed any costs to efficiency.  The final step in our decision-making is policy assessment, which includes consultation, a final decision and ongoing assessment. The consultation will typically consider several policy responses and settle on a favoured option. However, we listen carefully to our stakeholders and, should we find their arguments persuasive, we will change our views. Once a macroprudential tool has been deployed, the Reserve Bank will continue to assess its effect in the six-monthly Financial Stability Report. This asks whether there are unintended consequences, and whether the policy intervention remains optimal. Our ongoing assessment of the impact of the LVR policy has informed each adjustment in its calibration. The good news is that declining risks have allowed us to ease the LVR restrictions, starting in 2017. The outlook for macroprudential policy We left the LVR policy unchanged in the May Financial Stability Report, in order to monitor the effect of our recent easing and the recent fall in mortgage rates. Looking ahead, we are comfortable with further easing in the LVR policy over time, but this is predicated on risks continuing to abate. Specifically, we want to see household debt levels remaining stable relative to incomes, prudent lending standards from banks, and moderate house price inflation. If these conditions are met, we are inclined to continue easing the restrictions.  In the long term, we face a choice between removing the LVR restrictions and maintaining a permissive setting. A full removal would of course eliminate any efficiency cost, and could be done alongside the deployment of a less intrusive tool if we are still worried about residual risks. But on the flip side a permanent LVR setting will continue to guard against the very risky forms of lending, and may better prepare the banking system to adapt to a more restrictive calibration if risks re-emerge. The efficacy of a permanent LVR setting is an important policy question for future research. As you may know, the Reserve Bank has proposed a material increase to banks’ capital requirements to increase the resilience of the financial system. The proposals include a more prominent role for the counter-cyclical buffer, providing more certainty that this buffer will be built prior to a downturn in the financial cycle, in order to support lending during a systemic crisis.13  As a consequence, macroprudential tools, including the LVR restrictions, may need to be used less actively. That said,                                                            13 The counter cyclical buffer would be released during a systemic downturn to support lending. In contrast, it is unlikely that easing LVRs during a downturn would have the same benefit, as banks will be reluctant to undertake high-LVR lending when under stress. 
13  different tools are effective for addressing different risks, and there will still be a role for borrower-based tools to more directly address risks associated with household debt.   Part 4 – Conclusion In conclusion, financial stability is important for the wellbeing of New Zealanders, and macroprudential policy is a key line of defence for safeguarding financial stability. Baseline prudential tools ensure that potential threats to the financial system can be absorbed and the damage repaired. Macroprudential policy reduces the likelihood and severity of the threat, and mitigates the adverse impact on the economy.  To inform our strategy for macroprudential policy, we have reviewed our operation of the LVR restrictions policy since 2013 and the growing research on macroprudential policy internationally. We found that the LVR restrictions policy has significantly improved the resilience of the banking system. We have also gained a broader understanding of the side effect of the LVR policy on other public policy areas, of ways to mitigate the potential policy tensions, and of the limitations of macroprudential policy. Our experience in LVR restrictions has helped to shape our strategy for using macroprudential policy. Our strategy broadly follows a three-step process of systemic risk monitoring, policy choice, and policy assessment, including evaluation after implementing the macroprudential tools. We are transparent and accountable, both in outlining how the tools will be used and in making the case for their implementation. The government is reviewing the role and powers of the Reserve Bank as they relate to financial stability, including whether our macroprudential framework remains fit for purpose. The principles of good governance I have touched on, and our refreshed macroprudential strategy, form an anchor, and should be compatible with a range of outcomes of the review. I hope our refreshed strategy on macroprudential policy has contributed to the understanding, accountability, and lasting legitimacy for the framework.

Benjamin E Diokno: Ensuring price stability through monetarypolicySpeech by Mr Benjamin E Diokno, Governor of Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP, the centralbank of the Philippines), at the Breakfast Briefing with the Italian Chamber of Commerce in thePhilippines, Inc. (ICCPI), Manila, 17 May 2019.*   *   *To the officers and members of the Italian Chamber of Commerce in the Philippines, (ICCPI), ledby its President, Mr. Sergio Boero and Vice President Mr. Lorens Ziller, distinguished guests,ladies and gentlemen, magandang umaga/good morning.It is a pleasure to be invited as guest speaker in today’s breakfast briefing to discuss monetarypolicy and the overall the strategies of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas.  The passage of RepublicAct No. 11211, or the Amendments to the BSP Charter (Republic Act No. 7653), definitelybolsters the BSP’s commitment to its primary objective of promoting the stability of prices as wellas the financial system. The enactment of the said law is both timely and appropriate givennotable developments – both in the global and domestic fronts – that have taken place since1993 when the old BSP Charter took effect.For this morning’s presentation, let me focus on these three discussion points.First, I will provide an overview of the latest developments in the monetary sector by dissectinginflation numbers in the first four months of 2019 and look into the BSP’s inflation outlook for thisyear and in 2020.Second, I will focus on the monetary measures that have been pursued by the BSP as well asthe non-monetary measures put in place in coordination with other government agencies to helpanchor both inflation and inflation expectations following a challenging inflation environment in2018. This will highlight the crucial role of strong inter-agency coordination to address shocks toinflation.Lastly, I want to share the BSP’s policy thrusts moving forward, particularly in the context of theenactment of the amendments to its charter which strengthens its mandate of safeguardingprice and financial stability.Let me begin with the recent inflation numbers.It may be recalled that 2018 was a very challenging year for the BSP. Inflation has been on therise beginning the month of January and peaked in the month of September at 6.7 percent beforesettling at an average of 5.2 percent for the full year 2018. This inflation rate was 1.2 percentagepoints (ppts) above the high end of the inflation target range of 2.0 percent to 4.0 percent for theyear.Nonetheless, as projected, inflation has gone down significantly, falling toward the midpoint (at3.0 percent in April 2019) of the target band in the latest inflation print. This is not surprising giventhat the price pressures in 2018 were driven by cost-push factors. With the abatement of supply-side pressures, inflation has also started falling within target. The contribution of food inflation(represented by the yellow bar) to overall inflation has dropped markedly especially with riceprices easing in recent months brought about by the continued arrival of imports and the onset ofthe summer harvest season.Looking ahead, we expect inflation to remain on a target-consistent path for 2019 and 2020. Thelatest baseline forecasts (as of 9 May 2019 MB policy meeting) indicate that inflation is projectedto average at 2.9 percent for 2019 while inflation forecast for 2020 is slightly higher at 3.1 percent 1 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
due largely to the rebound in crude oil prices.Meanwhile, risks to the inflation outlook remain broadly balanced for 2019 amid risks of aprolonged El Niño episode and higher-than-expected increases in global oil prices. For 2020, therisks continue to lean toward the downside as weaker global economic activity could tempercommodity price pressures.Similarly, forecasts of other institutions generally convey the same expectations. Results of theBSP’s April 2019 survey of private sector economists showed lower mean inflation forecast for2019 at 3.1 percent from 3.3 percent in the previous survey round. The mean inflation forecastsfor 2020 and 2021 both declined to 3.3 percent from 3.4 percent. Meanwhile, projections fromother institutions also show inflation within target for this year and the next.Analysts expect inflation to continue easing and settle within the government’s target range.However, possible upward pressures are seen to keep inflation from further decelerating.(Upside risks to inflation): potential rebound in global crude oil prices, adverse weather conditionssuch as El Niño, higher electricity rates, reduction in the BSP’s policy interest rate, and higherdomestic demand due to the upcoming midterm elections and school enrollment(Downside risks to inflation): the lower inflation prints, implementation of non-monetary policyactions to increase domestic food supply and stabilize prices such as the rice tariffication lawand the mitigating measures put in place by the Department of Agriculture against the lingeringweak El Niño condition, lower global crude oil prices, base effects, stable domestic currencyagainst the US dollar, slower global trade and economic growth, and continued monetary impactof the BSP’s policy rate hikes in 2018.While the BSP is tasked with the primary mandate of safeguarding price stability, in certaincircumstances, when price pressures are emanating from the supply side, close coordinationwith other government agencies is critical to rein in inflation. Thus, a combination of bothmonetary and non-monetary measures becomes the best strategy to pursue.In 2018, the BSP took timely and deliberate monetary policy actions in May, June, August,September and November (with a cumulative of 175 bps hike in policy interest rate) to firmlyanchor inflation expectations to the inflation target and to arrest any possible risk of second-roundeffects.Non-monetary interventions implemented by other government agencies complemented theBSP’s monetary actions in addressing inflation pressures especially in the face of strong supplyshocks in 2018. These measures include enhanced surveillance of basic goods and agriculturalcommodities as well as streamlining administrative procedures to address supply bottlenecks.On 14 February 2019, President Duterte signed Republic Act No. 11203, or the “Act Liberalizingthe Importation, Exportation, and Trading of Rice, Lifting for the Purpose the Quantitative ImportRestriction on Rice, and for Other Purposes." The law, which became effective on 5 March 2019, replaces quantitative restrictions with tariffsand provides for the Rice Competitiveness Enhancement Fund giving more incentive to farmersto improve productivity and competitiveness. The implementing rules and regulations wereissued on 5 April 2019 and were published in the Official Gazette on 8 April 2019. Since then, asshown in earlier slides, inflation has gone down significantly.With inflation returning to the target, the BSP decided to reduce the policy interest rate by 25 bpsto 4.50 percent during its 9 May 2019 policy meeting. The MB’s decision was based on itsassessment that the inflation outlook continues to be manageable, with easing price pressuresowing to the decline in food prices amid improved supply conditions. Latest baseline forecasts 2 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
indicate that inflation remains likely to settle within the target range of 3.0 percent ± 1.0percentage point for both 2019 and 2020, while inflation expectations have moderated further.In deciding this, the MB noted the impact of the budget delays on near-term economic activity,but took the view that the prospects for domestic demand remain firm, to be supported by aprojected recovery in household spending and the continued implementation of the government’sinfrastructure program. In addition, the MB observed that the global economic growth momentumhas slowed down in 2019. Meanwhile, indications of slower growth in domestic liquidity and creditrequire careful monitoring.At the same time, the MB also noted that the risks to the inflation outlook remain broadlybalanced for 2019 amid risks of a prolonged El Niño episode and higher-than-expected increasesin global oil prices. For 2020, the risks continue to lean toward the downside as weaker globaleconomic activity could temper commodity price pressures.Looking ahead, the BSP will continue to monitor developments affecting the inflation outlook toensure that the monetary policy stance remains consistent with its price stability objective.On the other hand, the passage of Republic Act No. 11211, or an Act Amending Republic Act No.7653, known as the ‘New Central Bank Act’ (signed on 14 February 2019) is a significantmilestone for the BSP.Our three pillars of central banking, that of price stability, financial stability, and an efficientpayments and settlements system, were further strengthened with the expansion of the BSP’spolicy toolkit. The law restored the central bank’s authority to issue its own debt papers as part of its regularmonetary operations, establishes a stronger prudential regulatory framework to promote a safeand sound financial system through the expansion of supervisory coverage, and authority toprescribe metrics attuned to international standards and practices.The amendment likewise empowers further the BSP to oversee the country’s payment andsettlement systems (PSS), including critical financial market infrastructures that are vitalcomponents of the PSS.Additional notes:The amended BSP Charter restores the central bank’s authority to obtain data from any personor entity from the private and public sectors for statistical and policy development purposes inline with the pursuit of our triad mandates.The law authorizes the increase in the capitalization of the BSP from Php 50 billion to Php 200billion, which shall be sourced from dividends declared by the BSP in favor of the NationalGovernment. Under the amended Charter, the BSP is also exempt from paying taxes on incomederived from its governmental functions. These reforms place the BSP on a stronger position topursue its mandate amidst a growing economy and the increasing sophistication of the financialsystem.Looking ahead, we will continue to vigilantly monitor domestic and global developments to ensurethat the BSP is able to sustain the “trend” of achieving its inflation targets. The BSP stands readyto deploy appropriate measures as needed to ensure an inflation environment conducive to asustainable growth of the Philippine economy.Future policy actions of the BSP will continue to be guided by the following principles:1)    primacy on achieving its inflation objective. 3 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
2)    pre-emptively action if the inflation target is considered to be at risk. And3)    policy flexibility using all available tools in our enhanced tool kit, as deemed appropriate toaddress any threats to our inflation objective.Let me end my presentation with these key notes. Rest assured that the BSP is stronglycommitted to take all necessary policy actions to safeguard the government’s inflation targetsand deliver on its primary mandate of price stability to support the country’s growth trajectory. Maintaining price and financial stability that will minimize systemic risks, as well as provideresilience to shocks to the economy will help foster an enabling macro-environment that isconducive to accelerating economic growth and help expand its productive capacity.Ultimately, the BSP’s conduct of its monetary policy will always be anchored on its price stabilitymandate in support of our collective goal of a Philippine economy that is continuously expandingand thriving, for the benefit of all Filipinos. Thank you. 4 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
Yakiv Smolii: National Bank of Ukraine press briefing - changes inthe denominations of banknotes and coins of hryvniaSpeech by Mr Yakiv Smolii, Governor of the National Bank of Ukraine, at a press briefing onoptimization of the denominations of banknotes and coins of hryvnia, Kyiv, 25 June 2019.*   *   *Dear colleagues,Today, we are holding meetings in many Ukrainian cities, Kyiv, Dnipro, Odesa, Kharkiv, Lviv andKhmelnytskyi, to present to the public the changes in the denominations of banknotes andcoins of hryvnia that aim to harmonize  cash circulation.Despite the fact, that cashless settlements are gaining more popularity in Ukraine, cash remainsthe most used means of payment.Our domestic currency, it’s banknotes and coins, is something that everyone of us, regardless oftheir location, profession or age, deals with on a daily basis. Therefore, it is of outmostimportance for us that hryvnia in any material form remains high-quality, secure, and stable, andthat payments in hryvnia are convenient.Already this year we’ll take two important steps:first, 1, 2, and 5 kopiika coins will cease to be means of payment in Ukraine and will bewithdrawn from circulation. Also 25 kopiikas, that is still used for payments, will be graduallywithdrawnsecond, a new 1,000 hryvnia banknote will be introduced.In three years, after complete withdrawal of the above coins and the introduction of the newbanknote, the number of hryvnia denominations will reduce from 17 to 12. A total of 6 coindenominations and 6 banknote denominations will remain.This will streamline existing hryvnia denominations. 11–13 currency denominations are the mostcommon in the leading countries of various parts of the world, from the US to Canada, the UK tothe Czech Republic, Denmark, Switzerland and Australia.Why are we introducing changes to the currency denominations?I can give you three main reasons backing these decisions: customer convenience, economicfeasibility, and saving costs for the state and business.Let me add some details.The first reason is customer convenience.  The changes we present today will reduce theaverage number of coins per Ukrainian almost by half, and the number of banknotes by almost athird. Consequently, cash settlements and savings will be streamlined.The second reason is economic feasibility. Considering the growth of income and prices,Ukrainians essentially have no need for low-denomination coins, instead there is demand for abanknote with a denomination higher than 500.The structure of cash in circulation has also changed. At present, 500 hryvnia banknotes accountfor over 55%, and 200 hryvnia banknotes account for one third. Considering global experience,the 50% threshold is indicative of the need for a higher denomination. 1 / 2BIS central bankers' speeches
Thus, a new 1,000 hryvnia banknote is long overdue.The third reason is saving costs for the state and business. The costs of the state andcash circulation participants on producing, processing, transporting, and storing banknotes andcoins will be reduced.Thus, when and how will these decisions be implemented?The 1, 2, and 5 kopiika coins will cease to be means of payment in Ukraine from 1 October2019. From that time onwards, these coins will no longer be accepted for cash payments forgoods and services, and the NBU will commence the withdrawal of these coins from cashcirculation.At the same time, the public will be able to exchange these coins without limitation and free ofcharge for coins and banknotes of other denominations during the next three years.Furthermore, we intend to gradually withdraw 25 kopiika coins. Unlike 1, 2, and 5 kopiikas, 25kopiikas will for now remain in cash circulation. You can use them to pay for goods and services.But these coins, if received by banks, will not be returned into circulation. With time, their numberin circulation will decrease.The new banknote denomination (UAH 1,000) will be put into circulation on 25 October 2019.And now I present to you the new highest denomination banknote.(Pause, the governor takes the tube in his hands)According to the procedure for disclosing classified information, I have to open this tube andshow you an uncut sheet of the new banknotes.(Opens the tube, demonstrates the banknote sheet and gives one minute for filming)As you can see, the design of the new banknote is similar to the designs of the upgraded 20, 100and 500 hryvnia banknotes.The front of the banknote features a portrait of Volodymyr Vernadskyi.The building of the Presidium of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine is at the back ofthe banknote.The new banknote incorporates top-notch design and security technologies.The novelties announced today bring us forward to the completion of the current series ofbanknotes and coins. Meanwhile we are also preparing to develop the design of the nextgeneration of more modern hryvnia banknotes.Thank you for your attention! Now I would like to give the floor to my colleagues who will give youa detailed description of the security features and design of the new 1000 hryvnia banknote. 2 / 2BIS central bankers' speeches

    All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/default.aspx 2  2    Introduction  Thank you very much for the invitation to open this event today.  Promoting greater diversity in capital markets is a subject of great importance to me, to the Bank of England, and – I believe – to the continued prosperity of the financial markets and economy as a whole.  Let me say why.  The foreign exchange market is the nerve centre of the global financial system – settling some $5 trillion of transactions every day, supporting trade, travel and investment.  And its heart is here in London, which has nearly 40% of the global market.  That’s a big responsibility, and one we at the Bank of England take very seriously.  We are active ourselves in the market every day, buying and selling currencies on behalf of the UK Government and other central banks, and managing the UK’s foreign exchange reserves.  I and my staff speak regularly to a wide range of market participants to gather insights on developments for the Bank’s monetary and financial policy committees.  I chair the London Foreign Exchange Joint Standing Committee.  And the Bank, through the Prudential Regulation Authority, supervises the banks, insurance firms and broker-dealers active in financial markets.  Given the FX market’s global importance, it is vital that it operates to the highest standards.  Those standards fell unacceptably short in the years running up to, and following, the financial crisis.  And that is why in 2015 the Fair and Effective Markets Review (FEMR), which I led, called for a new global Code, setting out principles to promote the integrity and effective functioning of the market.  That Code was launched two years later, here in London, and is now overseen by a Global FX Committee, comprising public authorities and market participants from 18 countries around the globe.1  As of mid-June, the Global Index recorded over 900 public commitments from organisations across all geographies and sectors of the market to abide by the terms of the Code2.  Perhaps the most depressing aspect of past FX abuse was the light it threw on historic behaviour in parts of the market, called a ‘bro-culture’ by some,3 in which inappropriate, sometimes illegal, behaviour became the norm through a process of what we termed in FEMR ‘ethical drift’.  Groups calling themselves the ‘A-team’, the ‘3 Musketeers’ or (perhaps more aptly) the ‘Semi-Grumpy Old Men’ attempted to pervert the multi-trillion dollar foreign exchange market on which everyone in the world in one way or another depended.  For some of those active in the industry at that time, the culture from which this extreme behaviour emerged may have seemed wearingly familiar.  Lucy Kellaway, writing in the FT, described the toxic male environment she experienced on an FX trading floor early in her career.4  Though many men were (and are) equally                                                       1 https://www.globalfxc.org/membership.htm  2 https://www.globalfxc.org/global_index.htm 3 https://www.ft.com/content/62001b10-90de-11e8-9609-3d3b945e78cf 4 https://www.ft.com/content/511ad09e-6be2-11e4-b939-00144feabdc0

The 2016 Gadhia review5 showed that, whilst women actually outnumbered men 60/40 in financial services as a whole, they were much less likely to be the managers or leaders who shaped the culture (Figure 1).  And even when they were leaders, they were three times more likely to be running HR, communications or other support functions than serving in C-suite positions (Figure 2).

    All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/default.aspx 4  4    Diversity is good for the bottom line  Disparities of this kind are unfair.  They also make terrible business sense.  Diversity improves financial performance:  across the economy as a whole, firms with top-quartile executive-level diversity are 20-30% more likely to outperform their peers (Figure 3).  And diversity reduces risk.  Research at the University of Leicester found that an increase in the number of female traders in a market reduces the occurrence of crashes.6  Firms with monocultures suffer a quarter more governance-related issues than their peers, according to the FCA.7  And the IMF found that banks with higher shares of women leaders had higher capital buffers, lower nonperforming loans, and higher ‘distance to distress’.8  Figure 3:  Likelihood of financial performance above national industry median (%)  Source:  ‘Delivering through diversity’, McKinsey, January 2018.                                                         6 https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/88c1/6ee1ff277cd71340dd15980537174658016f.pdf 7 https://www.fca.org.uk/news/speeches/women-finance-keeping-pressure-progress 8 https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/Staff-Discussion-Notes/Issues/2018/09/17/women-in-finance-a-case-for-closing-gaps-45136 
    All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/default.aspx 5  5    There are several reasons for these findings:   First, recruiting a more diverse team means you are fishing in a bigger talent pool – so you should be able to choose a better team.     Second, more diverse teams make better decisions, because they have more ways to approach problems, and are better at self-challenge; and   Third, diversity improves a firm’s connection to, and empathy with its customers.    Within a trading environment, research suggests that adding more women to trading teams tends to improve risk management, increase average returns, reduce the incidence of ‘over trading’ (or trading for the sake of it), and improve a team’s capacity to monitor for, admit to, and learn from past mistakes.  But if diversity is so great, why has it taken so long for FX and other markets to begin to embrace it?  We can only speculate.  Perhaps the cliques that existed in parts of the FX market in the past have proved more adept at self-perpetuation than might have been hoped, particularly where they extended across both  sell- and buy-side.  Or remuneration schemes may have continued to reward those who make particularly large profits – even if the same behaviour can also lead to particularly large losses – rather than those who deliver a higher average return with fewer fireworks.  Whatever the reason, times are changing in the FX market – and fast.  And that’s what makes me optimistic about the future, and the role all of you here today can play in it.  The FX market of tomorrow, and why embracing diversity will no longer be an option  I want to focus on three key drivers of change:  technology; broadening market participation; and culture.  The most profound of these for the economics of the industry is technology.  Technological advances have fundamentally changed the face of trading and revolutionised the structure of the FX market.  These days, only a minority of FX trades involve people actually talking to one other.  And a growing number don’t even need someone to click a mouse, as algorithmic and high frequency trading techniques take over from manual trading.  That is particularly true for vanilla flow trading.  To take just one example, an estimated 70% of orders on EBS – a key inter-dealing platform for spot FX – are submitted by algorithms9.  The increased speed with which these technological advances enable market participants to respond to developments is opening the door to deeper analysis, significant efficiency gains and new business models.                                                        9 https://www.bis.org/publ/mktc10.pdf 
    All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/default.aspx 6  6    Such changes in technology inevitably also imply profound changes in the type of jobs, and skills, needed in the FX industry.  Traditional manual execution roles, where traders place orders on behalf of customers or their own book, are disappearing fast – and with them the ‘boiler room’ trading environments they spawned.  But as some roles disappear, others grow.  The focus now is on exploiting creative ideas, knowledge of customer needs and risk management, strategic judgment and technological savvy to develop and maintain a competitive edge.  And that is exactly the environment in which diverse teams are not only an advantage, they are a necessity – for all the reasons I stated a moment ago.  The revenue-generating stars of the future will not be the big swingers of the past:  McKinsey10 argue that half of the value-added in wholesale banking will be created by just 10% of the future workforce, but none of those roles sit on today’s senior teams.   If technology and innovation are transforming the FX products of the future, they are also transforming the way people work.  Modern communication tools allow much more flexible working, in time and space:  unheard of in traditional trading environments, but eminently feasible in a world of e-platforms and algorithmic trading, even in a market that trades 24/7.  And that opens the industry to a much wider talent pool, with different skills and thought processes, improving productivity and retention. Companies that fail to offer flexible working arrangements underperform their peers.11  And that is relevant to both men and women:  89% of those responding to a 2017 survey of British businesses12 said flexible working was a key enabler for productivity.  The second key change is the profound broadening in FX market participation.  In part that reflects a sharp reduction in the costs of entry to, and use of, the FX market, driven by those same technological trends I’ve just outlined.  Retail banks, asset managers and corporates can now access the market directly.  And there is a much wider range of service providers, stretching well beyond the traditional investment banks:  indeed, some of the biggest, or fastest-growing, firms in the market were unheard of 5-10 years ago.  The rapid development of previously emerging economies, and progressive capital account liberalisation, has also substantially increased the geographical reach of the foreign exchange market, bringing different customer needs and perspectives.                                                         10 https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/talent-in-wholesale-banking-building-a-sustainable-competitive-advantage 11 https://www.ft.com/content/c8c79254-bb33-11e8-8274-55b72926558f 12 https://www.ft.com/content/1c3e8d8a-6a70-11e8-aee1-39f3459514fd

Workforce diversity differs across sectors (Figure 4) and across firms within sectors.  But it also means that service providers need to get better at relationship management, investing more in understanding increasingly diverse customer needs.  It is striking, for example, that portfolio managers in Asia are twice as likely to be female (Figure 5); and the gender mix of retail FX trading in Europe – a rapidly growing market segment – is approaching 50/50 (Figure 6).  It would be too simplistic to say that service providers need to be as diverse as their customer base.14  But recruiting from a broader diversity pool and hiring people with different life experiences helps firms understand the mindset of their clients better, improving customer engagement and ultimately increasing returns.                                                         13 https://newfinancial.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Women_in_UK_finserv_2016_FINAL.pdf 14 See for instance, p.11 of the 2016 CFA report on gender diversity in investment management at:  https://www.cfainstitute.org/en/research/survey-reports/gender-diversity-report

Public authorities and firms right across the financial spectrum have put an enormous amount of effort into culture change in recent years.  Painful fines and enforcement actions have led to intense scrutiny of internal conduct.  Over 330 firms have signed the UK Women in Finance Charter, committing themselves to supporting the progression of women into senior roles, setting and publishing progress against gender diversity targets, linking senior executive pay to those targets, and appointing a named senior executive to be accountable for gender diversity.17  And the FX Global Code that I mentioned earlier has introduced clearly defined standards demonstrating which behaviours are no longer acceptable, rebuilding trust in the market and removing obstacles to open, non-biased recruitment. These higher ethical standards will make the sector more accessible and inclusive, improving the number of opportunities, but also strengthening the appeal of working in the FX market.                                                       15https://www.oliverwyman.com/our-expertise/insights/2016/jun/women-in-financial-services-2016.html 16From 2014 report by CitiFX, available at:  https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/groups/pdf/fxcg/2301/Retail_FX.pdf?8b9766f1bbf56797757c4c2cb391f305 17https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/women-in-finance-charter

But these initiatives, coupled with the profound technological and economic changes that I have been discussing, will leave the FX market of 5-10 years’ time in a very different place to where it was in the pre-crisis era.  There has never been a better time to get involved.  What is the Bank of England doing?  Just as diversity is essential to the continued success of the FX market, it is also fundamental to the delivery of the Bank’s public mission:  promoting the good of the people of the United Kingdom by maintaining monetary and financial stability.  As a public institution, we must aim to reflect the diversity of the public we serve.  And the wide range of policy challenges we face in the years ahead means we need those business advantages of diversity just as much as you.  Choosing the best talent, wherever it comes from, with the broadest set of problem-solving skills, and the greatest capacity to engage in constructive challenge and creative thinking, helping to avoid groupthink and bias, and hence deliver the best possible public policy decision making.    Promoting diversity and inclusion is therefore a top strategic priority for us, as the Governor recently set out in his remarks to the Women in Banking and Finance Annual Awards.18  We have signed the Women in Finance Charter and introduced a career returners programme in partnership with Women Returners.  We have set stretching diversity targets, aiming for at least a 35% female senior management by 2020, and 50% female representation below senior management.  Our BAME targets are to increase representation in senior management to 13% by 2022, and 20% below senior management by 2020.  And we have a comprehensive internal inclusion strategy bringing together our initiatives on diversity, wellbeing and community with the goal of building an inclusive culture where colleagues can provide their best work.  As part of this, I and my fellow Executive Directors sponsor individual female and BAME staff to support their progression into senior management – something I have personally found particularly rewarding.  As we strengthen diversity internally, we are also doing more to improve the diversity – in its broadest sense – of our external engagement with market participants.  A key part of my team’s role is to act as the Bank’s ‘eyes and ears’ in the financial markets:  gathering the best possible intelligence on market developments to support the decisions of our Monetary and Financial Policy Committees.  As those markets evolve, so too we must adapt and change those we engage with to keep our finger on the pulse.  Different and broader types of firm, using different technology.  Different people within firms, as those who matter for decision making change.  And a different and more open style to that engagement, more open to challenge and different perspectives on what makes markets tick.  Just as embracing diversity is no longer a choice for success in your business, so it is no longer a choice for us in ours.  Unless we ensure we are speaking to a broad, diverse set of market participants who are truly reflective of the diversity in the market, and feeding that input into our policy decisions, we will not be doing our job.                                                       18 https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2019/mark-carney-women-in-banking-and-finance-22nd-annual-awards 
    All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/default.aspx 10  10    To deliver on that goal, we are working with a wide range of financial market stakeholders and external networking organisations.  Ensuring diversity of market segments and individuals is explicitly considered when identifying members for roles on our external-facing committees, including the London Foreign Exchange Joint Standing Committee.  Further expanding our intelligence network to embrace all the benefits diversity can bring to our understanding of financial market developments.  And engaging more actively at events like this, where diversity is an explicit theme or topic of discussion.  But I would say this:  finding new and insightful contacts across the market is not always easy.  So we need your help as we ramp these efforts up over the coming year:  to identify people earlier in their careers, and the new generation of up-and-coming leaders of tomorrow, and bring them to our attention so we can ensure their views help support our policymaking for the whole of the country.  Conclusion  The foreign exchange market is one of the biggest, most geographically dispersed, efficient and technologically advanced financial markets in the world.  It touches every economy and financial system.  And it’s changing fast, with new products and players appearing every day, drawing in some of the smartest people, working to develop better ways to meet customers’ needs.    The culture and working patterns are changing too – not just because there is a moral imperative to do so, but because it makes hard business sense.  Diversity is not an option in FX – it’s an imperative.  And actually that’s what gives me greatest optimism that we will succeed – because if I had to choose one market to epitomise that hard-edged business instinct, it would be foreign exchange, where ultimately good ideas thrive and objective results speak louder than anything else.  So to all of you interested in a career in the FX markets, I say:  come and get involved.  It’s exciting, important and changing fast.  The things that might have put you off in the past are being dismantled – and what’s left is a vibrant and vitally important market where you can really make a difference, both in shaping the future, and in supporting the vital underlying economic activity that relies on it.  We need your talent and your skills to help drive change further.  I look forward to meeting many of you later, and to hearing from some of the great role models speaking in the later panels.  Thank you. 
John C Williams: Diversity and inclusion - we are not where weneed to beRemarks by Mr John C Williams, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Federal ReserveBank of New York, at the OPEN Finance Forum, New York City, 25 June 2019.*   *   *As prepared for deliveryGood morning. I’m an economist, so I’m going to start with some numbers.The unemployment rate for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people is nearly double thenational average. And the unemployment rate specifically for transgender people is three timesthe national rate. As President of a Federal Reserve Bank, I am focused on two vital economicgoals: maximum employment and stable prices for the U.S. economy. These statistics paint aclear picture of why conferences like this one are so important: We are not where we need to be.Before I go any further, I need to give the standard Fed disclaimer that the views I express todayare mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open Market Committee orothers in the Federal Reserve System.Let me say, as an ally, that it’s a genuine honor to be invited to open today’s Forum.This Pride Month marks 50 years since the Stonewall uprising. We’ve come a long way since the1960s, but we still have far to go. It was also a great honor to be able to fly the Pride flag outsidethe Federal Reserve Bank of New York for the first time this June. But, given that it is 50 yearssince Stonewall, it’s clear we have more catching up to do.And this is where we owe OPEN Finance a great debt of gratitude. OPEN Finance gives us thetools we need to assess how we’re doing, and where we need to make progress.With the support of OPEN Finance, and the dedication of the Open Network at the New YorkFed, we’ve introduced a number of new policies and measures that drive our efforts to make theBank the open and inclusive employer we aspire to be. I’d personally like to thank David Ignell andGil Carroll, presidents of our Open Network, for their work moving us forward.These efforts are important because they send a message to LGBT employees and theorganization as a whole about our values and culture.I’d like to share one specific example. We recently created the option to add gender pronouns toour official e-mail signatures. This is a part of an organization-wide effort to raise awarenessaround the use of pronouns. On its own, it may seem like a small change, but it sends a loudmessage that part of respecting one another is using the correct pronouns. This effort has beenwell received, and a big part of that is because it’s created spaces for conversations that justweren’t happening before.But policies can only go so far.In fact, we can have world-class policies, but if we don’t have a culture where people feelcomfortable bringing their whole selves to work, rules alone won’t get us to where we need to be.This is true of every element of diversity and inclusion. In a culture where taking extended leavedamages your career prospects, a generous parental leave policy won’t make up for that. In aculture where people don’t feel that their voices are welcome, few will speak up. In a culture thatfails to embrace differences, we won’t reap the benefits of diversity.12 1 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
The data are clear. Nearly half of LGBT people are closeted at work, and the top reason LGBTworkers don’t report negative comments they hear about LGBT employees is they don’t believethat anything will be done about it.This gets to the heart of why the “inclusion” piece of diversity and inclusion is essential, and apersonal priority. Obviously, there’s a moral imperative for diversity, and numerous studies haveshown the benefits to both productivity and the bottom line.But for me, it’s my experiences as both an academic and a policymaker that have madeinclusion so important. Economics is a profession that has a glaring diversity issue. Aseconomists, we have not done enough to create a diverse profession or an inclusive culture.When I’m sitting in a room and see a bunch of people who look and sound the same, I know it’s aproblem. When everyone has an identical view, it’s easy to assume it’s because that view is theright one. But for me it raises questions: Who isn’t in the room? Who’s missing, and why aren’tthey here?I’m always on the hunt for different perspectives on how to interpret the data, new takes on oldproblems, and innovative approaches to tackle the challenges that lie ahead. If I have a bunch ofcookie-cutter theories and explanations that look like my own, I know it’s highly probable we’venot been challenging ourselves enough.Most CEOs will tell you that that their people are their greatest asset. I know that to be true.That’s another reason why an inclusive culture is something that’s so important, and needs to beembedded across an organization. It’s not enough for diversity to live in HR documents andpolicies. We need to create an environment where everyone has the potential to flourish; to bringtheir best, most innovative, and creative selves to work; and to do the best work of their careers.So how do we make progress? We need to have honest and open conversations every day. Notjust about work performance and ideas, but on everything. We need to make sure that everyone—regardless of their background, their age, the color of their skin, their sexual orientation, or theirgender identity—feels their perspectives are heard and valued.Creating an inclusive culture has no end date. Like so many aspects of culture and values, it’snot a project with a deadline, where we can say, “OK, we’re done now.” Instead, we need to beconstantly reassessing our goals, refining what we do, and how we do it.We need to be vigilant, attuned to change, and open to new ideas. Because it’s one thing tocreate an open culture, but a much harder challenge to keep it that way.I’m reminded of a quote by Brené Brown, which I believe sums this up: “To not have theconversation because of discomfort is the definition of privilege…”When we step back, when the dialogue—however uncomfortable it may be—stops, or is neverinitiated in the first place, is when there’s a problem. It’s the conversations that aren’t spoken thaterode trust, alienate people, and take us back.I’d like to conclude where I began. I spend a lot of time examining data, and it’s a source ofconstant disappointment and frustration that LGBT people, women, and people of color continueto have less economic opportunity than their straight, white, male counterparts.Creating equality of opportunity at the national level is a challenge the United States continues tostruggle with. But it’s both the right thing to do and the only way we’ll reach our full economicpotential.Creating a more diverse—and equally important—a more inclusive Federal Reserve is a key34 2 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
priority. We have come a long way, but there’s no doubt we still have far to go. And this is ajourney without a final destination. When someone tells me “we’re done,” is when I know we havethe furthest to go. It’s also a journey that is so much easier when we do not walk alone. Partnerslike OPEN Finance are crucial to our progress.Once again, I’d like to thank you for inviting me to open today’s forum. I know it’s going to be aproductive and insightful day, and one full of the conversations we all need to be having morefrequently. LGBT Demographic Data Interactive.

Claudia Buch: Welcoming remarks - Macroprudential Conference2019Welcoming remarks by Prof Claudia Buch, Vice-President of the Deutsche Bundesbank, at theMacroprudential Conference 2019, Eltville, 21 June 2019.*   *   *The Bundesbank is very proud to be hosting the Macroprudential Conference series for the firsttime, and I would like to take this opportunity to welcome you all here in Eltville. From myperspective, the tradition of these conferences, which were initiated by the Dutch National Bankand the Swedish Riksbank, has two particularly important features:The first is close interaction between policymakers and academics. In many ways,macroprudential policymaking has entered unchartered territory, and policy developments haveoften leapfrogged analytical work. A close dialogue between researchers and policymakers isthus essential in order to understand how our existing policy tools are working, to identify whetherwe are missing any relevant channels, and to learn more about the functioning of the financialsystem, particularly in times of stress.The second feature is the need for cooperation. It has been emphasised repeatedly thatmacroprudential policy is a necessary complement to microprudential supervision with regard toproviding a system-wide perspective on the resilience of the financial system. This system doesnot end at national borders. International cooperation and coordination is thus crucial when itcomes to macroprudential policymaking.Let me give you two examples which demonstrate that such policy coordination is in fact working– and highlight the value of interaction with academia.1 Coordination of Macroprudential Policy nationally and in EuropeMacroprudential policy is a core element of the post crisis reform agenda, and it plays aparticularly important role in the European monetary union which lacks a single sovereign (Buchand Weigert 2018). It is not enough to focus on the sustainability of public debt – mechanismsare needed to safeguard the stability of the financial system. Such mechanisms ensure thatprivate credit is sustainable and that the failure to service debt does not pose a threat to thestability of the financial system. Macroprudential policy has exactly that objective: Preventing thebuild-up of systemic risk, i.e. the risk of destabilising negative externalities in the financial system,and preventing excessive leverage of the private sector. Macroprudential policy takes amacroeconomic perspective on the financial sector’s health and resilience. It complementsmonetary policy and microprudential supervision.In Europe, macroprudential policy is a national task – involving close coordination at theEuropean level. Understanding the coordination of macroprudential policy –at both the nationaland supranational level – is important: In a monetary union with a high degree of financialintegration, risks can easily spill over across borders.Let me give you an example: The German Financial Stability Committee recently recommendedactivating the countercyclical capital buffer and raising it to 25 basis points. Thisrecommendation is based on the analytical work of the Bundesbank, as President Weidmannexplained this morning.  We warn against over-optimism after a long period of good growthperformance: credit risk might be underestimated, and market participants might overestimatethe value of collateral. Interest rate risks are, obviously, closely correlated with these risks.Responsibility for macroprudential policy in Germany is shared by the members of the Financial1 1 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
Stability Committee (FSC): the Bundesbank, the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin)as the macroprudential authority, and the Ministry of Finance as the chair of the Committee. TheCommittee can issue warnings and recommendations when there are financial stabilityconcerns. The institutional set-up for the implementation of macroprudential policy often includesmore than one institution. This brings more expertise and different views to the table, whichensures sound decision making. But the decision-making process may also be lengthened. Thisimportant issue has been highlighted in today’s presentation by Nellie Liang. In her paper withRochelle Edge, she finds that “countries with FSCs with stronger governance mechanisms aremore likely to use the CCyB”. As more evidence on policy decisions accumulates, and as moreinstruments will be used, we will certainly learn more about the design of macroprudential policyand governance structures.An insightful example of the coordination and the political economy of macroprudential policydecisions at the national level is a recommendation that was issued by the German FSC in 2015.The Committee recommended that legislative action be taken with regard to macroprudentialinstruments for the housing market and, importantly, that a legal basis be created for thecollection of sufficiently granular data on housing loans. Two years later, the German parliamentpassed legislation including two of the recommended policy instruments – loan-to-value-capsand amortisation requirements – while limits to debt-service and debt-to-income ratios weredropped from the proposal. Thanks to the close collaboration and close coordination ofcommunication among FSC members we were able to convince lawmakers to include at leasttwo of the recommended instruments. In this sense, the FSC acts as an important hub toexchange views and coordinate action under the heading of financial stability. This is somethingwhich would have been much harder to achieve without a sound legal mandate and a designatedcommittee. However, the arguments for the two remaining instruments are still valid and therestill remain data gaps to be closed.Governing macroprudential policy decisions in Europe goes beyond coordination at the nationallevel. Domestic policy decisions play an important role also for the European financial system.The European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) and ECB with its Financial Stability Committeeprovide a cross-country view. The ESRB is the macroprudential oversight body for the EU. It canissue confidential or public warnings when it identifies significant systemic risks. Furthermore,the ESRB can issue recommendations for remedial action to address identified risks. The ECBhas the right to top-up certain national measures, such as the CCyB, thereby limiting spill-overeffects that might not be fully accounted for by national authorities.This provides a laboratory for research on the effects of macroprudential policy coordination:How do national policymakers react to domestic and European financial stability risks?Which indicators should guide policymaking, and which surveillance tools should be used?What is the role of communication? How to explain complex issues like financial stability,systemic risks and macroprudential instruments, such as the CCyB? What can we learnfrom each other?The examples given here show that macroprudential policymaking in Europe is embedded in acomplex set of institutional arrangements, ensuring coordination between national institutionsand countries. It may be too early to tell whether these institutional arrangements help toovercome the inaction bias inherent in macroprudential policy and whether they improve thesurveillance of systemic risks. But as more evidence accumulates, we will certainly learn fromour experiences and improve existing frameworks, if necessary.2 Coordinating Reform Evaluation InternationallyA second example is the coordination of the FSB’s currently ongoing ex post policy evaluations.Post-crisis financial sector reforms were agreed at a global level in order to make sure that 2 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
certain minimum standards apply in all jurisdictions. At the same time, many macroprudentialpolicies that were implemented after the global financial crisis were without precedent. Thismeant that macroprudential policies had to be implemented and calibrated with great uncertaintyas to their actual effects. Now that many policies have been put in place and initial experienceshave been gained, we are in a position to evaluate and thus improve our understanding of theireffects. Policy evaluation provides information on whether policies achieve their objectives orwhether unintended consequences materialise. Policy evaluation, however, is not a trivial task asit needs to answer three key questions:1.  Did the reform “cause” an outcome (attribution)?2. Did the reform have similar effects across relevant markets, states of the world, orjurisdictions and regions (heterogeneity)?3. Did the reform achieve its overall objective (aggregation/general equilibrium)?These questions cannot be answered by taking a purely national perspective. Recent work at theFinancial Stability Board (FSB) is a good example of how internationally coordinated evaluationhas become part of the policy process: In 2017, during the German G20 presidency, the FSBdeveloped a framework to evaluate the effects of the G20 post-crisis reforms of financialregulation (Financial Stability Board 2017). The FSB subsequently launched several evaluationprojects. Three projects have already been completed or are close to being finished:The first project provided evidence that post-crisis reforms generated incentives to centrallyclear OTC derivatives.The second project showed no material negative effects of reforms on infrastructurefinancing.The third project analyses reform effects on the availability of funding for small and medium-sized enterprises. The recently-published consultation report showed no persistent negativeeffects of the G20 regulatory reforms on SME financing overall.Ongoing evaluation work at the FSB deals with one of the G20’s core objective – reducing thesystemic and moral hazard risks associated with systemically important financial institutions. Afirst evaluation plan has been published on the FSB’s website. Workshops will be held withstakeholders from academia, the financial sector, and representatives of civil society.The Too-big-to-fail (TBTF) evaluation will address three main questions:1. Were the reforms effective in reducing the perceived probability of the impact of failure ofsystemically important institutions? This question can be addressed by assessing changesin estimates of implicit funding subsidies and analysing progress in the resolvability ofsystemically important banks.2. Are reforms resulting in altered bank behaviour in terms of changes in funding structures,asset allocation and risk-taking?3. What are the broader effects of the reforms? Such effects include the functioning of thefinancial system, market fragmentation, cost and availability of financing to the realeconomy.Focusing on the experiences of individual countries will not be sufficient to answer thesequestions. Financial systems differ with regard to their competitive structure and the types ofinstitutions involved. Reform effects are thus likely to differ across countries. Researchconducted by the International Banking Research Network, for instance, shows that prudentialinstruments sometimes spill over across borders through bank lending, and that internationalspillovers vary across prudential instruments and are heterogeneous across banks. Thereappears to be no one channel or indeed, a specific direction of transmission that predominates in2345 3 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
the context of spillovers. Understanding this heterogeneity and its implications for resilience iscrucially important.3 Summing UpMacroprudential policy is a new policy field and offers lots of unchartered territory to be exploredby basic academic research and policy-oriented and applied research. With the FSB evaluationframework and the evaluations initiated, policy makers also explicitly acknowledged theimportance of academia to support evidence-based policy making and improve accountability.Therefore, I invite the academic research community join this evaluation process: Either bydirectly contributing to the on-going and envisaged projects or by critically following the processto ensure that analytical results and policy conclusions match.ReferencesBuch, C.

Anita Angelovska Bezhoska: How to make capitalism work for allSpeech by Ms Anita Angelovska Bezhoska, Governor of the National Bank of the Republic ofNorth Macedonia, at the IMF/WB Constituency Meeting, Skopje, 22 June 2019.*   *   *Distinguished Prime Minister, ministers of finance and other respective representatives ofgovernment institutions, governors of central banks and other respective representatives ofcentral banks, Executive Directors, Vice Presidents in World Bank Group Directors inInternational Monetary Fund, Professor Zingales, Delegates of the Constituency, excellences,fellow colleagues, representatives of the media,At the very beginning, let me say how honored we are to have the opportunity to host thisimportant gathering of our Constituency. Sixteen years have passed since the last meeting of theConstituency in Skopje, and we are delighted to have all of you with us here during these threedays.By a twist of fate, I recently came across a book that I have not seen since my early youth days;a book that starts with a very powerful notion – “Happy families are all alike; every unhappy familyis unhappy in its own way” – you might recall Tolstoy’s “Anna Karenina”. Few days after, whilesearching for the most recent discussions on the matter of capitalism, inequality, wealthdistribution, I read an analytical piece where the author cited the same quote, linking it with all thedifferent modalities of inequality, as a symbol of the global unhappiness. Standard metrics oninequality point to a widespread and rising phenomenon. It obviously underpins the risingpopulism, that reflects the dissatisfaction with the system that does not create equalopportunities for everyone, a system where reward is not merit based, i.e., system that graduallyevolves into a crony capitalism. Against this background, I have no doubts that we have chosenthe perfect spotlight for this Constituency meeting.Let me shortly use the historical lenses – what questioned the sustainability of capitalism and ledto Marxism was the stagnation of wages and concentration of wealth in the early phases ofindustrial revolution. It gave ground for rising inequality, and as Thomas Pikketty, the so-called“Modern Marx” reveals in his book “Capital in the Twenty-First Century”, the only exception fromthis rising trend of global inequality is the period as of 1914 until 1970s, as a historical outlier. Indeed, actual data does indicate rising income inequality since the 1980s onwards almostacross the board, although with different intensity. This turning point is very often associated withthe end of the so-called “post-war egalitarian regime” around the globe. To bring the point closer,let me refer to the data retrieved from the 2018 World Inequality Report, which reveals that in1980, the income share of the top 10% in the income distribution in Western Europe, NorthAmerica, China and India was around 30–35%. By 2016, this percentage rose to around 35–40%in Western Europe, while the increase in the other regions was stronger, reaching 45%-50% ofthe total income. One might notice the remarkable difference in the income concentration at thetop-level earners in Western Europe and US, meaning the inequality diverged substantially inthese two groups in the last almost four decades.This so-called “modern” surge and divergence in inequality leads economists wondering, whichforces may be preventing benefits of capitalism being widely distributed. Observing the US –Europe nexus, apparently the level of development does not always matter for how the incomedistribution could look like. There are policy tools and fundamental values in the society that canaffect the distribution curve markedly. For instance, many authors associate the divergence inWestern Europe and US with the educational inequalities and less progressive tax system in US.On the other hand, in Western Europe tax progressivity declined moderately, but even moreimportantly the educational system and wage setting policies are thought to be relatively more 1 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
favorable to low and middle income groups. Hence, equal opportunities to higher qualityeducation, in particular nowadays when technology is rapidly advancing could be one of theremedies for the “illness” of inequality. It could enable young people at the bottom of the incomedistribution to get access to better-paid jobs, and hence flatten the income distribution curve.In the region-specific context despite the transition, process that in principle leads to increase ininequality, the top 10% of the income distribution has a share of close to 29% of the total income,lower compared to Western Europe.Apparently, the issue of rising unequal income distribution is neither new, nor the world has beenshielded from tectonic changes in the systems, such as for example the transition in Europe,which was “fertile soil” for rising inequality. However, it is only in the last ten years that wewitnessed such substantial proliferation of literature, and academic and political debates on theroots and consequences of rising income inequality. It was the financial crisis that brought theissue to the fore. Even more, some authors link the severity of the financial crisis and itsunexpected spell, exactly to the uneven societies. In his book “Fault Lines”, Raghuram Rajanargued that rising inequality in the past three decades led to political pressure for redistributionthat eventually came in the form of subsidized housing finance, which was at the root of theglobal crisis.Whether or not policies of the central bank affect the income distribution gained lots of attention,as well. I would say that the pure fact that we inherently face with heterogeneity acrosshouseholds in terms of their primary sources of income – capital or labor – or with respect totheir position of being saver, or borrower naturally implies that monetary impact, at least in theshort-term, could differ along these groups. Macro-prudential measures, by design are targetedand selectively used to tackle identified points of vulnerability. Purchase of different types ofassets, also significantly alters the pricing on the financial markets and can have different wealtheffects. Still, given the rationale and the features of central banking policies, as Ben Bernanke(2015) states: “By comparison to the influence of (these) long-term factors, the effects ofmonetary policy on inequality are almost certainly modest and transient”. These long-termfactors influencing inequality relate to globalization, technological progress, demographic trends,and institutional changes in the labor market.How should we tackle the chronic problem of uneven income distribution, which seems asymptom of many fundamental weaknesses of the system? How to return the greatness of theopportunities that modern society should bring? Should the way forward be stronger regulation,more active redistributive role of the state or as Prof. Zingales claims through harnessing thepower of competition? As economists, we all know that market based system inherently bringssome inequality, but its disruptive power is unthinkable when boundaries are crossed. At thecurrent juncture, when global growth slowdown is on the horizon pro–growth and pro–equalitypolicies seems inevitable. I am sure that distinguished speakers and panelists will reflect on thearray of available policies, including improving access to markets and levelling the playing field,increasing financial inclusion, investing in human capital, regulatory and institutional reforms, thatstrengthen the rule of law and promote competitive and fair business environments.We, as policymakers, cannot only have the role of “innocent bystanders”, scrutinizing andstocktaking, but putting in place reforms that promote strong and inclusive growth that by itsnature reduces inequality. Thus instead of re-slicing the pie more focus is needed on ensuringthat the pie gets bigger and more inclusive, which will lead to less unhappiness in all thedimensions that it might appear. I truly hope that in a not so distant future, we will be witnessing moderation in the income gaps,more prosperous and less unequal societies. This requires commitment, willingness and visionby all policymakers. Somehow, it seems appropriate to end as I began, with Tolstoy quotation:“Тhere is only one time that is important— Now! It is the most important time because it is the 2 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
only time when we have any power”. And we, as policymakers, exactly Now have not only power,but also a duty to act for a better wellbeing in our societies. Thank you. 3 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
Benoît Cœuré: European capital markets - priorities and challengesDinner remarks by Mr Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the European CentralBank, at the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Frankfurt am Main, 25 June 2019.*   *   *The past decade has seen remarkable achievements in strengthening global financial regulation,and in making our economies safer and more resilient, thanks in large part to the work of theinternational community under the auspices of the Financial Stability Board (FSB).But now, more than ten years after the crisis, priorities have shifted and there are concerns thatthe cooperative multilateral order that has underpinned past international achievements isincreasingly being questioned.In my remarks this evening I will argue that dismantling regulatory standards would be a mistake,and would add to market fragmentation. I will also argue that the current low levels of financialintegration in the euro area are inefficient, and that, as a response, we need to intensify ourefforts if we want to achieve tangible progress in completing banking union and creating a truecapital markets union (CMU).In the last part of my remarks I will briefly touch on the ongoing reform of interest ratebenchmarks, which is essential to safeguard the smooth transmission of monetary policy andthe resilience of the financial system.Market fragmentation as a source of concernThe achievements of the FSB and the global standard-setting bodies since the financial crisisare remarkable. By rolling out international standards and new principles for regulatorycooperation, they have made global financial markets more integrated and our financial systemsafer and more resilient, protecting taxpayers from costly bailouts.We have also made significant progress at a regional level. In the euro area, we now have asingle banking supervisor that harmonises supervisory actions across participating countries. Atthe level of the European Union (EU), the Commission and the co-legislators have alsostrengthened the single rulebook and launched an ambitious agenda for creating a CMU.But with the financial crisis gradually disappearing in the rear-view mirror, ambition for furtherreforms is weakening and reluctance to implement already agreed standards is rising.Hidden forms of financial protectionism, or a relaxation of regulation, would turn back the clock oninternationally agreed rules, revive distrust, and risk regulatory arbitrage and a race to the bottom.As a result, market fragmentation has become one of the more pressing issues for globalstandard-setting bodies and the financial community in recent months. The Japanese G20presidency has identified market fragmentation as a key priority, and the FSB published its reporton the matter just ahead of the G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors Meeting inFukuoka on 8 and 9 June. ISDA itself prominently discussed the topic at its 34th Annual GeneralMeeting in Hong Kong earlier this year.Market fragmentation can arise for a number of reasons, such as technological differences,divergent tax regimes or differences in local financial structures. Diverging regulation andsupervisory practices can also play a role here.Not all types of market fragmentation are harmful. Stricter financial regulation in some parts ofthe world, for example, may help promote financial stability more widely by mitigating perilous12 1 / 8BIS central bankers' speeches
cross-border spillovers, insofar as it does not increase risk taking in foreign markets. Othertypes of fragmentation may come with real economic costs, however.In Europe, for example, financial integration has gone into reverse since the crisis broke and isonly very gradually coming back. Today, intra-euro area cross-border risk sharing is atuncomfortably low levels. And without private risk sharing, country-specific shocks will continueto cause persistent dispersion in economic outcomes across euro area countries, underminingreal convergence and hampering the conduct of the single monetary policy.Priorities for CMU after BrexitIt is this type of fragmentation that I would like to focus on in the remainder of my remarks.Financial disintegration is particularly harmful in a currency union where deeper and more liquidfinancial markets should be able to compensate for the absence of other intra-regional shockabsorbers, such as flexible exchange rates. Financial markets that can absorb shocks efficiently,and contribute to macroeconomic stabilisation and resilience, do not waste costly politicalcapital. And they create more policy space in downturns, for both fiscal and monetary policy.I am not arguing here that public risk sharing is irrelevant. But progress towards a euro areafiscal capacity with stabilising features, however desirable, will be a long journey. Better privaterisk sharing mechanisms can only make it more acceptable. As the US monetary union shows,both private and public risk sharing are in fact complements, not substitutes.A true CMU could contribute to filling a substantial part of this void and help diversify and reducerisk in the euro area. Significant progress has already been made. Under the outgoing EuropeanCommission, 11 of the 13 legislative initiatives tabled under the current CMU action plan werefinalised, together with most of the non-legislative actions.But the pace with which co-legislators, and Member States in particular, have progressed onindividual initiatives has been much slower. Ring-fencing and considerable differences in nationallegislation mean that CMU remains incomplete in many respects, while new challenges forfinancial integration have emerged.The United Kingdom’s departure from the EU’s Single Market, in particular, will by its very natureaffect the shape of Europe’s future financial market architecture. A large number of banks andinvestment firms are in the process of establishing or expanding their euro area presence with aview to ensuring that they can continue to serve the Single Market after Brexit.Plans submitted to the ECB indicate that this can be expected to result in a substantial relocationof activity to the euro area, in the order of over €1 trillion in bank assets, and that, at least in theshort term, activity will move to a number of euro area countries, possibly resulting in thedevelopment of a multi-centric European financial system.While the landscape may evolve further in the future, in a financial system with a number ofincreasingly important hubs, as opposed to one dominant hub in London, it will be moreimportant than ever for these hubs to be able to efficiently interact with one another and to avoiddifferences across Member States providing opportunities for regulatory arbitrage.So, Brexit reinforces the urgency with which we should pursue policies that address barriers tocapital market integration in the EU. This discussion is also closely connected to the paralleldiscussion on the global role of the euro, which fundamentally depends on our ability to builddeeper and more efficient financial markets.Advancing CMU should therefore be a top priority for the new European Commission andParliament. The ECB is a key stakeholder in this discussion, as the transmission of our single2345 2 / 8BIS central bankers' speeches
monetary policy crucially depends on the degree of financial integration in the euro area.But we should recognise that not all of the numerous initiatives adopted under the CMU actionplan will have the same impact. And some initiatives with greater potential, such as the creationof a common safe asset, will face considerable political resistance in the short term.We should therefore choose our battles wisely when discussing policy priorities that couldimprove Europe’s financial market architecture in the short term. So what areas should we focuson when shaping CMU in the future? In the view of the ECB, there are three high-priority areas.Harmonising insolvency frameworksThe first relates to harmonising insolvency frameworks – an area in which synergies between thebanking union and the capital markets union are particularly strong. High non-performing loanratios, and their effects on growth and bank lending, are a case in point.Transparent and efficient insolvency frameworks are the backbone of cross-border capitalmarkets transactions. They safeguard trust and legal certainty for issuers and investors. And byfostering effective and efficient resolution actions, they increase the expected return oninvestment and thereby stimulate investment in both credit and capital markets. The end result ishigher rates of economic growth, more dynamic local economies and higher levels of private risksharing.Some progress has already been made, most notably through the proposal on preventiverestructuring frameworks, second chance, and measures to increase the efficiency ofrestructuring, insolvency and discharge procedures.But the Commission proposal fell short of harmonising core aspects of insolvency, such as ruleson conditions for opening insolvency proceedings, a common definition of insolvency, ranking ofclaims and avoidance actions in general. And for various aspects that were included in theproposal, it has become clear that, at the current stage, we face significant challenges inovercoming prevailing divergences in views among Member States.It thus makes sense for EU legislators to tackle this issue in stages, and focus first onharmonising specific elements of insolvency frameworks. Full harmonisation of creditorhierarchy in bank insolvency, for example, is one area where achieving tangible results wouldhave a high impact.A harmonised depositor preference rule would help create a level playing field for debt issuanceby banks and enhance the robustness of their resolution framework, which benefits the overallstability of the financial system and, in turn, strengthens banks’ capacity to support the widereconomy.More generally, a clear credit hierarchy for all companies, not just banks, would provide cross-border investors with greater comparability and transparency on the ranking of their claims ininsolvency.Supervisory convergence and the oversight and supervision of central counterpartiesThe second area that we should prioritise on the CMU agenda relates to supervisoryconvergence.The final outcome of the review of the three European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs) fell short ofits initial ambitions, in particular on governance aspects, where national authorities retain aleading role despite a strengthened profile for the ESAs’ chairpersons.Ever-more sophisticated technologies and products, climate change and the rise of cybercrime 3 / 8BIS central bankers' speeches
increasingly require a highly coordinated European approach and a governance andaccountability structure for the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) that is moreconsistent with its status as a fully-fledged supervisory body.Consider Facebook’s plan to launch a new global digital currency, the implications of which arenow being scrutinised by a G7 working group, which I chair. Such initiatives naturally require aglobal response, including a harmonised pan-European position.To put it simply, truly integrated European capital markets will ultimately require a single capitalmarkets supervisor, much in the same spirit as we have a single bank supervisor today.Take the role of ESMA in the supervision of central counterparties (CCPs). Given that the brunt ofdefault risk in EU CCPs is borne by their clearing members, most of whom are directlysupervised and resolved at the European level, the principle of aligning liability and responsibilityclearly implies European supervision of EU CCPs.But despite significant legislative efforts, the recent revision of the European Market InfrastructureRegulation (EMIR 2) is a lost opportunity to advance capital market union, as the competence forCCP supervision will remain almost exclusively national.What EMIR 2 does do, however, is strengthen the EU regulatory framework with respect toclearing activities which are systemically important for the EU but take place in non-EU countries,including those provided from London after Brexit. This debate is arguably at the heart of thecurrent discussion on fragmentation.Instead of being based only on equivalence at jurisdiction level, the new framework will alsosubject systemically important non-EU CCPs to EMIR standards and supervision by ESMA. Thiswill ensure a level playing field with EU CCPs, limiting regulatory arbitrage, and enhance CCPresilience.One open issue is whether regulators should force swaps clearing to be relocated even if it risksincreasing spatial fragmentation. EMIR 2 clearly states that recognition can only be denied as alast resort, and the ECB supports this approach.Cooperation has, in fact, always been the ECB’s preferred approach to the oversight of financialmarket infrastructures, as per Responsibility E of the CPMI-IOSCO Principles for FinancialMarket Infrastructures. In this respect, the existence of common regulatory standards for CCPshas been playing a fundamental role for underpinning co-operation arrangements, includingmutual recognition.We therefore also note with interest that the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission nowintends to move to a proportional approach similar to EMIR 2, and we look forward to learningmore about this new framework in the future.I would only note that, given the importance of clearing for the stability of the global financialsystem, our reliance on deference depends on the depth of cooperation and information-sharingbetween authorities. There is still much progress to be made on that front, and theimplementation of international commitments is of the essence.Diversifying external funding for the real economyThe third area of priority for CMU should focus on broadening and deepening the funding mix ofeuro area firms and households. This is particularly important for the transmission of monetarypolicy.Today, firms in the euro area predominately rely on bank lending for their debt financing, althoughthe importance of non-bank financing has increased over the past ten years. The latest data 4 / 8BIS central bankers' speeches
indicate that bank lending accounts, on average, for around 55% of debt financing of euro areafirms. In the United States, by contrast, firms source around 70% of their debt financing directlyfrom non-banks, and only 30% from banks.In principle, bank and market-based finance tend to support economic development and livingstandards in similar ways. But the euro area sovereign debt crisis, and the subsequentimpairment of the bank lending channel, underlined that what matters for resilience and growth isthat funding is diverse and avoids concentration risks.Clearly, market financing is still too rare in the euro area and too restricted to large companies.According to the most recent survey on the access to finance of enterprises (SAFE), for theperiod from October 2018 to March 2019, only 11% of small and medium-sized companies(SMEs) have considered taking on equity financing, and only 3% issued debt securities.SMEs have therefore increasingly sought to raise capital outside of public capital markets.Private equity investors, in particular, have partly filled the void left by financial markets. Theirinvestment has increased considerably in recent years and has also benefited many young andsmall companies.In 2018, total equity invested in European companies increased by 7% to €80.6 billion, thehighest level recorded to date. The number of companies receiving equity investment alsoreached its highest level, also increasing by 7% to over 7,800 companies. 86% of these wereSMEs. Venture capital investment, which is particularly important for young innovative firms,stood at a historical high of €8.2 billion, funding a record 4,400 companies.But because the United Kingdom is home to around one-fifth of the EU’s private equity funds,Brexit may disrupt private equity investment as non-EU private equity funds can only be marketedin the EU under strict conditions.In order to fill the gap left by the possible loss of UK private equity funds, we need to harmonisethe myriad of existing national requirements and ensure that EU-based funds and managers areallowed to reap the full benefits of the single passport and market their products to all suitable EUinvestors.All this suggests that more needs to be done to further diversify external funding of euro areafirms, in particular for SMEs, which are typically the first to suffer from tightening credit conditionswhen the tide turns and risk aversion rises. This relates to both market integration and marketdevelopment.The role of market developmentMarket development entails both seizing new opportunities and making sure that existingframeworks are fit for purpose. Fintech, for example, opens up new sources of funding and newopportunities for investors, such as crowdfunding. And the work by the EU technical expert groupon sustainable finance, published last week, will help deepen the market for “green” investmentsby laying out a common taxonomy for sustainable financial instruments.The ECB is supporting market development efforts by establishing state-of-the-art marketinfrastructures. In November last year, for example, the ECB launched Target Instant PaymentSettlement (TIPS), which allows payment service providers to offer funds transfers to customersin real time and around the clock across Europe. We have also launched a marketconsultation on a European mechanism for the issuance and initial distribution of debt securities(EDDI), to which we expect comments before 9 July.Cutting red tape also supports market development. I welcome the current work by the EuropeanCommission to consider ways to encourage SMEs to tap capital markets for their financing6789101112 5 / 8BIS central bankers' speeches
needs more often. But incentives must be aligned, too. In particular, preferential tax treatmentcontributes to pushing firms towards debt funding. This unequal treatment might incentiviseexcessive leverage and hinder effective private risk sharing.The role of market integrationMarket integration, in turn, leverages the potential of market development initiatives and enhancesmarket depth. Research suggests that deeper equity markets are more effective in bringingeconomies closer to the technological frontier, as well as in “greening” the local economy.On the retail side, the creation of a pan-European personal pension product would go a long waytowards integrating local capital markets and overcoming prevailing home biases. Unfortunately,the initial proposal was watered down and the tax treatment has been fully left to the nationalauthorities’ discretion. Renewed impetus here is vital.Pension reforms that strengthen private retirement savings, and also contribute to thediversification of such savings into equity, would support the process. In 2017, EU householdsheld just 21% of their financial assets in shares and equity, compared with 41% in the UnitedStates.A second important lever for integration and diversification is to build on the newly adoptedEuropean covered bonds directive and to increase efforts to revive the European securitisationmarket, in particular SME securitisation. SME deals only accounted for around 8% of overallsecuritisation in 2016.Early on, the ECB and the Bank of England have called for a revitalisation of the Europeansecuritisation market, addressing the flaws evidenced by the crisis. The new EuropeanSecuritisation Regulation entered into force at the start of this year. We have already seen itbearing fruit, as simple, transparent and standardised securitisations have started to pick up,with 16 such transactions published on ESMA’s central register between late March and earlyJune.The development of covered bond-like structures backed by SME loans, such as the EuropeanSecured Notes, could complement efforts to open up new financing sources for SMEs.Benchmark rates and the need for fallback optionsBefore concluding, let me say a word on a matter that is very much related to the resilience ofEuropean financial markets, namely the ongoing interest rate benchmark reform, where a lot ofprogress has been made this year. Given ISDA’s work to implement more robust fallbacks forderivatives that reference key interbank offered rates, I will focus on the role of fallbacks forEURIBOR.EURIBOR plays an important role in the transmission of the ECB’s monetary policy. It is closelylinked to the interest rates that affect many businesses and households in the euro area. Morethan 80% of new loans to non-financial corporations in the euro area are based on floating rates,and more than 20% of new loans to households, including mortgages, are variable rate loans. Inmany euro area countries this share is significantly higher.It is therefore encouraging to see that the EURIBOR reform has entered its final stages. Lastmonth, EURIBOR’s administrator, the European Money Markets Institute (EMMI), started tophase in the new hybrid methodology. The relevant supervisory authority, the Financial Servicesand Markets Authority, is currently assessing its compliance with the EU Benchmarks Regulation(BMR).121314151617 6 / 8BIS central bankers' speeches
The outcome of this assessment is expected to be positive, allowing users to continue toreference EURIBOR beyond the deadline given by the BMR, which is expected to be extended bypolitical agreement to the end of 2021.Yet EURIBOR, also in its amended form, will ultimately rely on voluntary contributions by its panelbanks. The BMR includes the possibility of making these contributions mandatory for a period oftime, but eventually it will be up to the market, including users and panel banks, to see whetherEURIBOR can be sustained in the long run.This means that we need to prepare for various eventualities. For this reason, it is important thatthe working group on euro risk-free rates continues its ongoing work on identifying fallbacks forEURIBOR, based on the ECB’s euro short-term rate (€STR) that will be published as of 2October this year. As a first step, earlier this year the working group recommended amethodology for calculating forward-looking term rates based on the €STR.However, at the current stage, it is not certain whether and when forward-looking term ratesbased on €STR will become available, and for which use cases they would be suitable. Forthis fallback solution to ultimately gain ground, we need the market to start preparing for the useof €STR as soon as possible and to build up liquid derivatives markets.ConclusionIn any event, and with this I would like to conclude, further analysis of the appropriate fallbacks forEURIBOR, and the ways to implement them, is required. This includes the need to makedecisions on trade-offs between international comparability, consistency across products andavailability for use. I am sure ISDA will continue to play a vital role in finding such solutions for theeuro area.The reform of interest rate benchmarks comes at a time when more far-reaching andencompassing reforms to European capital markets are needed to promote integration,strengthen investment and boost private risk sharing.The United Kingdom’s departure from the EU reinforces the urgency with which we shouldpursue policies that address barriers to capital market integration in Europe and eliminateopportunities for regulatory arbitrage. More integrated capital markets will support thetransmission of the single monetary policy and increase its resilience in periods of stress.Advancing CMU should therefore be a top priority for the new European Commission andParliament.Thank you.See FSB (2019), FSB Report on Market Fragmentation, 4 June.See Houston, J., Lin, C. and Ma, Y.

 Japan's Economy and Monetary Policy Speech at a Meeting with Business Leaders in Aomori Bank of Japan June 27, 2019 Masazumi Wakatabe Deputy Governor of the Bank of Japan (English translation based on the Japanese original) 
1  Introduction Good morning. It is my pleasure to have the opportunity today to exchange views with administrative, financial, and business leaders in Aomori Prefecture. This is my first meeting of this kind since the start of the Reiwa era. Aomori Prefecture is blessed with a rich natural environment such as the Shirakami Mountains, which are registered as a World Heritage site, Lake Towada, and the Hakkoda Mountains. It has a long history represented by a Jomon clay figurine designated as a national treasure, as well as the Sannai-Maruyama Site. It also is an area distinguished by a rich culture that has produced many intellectuals and artists, such as Shoeki Ando (philosopher), Osamu Dazai (novelist), Shuji Terayama (poet and playwright), and Noriko Awaya (singer). The Bank of Japan's Aomori Branch was established in 1946. I heard that, due to a shortage of materials at the time, there were great difficulties in constructing the branch building. Since then, the branch has operated to the present owing to support from people in the region. I would like to take this opportunity to express my sincere gratitude for your cooperation with the activities of the branch.  Today, I would like to hear your views on the current status of the local economy, as well as your candid opinions about the Bank's policies and activities. First, I will briefly explain developments in Japan's economic activity, and then talk about the Bank's conduct of monetary policy, regional financial institutions in Japan, and economic developments in Aomori Prefecture.  I. Economic Developments A. Economic Improvement since 2013 First, I would like to take a look at how Japan's economy has changed under quantitative and qualitative monetary easing (QQE) that the Bank introduced in April 2013.  Looking back, Japan's economy suffered a significant downturn due to the Global Financial Crisis in 2008, and thereafter remained below the pre-crisis level until around 2012. In contrast, since 2013, it has followed an improving trend under the Bank's monetary easing, albeit with fluctuations (Chart 1). Domestic demand such as private consumption and business fixed investment has been increasing more considerably than the previous recovery phase of around 2002-2008, despite slower growth in external demand (Chart 2). This 
2  suggests that, even amid a weaker tailwind from overseas, well-balanced economic growth has materialized as domestic demand has been stimulated strongly, partly by various policy measures.   The well-balanced growth of Japan's economy since 2013 also can be evidenced by an improvement in the employment and income situation. Labor market conditions have continued to tighten steadily in Japan, with the active job openings-to-applicants ratio rising to the level seen in the 1970s and the unemployment rate declining to the level observed in the early 1990s (Chart 3). A notable feature of such improvement is a substantial increase in the numbers of employed persons and employees. This shows that tight labor market conditions in the current phase are attributable to an increase in labor demand, rather than to a decrease in labor supply that results from a decline in the working-age population. If labor market conditions had tightened, due mainly to a decline in labor supply, the number of employees would have declined since the number of those who wish to work would decrease with wages unchanged and the labor supply curve would shift to the left (Chart 4).1 In reality, the number of employees has continued to increase, along with a moderate rise in wages, and therefore employee income has continued to register relatively high growth. Such improvement in the employment and income situation, together with generally favorable corporate profits, has supported solid domestic demand.  B. Effects of the Monetary Easing I think that the Bank's monetary easing has contributed greatly to achieving economic growth, in which domestic and external demand have increased in a well-balanced manner                                                    1 Compared to the fact that the numbers of employed persons and employees have increased significantly since 2013, wage increases have been relatively weak. This suggests that the labor supply curve could have shifted to the right -- the direction indicating that the labor supply has increased. Although the continued decline in the working-age population aged 15-64 can contribute to shifting the labor supply curve to the left, there is a possibility that mainly women and seniors have become more willing to work, due to the progress in labor market reform that enabled various working styles, the extension of healthy life expectancy, and the rise in expectations that labor market conditions will remain tight. Firms seem to be addressing demographic changes including the declining birthrate and aging population proactively by, for example, taking various steps to secure their labor force and expanding labor-saving investment, rather than merely considering these changes as constraints. 
3  accompanied by the improvement in the employment and income situation. In what follows, I will explain the effects of the monetary easing since 2013, by describing changes in financial conditions and its impact on economic and price developments.  Let me start with the changes in financial conditions. Since the introduction of QQE in 2013, Japan's interest rates have declined significantly. The decline in interest rates has stimulated the private sector's credit demand and improved financial institutions' lending attitudes. These have resulted in a clear increase in the amount outstanding of funding in the private sector (Chart 5). There is considerable evidence that the financing environment for firms has improved considerably under the monetary easing.  I will move on to the effects of the monetary easing on economic activity and prices. It can be said that it has led to an upturn in the economic and price situation by, for example, producing accommodative financial conditions and influencing people's expectations, as well as through a resultant rise in asset prices. Since the actual economic and price conditions are subject to various factors, it is not easy to quantify the effects of the monetary easing alone. That being said, let me introduce one simulation of how economic activity and prices would have developed since 2013 if the Bank's QQE had not been introduced (Chart 6). Although the estimation results should be interpreted with a certain latitude, this analysis suggests that (1) QQE has strongly stimulated economic activity and prices through, for example, a decline in interest rates, and (2) without QQE, it is highly likely that the current situation where Japan's economy is no longer in deflation could not have been achieved amid a continuous shortage in demand.2                                                     2 The simulation shown in Chart 6 is based on a vector auto-regressive (VAR) model consisting of the following variables: the monetary base, interest rates for different maturities, the output gap, the consumer price index (CPI) excluding fresh food and energy, and the foreign exchange rate. The future path of the output gap and the CPI was simulated assuming that there had not been any shocks on interest rates or the monetary base. The results are generally consistent with those presented in the Bank's Comprehensive Assessment released in September 2016, which estimated the effects of QQE on economic and price developments based on a large-scale semi-structural model of Japan's economy. 
4  The effects of the monetary easing are exerted so indirectly through mainly interest rates that people cannot feel them easily. However, I would like to emphasize that the monetary easing in fact has been underpinning the economy firmly from various aspects as I explained earlier.  C. Current Situation and Outlook for Japan's Economy I have described so far that Japan's economy has been on an improving trend since 2013 under the Bank's monetary easing. However, exports and production have been relatively weak since early this year amid growing concern about deceleration in overseas economies (Chart 7).  On this point, the Bank currently assesses that Japan's economy has maintained its moderate expanding trend, although exports and production have been affected by the slowdown in overseas economies. The monetary easing has been sustaining steady domestic demand. Also, as for the outlook, the main scenario is that the economy is likely to continue expanding moderately as a trend, with the growth rates of overseas economies rising somewhat and domestic demand maintaining its firmness (Chart 8).  More recently, however, further attention needs to be paid to downside risks to the main scenario. The latest economic outlooks by international organizations such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) also have pointed out that, although the global economic growth rate is projected to increase somewhat from the second half of 2019, this scenario entails substantial uncertainties. Most notably, the trade friction between the United States and China involves significant issues beyond mere economic problems -- such as the competition in advanced technologies and national security -- and it may be difficult to resolve these issues fundamentally in a short period of time. The negotiation between the two countries is still underway, so we should not be too pessimistic. If the trade friction becomes prolonged or persistent, however, downward pressure on the global economy may heighten not only through the direct effects of the tariff hikes but also 
5  deterioration in firms' fixed investment stance and financial market sentiment.3 In Europe, uncertainties over political developments including negotiations on the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union (EU) remain high, and in the Middle East, for example, geopolitical risks warrant careful attention.  If the slowdown in overseas economies becomes prolonged, downward pressure on domestic demand may strengthen gradually. In addition, there remains a risk that the scheduled consumption tax hike this October may push down domestic demand and eventually economic activity and prices.  II. Conduct of Monetary Policy A. Why Is the Price Stability Target of 2 Percent Necessary? Next, I will talk about our conduct of monetary policy. The Bank has conducted monetary easing policy with a view to achieving the price stability target of 2 percent. At my previous meeting with business leaders held in Niigata last December, I elaborated on why the Bank has set the price stability target at 2 percent.4 Setting the target level at 2 percent is a global standard; if we lowered the target, deflationary pressure would be exerted through changes in people's expectations as well as in foreign exchange rates and asset prices. In addition, the Bank does not consider it sufficient if only prices go up; rather, it thinks that achieving the 2 percent target contributes to the sound development of the national economy -- for example, increases in nominal GDP, corporate profits, household income, and the number of employees, as well as fiscal soundness. A rise in labor costs has been pointed out in recent years as one of the factors behind price rises. Labor costs are, in other words, wages and salaries. Increases in wages and salaries will lead to price rises, but it also is true that                                                    3 According to the G-20 Surveillance Note written by IMF staff this June, it is estimated that global GDP is likely to be lower by 0.5 percent in 2020, taking into account the impact of an increase in tariffs on 200 billion dollars' worth of United States imports from China from 10 percent to 25 percent, the possible 25 percent tariff on the roughly 267 billion dollars' worth of United States imports from China, and the tariff hikes already conducted in 2018. For details, see https://www.imf.org/external/np/g20/pdf/2019/060519.pdf. 4 Masazumi Wakatabe, "Japan's Economy and Monetary Policy," speech at a meeting with business leaders in Niigata, December 5, 2018, http://www.boj.or.jp/en/announcements/press/koen_2018/data /ko181205a1.pdf. 
6  firms are not able to raise wages and salaries in a situation where they cannot increase the prices of their products and services.  In this speech, I would like to explain the Bank's monetary policy from a somewhat different perspective. The Reiwa era has just started. Most of the Heisei era, which lasted from January 1989 to April 2019, was one of deflation, and marked by a battle against it. Unfortunately, economic activity also stagnated during that period. While there have been various views to explain what caused deflation, we have to note with the utmost seriousness that only Japan fell into prolonged deflation among advanced economies, the rest of which achieved inflation of around 2 percent for most of the time.5  However, under the Bank's price stability target of 2 percent, Japan's economy is no longer in deflation. Since the introduction of QQE in April 2013 in particular, the inflation rate on average has increased from around 0.5 percent in negative territory to around 0.5 percent in positive territory. This improvement was achieved under the Bank's clear commitment to the 2 percent target and the monetary easing pursued in line with it (Chart 9).  B. Cause of Low Interest Rates: Decline in the Natural Rate of Interest That being said, the inflation rate has not yet reached 2 percent, being in the range of 0.5-1.0 percent when excluding fresh food, and therefore the Bank's monetary easing has continued for a long period of time. In this situation, there are requests for higher interest rates. Some may think that the Bank can raise interest rates because it can control them as it wants. But the reality is not that simple.6                                                     5 Kataoka Goushi, Nihon no "Ushinawareta 20-nen": Defure o koeru keizai seisaku ni mukete (Tokyo: Fujiwara-Shoten, 2010); Masazumi Wakatabe, Japan's Great Stagnation and Abenomics: Lessons for the World (New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2015); Takenaka Heizo, Heisei no kyōkun: Kaikaku to gusaku no 30-nen (Tokyo: PHP Institute, Inc., 2019); and Iwata Kikuo, Naze defure o hōchi shite wa ikenai ka: Hitode busoku keizai de yomigaeru Abenomikusu (Tokyo: PHP Institute, Inc., 2019). 6 For one example as an answer to the same question in the United States, see Stanley Fischer, "Why Are Interest Rates So Low? Causes and Implications," remarks at the Economic Club of New York, October 17, 2016, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/fischer20161017a.htm. 
7  Why have interest rates remained low in the first place? Interest rates are low not only in Japan but in other advanced economies. In economics, it is said that if you want to raise a rate, cut it first; if you want to cut a rate, raise it first. A central bank lowers interest rates when the economy slips into a downturn with a higher risk of deflation. Then, as the inflation rate goes up, reflecting the economic recovery, a central bank raises interest rates accordingly.  Let me elaborate on this. Monetary policy today is based on the following understanding. The level of the interest rate that balances savings and investment and neither accelerates nor decelerates the economy is called the natural rate of interest, or the equilibrium real interest rate. A central bank conducts monetary policy using the natural rate of interest as a reference point. Specifically, at a time of an economic downturn, a central bank stimulates the economy by guiding the actual interest rate to a level below the natural rate of interest. When the economy is overheated, a central bank raises the interest rate to a level above the natural rate of interest.  As the natural rate of interest is just an estimate based on a theoretical model and entails uncertainties, it should be interpreted with a certain latitude.7 With this in mind, I would say that the natural rates of interest have declined in many advanced economies including Japan (Chart 10).   In the case of Japan, the natural rate of interest declined sharply in the early 1990s. In other advanced economies, the rates have decreased since the Global Financial Crisis. This suggests that the natural rates of interest have been affected by the bubble burst as well as financial and economic crises. Generally speaking, the reason behind a decline in the natural rate of interest is one of the following: an increase in savings, a decrease in                                                    7 Jerome H. Powell, "Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy," speech at a symposium titled "Changing Market Structure and Implications for Monetary Policy" held in Jackson Hole sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, August 24, 2018, https://www.federalreserve.gov /newsevents/speech/powell20180824a.htm; and Richard H. Clarida, "Models, Markets, and Monetary Policy," speech at the Hoover Institution Monetary Policy Conference titled "Strategies for Monetary Policy" held at Stanford University, May 3, 2019, https://www.federalreserve.gov /newsevents/speech/clarida20190503a.htm. 
8  investment, or a combination of these two. For example, when households and firms seek to increase their savings in the event of an economic crisis, the supply of funds in the economy will increase and the natural rate of interest will decline. If growth expectations deteriorate due partly to an economic crisis or a decrease in productivity, and thereby firms become less willing to make investment, actual investment will decrease and the natural rate of interest consequently will decline. Demographic changes such as the declining birthrate and aging population also are pointed out as causes of the decline in the natural rate of interest.8 Moreover, some say that a global saving glut plays a major role and others point to the possibility of "secular stagnation."9  In a case where the natural rate of interest declines for any reason, a central bank needs to lower interest rates accordingly because otherwise the economy will be under deflationary pressure. In Japan, short-term nominal interest rates already have reached close to 0 percent since the 1990s. In light of this situation, the Bank has taken such measures as (1) lowering long-term interest rates through purchases of Japanese government bonds (JGBs), (2) introducing a negative interest rate policy to guide short-term nominal interest rates to negative territory, (3) adopting an inflation-overshooting commitment, under which the Bank will continue expanding the monetary base until the year-on-year rate of increase in the observed CPI exceeds 2 percent and stays above that level in a stable manner, and (4)                                                    8 The following study examines the effects of demographic changes on the natural rate of interest. Assuming that a decline in labor force lowers the economic growth rate and that the extension of longevity results in an increase in savings, this study estimates that about 270 basis points can be attributed to demographic changes out of the 640 basis points decline in real interest rates over the past 50 years in Japan. Nao Sudo and Yasutaka Takizuka, "Population Aging and the Real Interest Rate in the Last and Next 50 Years: A Tale Told by an Overlapping Generations Model," Bank of Japan Working Paper Series, no.18-E-1, January 2018, https://www.boj.or.jp/en/research/wps_rev /wps_2018/data/wp18e01.pdf. However, attention should be paid to the fact that the study does not take into account the effects of financial crises as factors causing a decline in the natural rate of interest. 9 Secular stagnation refers to a situation where aggregate demand in an economy remains below its potential supply capacity for a long time, resulting in a further decline in the capacity. For more details on the decline in the natural rate of interest and secular stagnation, see a collection of papers by Lawrence H. Summers, Ben S. Bernanke, Paul Krugman, and Alvin H. Hansen in Keiki no kaifuku ga kanjirarenai no wa nazeka: Chōki teitai ronsō, ed. and trans. Hiroo Yamagata (Kyoto: Sekaishisosha Co., Ltd., 2019), available only in Japanese. 
9  introducing forward guidance stating that the Bank intends to maintain the current extremely low levels of short- and long-term interest rates for an extended period of time. Once an economy falls into deflation, households and firms will strengthen their expectations that deflation may continue. Especially when deflation lasts for a long time as in Japan, such expectations will heighten further. In that case, firms and households will perceive interest rates as higher than the actually low level of nominal interest rates. We call such perceived interest rates, which take into account inflation expectations, real interest rates. The Bank's price stability target of 2 percent is expected to encourage firms and households to strongly hold expectations that prices will rise steadily, resulting in a decline in real interest rates.  The word "normalization" is often used with regard to monetary policy, but it is an ambiguous term with an unclear definition. The ultimate objective of monetary policy is the sound development of the national economy. In other words, it is not until the economic and price situation is normalized that monetary policy also will be normalized.10 The Bank will continue with the monetary easing for as long as it is necessary to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent in a sustainable manner.   C. Discussions over the Monetary Policy Framework Amid low interest rates and low inflation observed globally, central banks and academics have had discussions that mainly regard the monetary policy framework. The Bank of Canada reviews its monetary policy framework every five years; the Federal Reserve                                                    10 Arguments for raising interest rates include the "theory of ammunition." According to this, a central bank should raise interest rates in advance -- as if loading a gun with ammunition -- because otherwise it cannot lower interest rates when the next economic downturn occurs. Of course, when the price stability target is achieved in a sustainable manner, interest rates are likely to increase reflecting inflation. However, interest rate hikes before the price stability target is achieved will instead bring about an economic downturn, which will be counterproductive. 
10  recently has discussed whether to update its framework.11 Key points of such discussions including these can be summarized as the following.12  First, through the experience of Japan's battle against deflation and the U.S. and European economies following the Global Financial Crisis, policy tools such as QQE, a negative interest rate policy, and forward guidance have been added to the central banks' "arsenal." They will be used going forward depending on the situation.  Second, the inflation target framework has been proved effective even in the time of the Global Financial Crisis and its aftermath, but it has been pointed out that, even in the United States, where economic and price developments are relatively firm, interest rates have remained lower and room for monetary policy response has become smaller than before. Under these circumstances, there are ongoing debates in the United States and other economies on what monetary policy framework should be adopted with a view to achieving the medium- to long-term price stability. Various approaches have been proposed, such as setting a higher inflation target and introducing average inflation targeting, price-level targeting, the inflation target range, and nominal GDP targeting (Chart 11). Every approach has its own advantages and challenges. Of course, Japan cannot be treated the same as other economies such as the United States, where the inflation rate is already at around 2 percent. The Bank judges at present that it is appropriate to maintain the current policy framework in which it clearly commits to the price stability target of 2 percent and pursues the monetary easing to achieve the target. That being said, I think it is necessary for the Bank to work sufficiently on studies toward better monetary policy.                                                     11 Regarding the Bank of Canada's review of its monetary policy framework to date, see https://www.bankofcanada.ca/agreement-inflation-control-target/. As for the Fed Listens events that the Federal Reserve has proceeded with, see https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy /review-of-monetary-policy-strategy-tools-and-communications-fed-listens-events.htm. 12 With regard to the challenges of and outlook for monetary policy at present, the following paper by Ben S. Bernanke, former Chair of the Federal Reserve, is informative. See Ben S. Bernanke, "Monetary Policy in a New Era," in Evolution or Revolution? Rethinking Macroeconomic Policy after the Great Recession, ed. Olivier Blanchard and Lawrence H. Summers (Cambridge: The MIT Press, 2019), pp.3-48. 
11  III. Regional Financial Institutions in Japan Next, I would like to talk about regional financial institutions in Japan. Needless to say, they play an extremely useful role in regional economies. With accommodative monetary policy lasting for a long period of time, the challenges faced by the regional financial institutions in Japan and the impact of such monetary policy on them have come to draw attention. Japan's financial system can be characterized as follows. First, indirect financing has been dominant. Indirect financing is a form of finance in which depositary financial institutions such as banks play a significant role in firms' funding. Second, particularly in regional financial institutions, the ratio of deposits to overall financial liabilities is high while that of corporate bonds and equities is low. Third, regional financial institutions in particular depend on deposit-taking and lending activities.  However, financial institutions, not only in regions but in Japan as a whole, are now entering a phase of drastic changes. Structural changes are taking place, such as the declining population and aging, globalization, as well as technological innovation evidenced by new entries to the settlement business from outside the financial sector. National accounts data show that the corporate sector has become a net lender of funds since the mid-1990s (Chart 12). This also is related to the decline in the natural rate of interest that I mentioned earlier. Even among small and medium-sized firms, the ratio of the so-called de facto debt-free firms -- defined as firms with cash and deposits that exceed their total amount of borrowings -- has continued to increase, recently exceeding 40 percent.13  Structural factors such as these lie behind the decline in financial institutions' profits. Interest rates used to be high worldwide, reflecting high inflation and high natural rates of interest. However, unfortunately, it is unlikely for such an environment to be realized again soon. At regional financial institutions, although net income has remained high in the long run, pre-provision net revenue (PPNR) has continued to follow a declining trend. The Financial System Report released this April shows profit simulation for the next 10 years. The results suggest that more than half of domestic regional banks are expected to run                                                    13 According to Teikoku Databank. 
12  deficits in 10 years if the borrowing demand of the corporate sector continues to decline at the same pace as in the past. Of course, it should be noted that these results need to be interpreted with a latitude as they are calculated based on certain assumptions (Chart 13).  Here, it is worth referring to the case of financial institutions in Europe, where a negative interest rate policy has been introduced, as in Japan. The Financial System Report compares financial institutions in Europe with those in Japan. Under a negative interest rate policy, the former have made higher profits than the latter. This is partly because funding costs of financial institutions in Europe have decreased against the background that the low interest rate environment has lasted for a shorter period than in Japan, and therefore there has been room for a further decline in deposit interest rates. Also, in Europe, the share of deposit funding to overall financial liabilities is low, and the costs of market financing such as issuing corporate bonds have been declining. Moreover, financial institutions in Europe have secured various sources of revenue that are unsusceptible to changes in interest rates by, for example, diversifying fees on services (Chart 14).  For higher profitability going forward, it is hoped that regional financial institutions will (1) set lending rates that reflect risks appropriately, (2) depart from excessive dependence on deposit-taking and lending activities by, for example, increasing fee-based income, and (3) drastically improve their business efficiency.14 To push forward with these initiatives strongly and effectively, the use of digital technology, integration or partnering among financial institutions, and alliances with firms outside the financial industry can be effective options. The Bank will continue to support these efforts by financial institutions.  IV. Economic Developments in Aomori Prefecture Now, I would like to talk about the economy of Aomori Prefecture. Looking at current developments, economic activity in Aomori Prefecture has been on a moderate recovery                                                    14 For discussions based on the comparison of financial institutions in Japan with those overseas, see Hiroshi Nakaso, "New Frontier of Macroprudential Policy: Addressing Financial Institutions' Low Profitability and Intensified Competition," speech at the Kin'yu Konwa Kai (Financial Discussion Meeting) hosted by the Jiji Press, November 29, 2017, http://www.boj.or.jp/en/announcements /press/koen_2017/ko171129a.htm/. 
13  trend, albeit at a slower pace. The production growth has decelerated, reflecting weaker overseas demand. Business sentiment of primarily manufacturing firms has become cautious, and thus business fixed investment has been more or less flat. Meanwhile, labor market conditions have continued to tighten, and private consumption has maintained its recovery trend with employee income improving.  Let me touch on the economic structure of the prefecture. The prefecture has experienced a continued decline in population for 20 years longer than Japan overall and faced shrinking internal demand. During this time, it has taken initiatives such as inviting firms and managed to maintain its economic scale by attracting demand from other prefectures -- mainly the Tokyo metropolitan area -- and from overseas. It does not seem easy, however, to keep its economic scale going forward as the population already has started to decrease across the country. That being said, I also have felt during this visit that the prefecture has many advantages in terms of overcoming the challenges. Also, it is not constructive to only focus on the negative side of the declining population. Declining birthrates and aging populations are now advancing worldwide. As I mentioned earlier, Japan's economy has continued to improve moderately since 2013 despite a prolonged declining trend in population. Even though the population continues to decrease, we can prepare countermeasures if we factor that in beforehand. As aging population has progressed, the healthy life expectancy has become longer. As evidenced by the fact that drones and artificial intelligence (AI) already have started to be used in agriculture here, the declining population can promote innovation.15  For example, Aomori Prefecture has abundant resources, such as one of the largest agriculture, forestry, and fishery industries in Japan, manufacturing firms of worldwide prominence, as well as a natural environment and culture that attract attention from all over                                                    15 At the G20 Symposium co-hosted by the Bank of Japan and the Ministry of Finance on January 17, 2019, the theme of the discussion was "demographic changes and macroeconomic challenges." In the session, Toshitaka Sekine, Director General of the Research and Statistics Department at the Bank of Japan, discussed the extension of healthy life expectancy accompanied by that of longevity, and Yasuyuki Sawada, Chief Economist of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), discussed the possibility of the declining population promoting innovation.

14  the world. As a big fan of Jomon culture, I feel very encouraged to hear about the efforts to register Jomon Archaeological Sites on the World Cultural Heritage List. I met people working on vitalizing the local economy by making the most of these advantages. In addition, Aomori Prefecture has diverse cultures, history, and economic structures, depending on the area. To make use of such diversity, I hope that not only existing firms will make active efforts, but also startups aiming at achieving new growth will be provided with coordinated support by the industries, the administration, academics and research institutions, as well as financial institutions. Such initiatives are expected to help the prefecture make further progress toward its goal of realizing a self-sustaining economy. As the central bank of Japan, we also will support the local economy by, for example, analyzing the situation and disseminating information through the Aomori Branch. I would like to ask for your continued cooperation regarding the activities of the branch going forward.  Conclusion Mitsuru Yoshida, known as the author of Senkan Yamato no saigo (Requiem for Battleship Yamato), once worked as General Manager of the Bank's Aomori Branch from 1965 through 1968. Yoshida, who was very fond of Aomori Prefecture, placed high expectations on its potential, saying that Aomori could be the Norway of Japan, and that Aomori was a "future prefecture."16 He also stated that, if all the potential could be exploited, there would be a bright future ahead, and that we could not just keep waiting to firmly grasp those big dreams in our hands. These words apply not only to Aomori Prefecture but also to Japan's economy as a whole.  As I already mentioned, most of the Heisei era was one of deflation, and marked by a battle against it. Unfortunately, Japan's economy stagnated in that deflationary era. While other advanced economies achieved inflation of around 2 percent, we have to take seriously the fact that only Japan fell into deflation for a long period. As price stability is stipulated as the principle of the policy conduct in the Bank of Japan Act, the Bank has a responsibility to                                                    16 Yoshida's essays on Aomori Prefecture were first compiled in Aomori sanka (Aomori: To-o Nippo Press Co., Ltd., 1967), and are now included in Yoshida Mitsuru Chosakushū, vol. 2 (Tokyo: Bungeishunju Ltd., 1986). 
15  avoid deflation.17 The Bank will firmly pursue policy conduct so that the economy will never fall into deflation in the new Reiwa era.  Thank you very much for your attention.                                                     17 "The responsibility for deflation basically lies in monetary policy. This is because central banks are obliged to avoid deflation or inflation and stabilize prices."

Jerome H Powell: Economic outlook and monetary policy reviewSpeech by Mr Jerome H Powell, Chair of the Board of Governors of the Federal ReserveSystem, at the Council on Foreign Relations, New York, New York City, 25 June 2019.*   *   *Good afternoon. It is a pleasure to speak at the Council on Foreign Relations. I will begin with aprogress report on the broad public review my Federal Reserve colleagues and I are conductingof the strategy, tools, and communication practices we use to achieve the objectives Congresshas assigned to us by law—maximum employment and price stability, or the dual mandate. ThenI will discuss the outlook for the U.S. economy and monetary policy. I look forward to thediscussion that will follow.During our public review, we are seeking perspectives from people across the nation, and we aredoing so through open public meetings live-streamed on the internet. Let me share some of thethinking behind this review, which is the first of its nature we have undertaken. The Fed isinsulated from short-term political pressures—what is often referred to as our “independence.”Congress chose to insulate the Fed this way because it had seen the damage that often ariseswhen policy bends to short-term political interests. Central banks in major democracies aroundthe world have similar independence.Along with this independence comes the obligation to explain clearly what we are doing and whywe are doing it, so that the public and their elected representatives in Congress can hold usaccountable. But real accountability demands more of us than clear explanation: We must listen.We must actively engage those we serve to understand how we can more effectively andfaithfully use the powers they have entrusted to us. That is why we are formally and publiclyopening our decisionmaking to suggestions, scrutiny, and critique. With unemployment low, theeconomy growing, and inflation near our symmetric 2 percent objective, this is a good time toundertake such a review.Another factor motivating the review is that the challenges of monetary policymaking havechanged in a fundamental way in recent years. Interest rates are lower than in the past, and likelyto remain so. The persistence of lower rates means that, when the economy turns down, interestrates will more likely fall close to zero—their effective lower bound (ELB). Proximity to the ELBposes new problems to central banks and calls for new ideas. We hope to benefit from the bestthinking on these issues.At the heart of the review are our Fed Listens events, which include town hall–style meetings inall 12 Federal Reserve Districts. These meetings bring together people with wide-rangingperspectives, interests, and expertise. We also want to benefit from the insights of leadingeconomic researchers. We recently held a conference at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicagothat combined research presentations by top scholars with roundtable discussions amongleaders of organizations that serve union workers, low- and moderate-income communities,small businesses, and people struggling to find work.We have been listening. What have we heard? Scholars at the Chicago event offered a range ofviews on how well our monetary policy tools have effectively promoted our dual mandate. Welearned more about cutting-edge ways to measure job market conditions. We heard the latestperspectives on what financial and trade links with the rest of the world mean for the conduct ofmonetary policy. We heard scholarly views on the interplay between monetary policy andfinancial stability. And we heard a review of the clarity and the efficacy of our communications.Like many others at the conference, I was particularly struck by two panels that included peoplewho work every day in low- and middle-income communities. What we heard, loud and clear,was that today’s tight labor markets mean that the benefits of this long recovery are now 1 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
reaching these communities to a degree that has not been felt for many years. We heard ofcompanies, communities, and schools working together to bring employers the productiveworkers they need—and of employers working creatively to structure jobs so that employees cando their jobs while coping with the demands of family and life beyond the workplace. We heardthat many people who, in the past, struggled to stay in the workforce are now getting anopportunity to add new and better chapters to their life stories. All of this underscores howimportant it is to sustain this expansion.The conference generated vibrant discussions. We heard that we are doing many things well,that we have much we can improve, and that there are different views about which is which. Thatdisagreement is neither surprising nor unwelcome. The questions we are confronting aboutmonetary policymaking and communication, particularly those relating to the ELB, are difficultones that have grown in urgency over the past two decades. That is why it is so important thatwe actively seek opinions, ideas, and critiques from people throughout the economy to refine ourunderstanding of how best to use the monetary policy powers Congress has granted us.Beginning soon, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will devote time at its regularmeetings to assess the lessons from these events, supported by analysis by staff from aroundthe Federal Reserve System. We will publicly report the conclusions of our discussions, likelyduring the first half of next year. In the meantime, anyone who is interested in learning more canfind information on the Federal Reserve Board’s website.Let me turn now from the longer-term issues that are the focus of the review to the nearer-termoutlook for the economy and for monetary policy. So far this year, the economy has performedreasonably well. Solid fundamentals are supporting continued growth and strong job creation,keeping the unemployment rate near historic lows. Although inflation has been running somewhatbelow our symmetric 2 percent objective, we have expected it to pick up, supported by solidgrowth and a strong job market. Along with this favorable picture, we have been mindful of someongoing crosscurrents, including trade developments and concerns about global growth. Whenthe FOMC met at the start of May, tentative evidence suggested these crosscurrents weremoderating, and we saw no strong case for adjusting our policy rate.Since then, the picture has changed. The crosscurrents have reemerged, with apparentprogress on trade turning to greater uncertainty and with incoming data raising renewedconcerns about the strength of the global economy. Our contacts in business and agriculturereport heightened concerns over trade developments. These concerns may have contributed tothe drop in business confidence in some recent surveys and may be starting to show through toincoming data. For example, the limited available evidence we have suggests that investment bybusinesses has slowed from the pace earlier in the year.Against the backdrop of heightened uncertainties, the baseline outlook of my FOMC colleagues,like that of many other forecasters, remains favorable, with unemployment remaining nearhistoric lows. Inflation is expected to return to 2 percent over time, but at a somewhat slowerpace than we foresaw earlier in the year. However, the risks to this favorable baseline outlookappear to have grown.Last week, my FOMC colleagues and I held our regular meeting to assess the stance ofmonetary policy. We did not change the setting for our main policy tool, the target range for thefederal funds rate, but we did make significant changes in our policy statement. Since thebeginning of the year, we had been taking a patient stance toward assessing the need for anypolicy change. We now state that the Committee will closely monitor the implications of incominginformation for the economic outlook and will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion, with astrong labor market and inflation near its symmetric 2 percent objective.The question my colleagues and I are grappling with is whether these uncertainties will continueto weigh on the outlook and thus call for additional policy accommodation. Many FOMC1 2 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
participants judge that the case for somewhat more accommodative policy has strengthened.But we are also mindful that monetary policy should not overreact to any individual data point orshort-term swing in sentiment. Doing so would risk adding even more uncertainty to the outlook.We will closely monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and willact as appropriate to sustain the expansion.

Guo Shuqing: Opening remarks - 11th Lujiazui ForumOpening remarks by Mr Guo Shuqing, Party Secretary and Deputy Governor of the People’sBank of China, at the 11th Lujiazui Forum, Shanghai, 14 June 2019.*   *   *Honorable Vice Premier Liu He, Secretary Li Qiang, Chairman Zhou Xiaochuan, ExecutiveDeputy Secretary-General Ding Xuedong, Mayor Ying Yong, Governor Yi Gang, Chairman YiHuiman, Ladies and Gentlemen,Good morning!As the rotating co-chair of this forum, on behalf of the host, I would like to extend a warmwelcome to all of our friends old and new. The annual Lujiazui Forum has been held successfullyten times. We are glad to see that, Shanghai has been accelerating its steps in establishing aninternational financial center, amazing the world with its great achievements. In the future, thecentral financial regulator will continue with its support for the opening-up and reform ofShanghai, trying the upmost to do whatever we can do. Yesterday, the Shanghai municipalleaders criticized me for not coming here very often. I regret that it’s true. But, as long as our VicePremier Liu grants an approval, as soon as tomorrow I would move my office to Pudong.Currently, the financial system of China operates soundly, and thus provides solid guarantee forthe comprehensive deepening of reforms and the high-quality development of the Chineseeconomy. Under the leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at thecore, and in line with the overall arrangements of the Financial Stability and DevelopmentCommittee under the State Council, the financial system firmly implements the new developmentphilosophy, vigorously promotes the supply-side structural reform, continuously optimizes theinstitutional system, market system and product system, and strives to provide the real economyand our people with more effective financial services of a better quality. In this process, thefollowing aspects need to be highlighted.First, financial institutions must remain committed to the customer-oriented operating philosophy.In 1978, China had aggregate financial assets of less than RMB200 billion, and saw an acuteshortage of financial products. Today, the aggregate financial assets have exceeded RMB400trillion. Despite this, financial institutions still have a long way to go in customer service andmarket segmentation. Fifteen years ago when we started introducing the shareholding system inlarge-sized state-owned banks, the hardest task was to eliminate the “bureaucratic way ofhandling commerce”. In 2005, some experts from American banks came to help us reform bankoutlets. For weeks, they went to the same savings agency, patiently asked every customer aboutthe services they received, and put down every detail of the transactions. Our colleagues wereconfused, with some even mocking the Americans for being unwise and rigid. However, whenthe experts presented their accurate analysis reports, everyone was astonished. After that, ourcolleagues not only consult their American counterparts, but think about improvements on theirown initiative. As a result, the business processes of Chinese banks gradually approach the SixSigma method, and their productivity got close to or even surpassed that of the world’s top-notchbanks. Today, availing ourselves of such information technologies as the Internet, artificialintelligence, and big data, China’s financial institutions continuously witness revolutionarychanges in their technological capabilities, and product development is conducted at a paceincreasingly closer to that of the world’s leading institutions. However, to offer effective financialservices and to build Shanghai into a world financial center, most crucially, financial institutionsmust put the interests and concerns of customers in the first place.Second, more efforts should be made to develop more specialized and personalized financialinstitutions. China has over 5,000 licensed financial institutions, and tens of thousands of 1 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
unlicensed institutions engaging in quasi-financial businesses. However, compared withdeveloped countries, the penetration rate of banks, the depth and density of insurancebusinesses, and the influence of the capital market in China all remain at a very low level.Financial institutions are less diversified in classification, unreasonable in distribution, andindistinct in characteristics. Moreover, the phenomena of “excessive competition” and “serviceblank” coexist. With the new developments of Fintech, it is by no means feasible to simply copythe development path of other countries in terms of industrial pattern, profitability model, andcorporate structure. Instead, we should work to both increase the number of financial institutionsand improve the level of their quality. We should support small and medium-sized institutionsserving communities and small and micro businesses (SMBs), and encourage the practice ofthe spirits of “collecting data street by street” and “walking into villages and households”; supportspecialized and dedicated financial enterprises, and encourage them to form distinct corporateculture appropriate for their main businesses; and support all kinds of distinctive financialinstitutions that can closely integrate offline and online businesses and combine traditional andmodern features. In this process, we warmly welcome the involvement of overseas financialinstitutions with a further opening-up of China’s banking, insurance, securities, and trust sectors.We especially welcome experienced asset management institutions, along with domesticcounterparts, to raise RMB capital and invest in the RMB-denominated securities market.Third, the financing market system must be better suited to the life cycle of enterprises.Enterprises in different development stages have financing needs different in nature and feature.Venture capital suits the financing feature of startups; bank credit is more favorable forenterprises at the growth stage; and bonds, stocks, and other direct financing tools are of greatimportance to relatively mature businesses. By structure, bank credit accounts for over 80% ofthe aggregate financing, while equity financing makes up no more than 10%. Basically speaking,the bond market is a quasi-credit market with a lack of depth where commercial banks are majorplayers, bond products are characterized by poor variety and the transaction scenario remainsless lively. Meanwhile, due to excessive reliance on banks, enterprises cannot well match theirlife cycle with production cycle. As a result, the large and medium-sized enterprises are likely tosqueeze others out and excessively occupy credit resources, whereas SMBs and innovation-driven enterprises may have difficulties in securing necessary financial support in the hatchingstage. Therefore, on the basis of a strong consensus, financial regulators and enterprises mustwork concertedly to develop China’s capital market and completely change the imbalancebetween direct financing and indirect financing.Fourth, measures should be taken to establish and improve a corporate governance structurewith Chinese characteristics. Unsound corporate governance has always been an intrinsicproblem in China’s economy, as enormous losses have been caused by major shareholders’manipulation in some institutions and insider control in some others. Since the vast majority offinancial institutions are, by nature, strongly correlated with public interests, the financialinstitutions should place more emphasis on corporate governance structure. We should makecontinued efforts to establish a modern corporate system and enhance Party leadership, so asto set up a mechanism of proactive cooperation and mutual restrictions between institutions ofcorporate governance. We should also carry out the Hangzhou Summit Declaration to ensureprior implementation of the G20-OECD corporate governance consensus in the financial sector.Fifth, sufficiently harsh punishment should be promptly imposed on violators of laws andregulations. For some time, some institutions have disclosed false information, manipulated thequality categorization of assets, and even recklessly falsified accounts, which undermined thecredibility of the financial sector. These problems can be attributed to a number of reasons, yetthe principal ones include the failure in implementing capital rules, unsound corporategovernance, feeble market control, and negligent oversight and law enforcement. The low cost ofviolating rules and regulations can only result in further trampling on laws. Therefore, regulatorsmust have the courage to fight, to ensure strict enforcement of laws, and to resolutely safeguardthe sanctity of laws. For more than two years, the banking and insurance regulators have been 2 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
seriously dealing with institutions accountable for violating laws and regulations, imposingpenalties of more than 8,000 person/times, and confiscating more than RMB6 billion fromrelevant institutions. A series of stringent regulatory measures have been taken to crack down onfalsified asset categorization and accounting fraud, and more than RMB4 trillion of nonperformingloans have been disposed of.Sixth, we should be determined to change the distribution of financial assets. At present, China’sbank savings deposits amount to over RMB78.7 trillion, and asset management products, whichare essentially similar to bank deposits, total more than RMB60 trillion. In addition, we have anequally considerable sum of corporate deposits and enormous idle funds in the society. How totransform such funds into long-term stable sources of investment capital through institutionalinvestors, is an important yet urgent issue that must be addressed. We should vigorouslydevelop various institutional investors including publicly offered funds, privately offered funds,insurers, trusts, and wealth management companies. In this way, we can change the investorcomposition dominated by retail investors and foster a market atmosphere favorable to long-terminvestment and value investing, while raising the scale of stable funds in the market as well asthe efficiency of investment conversion. In terms of pension funds, we can draw on theexperience of other countries to construct three pillars, namely basic social security funds,enterprise annuities, and commercial insurance, in a bid to raise the scale of China’s pensionfunds in the capital market to the world average.Seventh, we must firmly prevent the resurgence of structurally complex products. China boaststhe largest new capital inputs among all economies in the world, but it is a challenging task toraise the efficiency of fund utilization. The key is to avoid the diversion of investment out of thereal economy and to continuously clean up funds which circulate solely within the financialsector. For more than two years, we have remained committed to rectification of marketirregularities and dismantled shadow banks, achieving a net reduction of RMB13.74 trillion ofhigh-risk assets, consequently shortening the financing chain and lowering financing costs.Currently, there are signs of relaxed regulation in the world that promote resurgence of shadowbanks, which requires us to be ever vigilant. The diversion of investment out of the real economyand multi-layer nested investment in China’s financial sector had been among the most severe ofthe kind, so we must prevent a replay of the past.Eighth, we must face up to the problem of the financialization of real estate in some parts ofChina. In recent years, the leverage ratios of the household sector in some Chinese cities haverisen rapidly, and the debt ratios of a considerable proportion of households have reached anunsustainable level. More seriously, around half of the new savings resources are invested intothe real estate sector. The excessive financing of the real estate sector not only crowds outcredit resources of other industries, but also encourages investment speculation in the sectorand causes a bigger bubble. When you buy a house to live in, it means you will have an incomeof market rent and an equal amount of expenditure each month, which also means that yourhouse generates the equal amount of added value; when you buy another house to rent out, youwill also have income and output; however, when you buy a house solely for investment orspeculation, rather than for rental income, it will be just a pile of unused cement, bars, and bricks.Real estate is marked by regional differentials, and it is normal that housing prices rise and fall indifferent regions. Nevertheless, “housing is for living in, not for speculation.” History has provedthat every country relying excessively on real estate for economic prosperity would eventually paya heavy price. All residents and enterprises relying on blind investment and speculation in realestate to manage money will eventually find that it is really not cost-efficient.At present, the Chinese economy is at a crucial stage of transformation and upgrading andstructural reform, and the transition from old to new drivers of growth keeps accelerating. Ascontinuous improvement has been made to the financial sector’s capability in serving the realeconomy, funds injected by the banking and insurance sector into businesses grew rapidly, and,in particular, loans issued to manufacturing and high-tech industries and private enterprises 3 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
rebounded significantly, relieving the difficulties that SMBs face in accessing affordable financing.By end-May, inclusive financial loans issued by the five major banks to SMBs grew 23.7%compared to the end of last year, fulfilling the majority of their full-year plan. The average interestrate was 4.79%, reporting a decline of 0.65 percentage point compared to the full year rate forlast year. Meanwhile, the banking and insurance sectors have been fully cooperating with localgovernments on the issuance of general bonds and special bonds, earnestly implementingdecisions and plans made by the state to provide financing support for projects launched tobolster weak spots in infrastructure construction. We believe that, through the deepening supply-side structural reform to expand effective domestic demand, the effects of various impedimentswill be offset for certain. The Chinese economy and financial sector is surely to achievesustained, healthy, and steady growth!These ideas are only presented for your reference.To conclude, I wish this forum a complete success.Thank you! 4 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
   9TH ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING OF GHANA ASSOCIATION OF SAVINGS AND LOANS COMPANIES    ADDRESS BY MRS. ELSIE ADDO AWAZDI   SECOND DEPUTY GOVERNOR BANK OF GHANA     THE COCONUT GROOVE REGENCY HOTEL, RIDGE, ACCRA JUNE 20, 2019    
 1  Mr. Chairman,  Executives of the Ghana Association of Savings and Loans Companies (GHASALC),  CEOs/Managing Directors of Member Institutions, and other financial institutions, Executives of other industry associations, Invited Guests,  Distinguished Ladies and Gentlemen,  1. Good Morning and thank you for the opportunity to join you at this 9th Annual General Meeting of the GHASALC. Almost a decade after its establishment, this Association has become a recognised voice for its member institutions, and we at the Bank of Ghana always welcome the opportunity to dialogue with GHASALC and its membership.     2. The chosen theme “Business Sustainability: A Shared responsibility” could not be more appropriate in the times we are in. Sustainability of businesses is critical, if we are going to achieve the socio-economic growth we need to move this country forward. Savings and loans companies, like other deposit-taking institutions, exist to intermediate savings in order that businesses and other economic actors can obtain access to much-needed funds to meet their legitimate needs. Savings and loans companies are therefore a major enabler 
 2  of sustainable businesses and must understand how this role, if well played, can provide a boost for overall socio-economic growth and development. What is more, I need not remind you that savings and loans companies are themselves businesses and must therefore be sustainable in order to be able to support their customers and the entire economy. As a nation, the future of our economy and the wellbeing of our people depends to a large extent on the safety and soundness of individual financial institutions, and by extension, the sustainability of the whole sector. It is therefore imperative that we stakeholders work together towards building strong and sustainable financial institutions for our common good as a people.          3. We have unfortunately seen the recent demise of a number of banks and microfinance institutions, owing to weak capitalisation, unsustainable business models, poor corporate governance, poor compliance with regulatory requirements, default on contractual obligations, among others, that ultimately led to their insolvency and eventual collapse. Let me be clear that businesses fail for all kinds of reasons, but the weaknesses I have outlined above undoubtedly leave any business vulnerable and unable to withstand shocks, making collapse inevitable. Indeed, several corporate failures around the world have been associated with weak compliance. Examples of failed businesses, such as the Medici Bank that collapsed in Italy in 1494, the failure of over a thousand savings and loans companies in the United States in the 1980s and 1990s, the failure of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International 
 3  in 1991, Barings Bank in 1995, and more recent banking failures in the U.S, the EU, and Nigeria, were all associated with poor corporate governance and a culture of weak regulatory compliance. For financial institutions especially, trust and confidence are critical and once lost, business sustainability becomes difficult. As the saying goes, trust comes on foot but bolts on horseback.   4. The focus of this AGM on building sustainable businesses, is therefore timely. Now is a good time to assess the current state of the Savings and Loans (S & L) subsector, with the view to building sustainable business models to the benefit of all stakeholders and the broader economy.   5. Ladies and Gentlemen, as I said earlier, financial intermediation is central to economic growth and poverty alleviation. This intermediation role is played by both the banking sector and other savings and deposit taking institutions in the economy. Within our financial sector, S & L companies and other lower-tier financial services companies are expected to provide financial access to the rather large informal sector which is mostly characterized by the unbanked and underserved population. Financial access to this segment of the society not only helps in improving livelihoods, but also contributes positively to the sustainable development of the country.   6. Within the Ghanaian context, therefore, the potential role of S&Ls in financial intermediation cannot be overemphasized. It is however important to note that intermediation thrives on trust and confidence in the financial system. The security of funds entrusted to all financial institutions demands that they 
 4  are governed and managed in a sound and prudent manner to preserve the confidence of depositors and investors. This also implies that all deposit taking institutions must adhere to good corporate governance practices and build strong risk management systems to safeguard the stability of the financial sector.   7. Mr. Chairman, Ghana’s Savings and Loans sub-sector is made up of some 39 companies as at the end of March 2019, and dominates the Specialised Deposit-Taking Institutions (SDI) sector, accounting for 44.6 percent of total SDI assets. In March 2019, total assets of the sector increased to GH¢7,977.63 million, up from GH¢6,548.63 million a year earlier.   8. Mr. Chairman, despite the growth in total assets, some S & L companies continue to be faced with poor asset quality, solvency and liquidity challenges. Indeed, as regulators, we have observed some worrying trends which require the attention of all stakeholders. In addition to liquidity and solvency issues, several financial soundness indicators of the industry have adversely deviated from accepted statutory and prudential benchmarks. These outcomes are primarily due to the business models adopted by some (not all) S&Ls, by essentially attracting term-deposit funding at unsustainably-high costs and deploying such funding into risky assets without adequate risk management systems to manage and monitor the inherent risk exposures. Poor credit underwriting practices, poor loan recoveries, insider dealings and related party transactions, weak governance and concentration in ownership structures 
 5  among others, have all contributed to the capital illiquidity and solvency challenges in the S&L sector.   9. What is more, some institutions within the S&L sub-sector shifted from financing the lower-tier retail end of the market towards financing the wholesale end, or simply placing funds with other S&Ls. These practices have increased concentration risks in the sector, which impact negatively on financial stability.   10. Given these challenges in the sector, I must commend the GHASALC for spearheading efforts to re-evaluate and realign the business models of its member institutions, at this Annual General Meeting. This will help improve to reposition the sector and regain the trust and confidence of the public.    11. I urge the Executives of this Association to continue to lead the process of reengineering this sector, and in so doing, to help to refocus the business models of its members towards realigning themselves with the policy objective of financial inclusion for which savings and loans licences were issued. I would also urge you to collectively work towards finding the balance between profit-making and protection of depositor funds, underpinned by strong corporate governance, prudent business practices, and high ethical standards. Investments in appropriate technology and good human resources are also critical to helping the sector reposition itself to drive financial inclusion, improve efficiency and lower transaction costs for S&Ls and their customers.  
 6   12. Ladies and Gentlemen, it is only such steps are taken that we can expect to see a sustainable savings and loans sector, as well as a sustainable private sector supported poised to be the engine of Ghana’s socio-economic growth and development.  13. Distinguished Ladies and Gentlemen, making the Savings and Loans sector sustainable is indeed a shared responsibility and we must all work to improve the sector’s performance within Ghana’s financial structure. As your regulator, the Bank of Ghana remains committed to ensuring that S & L companies are safe and sound, and that together the sector as a whole is resilient and does not pose risks for the wider financial system. We count on the support of the Association as we take steps in this direction and we will continue to dialogue with the Association to explore how this sector is repositioned going forward.      14. On this note, let me thank you all once again for the invitation and wish you fruitful deliberations at the Annual General Meeting.   15. Thank you for your kind attention.  
      2 The Terrace, PO Box 2498, Wellington 6140, New Zealand  Telephone 64 4 472 2029 Online at www.rbnz.govt.nz             Renewing the RBNZ’s approach to financial stability    A speech delivered to 15th Financial Markets Law Conference in Auckland  On 26 June 2019 (2:10pm)  By Geoff Bascand, Deputy Governor & Head of Operations        
 2  Ref #8022722 v2.0   Renewing the RBNZ’s approach to financial stability   Good afternoon, it’s good to be here today. I’m going to talk about the Reserve Bank’s role in ensuring financial stability and how our approach to prudential regulation and supervision is evolving in line with our own, and society’s, risk tolerance.1  You’ll hear me talk about how the Bank’s approach is expanding and becoming more intensive, so that we are more active in addressing vulnerabilities in the financial sector. This is in response to our own experience, and a publicly identified need in formal reviews of our approach.2 We are building our capabilities to undertake deeper analysis of risks to the financial system and shift to a more intensive supervisory model. It’s a busy time at the Bank as we also undertake with Treasury a fundamental review of the statutory framework for delivering financial stability. The government has announced in-principle decisions to modernise how the Reserve Bank is governed and its objectives, powers and regulatory perimeter. These decisions strengthen our financial stability focus and set the foundations for enhanced performance, capability and accountability of our financial stability functions. Our ‘soundness and efficiency’ objective is to be replaced with an explicit financial stability objective. The single decision-maker model is to be replaced with a governance board responsible for financial policy. And the artificial distinction between banks and non-bank deposit takers is set to be removed.  Meanwhile, we are reviewing key aspects of the regulatory system, for example upgrading the capital framework for banks and commencing a review of insurance legislation and solvency standards, while the government has declared its intention to introduce deposit insurance. These significant developments raise the question: how do the different parts of our financial stability regime fit together?  Answering that question is not easy – financial stability is complex and we use a large number of tools to promote it. And there is no single, quantifiable numerical target like the inflation target for monetary policy. Hopefully on conclusion of my speech you will have a greater understanding of the Reserve Bank’s role and where we are heading in terms of how the components of our regulatory and supervisory regime fit together.  First I’ll outline why financial stability is important, the risks to the financial system and the market failures that create the need for regulation and supervision. Next I’ll set out the Bank’s role, alongside regulated entities and other agencies, in supporting a dynamic and sustainable financial system and economy. Finally I’ll focus on the Bank’s approach to financial stability, and the outlook in terms of regulation, supervision, strategy and the ongoing modernisation of the Reserve Bank, before covering off some recent announcements that will change the way we work.                                                   1 I am very grateful to Piers Ovenden for considerable assistance in the preparation of this speech, along with valuable comments from other Reserve Bank colleagues. 2 For example the IMF’s FSAP recommendations. 
 3  Ref #8022722 v2.0   Part 1 – Why we regulate and supervise Financial stability is important The financial system has a critical role in supporting economic activity. Households and businesses need avenues for saving and credit to fund consumption and investment, payment systems to facilitate local and international transactions, and insurance to manage their risks.  In order to facilitate economic growth, the public need to be confident that banks, non-bank deposit takers (NBDTs) and insurers can and will continue to provide these services, and that the payment and settlement systems will work as expected. The continued and reliable provision of financial services to the economy is a pre-condition for ensuring that the financial system makes its maximum contribution to the prosperity and wellbeing of all New Zealanders.  Financial stability means having a resilient financial system that can withstand severe but plausible shocks and continue to provide the financial services we all rely on. It is something we tend to take for granted – financial crises have been uncommon in this country. But evidence from a wide range of countries over many decades shows us that when they do happen, crises are damaging with long-lasting effects. They impact businesses and households, with reduced economic activity and lost output. They result in increased unemployment and costs for taxpayers. Not only that, recovery can take over a decade and is often halting in nature.  Put another way, financial instability creates inefficiency and waste on a large scale. Reducing the likelihood and severity of these episodes is therefore at the heart of our mission. Our aim is for New Zealand to have a dynamic and efficient financial system that contributes to a sustainable and productive economy.  The financial system is exposed to risks… Risks to financial stability come from a wide range of sources. External – New Zealand’s financial system is heavily reliant on external funding, which makes us vulnerable to dislocation in overseas funding markets. Domestic – risks related to lending to our dairy industry and to our already highly indebted households. And our most recent Financial Stability Report notes the risks from technology disruptions, misconduct and cybercrime, insurance affordability and climate change.  We also have to consider the vulnerabilities of our financial system. It is relatively small, and is dominated by a handful of institutions that have similar underlying business models. That means the distress or failure of one of the major institutions is likely to have significant implications for the system as a whole.  And we have to remain alert to new risks. History tells us that there are a wide variety of triggers for financial instability. Every financial crisis is different.  …and is subject to market failures Financial stability is a common resource that benefits us all. But because it is a common resource, it is also prone to the tragedy of the commons – the risk that it is abused and degraded by individual agents who do not have the right incentives to look after it, or at least to internalise the cost that instability imposes on others. Viewed through this lens, 
 4  Ref #8022722 v2.0   maintaining financial stability depends on market participants being willing and able to identify, price, allocate and manage their risks appropriately.3  Information asymmetries – where one party to a transaction knows more than the other – exacerbate this free-riding problem. Small retail savers are likely to find it difficult to detect and price for higher risk-taking at a financial institution, although wholesale investors will exert discipline. In addition there are factors that limit the incentive for financial institutions to internalise the costs to society of a financial crisis. For example, moral hazard can result if institutions believe the taxpayer will bail them out in the event of a crisis. The larger the scale of this distortion, the greater the risk to financial stability and the greater the risk to other regulated entities, investors, depositors and ultimately taxpayers.  These structural market failures tend to be reinforced by behavioural factors. It is well recognised that individually rational people make decisions on the basis of other people’s credit and risk assessments.4 This herd behaviour can create market momentum that drives the price away from the underlying risks and returns. In the absence of objective information about the fundamental economic value of an asset or trade, this reinforces the mis-pricing of risk.  Alongside herd behaviour, add myopic decision making and irrational exuberance and we are well on our way to boom-bust cycles. If asset prices rise, people borrow more and invest more heavily in that asset class. For a time, this becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. However this also increases the risk of contagion and fire sale dynamics once market sentiment turns. As I said, financial stability is complex.  Part 2 – The Reserve Bank’s role  The importance of financial stability as a common resource and the risks and market failures that it is prone to, create the need for prudential regulation and supervision. Nonetheless there is an important role for both the regulator and the regulated in ensuring that the financial stability regime is operating effectively as intended.   The three pillars remain relevant…  The three, inter-dependent, pillars of self-, market- and regulatory discipline remain relevant to our role as prudential regulator. Our regulatory actions do not occur in a vacuum, and there is an important role for regulated entities and market participants in supporting financial stability.  Market discipline refers to the influence that market participants have on a regulated entity’s behaviour and risk-taking, where influence is exerted by market participants changing the cost or amount of funding they are willing to provide based on financial and other information about the entity. In a functioning market this creates an incentive for regulated entities to manage their risks appropriately. Transparency initiatives, such as the Financial Strength Dashboard and mandatory disclosure statements support market discipline5.  Self-discipline refers to a regulated entity’s own processes and risk management frameworks, the responsibility for which lie primarily with its directors and senior managers. It                                                 3 See Orr, A, ‘Towards a framework for promoting financial stability in New Zealand’, March 2006,  https://www.rbnz.govt.nz/research-and-publications/speeches/2006/speech2006-03-22  4 See Orr (2006). 5 As noted earlier, market discipline works best at the wholesale level, and is less meaningful for ‘Mom and Pop’ savers. 
 5  Ref #8022722 v2.0   remains the starting point of the Reserve Bank’s supervisory philosophy. However as the conduct and culture review, the Reserve Bank’s attestation review, and various regulatory incidents demonstrate, we cannot assume that it is operating as intended and that self-discipline is effective.   Even when market and self-discipline are effective, they are not enough on their own because of market failures.6 Regulatory discipline – the imposition of requirements on regulated entities – is necessary to improve the effectiveness of market and self-discipline, and to minimise the costs of that could be visited on the financial stability commons. Our role as regulator means setting robust requirements that are fit for purpose – that address risks and market failures at source, taking into account the costs of regulation and of supervision on our regulated entities and the wider economy.  Setting rigorous but not too stringent requirements is our challenge, informed by research, experience and feedback.7 We need to understand New Zealanders’ appetite for risk, analyse the costs and benefits of regulatory requirements, and have processes for decision-making that provide confidence that in high quality decisions being made.   …and we do not run a zero failure regime  Achieving financial stability does not mean eliminating all risks. This would create inefficiencies of its own – it would potentially stifle new entrants, and remove the incentives for growth, innovation and healthy risk-taking. So we do not run a zero failure regime. Allowing institutions to fail provides the incentives for self- and market-discipline to operate effectively.   However, in order to allow individual institutions to fail we need a robust financial system that can continue to function even when individual entities are experiencing distress or failure. In those situations the Bank is tasked with minimising the impact of distress or failure of an institution on the financial system and the economy.   Our role is dynamic  By necessity our role is a dynamic. The financial system is constantly evolving, as are the risks and challenges. This means that establishing baseline standards is not a set-and-forget exercise. Our requirements and expectations of regulated entities continue to evolve. While it is impossible to predict the future, it is incumbent upon us, when we do impose requirements and set expectations, to think about their effect, and how they might be adapted, in different states of the world.  We monitor the financial system… We continuously monitor the financial system in order to identify and assess:  • Structural risks: ever-present risks related to the composition of the financial system, in terms of its institutions, and their assets and funding. New Zealand is exposed to external shocks and standards must recognise these risks and shield the domestic system and economy.  • Emerging risks: risks related to traditional areas of focus like credit or funding risks, or to new and emerging technologies or to climate change. We are particularly                                                 6 Fiennes, T, ‘New Zealand’s evolving approach to prudential supervision’, September 2016, https://www.rbnz.govt.nz/research-and-publications/speeches/2016/speech2016-09-01 7 See Bascand, G, ‘Financial Stability – risky, safe or just right?’, November 2018,  https://www.rbnz.govt.nz/news/2018/11/financial-stability-risky-safe-or-just-right. 
 6  Ref #8022722 v2.0   focused on innovation that presents risks to the regulatory perimeter – whether institutions are operating inside or outside our supervisory and regulatory reach, and whether this is appropriate.  • Cyclical risks: the risk that boom-bust cycles are amplified by, and to the detriment of, the financial system, due to the procyclicality of credit and asset price growth, when the failure of participants to account for the broader economic and social costs of their actions is exaggerated.  We publish our assessment of risks in the Financial Stability Report both to increase awareness and so that institutions can adapt and develop resilience, and improve their self-discipline.  Supervision has a key role to play both in helping us understand risks to individual institutions, and question whether banks are managing those risks adequately. Our thematic reviews, where we delve into the detail of specific issues, help us and our regulated entities better understand specific risks. Our periodic stress testing, where we subject individual institutions to a significant yet plausible downturn in the economy and distressed funding markets, help us to understand the system’s resilience to macro risks.       …enhance the resilience of the financial system… We enhance the resilience of the financial system by establishing rigorous baseline requirements and ensuring these are complied with through supervision. Our baseline requirements address enduring and identifiable sources of risk to the financial system, with the aim of achieving resilience to most probable shocks or adverse events. We then adapt our regulatory and supervisory approach to reflect newly emerging and/or cyclical risks and the impact they could have on the financial system.  Monitor the financial systemEnhance the resilience of the financial systemManage distress or failureIdentify and monitor risks; support effective self and market discipline Establish rigorous baseline requirements, and adapt as necessary Minimise the costs of institutional distress or failure  Financial stability approach 
 7  Ref #8022722 v2.0   For example, we require banks to meet prescribed capital and liquidity ratios to minimise the risk of insolvency due to sudden losses or a disruption in funding markets (We have been consulting on whether baseline requirements should be set to ensure solvency of the banking system in all but the rarest occasions (a 1:200 year event) or only sufficient for something more frequent). If cyclical risks become excessively heightened we can enhance resilience by increasing capital and/or liquidity ratios. We can tighten loan-to-value ratio (LVR) restrictions if we are concerned about banks’ lending standards and the growth of household credit together with the risk of a correction in the housing market.   Our regulatory requirements aim to support effective self and market discipline by providing a basis for directors and the market to assess the well-being of individual institutions. Again, supervision has a key role to play, in verifying that regulated entities are complying with regulations and that self and market discipline are operating as intended.   …and manage the impact of distress or failure Prevention is best, and most of our effort is focused there. Nevertheless, despite our efforts to monitor and enhance the resilience of the financial system, institutions may become distressed and even fail. This means we need to be well placed, in terms of information and regulatory tools, to manage these events if and when they do occur.  Supervision is crucial in helping us understand the balance sheets, operations and the risks facing institutions. This means working closely with firms on their recovery and resolution plans and having a clearly articulated ladder of supervisory intervention.  The Reserve Bank also stands ready to act as the lender of last resort in situations where a liquidity shortfall threatens the viability of solvent banks and causes a significant tightening in credit supply.  And a new element of our resolution framework is being proposed. The government has stated its intention to introduce a deposit protection regime that, in the event of failure of a deposit taking institution, would provide that deposits in the range of $30,000- $50,000 were insured. While protecting bank customers and taxpayers, this could make it easier to close down a failing institution, sharpen incentives on wholesale investors to exert market discipline, and help reduce the likelihood of financial instability through ‘runs’ on banks. The Reserve Bank is uniquely placed… As a full service central bank we are uniquely placed to fulfil our role in maintaining financial stability. That means that, alongside our regulatory and supervisory function, we undertake monetary policy, we oversee payment and settlement systems, and we stand ready to use our markets functions to provide liquidity in exceptional circumstances.  We also have a role in promoting a vibrant and healthy financial ecosystem. This relies on the input of a wide range of stakeholders, regulators and regulated, as well as the consumers and businesses who rely on the financial system. As a member of the Council of Financial Regulators, we work with Treasury, the FMA, the Commerce Commission and the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment to identify, manage and address issues, risks and gaps in the financial system, so that it is both safe and efficient. We welcome the ten year review of New Zealand’s capital markets by the FMA and NZX.8 Capital markets are a key component of a sound and efficient financial system – they                                                 8 NZX and the FMA have initiated an industry-led review of New Zealand’s capital markets.

 8  Ref #8022722 v2.0   diversify the funding sources that businesses rely on, and they perform a crucial function in regulated entities identifying, pricing, allocating and managing risk appropriately. That is more likely to occur when capital markets are liquid and accurately capture the fundamental value of assets.  Part 3 – Our approach to financial stability Our approach to financial stability is expanding and becoming more intensive, in terms of both regulation and supervision. How do we operationalise our financial stability role, and what aspects of this role are changing?   Our regulatory approach We choose the appropriate regulatory tool to address the identified risk to financial stability, bearing in mind efficiency costs, the level of effective self and market discipline, and the regulatory framework as a whole. Our requirements are complementary, with some substitutability at the margin – we view them as a package. And as I mentioned earlier, our baseline settings are not set-and-forget, we adapt them as risks and the resilience of the financial system evolve.  We are bolstering the regulatory pillar through a wide range of initiatives. Most notably we are consulting on a material increase in bank capital requirements. Bank capital is a crucially important component of the regulatory framework for banks. ‘Skin in the game’ reinforces self-discipline – the responsibility on boards and senior managers to manage and disclose risks appropriately. Our proposals reflect our experience and the evidence on the consequences of financial crises.   However, capital is not a complete mitigant. Our other initiatives reflect that banks can fail for many reasons. And it is not efficient to require banks to hold more and more capital in order to address all the different sources of risk. That’s why we have a range of policies that aim to address potential problems at source. For example, liquidity standards are important in ensuring banks can meet their cash flow demands; outsourcing requirements are needed so that banks can continue to operate in a situation where a key service provider fails; and macroprudential interventions may be necessary during periods of excessive credit and asset price growth.  Other regulatory initiatives include new legislation to grant us more extensive powers to supervise FMIs. Given our dependence on payment and settlement systems, their lightweight regulation and supervision is a crucial vulnerability. We are working with banks and other stakeholders on a new mortgage bond standard, which will provide banks with an additional funding source, as well as provide banks and investors with a new tradeable instrument. It will also create a larger pool of standardised and transparent securities that the Reserve Bank can lend against as lender of last resort. Phase 2 of the review of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand Act is looking in more detail at our macroprudential and crisis management tools.  The table below illustrates how our prudential banking tools work together to deliver financial stability. Each of our policies contributes to financial stability by addressing a separate risk, with its own transmission channel. Some are more targeted at prevention (limiting the likelihood of a financial crisis) while others are more targeted at management (mitigating the impact of a crisis if it does occur).                                                 https://www.fma.govt.nz/news-and-resources/media-releases/nzx-and-fma-initiate-industry-review-capital-markets-2029/

 10  Ref #8022722 v2.0   There may, at the margin, be some substitutability between our different regulatory tools and settings. However, as I’ve said, our regulatory tools are intended to be complementary. For example, even if we have higher bank capital ratios, LVRs will continue to have a role to play if there is excessive credit growth in household balance sheets.  Our supervisory approach – a tougher stance While a robust regulatory approach gives us confidence in the financial system and its stability, it does not imply a lower level of supervisory intensity or that we can shirk our supervisory role. Our supervisory approach is intended to complement our regulatory approach in terms of its reach, and its intensity.  Supervision plays a key role in monitoring, and deepening our understanding of, the financial system and the risks it faces; in enhancing resilience by verifying that our requirements are operating as intended, and enforcing them as necessary. Supervision provides us with the necessary intelligence to manage the consequences of distress or failure of individual institutions.  Effective self-discipline is the starting point of our supervisory philosophy. Firms must want to achieve good outcomes for their customers and owners, not because regulators wish them to. We aim to leverage the incentives on directors, senior managers and shareholders to improve the soundness of institutions, and by extension the resilience of the system as a whole, as efficiently as possible.  However, our experience over the last decade has been that regulations have not always been well applied or complied with, and that tells us that we cannot rely solely on self-discipline. Crucially, it is not just the fact of non-compliance that concerns us – regulated entities have not been as proactive as we would have liked in identifying and remedying issues before the risks become more significant.  Last year’s conduct and culture review (run jointly with the FMA) highlighted specific shortcomings in governance and risk management at banks and insurers, notably in relation to sales incentives. The court judgement on CBLI’s liquidation stated that “aspects of CBLI’s management had indicated a lack of commercial probity”. And “a lack of candour in dealing with the company’s auditors and the regulator”. More recently we revoked ANZ’s accreditation to model its own operational risk capital requirement because of persistent failures in its controls and attestation process. It is clear that institutional self-discipline has been lacking.  There is therefore a strong case for further increasing the intensity of our supervisory model in line with the recommendations from the IMF’s Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) assessment of New Zealand.10 This applies even if, on paper, individual regulated entities appear to be sound. Banks should expect our more intensive supervisory approach to apply even if capital requirements are increased as a result of the ongoing Capital Review.  Regulated entities can expect our supervision to be more intrusive, in seeking evidence that attestations are merited and verifying compliance, and that we will intervene and enforce our requirements. We will be more pro-active in holding directors and managers to account, particularly in areas where we have already identified shortcomings.  Our regulated population can expect us to continue with our thematic reviews in order to enhance self-discipline and our own understanding of risks. In the near future there will be a                                                 10 See https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/CR/Issues/2017/05/08/New-Zealand-Financial-Sector-Assessment-Program-Financial-System-Stability-Assessment-44886 
 11  Ref #8022722 v2.0   thematic review on banks’ liquidity standards and another on the appointed actuary regime in the insurance sector. We will continue to periodically stress test the banking system.  We are working towards more transparency about how our supervisory response would escalate if institutions come under stress. As part of the Capital Review we have sought feedback on the proposed supervisory consequences for banks if they breach their capital buffers. The starting principle is that our response will vary depending on the extent to which a bank needs to use its capital buffers to absorb losses. A minor breach of the proposed capital buffers would result in increased monitoring and potentially a formal request for the bank to submit a capital plan detailing how it planned to remedy the breach and by when. More significant breaches could result in increasingly restrictive supervisory actions and requirements.  Figure: Stylised escalated supervisory response  We continue to boost core supervisory capability in order to deliver on our supervisory approach. This means more skilled resource but it also means building and maintaining the necessary monitoring and supervisory frameworks, and it means being analytically strong, suitably sceptical, and willing to act. Being clear and up-front on our supervisory approach – on our greater willingness to intervene and to enforce our requirements – is desirable not only in terms of transparency but also accountability. Setting out our approach publicly, which we will do in more detail in coming months, will help build confidence and commitment to our enhanced supervisory model.  A more intensive approach also means working more closely with industry. We are committed to establishing a ‘best regulator-regulated’ relationship; to open, knowledgeable and constructive discussions, recognising that that there can be a divergence of views and interests.   
 12  Ref #8022722 v2.0   Modernising the financial stability framework Our Statement of Intent (released yesterday) outlines how we are implementing our financial stability approach within the Bank. Our vision of ‘great team, best central bank’ means we use and maintain rigorous and up-to-date frameworks for regulatory policy development and supervisory decisions. In doing so we take into account the best theory and evidence available. We act as responsible steward of the rules and policies which we create and apply to regulated entities. We consult openly and are committed to communicating our approach in a timely and accessible manner. We work hard to raise awareness across our regulated populations about our objectives, priorities and expectations. We foster co-operation and mutual trust among our domestic co-regulators, wider stakeholders and global peers. Earlier this week the government announced the ‘in-principle’ decisions to (a) replace the Reserve Bank’s ‘soundness’ and ‘efficiency’ objective with a high-level financial stability objective, (b) establish a new governance board for the Reserve Bank with statutory responsibility for financial policy, (c) merge New Zealand’s two existing prudential regimes for regulating banks and non-bank deposit takers into a single regime, and (d) introduce a deposit insurance scheme. Further changes are being consulted on in the documents just released by Treasury.  The Governor is scheduled to talk on 11 July about the government’s review and what that means for the future of the Reserve Bank and the prosperity and wellbeing of New Zealanders. Financial stability objective The new financial stability objective is consistent with how the Reserve Bank has interpreted its responsibilities to date and with our increasingly intensive approach to regulation and supervision. Financial stability – the soundness or resilience of the financial system – relates directly to the existing purpose of our prudential philosophy and is consistent with our intent to have a dynamic regulatory framework; a framework with rigorous and adaptable baseline standards and a more searching approach to supervision. ‘Financial stability’ has the advantage of clarity, providing a sharp focus for the Reserve Bank, but potentially downplays the importance of efficiency and dynamism that are equally relevant to our over-arching purpose: contributing to a sustainable and productive economy and the prosperity and wellbeing of New Zealanders. Aspects of efficiency – regulatory efficiency and promoting innovation and competition – are expected to be recognised through sub-objectives that are also being consulted on. Increased transparency and accountability for decision-making will also serve to ensure good regulatory decisions are made.  RBNZ Governance board The Reserve Bank will have a new governance board, with statutory responsibility for financial policy. The board will be accountable for all prudential decisions, including regulation, supervision and enforcement, as well as crisis management. It is expected that the board will be able to delegate powers and the exercise of day-to-day functions and powers to the Governor, and in turn Reserve Bank staff (supported by internal committees as at present). The board will set our risk appetite and scrutinise management’s efforts to implement it. The new governance structure supports our vision and objectives of being a transparent and accountable organisation. Not only will the new board bring diversity of perspectives and experience to key decisions, it will set our strategic direction (our risk appetite, our policy frameworks) and explain its decisions and regulatory outcomes to a broad audience, from 
 13  Ref #8022722 v2.0   the Minister of Finance and Treasury, through to regulated entities and the general public. It will also create more robust accountability by creating a clearer distinction between governance and management functions, and establishing a delegation framework.  ADI perimeter  The government’s decision to merge our regimes for regulating banks and non-bank deposit takers into a single regime for deposit takers will create a simpler, more unified regime, more clearly aligned with our financial stability objective. It will minimise duplication and treat similar activities on the same basis, while continuing to allow our risk-based approach to supervision. It will also help future-proof the regime against a shift in lending and deposit-taking activity from banks to finance companies that are currently outside of our banking perimeter, although in a sector as dynamic as the finance industry perimeter issues will never be settled entirely. More work will be required to design the details of this new regime, particularly to ensure that it can be applied proportionately to the biggest Australian-owned bank or the smallest credit union.   Deposit insurance  The government has proposed introducing a depositor insurance scheme with a coverage limit in the range of $30,000 to $50,000. There is still a great deal of detail to work through in terms of how the scheme will be funded and operate but we expect the scheme will complement our role as resolution authority. As we work through the details, we will consider the consequences of the scheme for self- and market-discipline, and the need to adapt other aspects of our regulatory and supervisory framework accordingly.   Part 4 – Conclusion Financial stability is important for New Zealand and all New Zealanders. The cost of a financial crisis would be significant and wide-ranging. Its effects – in terms of lost output and unemployment – would persist, likely for a decade or more. This means focusing not just on risks to our financial system but on the market failures that can exacerbate these risks and undermine financial stability.  The Reserve Bank’s approach to maintaining and promoting financial stability in New Zealand is expanding and becoming more intensive, in terms of both regulation and supervision. We are recalibrating the rules and our enforcement of them. This is in response to our own experience and a publicly perceived need for us to do more, and better.  By necessity our approach is dynamic: we monitor and enhance the resilience of the financial system and intervene in times of crisis in order to manage the fallout. We do this through fit-for-purpose regulation and risk-based supervision. And we do so in a way where each of the moving parts is complementary in creating a financial system that is sound and efficient.  The Reserve Bank is uniquely placed to do this. As a full service central bank we can leverage our different tools and market functions. That means that, not only can we adapt our regulatory or supervisory response as circumstances dictate, we can also use our markets functions to provide liquidity to the financial system at times of stress. We work with other agencies to promote a dynamic and healthy financial system.  We are working hard to set robust requirements that address structural, cyclical and emerging risks in the financial system. Our requirements are not set and forget – we adapt them as vulnerabilities evolve and as risks emerge (and recede). Supervision has a crucial role to play in complementing the regulatory regime, and will continue to intensify. Regulated

The government’s ‘in principle’ decisions to modernise the Reserve Bank and our financial stability framework give us a clearer objective, a simpler perimeter and strengthen resolution options. The new governance framework, with a board responsible for our regulatory and supervisory approaches, will make us more transparent and accountable in how we deliver on our financial stability objective. These and other changes are being consulted on now and I encourage everyone to read the Phase 2 consultation documents on the Treasury’s website and to have their say.11 We are increasing our capability to deliver our approach and our vision for financial stability within this new architecture.  We expect that together these initiatives will provide the basis for a dynamic and efficient financial system that contributes to a sustainable and productive economy and promotes the prosperity and wellbeing of all New Zealanders.                                                   11 See https://treasury.govt.nz/news-and-events/reviews-consultation/reviewing-reserve-bank-act 
Page 1 of 10    Keynote address by Daniel Mminele,  Deputy Governor of the South African Reserve Bank,  at the 2019 BNP Paribas Global Official Institutions Conference   Paris 19 June 2019  The global backdrop and monetary policy in emerging markets  Introduction  Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon.  Thank you to BNP Paribas for allowing me the honour to deliver the opening keynote address at this prestigious gathering of global official institutions.   Also allow me to commend the organisers of this event for their foresight in coming up with diverse and well-balanced topics that have risen to the top of the global agenda.   There is no doubt in my mind that, at the present moment, uncertainty in the global macroeconomic environment, including rising geopolitical uncertainties, elevated trade tensions and rising debt levels, dominate the discussions of most global investors and policymakers.   In my remarks today, I will discuss the implications of these developments for emerging market economies and the possibility of further risk from market volatility, before I conclude by touching on the policy options at our disposal to navigate through these rather turbulent times.   
Page 2 of 10  An uncertain global economic environment  Investors and policymakers alike have had a nervous last few months. It is often said that expansions do not die of old age. Yet, as they lengthen in duration, reaching near-record periods in some cases, observers increasingly worry about whether the trigger of the eventual downturn is already there. Are we in such a case at present?   In his foreword to Global Economic Prospects published earlier this month, World Bank President David Malpass writes that ‘global growth has continued to weaken and momentum remains fragile’1. Compared to its January forecast, the World Bank has this month downgraded its forecast for global growth in 2019 by 0.3 percentage points to 2.6%. Furthermore, it sees only a mild recovery ahead, to 2.8% by 2021. Revisions to this year’s forecasts are broad-based, across both advanced and emerging economies. Private sector consensus forecasts have similarly been scaled down in recent months.  In some countries, a moderation was expected after the strong momentum observed in late 2017 and early 2018. In the United States (US), for instance, economists anticipated that the boost to private spending from the fiscal stimulus of the first half of 2018 would eventually fade. This has indeed happened, although the US economy remained dynamic at the start of 2019, rising by a surprisingly strong 3.1% when annualised, despite a temporary shutdown of government services.   But the deceleration in other countries, amid a slowdown in global trade flows, surprised many by its magnitude. The eurozone slowed from 2.4% in 2017 to 1.8% last year, as weakening exports to Asia, the United Kingdom (UK) and Eastern Europe took a toll on business confidence. The World Bank now only expects a 1.2% increase in the eurozone’s gross domestic product (GDP) this year. China has also lost momentum, as earlier policy tightening curtailed lending by the non-bank financial sector and the tariff increases of 2018 weighed on exports.  By late 2018, these negative economic surprises had reached levels ample enough to trigger a bout of risk aversion in financial markets, which particularly affected equities                                                            1 Media Call on the June 2019 Global Economic Prospects Report, World Bank Group, Washington DC, United States

This tightening, however, proved short-lived, as the continuation of benign (and, in some cases, soft) inflation developments allowed major central banks to pause, or delay, the start of their normalisation process. In the US, in particular, indications by the Federal Reserve (Fed) that it could be patient before making any policy decisions helped equities and corporate bonds to recover their earlier losses.  Nonetheless, many threats to global expansion remain unresolved, and in some cases risks previously identified have begun to materialise. First and foremost among these are the trade tensions between some of the world’s major economies. In the wake of the recent increases in US tariffs on selected Chinese imports, and in light of the potential for broader tariff increases, analysts are already anticipating a bigger drag on global growth from what increasingly looks like a protracted trade conflict. In its most recent Surveillance Note for the G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors, for the meetings in Fukuoka, Japan, 10 days ago, the IMF noted these additional tariffs would “dampen trade and weigh on confidence and financial sentiment, adversely impacting investment and productivity and growth.”   Separately, the UK’s Parliament is struggling to agree on the terms for leaving the European Union, with negative consequences for growth and investment and some spillovers to continental Europe. Financial markets have displayed sensitivity to these developments.  At the same time, a number of geopolitical tensions continue to simmer, especially between Iran, the US and its Middle East allies.  While the G20 observed that global growth appears to be stabilising more recently and may pick up into 2020, downside risks overall are still perceived to be tilted to the downside.   What does this backdrop imply for emerging markets?  Against such a global backdrop, emerging countries are facing conflicting pressures. And the experience of the past 15 months shows that it is not just the monetary policy 
Page 4 of 10  path in the major economies, but also the divergences (or not) between these policies, that can have major consequences for emerging markets.   At first, and for a large part of 2018, an ever-widening growth gap between the US economy and its major partners, coupled with budding trade tensions, boosted the US dollar. The Fed continued to normalise policy rate levels while other major central banks stayed put. The resulting widening in the interest rate divergence in favour of the US contributed to dollar appreciation.   The mix of rising US interest rates, a stronger dollar and overweight investor positions (at the time) in the so-called ‘risky assets’ weighed on the currencies and bonds of those emerging markets that exhibited frail external and fiscal balances. Specifically, financial stress in Argentina and Turkey, amid the need to roll over a large amount of short-term debts and a de-anchoring of inflation expectations, precipitated a sell-off in emerging market assets, although with important differentiation across countries.   The situation changed in the fourth quarter of 2018, when indications of slowing economic activity in the US led financial markets to anticipate lesser tightening by the Fed, resulting in some downward pressure on the dollar and a decline in US Treasury yields. The prevailing mix allowed for some recovery in emerging market assets and a resumption of capital flows to these countries. Additional factors also helped, including the decline in oil prices, the tightening of monetary policy in a large number of emerging countries that had restored wider rate differentials with the advanced economies, and, in several countries, a lesser-than-feared pickup in inflation in response to currency depreciation.  During the early stages of this year, we have seen a significant change in monetary policy forward guidance given by major central banks, the Fed and ECB in particular, which delivered some easing of financial conditions, particularly in advanced economies, but in emerging markets as well, although to a lesser degree.    
Page 5 of 10  Yet the situation remains fluid, as illustrated by the recent downward pressure on emerging currencies in response to the renewed flare-up in trade tensions – even if, again, rising market expectations of lower US interest rates are cushioning the blow.   In summary, the last few years have continued to teach us that, in a world of open capital accounts and elevated debt levels, global capital flows display cycles that remain heavily influenced by the monetary policy of the advanced economies. Furthermore, the Fed retains its key role in driving these flows, owing to the dollar’s role as a funding currency for both portfolio flows and bank loans. Indeed, the desynchronisation of policy cycles between the Fed and other major central banks can accentuate the capital flow cycle, especially if it leads to dollar appreciation.  That said, cross-border investors and lenders continue to differentiate between specific emerging markets. Those with elevated foreign exchange (FX) liabilities, twin deficits and poorly anchored inflation expectations remain the most vulnerable.   Looking ahead, the relative synchronisation of major economies’ central banks, insofar as they all experience a lack of inflation pressures, provides some reason for optimism, as does the success of these central banks in reversing the undue tightening of financial conditions in late 2018. However, any indications that the advanced economies are slowing faster than expected as risks materialise could trigger renewed capital outflows from the emerging markets.  Additional risks from geopolitical uncertainties and trade tensions  Allow me to briefly discuss, albeit in more detail, how trade tensions, and more generally geopolitical uncertainties, can affect the environment for emerging markets.   Countries with open capital markets and floating currencies are exposed to swings in the international perceptions of risk – and the factors I have mentioned influence these perceptions. Hence, even if a specific emerging country is not directly exposed to higher tariffs, or if it is not in the region where a geopolitical issue is flaring up, it can experience capital outflows as investors will require a higher premium on its assets.  
Page 6 of 10  There are more direct channels through which emerging markets can be affected by geopolitical issues. These include, of course, upward pressure in oil prices. We saw, up to a few weeks ago, that tensions in the Persian Gulf were keeping the price of crude elevated, even as global growth showed signs of slowing.   In addition, business confidence will typically suffer if the geopolitical tension affects prospects for trade with the region concerned. If the endgame is military conflict and infrastructure destruction, a consequence will be migratory flows. These, if uncontrolled, can cause both fiscal pressures and socio-political tensions in the country receiving the displaced populations.   Finally, conflict can also increase the cost of, and the potential restrictions to, international merchandise trade, for instance if it affects an area that is important for maritime traffic.  Of course, we talk here of linkages that relate to ‘severe’ geopolitical events like conflicts – and there is thankfully no certainty that these will happen. Nonetheless, emerging countries have also in the past been affected by ‘milder’ events that weigh on global demand and make investors less willing to increase exposure to the ‘riskier’ emerging market assets.   As far as trade tensions are concerned, negative consequences for emerging markets will emerge if these countries are involved in specific stages of the affected global value chains, or if they export commodities that are used at the beginning of these value chains.  The IMF G20 Surveillance note mentioned earlier indicated that based on simulations conducted by the IMF, recently announced tariffs, together with previously announced ones, could reduce global GDP by 0.5 per cent in 2020.   Are emerging economies at risk of further market volatility?  This leads me to addressing the issue of how emerging countries can navigate the current turbulent waters, and in particular how they can deal with potential financial market volatility.  
Page 7 of 10   As I have argued earlier: the experience of the last year shows that portfolio investors and other lenders, including banks, do differentiate between emerging markets, largely according to the strength of their macroeconomic and policy fundamentals. For instance, while currencies like the Argentinian peso and the Turkish lira depreciated by 48% and 32% versus the US dollar in the first 10 months of 2018 respectively, others barely depreciated, losing less than 5% over the same period (such Thai baht, Malaysian ringgit or Peruvian sol). These discrepancies illustrate the major influence of external and fiscal imbalances (the proverbial ‘twin deficits’), as well as the degree of endogenous inflation dynamics in response to external shocks.  Does this mean that emerging market assets will again experience widespread differences in performance this year and the next? While such a risk is indeed elevated, several factors should nonetheless help to insulate these markets better than in earlier crises.   First, most emerging countries enjoy better coverage ratios from their FX reserves, even if historical experience reveals that, when other fundamentals are weak, high reserves may not offer much protection against market volatility.   Second, inflation expectations now appear better anchored in a broad range of emerging countries, as a direct consequence of the growing credibility of inflation-targeting regimes. In several cases, public debt is also better managed than in the past, with countries extending the average maturity of their debt and increasingly relying on local currency-denominated issues.   Finally, the real effective exchange rates appear to be mostly fairly valued or even undervalued after their widespread depreciation in 2018.  This said, endogenous sources of vulnerability to future global market turbulence still exist in emerging countries. They need to be addressed if future bouts of local market volatility are to reduce in both size and duration. I would like to mention, in particular, the growing indebtedness of the corporate sector and, to a lesser extent, also of the household and government sectors, which means that, for most of the emerging 
Page 8 of 10  countries, total debt (public plus private) is now well in excess of the levels that prevailed before the global financial crisis.   Similarly, an increase in FX liabilities (mostly by the private sector) and, in several cases, growing mismatches between FX-denominated assets and liabilities poses risks in some countries. Indeed, even if there is no such mismatch at present, the levels of both FX assets and liabilities are often large relative to GDP, which means that any changes in valuations can quickly generate important swings in a country’s net international investment position.   Finally, the experience of South Africa also highlights the dangers linked to an increased financial fragility of state-owned enterprises (SOEs), as the hard-currency liabilities of SOEs can rise quickly, eventually turning into additional credit risks for the sovereign.  Policy options to deal with turbulent times  In the beginning of these remarks, I pointed to the support which emerging market currencies and fixed-income assets have received from the rising expectations of US interest rate declines and the fall in long-term bond yields, both in the US and in other advanced economies. Such developments ensure that the yield differentials between emerging countries and their advanced counterparts remain relatively wide, offering some buffer against capital outflows. However, this equilibrium is fragile. If the world economy proves more resilient than expected, bond yields can easily reverse part of their recent decline, especially if the recent US inflation softness proves transitory, as most economists indeed anticipate. Conversely, if global growth data surprise on the downside, emerging markets could suffer from a ‘flight to safety’ and renewed appreciation of the US dollar.  Last year’s events, just like the ‘taper tantrum’ of 2013 or the ‘investment recession’ of 2016, show that if global financial conditions become less favourable, all the emerging countries will be affected to some extent, although those with stronger fundamentals will show greater resilience. Building resilience thus appears to be a necessary task for governments and central banks alike. In particular, it is important to ensure that 
Page 9 of 10  inflation expectations remain well anchored and that, as a consequence, the lower exchange rate pass-through to inflation observed in the recent cycle remains the norm.   But authorities should also keep the growth in FX-denominated liabilities under control, so as to allow exchange rate depreciation to play its role as an ‘adjustment variable’ and minimise any impacts from external currency and asset price shifts onto private sector balance sheets. They also have the option of using the available macroprudential tools should conflicts emerge between the respective goals of price and financial stability, including risks to these balance sheets.  Resilience also depends on limiting dependence on foreign capital to meet domestic funding needs. It is therefore important for governments to ensure, through a mix of prudent fiscal policies and an environment that is conducive for private savings, the absence of any major mismatches between the domestic supply and demand of debt securities. Hence, when non-residents eventually reduce their bond holdings, these net sales will be more easily absorbed by domestic investors, and the domestic market for securities will remain liquid. Appropriate, sophisticated market tools to hedge against currency and interest rate risk can only help in the deepening of domestic markets.  These tools I have just mentioned deal more specifically with currency- and capital flow-related risks. Nonetheless, the list is not exhaustive. Resilience also depends on the way in which investors perceive the institutional and governance quality of the recipient country, the existence of checks and balances, and the depth and quality of its political debate. And, as South Africa’s experience shows, financial resilience also depends on real economic resilience. South Africa’s inflation expectations may be better anchored than they were in the past, its FX liabilities may be relatively low, its banking sector may be solid, and its domestic capital markets may be deep and liquid. Yet it’s domestic GDP growth performance has been weak, contributing to relatively high fiscal and current account deficits and a relative vulnerability of South African assets.  Consequently, emerging market policymakers should also focus on measures that increase the ability of domestic private agents to adjust to external shocks, including the mobility of labour and capital across sectors. These measures include lowering the 
Page 10 of 10  constraints to doing business, creating opportunities for laid-off workers to ‘retrain’ and find jobs in alternative industries, ensuring that infrastructure is appropriate for business to respond to relative price shifts, and allowing for sufficient economic and export diversification. This way, heavy reliance on specific commodities, markets or segments of value chains will not become a major risk if those particular sectors face global shocks.  Conclusion  In conclusion, let me again point out that while the global environment remains challenging for investors and policymakers alike, much progress has been made over the years to better insulate the emerging economies from unavoidable global shocks, and authorities have additional tools at their disposal to increase that resilience over the medium to long term.   Central banks can also play their part in the build-up of that resilience, both through the execution of their price and financial stability mandate, and through their management of official reserves – even though the current low-yield environment makes it difficult to earn good returns on their financial assets.   But central banks also face limitations in what they can achieve.   Strengthening a country’s economic and financial architecture is everybody’s task.  Thank you.   
Benjamin E Diokno: Beyond conventions - harnessing the BSPmultiplier amidst shifting sandsSpeech by Mr Benjamin E Diokno, Governor of Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP, the centralbank of the Philippines), at the Chamber of Thrift Banks Annual Convention, Makati City, 29March 2019.*   *   *IntroductionDistinguished officers, members, and trustees of the Chamber of Thrift Banks (CTB), ladies andgentlemen, good morning!Thank you for inviting me in this year’s annual convention and induction of CTB’s new set ofofficers and trustees. I am pleased to be delivering this speech before the members of the thriftbank community.I say this because this industry has been an enabler of economic development by encouragingretail savings and extending credit to crucial sectors of the economy.Shifting SandsYour chosen theme for today’s event – “Expanding New Markets,” reflects the current economicand financial reality we are all facing.As most of you already know, the global economy is in transition. The sands are shifting and weare once again reminded of the constantly evolving dynamics of economics and finance.If you ask me, policymaking in this time of transition requires some rethinking. As Nobel laureateJoseph Stiglitz aptly puts it, there is a need to shift our focus from what is happening on the so-called “average,” and take into account a broader spectrum of the society.   In other words, we need to bring our policies closer to the people and aim for long-term stabilityand inclusive growth.Thus, in my remarks today, I wish to provide you with the BSP’s perspective on these tasks. Inparticular, I wish to discuss the Philippine economy’s recent developments, potential challenges,and the BSP’s policy thrust going forward.On Solid FootingThe good news is that, despite the challenging operating environment, we can rely on thePhilippines’ solid macroeconomic fundamentals to provide us with a significant headway towardsa more robust and inclusive growth.The domestic economy grew 6.2 percent last year. This extends the country’s growth streak to80 quarters or roughly 20 years of uninterrupted growth.It should be noted that while the latest figure is relatively lower compared to a year ago, weremain on track to outpace most of our Asian peers in 2019.  The economy has been growingrobustly at 6.0 percent and better for the last 15 quarters since the second quarter of 2015. Admittedly, we had to deal with a challenging inflation environment last year due to supply-sidepressures. The increase in international crude oil prices, supply bottlenecks, and direct andindirect effects of the tax reforms pushed inflation beyond the government’s target range of  2 – 4 1 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
percent in 2018.The BSP’s decisive action to raise its policy interest rate by a cumulative 175 basis pointsbeginning in May 2018, coupled with the National Government’s implementation of non-monetarymeasures to alleviate price pressures, helped rein in high inflation and ensure that it would revertback to its target path.In fact, latest figures are encouraging as inflation declined to 3.8 percent in February this year.This is within the target range of 2-4 percent and is consistent with recent forecasts and marketexpectations that a manageable inflation environment could be sustained in the near term. While the peso experienced episodes of depreciation, it should be noted that this was partly dueto the strong demand for imports of capital goods, partly because of Build Build Build program,raw materials and intermediate products needed to support a growing economy.The country’s external payments position is reliably supported by strong structural foreignexchange inflows. These include remittances from overseas Filipinos, revenues from the IT-BPOindustry, receipts from the vibrant tourism sector, and sustained inflows of foreign directinvestments.With these inflows, the country’s Gross International Reserves (GIR) now stands at aroundUS$82.90 billion as of end-February 2019. This is roughly equivalent to 7.3 months’ worth ofimports of goods and payments of services and primary income.All of these could provide sufficient buffer against external headwinds.A Second Pillar of StrengthThe sound and stable condition of the banking community, supported too by the thrift bankindustry, has also served as a key pillar of strength of the economy.As of end- January 2019, total resources of thrift banks (TBs) rose to P 1.2 trillion, a 7.0 percentincrease compared to its level a year ago.Bank lending meanwhile continued to expand and was channeled mostly to production sectors.Both consumer loans (CLs) and real estate loans continued to grow. As of end-December 2018,the level of CLs of TBs expanded to P 561.9 billion, higher by 6.0 percent relative to the level ayear ago at P530.1 billion.  Meanwhile, loans for real estate activities increased by 8.0 percent toP291.4 billion relative to last year. Sustained by core earnings mainly from lending activities, theTB industry also remained profitable as net profit stood at P15.8 billion as of end-December 2018returning 10.3 percent to owners’ equity.Asset quality has likewise significantly improved. As of end-January 2019, the gross non-performing loans (NPL) ratio and non-performing assets (NPA) of thrift banks have significantlydeclined to around 5.4 percent and 5.7 percent, respectively. These figures were significantlylower compared to their end-December 2001 values of 12.0 percent and 17.0 percent,respectively.  Lastly, the TB industry remains well-capitalized.As of end-September 2018, the subsidiary thrift banks’ capital adequacy ratio (CAR), on solobasis, of 15.0 percent remains well above international standards  while the CAR of stand-aloneTBs stood at 18.2 percent.Ladies and gentlemen, all these numbers I just mentioned reflect, among others, the thriftbanking sector’s critical role in supporting the country’s inclusive economic growth.The Three Great Challenges Ahead 2 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
Even as I say this, the evolving operating environment is beset with what I refer to as the threegreat challenges that could potentially derail our growth trajectory.First is the imbalance or great divergence in global growth.  According to the InternationalMonetary Fund (IMF), global growth prospects in 2019 remain fragile and uneven as recovery inadvanced economies (AEs) is expected to remain steady, while activity in emerging marketeconomies (EMEs) is projected to slow down.   This uneven growth trajectory could potentially trigger portfolio rebalancing and capital flowreversal in emerging markets (EMs), including the Philippines.Second is the emergence of what is referred to as the great fragmentation, where policymakerstend to be less able and less willing to collaborate internationally.Populist sentiment continues to gain traction in countries around the world. This, in turn, hasfueled a greater inclination among governments towards “inward-looking,” prisoner’s dilemmatype of policies.We are in the midst of protracted trade tensions between the US and China. While talks haverecently begun between the two countries to potentially outline the exit from the trade tension,unwinding of the tariffs already imposed would still take some time.Third, there is also the risk of great disruption stemming from the so-called rise of the FourthIndustrial Revolution. While technological innovation in itself is not bad, and indeed often bringsbenefits, the velocity and depth of transformation could have potentially disruptive effects,especially in the short term.Consider for example the impact of financial technology on key areas of central banking such asmonetary policy and banking regulation. Digital currencies can potentially alter the organiccomposition and evolution of money supply and affect how central banks can influenceaggregate demand.On top of these external risks, we also have risks emanating from the domestic sphere. Theseinclude important challenges such as the impact of adverse weather disturbances- La Nina, ElNino-,  infrastructure gaps, implementation bottlenecks, and delay in the passage of the 2019budget of the National Government, among others.BSP’s Policy ThrustHow do we respond to these challenges?To my mind, successfully navigating this time of uncertainty entails a three-pronged approach.Building on StrengthsFirst, there is a need to continue building our strengths.In this regard, I am fortunate to inherit an institution that has a legacy of excellence, credibility,and independence.Rest assured, price and financial stability will remain the BSP’s top priority. On that note, you canrely on the BSP to remain independent and steadfast in safeguarding our primary mandates andimplement timely and appropriate policies that are evidenced based.Let me just say a few words about monetary operations. The BSP will continue to use market-based monetary instruments in its operations. 3 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
In particular, the BSP will work to further fine-tune our monetary operations with refinements inour Interest Rate Corridor (IRC) framework. The adoption of the IRC framework in June 2016,has allowed the reduction of reserve requirements by 200 basis points in 2018, from 20 percentto 18 percent, without sacrificing monetary control.The goal of reducing the Reserve Requirement Ratio (RRR) can therefore resume provided thatdomestic inflation and monetary conditions would allow it. This commitment to a gradual reduction in deposit reserves will lower friction costs in thebanking sector, create more efficient financial intermediation, and help curb shadow bankinggiven the rise of strong alternatives offered by fintech and digital innovation.Enhancing Policy AgilityThis brings me to the second approach. There clearly is a need to make our policies moreresponsive to the changing environment.Just recently, the amendments to the BSP’s Charter was enacted into law. The new charteramendments restore the BSP’s authority to issue debt papers, providing us greater flexibility indetermining the timing and size of our monetary operations.The BSP is also given the authority to obtain information from private individuals and entities forits policy formulation.  The law also widens the coverage of BSP-supervised financial institutionsto include money service businesses, credit granting businesses and payment systemoperators. These reforms put the BSP in a stronger position to pursue our price and financialstability mandates amid a rapidly evolving environment.In terms of financial stability, the BSP continues to foster a regulatory environment that is bothenabling to emerging trends and effective in managing new risks.The BSP’s policy reform agenda aims to strengthen risk governance in banks by setting outstandards that promote continued enhancement of banks’ risk management systems. The BSPis guided by the principle of proportionality while pursuing international best practice in itsstrategic policy objectives.For instance, the Monetary Board recently approved the extension of the observation period forthe Basel III Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) compliance ofthrift banks, that are subsidiaries of universal and commercial banks, up to end-December 2019,moving the effectivity date of said ratios to 1 January 2020.  This provides covered banks andquasi-banks sufficient time to build up their liquidity position given the combined impact of theseliquidity measures.  Moreover, enhancements to the LCR and Minimum Liquidity Ratio (MLR)methodologies were also approved as a result of the BSP’s continuing discussions with the CTBand the rest of the banking industry. Starting 1 January 2019, stand-alone thrift banks are alreadysubject to the 20 percent MLR which aims to ensure that covered institutions set aside a liquiditybuffer that will enable them to withstand liquidity stress events. To cope with the rapid advances of Fintech, we have upped our “RegTech” game by adopting aregulatory sandbox approach. This allows the BSP to observe and study new products andcreate appropriate regulations in response.Harnessing the BSP MultiplierThird and the last approach is something I am very passionate about. The magnitude andseverity of today’s challenges also call for the BSP to go beyond convention and embark ongoals outside the ambit of traditional monetary policy. 4 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
I am talking about the need to  support inclusive growth.The BSP’s effective pursuit of our primary mandate of maintaining price stability puts the countryin a better position to attain inclusive growth. We foster a macroeconomic environmentconducive for investments and supportive of job generation and employment.However, maximizing the impact of the BSP’s policies on the lives of Filipinos entails that wetackle the inclusive growth advocacy directly. I am heartened by the thought that the recentBanking Sector Outlook Survey showed that most thrift banks believe that business growth maybe maintained by developing new capabilities and by expanding market reach, digitally or throughnew products and services.This is what I refer to as the BSP Multiplier or the BSP’s ability to improve every single Juan andMaria’s quality of life.Towards this end, you can expect the BSP to continue to focus on this goal and integrate ourfinancial inclusion advocacy with our traditional objectives.The BSP is working hard to bring central banking operations to the people, of course with yourhelp. We are committed to advancing our financial inclusion, financial education, and consumerprotection agenda to ensure that everybody is given the opportunity to ride in this economicgrowth.A BSP that is Closer to the People For us to be able to succeed in a transitioning global environment, we need to build ourstrengths, be more responsive, and sometimes go beyond conventions.The BSP is aware that our efforts cannot stand alone. To keep the engine running, both thepublic and private sectors must share in the responsibility of making sure that no Filipino is leftbehind.I therefore thank the CTB and the thrift bank community for supporting the BSP and its thrust onfinancial inclusion.Rest assured, you can count on the BSP to walk closely with you in our country’s journeytowards inclusive growth.Thank you and mabuhay tayong lahat! 5 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
Benjamin E Diokno: Continuing the legacy - key BSP reforms forsustained and more inclusive growthSpeech by Mr Benjamin E Diokno, Governor of Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP, the centralbank of the Philippines), at the 4th General Membership Meeting of the Financial ExecutivesInstitute of the Philippines (FINEX), Makati City, 29 April 2019.*   *   *FINEX President Atty. Eusebio V. Tan, MAP President Rizalina G. Mantaring, FINEX directors andofficers, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, a pleasant afternoon.I would like to thank FINEX for inviting me as your guest speaker in this year’s generalmembership meeting, and for the opportunity to congratulate the new members of FINEX. It istruly an honor and pleasure to be here.When I was appointed as the new Governor, one of the things that came to my mind is whichdirection to navigate this strong and well-respected organization.  Then, I was reminded that theBSP is backed by dependable partners, whose continuing support and confidence, enable theinstitution to address challenges in the pursuit of its mandate, programs, and policies. Thisincludes the FINEX.  Truly, holding the steering gear is a tough and challenging task but I am certain that I can getthrough this because I am supported by highly competent workforce and by dedicated partners. For this afternoon, I will first be providing an overview of the BSP’s strengthened mandate as thecentral monetary authority and supervisor of the Philippine financial system and paymentssystem. Second, I will give an overview of the Philippine macroeconomic developments, followedby a snapshot of the condition and performance of the Philippine banking system based on thelatest available data. I will also discuss the evolving banking system landscape and reformagenda. Let me conclude this presentation with some key takeaways.For the past two and a half decades, the BSP has remained steadfast in the pursuit of its coremandates with the end goal of achieving a more globally competitive Philippine economy, and asafe, sound and stable financial system. The BSP’s mandates on price and financial stability andefficient payments system have been strengthened with the signing of Republic Act (R.A.) No.11211.This journey, relentlessly led by my predecessor, the late Nestor A. Espenilla, Jr., the dedicatedmembers of the Monetary Board, and initiated by the other stewards of the institution beforethem, has translated in the realization of significant milestones.First milestone is the positive macroeconomic developments.1. Real GDP growth.  The Philippines remains one of the fastest growing economies in theregion. Real gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 6.3 percent in the fourth quarter of2018, leading to an average growth of 6.2 percent in 2018.  The expansion in real GDP wassupported by similar growths in the industry and services sectors, particularly theconstruction and retail trade services, as well as sustained government and householdspending.2. Inflation.  In March 2019, the country’s headline inflation slowed down to 3.3 percent. Theresulting year-to-date average of 3.8 percent is now within the National Government’sannounced inflation target range of 3.0 percent ± 1.0 percentage point for 2019.3. Balance of Payments.  The country’s external position is strong as the overall balance ofpayments (BOP) position yielded a surplus of USD627 million in March 2019, a reversal of 1 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
the USD266 million BOP deficit recorded in the same month last year. Inflows mainly camefrom the BSP’s foreign exchange operations and income from investments abroad as wellas the National Government’s net foreign currency deposits.4. Gross International Reserves.  In relation to the gross international reserves (GIR) level, itregistered at USD83.2 billion as of end-March 2019.  At this level, the GIR represents a morethan ample liquidity buffer and is equivalent to 7.3 months’ worth of imports of goods andpayments of services and primary income.5. Exchange Rate – The peso averaged ₱52.34/USD1, appreciating slightly against the USdollar by 0.14 percent from the ₱52.41/USD1 average in March 2019. The peso appreciationis mainly due to risk-on sentiment following the resumption of trade talks between the UnitedStates and China. On a year-to-date basis (10 April 2019), the peso likewise appreciatedagainst the US dollar by 1.3 percent closing at ₱51.90/USD1.With the country’s robust and uninterrupted economic growth, the per capita income has beenincreasing. The Philippines’ per capita GDP and per capital gross national income (GNI) grew by8.8 percent and 8.5 percent, respectively, from end-December 2017 to 2018.The rate of poverty incidence has also improved to 16.1 percent as of the first half of 2018, from22.2 percent in the as of the same period in 2015.Another key milestone is the fundamentally sound and stable banking system.Key indicators show further strengthening of banks’ balance sheets with positive growth inassets, loans, deposits and capital.Alongside a growing economy, the total resources of the banking system continued to expand by10.0 percent year-on-year to P16.7 trillion as of end-February 2019.Consistent with the expansion in the asset base, the gross total loan portfolio of the Philippinebanking system increased by 12.3 percent to P9.9 trillion as of end-February 2019, albeit slowercompared to the 16.3 percent growth in the previous year. Nevertheless, loan growth remainsbroad-based across production sectors.The growth in the banking system’s assets was supported by the 6.3 percent growth in depositsamounting to P12.6 trillion as of end-February 2019. The deposits are mostly peso-denominatedand in the form of savings account which are considered as stable funding source.  Albeit slowercompared to the previous year, the decline in deposit growth rate is matched by the increase inbond issuances. As a result, the U/KB-issued bonds payable jumped by 163.1 percent to P316.7billion as of end-February 2019 from P120.4 billion as of end-February 2018.The banking system’s risk management system remains strong that is backed by capital. Theaverage capital adequacy ratio (CAR) is well above the minimum requirement at around 14.8percent on a solo basis and 15.4 on a consolidated basis as of end-December 2018.Overall quality of the bank loan portfolio remains satisfactory with low non-performing loans(NPL) ratio at 2.1 percent as of end-February 2019, and average NPL coverage ratio for the pasttwo years at 104.5 percent.Universal and commercial banks (U/KBs) are compliant with the minimum liquidity coverage ratiorequirement.  The Basel III Leverage Ratio of U/KBs stood at 9.4 percent on consolidated basis as of end-December 2018, and well above the BSP regulatory threshold of 5.0 percent and the internationalminimum of 3.0 percent.The Philippine banking system also remains profitable, sustained by strong core earnings. 2 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
Banks’ net profit grew by 6.9 percent to P179.7 billion for the year ended December 2018.These figures demonstrate how banks successfully adapt to the challenging externalenvironment and the evolving financial landscape.Another milestone is that the Philippine banking system has become more streamlined,financially inclusive and technologically responsive reaching out to more clients across the nationand addressing their changing needs. In particular, banks are geographically expanding through the establishment of branches andscaled-down branch-lite units.There were also banks which capitalize on electronic solutions or financial technology (FinTech)to reach a greater scale. This move is in line with the BSP’s initiative, in close coordination withindustry stakeholders, on the implementation of PESONet and Instapay under the National RetailPayment System (NRPS) framework. The participation and compliance of the supervisedfinancial institutions (BSFIs) to the NRPS requirements have been encouraging. The BSPexpects more participation particularly by stand-alone thrift, rural and cooperative banks once thenecessary investment in technology is completed. Setting sights on digitalization of the financial system, we are on track with our goal to raising theshare of electronic retail payments to at least 20 percent by 2020.Given these milestones, I will continue the legacy of my predecessors with focus on financialinclusion.  I am glad that a number of critical laws were passed to support sustained financialinclusion.The enactment of republic Act (R.A.) No. 11055 or the Philippine Identification System (PhilSys)in August 2018 provides Filipinos the means to establish a verifiable digital identity. This willenable them to open accounts, use financial services more efficiently, and gainfully participate inan increasingly digital economy. The BSP sits as a member of the PhilSys Policy andCoordination Council and participates actively in the inter-agency technical working group for thesuccessful implementation of such Law.In the same month, R.A. No. 11057 or the Personal Property Security Act was enacted. Thisprovides the legal and institutional framework to facilitate the use of movable property. The Lawexpands the range of properties which can be used as loan collateral, particularly by the micro,small and medium enterprises addressing the challenges on accessing credit because of thelack of acceptable collateral.  We look forward to the operationalization of the unified collateralregistry.Equally important is R.A. No. 11127 or the National Payment Systems Act which was passed inOctober 2018. This formalizes the BSP’s oversight on the efficiency of payments systems aschannels of funds in the financial market benefiting the consumers. The proposed implementingrules and regulations are currently exposed for comments.We are focusing on the implementation of these significant pieces of legislations geared towardachieving greater and broader access to financial services by all Filipinos, especially thefinancially unserved and underserved population.Parallel to this is our direction towards digital transformation recognizing the wealth of benefitsthat we could reap, from streamlined delivery of financial services to lower cost of services. Withthis in mind, the BSP always endeavors to provide a regulatory environment that encouragesfinancial innovation for a more inclusive financial system.While there is increased use of financial technology among financial institutions, the BSP adoptsan open and flexible approach through the “regulatory sandbox”, underpinned by three important 3 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
principles focusing on proportionate regulation, multi-stakeholder collaboration and consumerprotection. Cognizant of the attendant risks, the BSP has issued series of regulations aimed at mitigatingeffects of technology-related risks, particularly cyber-security threats. These include the followingissuances: (1) Circular No. 1019 further strengthens the BSP’s cyber-threat surveillancecapabilities by tightening the reporting regime for BSFIs on technology and cyber-risk-relatedincidents and disruptions; (2) Circular No. 982 sets forth enhanced guidelines covering a holisticframework on information security risk management to address the growing concerns on rapidly-evolving cyber-threats; (3) Circular No. 958 requires BSFIs to implement multi-factorauthentication for fund transfers, payments, and card not-present (CNP) transactions, inresponse to cyber-attacks and threats; (4) Circular No. 951  incorporates cyber-resilience in theBSFIs’ business continuity planning process to adequately capture the potential impact of cyberevents; and (5) Circular No. 949 advocates responsible use of social media by BSFIs byinstituting the necessary safeguards, governance structure and standards to effectively identify,measure, manage and monitor risks arising from social media platforms.Add to these regulatory initiatives is our continuing market surveillance on industry developmentsinvolving crowdfunding and peer-to-peer lending. We recognize that these innovative platformscan potentially expand financial access for new businesses, particularly those belonging to themicro, small and medium enterprise sector. But we also recognize that investors andconsumers are exposed to greater risk of financial abuse. We, therefore, stand ready to takeregulatory action if warranted to uphold fair and healthy competition.The BSP likewise collaborates with both local and foreign counterpart regulators to ensureconsistency in the priorities, prevent regulatory arbitrage, and to promote optimization of digitalinnovations.Along with digital transformation is our increased efforts towards the deepening of financialconsumer protection and education. I believe that we can truly reach financial inclusiveness ifFilipinos will become more aware of the varied financial products and services that are availablein the system to meet their different needs.In particular, the BSP conducts financial education expos and issues financial advisories towardsthis end. In 2018, we shifted our approach to financial education – from on the ground delivery oflearning sessions to forging strategic partnerships. The BSP has ongoing partnerships with theDepartment of Education, Overseas Workers Welfare Administration, the Philippine Army, andsoon with the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the Civil Service Commission. Learning toolswere developed, taking into consideration the profile and learning needs of audiences, as well asinstitutional set-ups/training delivery mechanisms of our partners.A measurement framework is also being developed to monitor programmatic key performanceindicators and measure the impact of initiatives under each partnership.Ladies and gentlemen, let me leave you with some key takeaways.First, Sound and resilient Philippine banking system supports domestic economic expansion.Second, Digitalization and financial technology are re-shaping the future landscape of thePhilippine banking system.Third, The BSP stands ready to provide an enabling regulatory environment to keep pace with theevolving developments in the financial system.Fourth, leveraging on the implementation of new laws, the BSP is now in a stronger position topursue its mandates and advocacy towards broad-based and inclusive growth. 4 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
Lastly, Attainment of sustained and inclusive growth of the economy as well as the bankingsector is a shared responsibility among various shareholders.It is through our harmonized efforts and partnership that we can accomplish any challenging taskand be able to sustain our growth momentum.As our staunch partner, we are always grateful to FINEX for your invaluable support in equippingbanking and finance professionals with the necessary skills and knowledge to cope with thedemands and challenges of today’s ever changing financial landscape.Again, thank you for your continued support to the BSP’s initiatives towards a globally competitiveeconomy and stable financial system. Mabuhay po kayo! 5 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
Mario Draghi: Twenty years of the European Central Bank’smonetary policySpeech by Mr Mario Draghi, President of the European Central Bank, at the ECB Forum onCentral Banking, Sintra, 18 June 2019.*   *   *Central banks were often established in the past with the aim of bringing stability in the aftermathof historic episodes. The Bank of England was established during the sovereign debt crisis of1690, when the government was unable to obtain funding in the market. The Federal Reservewas created after a series of panics that had rocked the US banking system in the late 19th andearly 20th century.The euro was introduced 20 years ago in response to repeated episodes of exchange-rateinstability and the need to secure the Single Market against competitive devaluations. The ECBwas established as the keystone of the new Economic and Monetary Union (EMU).The first decade of the Monetary Union was characterised by calm macroeconomic conditions,with limited volatility and steady economic growth. The second decade, however, has seenprofound shifts in the prevailing environment – including both financial and sovereign debt crises– and our monetary policy strategy has had to adapt with it.I would like to discuss this morning why this evolution came about and how it was achieved –and what the past twenty years can tell us about the ECB’s monetary policy in the future.Monetary policy before the crisisThe ECB’s mandate is given by the Treaty as price stability. In 1998, the Governing Councildefined price stability as inflation within a range of 0-2% over the medium term, which constitutesthe ECB’s objective. Then, in 2003, the Governing Council clarified that, within this range, it wouldaim at a focal point of below, but close to, 2%, which remains our medium-term aim to this day.This was a formulation that differed from the standard inflation-targeting framework of the time,which was typically based around a point target for inflation. But there were sound reasons whythis definition was put in place.In common with central banks across the world, the ECB faced a macroeconomic environmentbefore the crisis that was predominantly defined by low volatility and moderate shocks, with thedistribution of shocks to inflation almost exclusively to the upside. In the euro area, HICP energyprices rose by 80% between January 1999 and September 2008. Under these conditions,establishing a strong reaction function against high inflation was seen as crucial to anchorinflation expectations. Emphasising an aim of “below, but close to, 2%” was seen to imply astronger commitment than a standard inflation-targeting regime.But monetary policy in the euro area also faced a special challenge. The ECB was a new centralbank operating in a very heterogeneous monetary union, which created a particular imperative toestablish inflation credibility. Establishing a commitment to controlling inflation was seen ascritical to cement lower inflation expectations across the euro area – especially as moderateinflation was a relatively new phenomenon in several Member States.Over the two decades up to 1999, inflation had averaged above 3% in 10 of the 12 originalmembers. The decline in inflation in many countries in the run-up to EMU was in large part due toexpectations of joining, as well as to a number of extraordinary actions taken by nationalauthorities to meet the convergence criteria. From 1989–99, long-term inflation expectations hadfallen from a range of between 2.5-4.5% in the four largest euro area economies to below 2%across the board. It was now the task of the new central bank to lock in this moderate-inflation 1 / 8BIS central bankers' speeches
environment – and it did so successfully. Over the next decade, inflation expectationsinternalised the ECB’s commitment to keep inflation down and remained below 2%.But this process of building inflation credibility had implications for the ECB’s reactionfunction. As a matter of accounting, stabilising headline inflation largely caused by its volatilecomponents must mean that core inflation adjusts downwards. Rolling cross-correlationsbetween energy inflation and core inflation show that an episode of high energy inflation between1999 and 2007 was accompanied by a period of rapidly softening core inflation. As a result,between January 1999 and September 2008 headline inflation in the euro area averaged 2.35%,while core inflation averaged 1.7% and exceeded 2% less than 15% of the time.Central banks in other advanced economies faced similar challenges and adopted similarstrategies. But differences in mandates – and length of track records in fighting inflation – led todifferences in how much energy price pass-through to headline inflation others were comfortableaccommodating. For example, energy prices in the US CPI rose by 160% over the sameperiod and headline inflation averaged 2.9%. The Federal Reserve reacted less to headlineinflation, and core CPI inflation averaged 2.2%.The upshot was that the euro area entered the crisis having succeeded in establishing its anti-inflation credentials, but with underlying inflation dynamics that were perhaps relatively weaker.This was not immediately apparent, as inflation stayed at fairly elevated levels for more than fouryears after the Lehman crash. Monetary policy responded decisively to the global financial crisisand disinflationary threats seemed to pass quickly.But in hindsight it seems reasonable to conclude that the inflation process was vulnerable toa shift in the environment – which is what transpired from around mid-2012 onwards.New challenges for monetary policyAt this point, headline inflation in the euro area began what was, in retrospect, a prolongeddownward drift, and core inflation fell by almost a percentage point from mid-2012 to early 2014.There are two factors that help explain the switch to a disinflationary trend.First, the distribution of shocks to inflation moved strongly to the downside and theamplitude of the shocks increased. Supply-side shocks gradually dissipated over the yearsfollowing the Lehman crash and the sovereign debt crisis. Negative demand shocks, driven atdifferent times by domestic demand and external demand, instead became the dominant sourceof macroeconomic fluctuations in the euro area. ECB analysis shows that negative demandshocks have weighed on euro-area inflation by more than 1 percentage point on average sincethe start of the crisis. In the previous ten years, their effect was neutral overall, with periods ofboth upward and downward pressure.The second factor was a change in the macroeconomic policy mix. While in the first phase ofthe crisis fiscal and monetary policy had eased in tandem – with fiscal policy loosening by a totalof about 3% of potential GDP between 2008 and 2010 – thereafter the stance of monetary andfiscal policy decoupled. The euro area fiscal stance turned contractionary in response to thesovereign debt crisis, tightening by around 4 percentage points of potential GDP until 2013 –years the euro area was mostly in recession.This stands in contrast to the United States, where fiscal policy eased more in the initial phase ofthe crisis, by about 6.5% of potential GDP in total over 2008–09, and then tightened by about5.5% of potential GDP from 2011 to 2013 when the economic recovery was underway. The euroarea was forced onto a different path by the need in some countries to re-establish fiscalcredibility. But on aggregate the euro area did not have less fiscal space than the United States:public debt levels were similar in the two jurisdictions. The key difference was that fiscal12345 2 / 8BIS central bankers' speeches
stabilisation in the United States took place at the federal level, while the euro area lacked acentral fiscal instrument to act counter-cyclically.The policy mix is also relevant when it comes to financial sector policies. After the crisis, itwas inevitable that banking sectors in advanced economies would have to deleverage, both tocover losses and to re-focus their business models. The United States ensured that this processhappened quickly and early. Around 500 failing banks were resolved by the Federal DepositInsurance Corporation, while struggling banks were stress-tested and recapitalised through theTroubled Assets Relief Program. Between 2008 and 2011, US banks improved their leverageratio by 1.6 percentage points from 7.2 to 8.8%.The response in the euro area was more sluggish. Despite being more levered than their USpeers before the crisis, euro area banks improved their leverage ratio by just 0.9 percentagepoints, from 3.7 to 4.6%, and this was achieved more through shedding assets and less throughraising capital. This in part reflected the fact that, due to the fiscal rules, public support for bankswas concentrated in countries with fiscal space. Moreover, without a common resolutionframework only around 50 banks were resolved in the euro area in this period. So a weakbanking sector continued to drag on the euro area economy, which was especially perniciousgiven the importance of the banking lending channel for financing.In sum, the ECB faced an environment where there was both an increasing need to counterdemand shocks, and an increasing burden on monetary policy to do so. Our strategy thereforehad to adapt to these new circumstances in order to continue delivering our aim.Monetary policy responded first in the summer of 2012 by acting to defuse the sovereign debtcrisis, which had evolved from a tail risk for inflation into a material threat to price stability.Announcing Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT) established our commitment to counterunwarranted redenomination risks in sovereign debt markets and acted as a powerful circuitbreaker.While OMT was never activated, the effect of its announcement was equivalent to that of a large-scale asset purchase programme: spreads in vulnerable countries fell on average by more than400 basis points over the next two years. The macroeconomic impact of OMT was alsoanalogous to other purchase programmes: ECB research finds that the GDP and price effects ofOMT were broadly in line with those estimated for the QE that took place in the United States andthe United Kingdom.But the lingering effects of the sovereign debt crisis dented the capacity of this stimulus tocounter the new disinflationary trend. The delayed bank deleveraging process in the euro areabegan to accelerate, with banks further shrinking their balance sheets and paying back centralbank loans. Bank balance sheets declined by around 20 percentage points of GDP in 2013 aloneand, at the end of 2013, credit growth to the private sector was contracting at a rate of 2.4%relative to a year earlier. On the demand side, risk appetite in the private sector collapsed, withinvestment subtracting 1.6 percentage points from GDP growth in 2012.The ECB therefore reacted again in 2013 by cutting its main refinancing rate twice, from 0.75%to 0.25%, and by seizing the opportunity of the launch of European banking supervision. Wecarried out a comprehensive assessment of bank balance sheets, with the aim of steering theprocess of balance sheet repair towards a positive macroeconomic outcome. Banksstrengthened their balance sheets by over €200 billion in advance of the outcome. That put thebanking sector in a much stronger position to transmit our policy.But at this point, the euro area economy was hit by a further downward shock to inflation in theform of a 60% collapse in oil prices in mid-2014, which pushed inflation into negative territory.With underlying inflation already weakening, inflation expectations began to be affected. As the678910 3 / 8BIS central bankers' speeches
scope for further interest rate cuts was now limited, it became increasingly clear that ourreaction function needed to evolve to address these new challenges.Indeed, since our policy framework had never been systematically tested by persistentdisinflationary risks, the ECB had not yet had a chance to demonstrate its intolerance for inflationremaining below its aim for protracted periods of time.At the same time, there appeared to be some uncertainty about which tools we would be able todeploy if the effective lower bound were reached. Unlike in other major economies, the ECB hadnot resorted to large-scale asset purchases during the global financial crisis and its aftermath.Some even questioned the legality of asset purchases in Europe and their effectiveness in ourbank-based economy.If these uncertainties were not removed, there was a material risk that falling inflation couldbecome self-fulfilling: the public could begin expecting a smaller monetary policy response tofuture inflation undershoots, and revise their inflation expectations further downwards.In other words, credibility now relied not just on perceptions of the ECB’s commitment to our aim,but also on perceptions of our capability to fight low inflation. We responded to the situation inthree main ways.The ECB’s policy responseThe first was by clarifying the symmetry of our aim. While the quantitative definition of pricestability was instrumental in establishing credibility in the first decade, its asymmetric formulationmay have led to misperceptions in a low-inflation environment. Thus we made clear that ourpolicy aim was fully symmetric, and it was symmetric around the level that we had establishedin 2003: below, but close to, 2%. It is achieving this aim over the medium term that steers ourpolicy decisions.In addition, we clarified that symmetry meant not only that we would not accept persistently lowinflation, but also that there was no cap on inflation at 2%. As I emphasised on a number ofoccasions, our medium-term orientation implies that inflation can deviate from our aim in bothdirections, so long as the path of inflation converges back towards that focal point over themedium-term policy horizon.The second part of our response was to lay out the tools we would use to counteractdownside inflation risks, which began with a speech I gave in Amsterdam in April 2014 thatdescribed three contingencies and the instruments we would use to react to them. Thisestablished unambiguously that we had no taboos about resorting to unconventionalmeasures. There was nothing institutionally or legally special about the euro area thatprohibited monetary policy from adding accommodation once the lower bound was approached.Third, as these various contingencies played out, we operationalised our reaction function bylaunching a series of new instruments. We broke through the zero bound by lowering ourdeposit rate into negative territory, launched our targeted longer-term refinancing operations(TLTROs) to provide incentives for banks to lend, and implemented a large-scale assetpurchase programme (APP) of public and private securities. These measures were deliberatelydesigned to work as a package and ease the stance through complementary channels, workingboth through banks and the wider matrix of capital markets.The negative rate policy challenged market expectations that when rates reached zero they couldonly go up and not down, which helped skew the distribution of rate expectations and depress theshort end of the risk-free curve – a key benchmark for the pricing of bank loans. Asset purchasesin tandem compressed yields at the longer end of the curve, pushing down mortgage rates and,111213 4 / 8BIS central bankers' speeches
at the same time, making bank lending to firms more attractive in risk-adjusted terms. And bank-based transmission was amplified by the TLTROs, which lowered funding costs and increasedcompetition among banks.Over time, we also enhanced this framework with state- and date-based forward guidance,allowing us to rotate the marginal tool for determining the policy stance from asset purchases toforward guidance as the economic outlook improved. Today, this forward guidance links ourexpectations on the path of future rates to the path of inflation towards our aim, leading toautomatic easing if the convergence path towards 2% is delayed.There is mounting evidence that these instruments have been effective. Negative rates haveproven to be a very important tool in the euro area – and more so than they would have been inan economy like the United States. Indeed, the Federal Reserve eschewed negative rates in partdue to concerns about their effects on the money market industry, which are key intermediariesin the US financial system. But this factor is less relevant in the euro area, since many moneymarket funds have been operating as Variable Net Asset Value funds, and therefore are moreflexible to extend duration to seek additional returns.Furthermore, the euro area is a relatively open economy for its size, with total trade making up51% of GDP, compared with 27% in the United States. This means that the impact of negativerates on inflation and financing conditions via the exchange rate is more powerful.In short, faced with a new environment of downside risks and limited conventional policy space,the ECB showed that it had no shortage of tools available to respond. Unconventional measuresproved suitable substitutes for conventional ones: using market prices to construct a so-called“shadow short rate”, the stimulus provided appears broadly in line with the recommendation ofmonetary policy rules as suggested by recent academic research.Our capacity to react in this way was made possible by the flexibility embedded in our mandate –a flexibility that was confirmed by the recent ruling of the European Court of Justice. This not onlyaffirmed that asset purchases are a legal instrument of monetary policy in the euro area, butemphasised the broad discretion of the ECB in using all our tools in a necessary andproportionate way to achieve our objective.However, although we have seen the successful transmission of monetary policy to financingconditions, and from financing conditions to GDP and employment, the final legs of thetransmission process to wages and inflation have been slower than we expected. Wage growthis now strengthening as slack in the labour market diminishes. But the pass-through from wagesto prices remains weak. This may reflect structural changes, such as globalisation anddigitalisation, which mostly have an impact at this point in the pricing chain. Lingering cyclicalweakness can also delay wage-price pass-through as firms elect to squeeze margins ratherthan raise prices and risk losing market share.Current challenges for monetary policyIn this environment, what matters is that monetary policy remains committed to its objectiveand does not resign itself to too-low inflation. And, as I emphasised at our last monetarypolicy meeting, we are committed, and are not resigned to having a low rate of inflation forever oreven for now.We have described the overall orientation of our monetary policy as being “patient, persistentand prudent”. Patient, because faced with repeated negative shocks we have had to extend thepolicy horizon. Persistent, because monetary policy will remain sufficiently accommodative toensure the sustained convergence of inflation to our aim. And prudent, because we will pay closeattention to underlying inflation dynamics and to risks and will adjust policy appropriately.141516171819 5 / 8BIS central bankers' speeches
This orientation is expressed in our current policy framework, which allows us to adapt ourforward guidance and react flexibly as the macroeconomic situation evolves. That was illustratedby the monetary policy decisions taken at our meeting earlier in June.Looking forward, the risk outlook remains tilted to the downside, and indicators for the comingquarters point to lingering softness. The risks that have been prominent throughout the past year,in particular geopolitical factors, the rising threat of protectionism and vulnerabilities in emergingmarkets have not dissipated. The prolongation of risks has weighed on exports and in particularon manufacturing.In the absence of improvement, such that the sustained return of inflation to our aim isthreatened, additional stimulus will be required.In our recent deliberations, the members of the Governing Council expressed their conviction inpursuing our aim of inflation close to 2% in a symmetric fashion. Just as our policy frameworkhas evolved in the past to counter new challenges, so it can again. In the coming weeks, theGoverning Council will deliberate how our instruments can be adapted commensurate to theseverity of the risk to price stability.We remain able to enhance our forward guidance by adjusting its bias and its conditionality toaccount for variations in the adjustment path of inflation.This applies to all instruments of our monetary policy stance.Further cuts in policy interest rates and mitigating measures to contain any side effects remainpart of our tools.And the APP still has considerable headroom. Moreover, the Treaty requires that our actions areboth necessary and proportionate to fulfil our mandate and achieve our objective, which impliesthat the limits we establish on our tools are specific to the contingencies we face. If the crisis hasshown anything, it is that we will use all the flexibility within our mandate to fulfil our mandate –and we will do so again to answer any challenges to price stability in the future.All these options were raised and discussed at our last meeting.What matters for our policy calibration is our medium-term policy aim: an inflation rate below, butclose to, 2%. That aim is symmetric, which means that, if we are to deliver that value of inflationin the medium term, inflation has to be above that level at some time in the future.But fiscal policy should play its role. Over the last 10 years, the burden of macroeconomicadjustment has fallen disproportionately on monetary policy. We have even seen instanceswhere fiscal policy has been pro-cyclical and countered the monetary stimulus.If the unbalanced macroeconomic policy-mix in the euro area in part explains the slide intodisinflation, so a better policy mix can help bring it to a close. Monetary policy can always achieveits objective alone, but especially in Europe where public sectors are large, it can do so fasterand with fewer side effects if fiscal policies are aligned with it.Recreating fiscal space by raising potential output through reforms and public investment, andrespecting the European fiscal framework will maintain investor confidence in countries with highpublic debt, low growth and low fiscal space. But as fiscal expansion in the other countries mayhave limited spillovers, national fiscal policies remain constrained. So work on a common fiscalstabilisation instrument of adequate size and design should proceed with broader scope andrenewed determination.Conclusion 6 / 8BIS central bankers' speeches
Let me conclude.The euro was introduced twenty years ago in order to insulate the Single Market from exchange-rate crises and competitive devaluations that would threaten the sustainability of open markets. Itwas also a political project that, relying on the success of the Single Market, would lead to thegreater integration of its Member States.On both counts, the vision of our forefathers has scored relatively well. Imagine where the SingleMarket would be today, after the global financial crisis and rising protectionism, had all countriesin Europe been free to adjust their exchange rates. Instead, our economies integrated, convergedand coped with the most severe challenge since the Great Depression. That leads me to fourobservations.First, the integration of our economies and with it the convergence of our Member States hasalso greatly increased. Misalignments of real effective exchange rates between euro areacountries are about a half those between advanced economies with flexible exchange-rates orcountries linked by pegged exchange rates and they have fallen by around 20% in the seconddecade of EMU relative to the first.Second, the dispersion of growth rates across euro area countries, having fallen considerablysince 1999, is since 2014 comparable to the dispersion across US states. Third, this has beendriven in large part by the deepening of European value chains, with EMU countries nowsignificantly more integrated with each other than the United States or China are with the rest ofthe world. Most EMU countries export more with each other than with the US, China or Russia.Fourth, employment in the euro area has reached record highs and in all euro area countries butone stands above its 1999 level.But the remaining institutional weaknesses of our monetary union cannot be ignored at the costof seriously damaging what has been achieved. Logic would suggest that the more integratedour economies become, the faster should be the completion of banking union and capitalmarkets union, and the faster the transition from a rules-based system for fiscal policies to aninstitution-based fiscal capacity.The journey towards greater integration that our citizens and firms started twenty years ago hasbeen long, far from finished, and with broad but uneven success. But overall, it has strengthenedthe conviction of our peoples that it is only through more Europe that the implications of thisintegration can be managed. For some, that trust may lie in a genuine faith in our commondestiny, for others it comes from the appreciation of the greater prosperity so far achieved, for yetothers that trust may be forced by the increased and unavoidable closeness of our countries. Bethat as it may, that trust it is now the bedrock upon which our leaders can and will build the nextsteps of our EMU.Rostagno et al. (2019), forthcoming.The difference in growth in energy prices between the euro area and the United States can in large part beattributed to differences in tax rates, which are typically higher in the euro area. As such, the share of the finalprice paid by consumers accounted for by oil is much smaller in the euro area, and CPI energy prices are lessaffected in aggregate by movements in oil prices. That being said, the energy component has a higher weight ineuro area HICP, so a 1 percentage point increase in CPI energy prices has a greater impact on headlineinflation in the euro area than in the United States.The equivalent figure for core PCE inflation was 1.9%.Rostagno et al.

  Ghana – EU Business Forum     SPEAKING NOTES: The Challenges on Monetary Policy and Markets  Development in Ghana      DR. MAXWELL OPOKU-AFARI   FIRST DEPUTY GOVERNOR, BANK OF GHANA    JUNE 13, 2019  MOVENPIC HOTEL  ACCRA, GHANA    
 Page | 1   H.E. Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia, Vice-President of the Republic of Ghana Jyrki Katainen, Vice-President of European Commission  H.E. Diana Acconcia, EU Ambassador to Ghana Honourable Ken Ofori-Atta, Minister of Finance of the Republic of Ghana Honourable Robert Ahomka-Lindsay, Deputy Minister of Trade and Industry, Ghana CEOs and Representatives from the Financial Sector and Business Community Distinguished Ladies and Gentlemen    Background  1. Let me start by expressing our appreciation to the organisers of the Ghana – EU Business Forum. Ghana has had very good economic, trade and social relations with the European Union (EU) over the years, and we believe there are even greater opportunities for further socio-economic and trade cooperation in the medium to long term.  2. This Forum provides a unique platform for policymakers, financial sector participants and the business community to share ideas to help facilitate business promotion but also, on a larger scale, to shape the economic and structural transformation agenda we aspire for under the Ghana Beyond Aid agenda.   Let me provide a Brief Overview of Monetary Policy Implementation in Ghana  3. Monetary policy remains and will continue to remain crucial in the macroeconomic management process. The quest to achieve macroeconomic stability, a necessary condition for sustained growth, cannot be overemphasised.   4. In line with the Bank’s primary mandate of price stability, the key goal of the Central Bank’s monetary policy strategy seeks to pursue policies geared towards bringing down inflation to within the targeted bank. Currently, the band is set at 8±2% with a future possibility of reviewing the band target range 
 Page | 2   based on prevailing economic circumstances. With improving macroeconomic fundamentals, the Central Bank has lowered consistently its key policy rate, in line with the disinflation process, from a high rate of 25.5 percent at the end of 2016 to the current level of 16 percent as at May 2019. The Bank has done this by carefully balancing the need to lower rates to help foster vibrancy in economic activity and at the same maintain relatively higher real interest rates to sustain investor interest in the economy.     5. Headline inflation has declined from 15.4% at end 2016 to 9.0% in January 2019, before edging up to 9.5% in April on the back of pass-through effects of the exchange rate depreciation in the first quarter of the year.   6. While there is full commitment on the part of the Central Bank to achieve its price stability mandate, we need to recognize that monetary policy will have to act in concert with other economic parameters for full realization of the desired effects.. In this regards, the transmission mechanism through which policy decisions are channelled to the rest of the economy matters. In the context of the transmission mechanism, the role of banks and financial institutions remain important as they are the primary conduit through which monetary policy decisions impact on the final objectives of price stability and growth.    7. Monetary policy effectiveness therefore requires an efficient financial market system to ensure that monetary policy actions have the desired impact on the economy.  8. Appreciating the role of an efficient financial system, in discussions of monetary policy and market development is very important. Under the Bank’s inflation-targeting framework of monetary policy, short-term interest rates, including the rates at which banks lend to each other are expected to responded to changes in the Monetary 
 Page | 3   Policy Rate (MPR) . This then serves to influence other rates in the financial markets and then finally with impact effects on inflation and output.    MP Implementation Challenges 9. As simple as the transmission process may seem, , there are challenges. Key challenges to effective monetary policy and markets development, in our experience, have centred mostly on the following: Weak and uncompetitive banking sector  • The critical role of banks as the primary conduit for monetary policy suggests that the transmission mechanism is more effective in a competitive banking sector environment. In a weak and uncompetitive banking sector, monetary policy becomes less ineffective because banks become less responsive to changes in monetary policy stance.  • To address some of these challenges in the Ghanaian economy, the Bank of Ghana, over the past two years, has taken steps to recapitalise and undertaken significant reforms in the banking sector to strengthen the industry’s capacity to effectively intermediate. The implementation of new and wide-ranging regulatory reforms should also serve to provide a good-enough basis for enhancing competition and efficiency in the sector.   • Fostering banking competition, efficiency and stability therefore remains key policy objectives that the Bank of Ghana will continue to pursue to facilitate effective monetary policy transmission. High Non-Performing Loans (NPLs)   • The prevalence of high non-performing loans can also limit banks’ lending capacity and/or interfere with policy transmission and therefore impair the effectiveness of monetary policy. Although the banking sector’s NPL ratio has declined from 23.5 percent in April 2018 to 18.9 percent in April 2019, the current ratio still remains very high. With such high NPL levels, transmission mechanism of monetary policy to lending rates is weakened and financial intermediation to support economic activity is constrained.  
 Page | 4    • To make effective the transmission channel through the NPL angle , the Bank of Ghana is engaging banks to improve their risk management frameworks while the loan loss write-off policy is on-going. We are also strengthening credit conditions through the collateral registry and the credit referencing bureaus.   Market development to ease transmission mechanism  • The need to broaden the  scope of government financing needs without crowding out the private sector through the development of a liquid bond market is critical to effectively help manage debt without repercussions on macroeconomic stability. An efficient and liquid bond market provides some scope for effective transmission mechanism for monetary policy.  • With sound fiscal and monetary policies, improved regulatory environment and improved payments and settlement infrastructure, Government has lengthened the yield curve to 15-years on the domestic money market.  • Government re-profiling has supported the shift towards more medium-to-long term bonds to reduce re-financing risks, driving down interest rates at the short-end of the market and has helped correct the yield curve.   External Vulnerabilities • Exchange rate movements are relatively important for a small open-economy with a flexible exchange rate mechanism, like Ghana. Exchange rate dynamics have significant effects on the ultimate goal of price stability and hence on monetary policy decisions.   • The impact effects of external vulnerabilities on the domestic economy are channelled through three main sources – first, with a commodity-dependent export base, the economy is highly vulnerable to negative terms of trade shocks. Second, the increased levels of outflows in the service and income accounts due to the dividends and profit repatriation by large multinational companies in the energy, mining and telecoms sectors pose significant risks to reserves and in the process constrains out ability to effectively deal with shocks. Third, the  increased non-
 Page | 5   resident participation in the domestic bond market has exposed the economy to vulnerabilities stemming from changes in sentiments of these investors. These sources of vulnerabilities, when they materialize, can distort external sector conditions and impact adversely on economic conditions.   • In other words, the provisioning of foreign exchange cover for repatriation of Multi-National Corporations (MNCs) dividends and non-resident investors’ coupon payments, bond maturities and energy-related debt repayments exerts significant foreign exchange pressures. For instance, one of the triggers in the recent exchange rate volatility we experienced was the early redemption and coupon repayments of foreign denominated domestic bonds. These developments reinforce Ghana’s external vulnerability conditions which invariably results in sharp currency movements which impacts inflation and remains a challenge to monetary policy formulation.   • The recent inflation uptick from 9% in January to 9.5% in April 2019 was largely attributed to the pass-through effects of the recent currency depreciation on non-food inflation.  Structural rigidities and supply-side constraints  • The external vulnerability issues highlight the issues of structural rigidities that would need to be addressed alongside ensuring sound macroeconomic condition to ensure exchange rate stability. Issues such as pursuing export diversification, increasing local content, stepping-up domestic production, managing services and income outflows by MNCs, will all have to be addressed head-on. Most of these structural issues are not in the domain of monetary policy, but could pose challenges for monetary policy conduct.  • Structural reforms such as the Government’s industrialization drive under the ‘Ghana beyond Aid’ agenda to improve the manufacturing base of the economy, diversify the structure of the economy and create employment opportunities to increase production should be vigorously pursued.   • Further, the on-going digitization of service delivery processes in the economy will help improve the business environment of the country. Other complementary reforms and institutional 
 Page | 6   arrangements to further improve the business environment and ease production bottlenecks should be pursued to facilitate growth.    Conclusion 10. Distinguished Ladies and Gentlemen, let me conclude by stating that the importance of maintaining macroeconomic stability and ensuring an efficient and robust banking sector are critical to our monetary policy implementation processes. The Bank of Ghana will continue to play its role in ensuring that the economic conditions are conducive to support private sector investment and business growth in the country.         Thank you. 
Nor Shamsiah Mohd Yunus: Shifting tides - future of financeOpening remarks by Ms Nor Shamsiah Mohd Yunus, Governor of the Central Bank of Malaysia(Bank Negara Malaysia), at the MyFintech Week 2019 "Shifting Tides: Future of Finance", KualaLumpur, 17 June 2019.*   *   *I would like to welcome all of you to the inaugural MyFintech Week and Financial IndustryConference hosted by Bank Negara Malaysia. This event is being held at a time that bringstogether two important mileposts for the Malaysian financial services industry - the beginnings ofan exciting era of digitalisation and a new chapter in the development of the financial sector asthe current Financial Sector Blueprint approaches the end of its horizon in 2020."Shifting tides: Future of finance" was deliberately chosen as the theme of the event for a reason.For much of history, human civilisation could not reasonably explain how ocean tides occurred. Itwas only through the discovery by Sir Issac Newton and the dedication of scientists over manycenturies that we are able to understand it today.Like ocean tides, the future of finance may be hard to fathom at the beginning. Yet it offers manyopportunities and risks. Perhaps most importantly, it also underscores the heavy responsibilityand ownership that we collectively bear to build a financial system that is safe, reliable and trulyserves the needs of the people.In my remarks today, I will discuss what this entails in order to develop a financial system for allMalaysians.The world is undergoing dynamic shiftsThe world around us is shifting dramatically. To understand this shift, we should pay attention tofive megatrends.The first is the shift in global economic order with the rise of Asia, including the rising prominenceof ASEAN. The gravity of the global economy is moving to the East. Being the sixth largesteconomy and home to around 650 million people, there is an abundance of opportunity, hope anddynamism in this region. The financial sector will no doubt, be a key player in further catalysingthe growth of ASEAN countries.The second is the risks brought about by climate change. Tackling climate change may be oneof the biggest challenges for humanity in building a sustainable and prosperous future. It couldlead to devastating, wide ranging and irreversible damage to our economy, society and the waywe live. Economic losses in itself could be very significant, as high as USD20 trillion. Insuredlosses from effects of climate change have already increased five-fold in the past 30 years.The third is the rising income inequality that can threaten the fabric of our society. Consider this.The top 1% of the population has captured twice the global income growth of the bottom 50%since 1980. Worse still, inequality has persisted despite large transfers of public to private wealthin many countries.The fourth is the rising populism and protectionist policies. This can be seen in inward lookingpolicies and anti-establishment views that have become more entrenched in parts of the world.Slow growth, lack of economic mobility and erosion of trust in public and private institutions areamong the factors that are likely to have contributed to this. Like undercurrents before a storm,these trends have far reaching implications for political, economic and social systems.Last but not least, the fifth shift is the advancement of technology. This has and will continue to 1 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
dramatically alter the way we behave, interact and transact. Much has been said about thebenefits, but an increasing reliance on technology presents risks that we cannot ignore. Thisincludes issues of data privacy, discrimination or biases and also displacement of certainsegments within society. In the digital age, higher order risks of cyber-attacks and operationaldisruptions are magnified in ways that we have yet to fully comprehend.Calling for a financial system that is relevant, safe and socially responsibleThese five megatrends and finance are deeply intertwined. While undoubtedly finance has helpedto power the economic rise of ASEAN, its role in contributing to an increase in climate risk andinequality cannot be denied.Therefore, as we consider the future of finance, we need to contemplate not only how thesemegatrends may impact finance, but how finance itself can respond to and shape these trends inmore positive ways moving forward.In my mind, this calls for a financial system that is relevant, safe and socially responsible.Finance must be relevant to the needs of the economy. This means that it must offer suitable,cost-effective and quality financial products and services for all segments of society. It must alsorespond to the changing demographics and structure of the economy. For example, as we movetowards becoming a digital economy, the financial sector must accord adequate support toinnovative SMEs, such as those involved in e-commerce.  Equally important, we must rememberthat this imperative is not only for banks, but extends to the other parts of the financial sector.Non-banks such as venture capital and private equity firms, as well as alternative financiers suchas factoring and leasing companies, have an equal stake in this and should also play a moreactive role in financing the needs of businesses. The need to bridge the gaps between 20thcentury finance and the 21st century economy is both compelling and urgent for the wholefinancial sector as conditions remain challenging for the economy domestically and abroad.  Thisis also certainly not the only time that we will face such challenges.To be safe, finance must not sow the seeds of its own destruction and not serve as an amplifierof risk to the economy. The ability of finance to mobilise capital, create leverage and distributerisk allows it to be a powerful force for good. But excessive and unbridled risk taking createsinstability which is harmful not only for the particular firm, but the economy and society at large.There is also a greater need for finance to be socially responsible.  Financial institutions canand must assert the much needed leadership in a world where the continued neglect of equitabledevelopment and a rapidly deteriorating environment is displacing communities, raising socialand political tensions, and putting future generations at grave risk.  Finance still holds the trust ofsociety and substantial influence over economic agents. But this is a privilege earned, anddemands that financial institutions behave ethically, and act in the best interest of thecommunities they serve.The role of technology to revolutionise financeThere is no question that technology will lie at the very heart of these imperatives for the financialsystem.  This has been true for decades, only the order of its impact is now, arguably muchgreater.  After all, the world’s first ATM in 1967 transformed the relationship between people and moneyand making finance more accessible. Today, fintech signals the next phase in the transformationof finance.Fintech holds enormous potential to enhance competition, increase productivity, addressunfulfilled consumer demand and fundamentally change the way institutions provide financial 2 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
services – in ways we may not even have fully discovered.  Similarly for Islamic finance, adoption of technology could present significant opportunities toreduce the cost of financial intermediation and expand access. For example, distributed ledgertechnology could enable automated execution of contracts through the use of digital protocols, orsmart contracts, which can simplify complex Shariah contractual processes. In addition, fintechinitiatives to integrate social finance tools, such as waqf, sadakah and zakat, to offer moreaffordable financial and protection solutions, will be instrumental to serve those who are currentlyfinancially underserved or excluded. The integration of social finance into Islamic financialservices encourages wealth distribution among society to achieve greater balance betweenwealth creation and wealth sharing.Ultimately, fintech in Malaysia should be harnessed to offer inclusive, sustainable and relevantfinancial products and services to serve the needs of all.The responsibility to manage the attendant risksThis however means that we need to be cognisant of the potential risks associated withtechnology.This will be especially important as fintech and bigtech firms become more prominent in thefinancial system. Such firms could pose system-wide vulnerabilities that can amplify shocks tothe financial system and cause financial and economic instability. Increasing reliance andconcentration on third party service providers, including those located offshore, to support criticalfunctions, could also increase operational vulnerabilities in more unpredictable waysThe demands of society for speed, convenience and cost efficiency are at a point wheresubstantial tensions already exist between pressures on financial institutions to accelerate theadoption of technology, and our capacity to manage those risks effectively.  These tensions willonly increase going forward. Managing these tensions at an optimal level will be critical.  It will call for changes to how financialinstitutions internally oversee and manage technology risks, both within and across theirbusiness activities, invest in hard and soft infrastructure and having much deeper collaborationacross institutions and agencies.  Socially responsible finance will also require institutions to carefully consider how technologicalinnovations may create new forms of financial exclusion or raise difficult ethical questions. Clearguidance on acceptable conduct by staff and relevant parties will be needed. This in turn, willrequire financial institutions to reflect on their core values and risk appetite.In short, managing technology risks is not just an operational matter.  It is a strategic one withhigh stakes for individual institutions, as well as the industry and the economy more broadly.  Ourresponse should be commensurate with these stakes.Beyond measures taken at an institutional level, there is a pressing need for the financialindustry, and indeed even the nation, to provide an enabling and secure framework fortechnological innovation; and educate and empower the public to take advantage of innovations.For example, the need to formulate a cohesive, coherent and comprehensive national strategyon cyber security is an urgent need. We can only play our intended role to support the broadereconomy if we are attentive to both strategic and operational considerations of risk.Developing a safe, sound and vibrant financial system through innovation andtechnologyBank Negara Malaysia is committed to play a facilitative role to enable innovation to flourish. Like 3 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
financial institutions, we need to balance the significant benefits of financial innovation with itsrisks. We are also mindful that the calls we make in regulating and supervising the industry canthemselves sometimes, restrain innovation.    Our responses to new financial technologies will continue to be primarily concerned with therisks that they pose to financial stability and consumer protection. In finding the right balance inour overall regulatory and supervisory posture, we will continue to consult widely with the industryand experts in the field.  A key priority for the Bank is to ensure that our regulatory andsupervisory system is appropriately calibrated to encourage innovation, but also has the agility toshift gears when required to respond to new risks. This recognises that innovation withoutstability ultimately destroys value, confidence and undermines our future.What does this mean in practice? There are at least three things, which are each a reflection ofour ongoing efforts to build an enabling, yet safe environment for innovation:First, building interoperable infrastructures. This will start with open and fair access to ashared payment infrastructure for banks and non-banks alike. It is also important torecognise the need for other digital public infrastructures as key enablers to harness the fullpotential of fintech. These include having a national digital identity system, framework foropen API and open banking, clear cloud policy and nationwide broadband connectivity.Second, further differentiating our regulatory and supervisory approach to capture newsources and transmission of risks while allowing room for experimentation and for firms todevelop economies of scale. An important objective will be minimising regulatory arbitrage,which can lead to risks building up in parts of the financial system that may be subject todifferentiated regulations. We anticipate that this will call for a much more dynamic approachto regulation and supervision as well as better communication of regulatory developmentsgoing forward.Third, strengthening platforms for collaboration. In this regard, the Bank, together with thefinancial industry, is in the process of establishing a Financial Threat Intelligence Platform.The platform will collate, analyse and disseminate real time information on cyber threats andtrends to strengthen the detective capabilities of the industry against such threats. Weexpect to operationalise the platform before the year end. I am also pleased to announce theestablishment of a dedicated innovation lab, right here in Sasana Kijang. The lab will providea collaborative environment for the purpose of creating, elaborating, and prototypinginnovative solutions to clearly defined problem statements.Recall that ocean tides present us with both opportunities and risks. The fact that humanity todayis better able to understand, predict and master ocean tides should give us encouragement forthe future of finance. The goal of a relevant, safe and socially responsible financial system canbe attained by focusing our energies toward this shared goal in which we all have a criticalstake.  Much like a “rising tide that lifts all boats”, the actions and choices that we make within thefinancial system do not just affect the provision of financial services, but have importantimplications for the well being of society and our economic prospects as a nation. We owe thisnot only to ourselves and others at this point in time, but especially to our future generations. With that in mind, this event provides a valuable opportunity for us to reflect on a broad range ofissues that can help us move forward with greater confidence. Let me leave you with threequestions to ponder as you do so:First, what are the barriers preventing the industry from working together more closely tounlock the true potential of finance?Second, have firms in the industry achieved the right balance in their adoption of technologyin finance and capacity to manage the attendant risks?Third, how can we scale financial innovation to create greater value for society, including 4 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
advancing inclusive and responsible finance as well as the sustainability agenda?On that note, it gives me great pleasure to formally launch MyFintech Week and the FinancialIndustry Conference.  I wish all of you an informative and productive week ahead. 5 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
Sabine Lautenschläger: Transformation of the retail and wholesalepayments landscape in EuropeSpeech by Ms Sabine Lautenschläger, Member of the Executive Board of the European CentralBank, at the European Association of Co-operative Banks, Berlin, 14 June 2019.*   *   *The European payments market has come a long way since 1992 when the Maastricht Treatylaid the foundation for the euro as a single currency.The road may have occasionally been long and winding but the facts speak for themselves:today, the euro is the second most used currency in the world and the Single Euro PaymentsArea (SEPA) which extends beyond the EU affects the lives and businesses of over 500 millionpeople, 20 million companies and 4,000 payment service providers. The European paymentsmarket generates more than 130 billion non-cash payments per year, representing approximatelyone-quarter of the global payments business.For more than 20 years, Europe has strived to improve the efficiency and competitiveness of thepayments market. Substantial achievements have been made over the years and what somepeople used to consider challenging, or even impossible, has now become part of our everydaylives.The SEPA project is a perfect example. Having enjoyed the ease of SEPA payments since 2014,we can hardly remember a time when credit transfers and direct debits functioned smoothlywithin countries but not necessarily across borders.Like many of Europe’s other achievements, advances in retail payments are all too easily takenfor granted. It took approximately 12 years to harmonise credit transfers and direct debits acrossEurope, but today’s users can rely on a single account for their payments business within theSEPA area and freely choose payment service providers based on quality and costs rather thanlocation. And competition between payment service providers now takes place on a level playingfield.So what has been the key driver of past success? Beyond doubt, it is the cooperation betweenpayment stakeholders in Europe. Since the payments market is a network industry, cooperationand coordination among market players are of utmost importance.We at the ECB are well aware of the importance of European-wide cooperation.In 2013, we established the Euro Retail Payments Board (ERPB) with the objective of furtherdeepening such cooperation. This high-level strategic body brings together the supply anddemand sides of the European retail payments market. A great deal has been achieved underthe umbrella of the ERPB thanks to the efforts of all involved and I am pleased to see that furtherwork on developing innovative and competitive payment services is under way.The ERPB’s most important work at the moment relates to instant payments. I will later explainwhy I think that the ERPB’s work on instant payments is so important for the future of anintegrated European payments market.The ERPB can be considered the cradle of euro instant payments. In response to its call for thedevelopment of a pan-European instant payment scheme, the market delivered: the EuropeanPayments Council (EPC) developed the Instant Credit Transfer (SCT Inst) scheme in November2017.For the first time in Europe, a significant payment scheme was established with full stakeholder 1 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
involvement, both on the supply and demand sides, and in a remarkably short amount of time.Some 51% of European payment service providers that offer credit transfer services arereachable for instant payments by now.The Eurosystem also responded to the increasing need for instant payments by developingTARGET instant payment settlement (TIPS), which is based on the SCT Inst scheme.Launched in November 2018, this pan-European market infrastructure allows payment serviceusers to send and receive payments instantly and around the clock within Europe. Offeringinstant payment services at the European level ensures that any bank account holder in Europecan be reached. It minimises the potential risk of the payments market fragmenting. Assettlement in TIPS takes place in central bank money, it also eliminates credit risk for theparticipating banks.Instant payments – a challenge and an opportunity for European payment stakeholdersSo, why am I focusing so much on instant payments today? Well, I am convinced that instantpayments are the new challenge currently facing payment stakeholders in Europe. And I firmlybelieve that only a pan-European solution for instant payments will turn this challenge into anopportunity for Europe.I would therefore encourage all payment service providers that have not yet implemented SCTInst, to do so as soon as possible.In fact, instant payments may well be the game changer in the payments market, paving the wayfor innovative European payment solutions.We are embarking on a new era in which the pace of technological change is challengingpolicymakers and central banks as well as incumbent market players. Evolutions, andsometimes even revolutions, in both technology and user needs are facilitating the emergence ofnew players in the payments ecosystem. This brings competition and boosts the range of choicefor consumers.Changes in the payments industry have always been driven by customer demand forconvenience, speed and efficiency. New technical solutions have even further nurtured thesedevelopments.Given the prevalence of smartphones and other mobile devices, today’s customers are used todoing things on the spot. They want to make payments instantly, anytime, and anywhere, andexpect them to be as readily available as instant messages, instant videos or Instagram.The EPC’s creation of the SCT Inst scheme came in response to these users’ expectations. Andinstant clearing and settlement infrastructures have already been established, most notablyTIPS.But, in the long run, simply being reachable for incoming payments initiated by other banks’customers will not be enough. I am convinced that banks need to offer even more innovative andefficient solutions for their customers and I would advise them to embrace the instant paymentsspace as an opportunity to remain relevant players in the payments business.One area in which solutions have already emerged is payments between individuals, or so-calledperson-to-person payments.But we also need solutions encompassing payments at merchants, at the point-of-interaction(POI), both physical and virtual. In fact, some end-user solutions for instant payments at the pointof interaction are already emerging across Europe. But they tend to be limited geographically,meaning that each solution is only usable in one or a few (neighbouring) countries. This certainly 2 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
does not point to an integrated European payments market.In addition, in many instances, such regional solutions are not interoperable with each other. Forexample, although many solutions use QR codes that consumers can scan with their mobiledevices, they have not implemented a common standard for these codes.So, there is a clear need for standardisation to enable European consumers to pay EU-wideusing interoperable solutions. In this context, the ERPB set up a working group to analyse indetail the barriers to the pan-European reach of point-of-interaction solutions. It will report backon the outcome of this work by November 2019. I hope to obtain useful input from this work.Because if we do not achieve interoperability among national and regional solutions, as difficultas it may be, we run a serious risk of fragmentation of the European market.Let me explain why I am concerned about the risk of increasing fragmentation through nationalpoint-of-interaction instant payment solutions.At the moment, users who want to pay effortlessly at European level have to find alternatives tothis fragmented landscape. Appropriate solutions may not be based on the European schemes,but they may be provided by large platforms which can offer the desired network effects thanksto their large global customer base.But there are currently only a limited number of providers allowing for payments at pan-Europeanlevel. This leads me to the following question: how should we consider the dependency on only ahandful of big payment providers from a competition and diversity point of view? In the long run, alack of competition may reduce the quality of services to the detriment of their users. Isn’t there aneed for truly pan-European instant payment solutions, which would offer support to manypayment providers?The SCT Inst scheme – a pan-European scheme for instant payments – and the pan-Europeanmarket infrastructure for processing such payments, like TIPS, represent a unique opportunity fordeveloping a truly pan-European solution for instant payments at the point-of-interaction.Such solution could be designed to be as convenient as existing solutions at point-of-interactionthat are based on other payment instruments. The inherent benefits of instant payments wouldthus materialise for all stakeholders.Consumers would be able to use them anywhere in Europe and eventually also at global level.Users would also have a consistent payment experience within and between countries.By accepting instant payments at the point-of-interaction, merchants across Europe, too, wouldbenefit from more efficient liquidity management and higher cost efficiencies. Those merchantsor other businesses that today do not accept cards due to their associated costs could offerusers the opportunity to pay electronically.And finally banks could also benefit from higher cost efficiencies and generate new revenuestreams. They would also be in a position to design such a solution under their own governanceaccording to the needs of their customers.To make this vision a reality, further actions from market participants are needed. These actionsdo not need to be revolutionary. As I said before, Europe already has with SCT Inst scheme andTIPS some of the necessary building blocks in place to develop such a solution.In order to realise the potential of such a European solution, cooperation is once again essential.Banks, merchants and other relevant stakeholders across Europe should work together to findthe best way forward.Increasing efficiency in wholesale payments 3 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
Let me now briefly turn to the area of wholesale payments and our plans to increase efficiency inthis segment.Since well before TIPS, the Eurosystem has been offering efficient and safe marketinfrastructures that form the backbone of the financial sector. I am referring here in particular tothe two TARGET services: TARGET2-Securities (T2S) in the field of securities settlement andTARGET2 in the field of wholesale or large-value payments.The current economic and technological developments call for even more effective and efficientliquidity management services. In order to meet this demand, the Eurosystem will extend andenhance its provision of market infrastructure services for high-value payments. It will do so byintegrating TARGET2 with TARGET2-Securities and TIPS.This consolidation will also allow TARGET2 to benefit from the state-of-the-art approaches andtechnologies offered by T2S. This will be achieved through technical integration in the domains ofconnectivity, data management and other key enabling components, such as billing.There are further advantages: we not only expect a decrease in the running costs of theTARGET services. It will also act as a catalyst for smoother and stronger operability. And theharmonisation of functionalities across all TARGET services should lead to major improvementsin their usability for participants and service operators alike.The T2-T2S consolidation project is scheduled to go live in November 2021.ConclusionLet me conclude.Technological innovation and evolving user needs are reshaping the market infrastructure andpayments landscape on a global scale. Cooperation between European market players isessential to reap the opportunities and address the challenges deriving from such change.Cooperation is also key to the continuous provision of efficient and safe payments services inEurope. And cooperation is indispensable for Europe to remain competitive in the globalpayments market. The ECB strongly supports such cooperative spirit, as shown by the work ofthe ERPB.With instant payments, European stakeholders have developed a competitive and new paymentinstrument. Why not take advantage of this potential? Current achievements, such as SCT Instand TIPS, should facilitate future work towards increasing the efficiency of the Europeanpayments market.Pan-European solutions based on instant payments would be a chance for Europe to strengthenits role in payment innovation to the benefit of all EU citizens and businesses. Let us worktogether on this future-oriented approach and help Europe going forward. 4 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
SpeechThe Labour Market and Spare CapacityPhilip Lowe GovernorAddress to a Committee for Economic Development of Australia(CEDA) Event Adelaide – 20 June 2019I would like to thank CEDA for the invitation to address this lunch. It is a great pleasure to be back inAdelaide and to participate in another CEDA event.Those of you who follow the RBA closely would have noticed frequent references to the labourmarket in our recent communication. Today, I would like to explain why this is so and also discusshow we assess the amount of spare capacity in the labour market. I will then finish with somecomments on monetary policy.The Broad Policy FrameworkStudents of central bank history would be aware that the Reserve Bank Act was passed by theAustralian Parliament in 1959 – 60 years ago. In terms of monetary policy, the Parliament set threebroad objectives for the Reserve Bank Board. It required the Board to set monetary policy so as tobest contribute to:i. The stability of the currencyii. The maintenance of full employmentiii. The economic prosperity and welfare of the people of AustraliaThese objectives have remained unchanged since 1959. Here, in Australia, we did not follow thefashion in some other parts of the world over recent decades of setting just a single goal for thecentral bank – that is, inflation control. In my view it was very sensible not to follow this fashion. Ourlegislated objectives – having three elements – are broader than those of many other central banks.The third of our three objectives serves as a constant reminder that the ultimate objective of ourpolicies is the collective welfare of the Australian people.[*]
From an operational perspective, though, the flexible inflation target is the centre piece of ourmonetary policy framework. The target – which has been agreed to with successive governments –is to deliver an average rate of inflation over time of 2–3 per cent. Our focus is on the average andon the medium term.Inflation averaging 2 point something constitutes a reasonable definition of price stability. Achievingthis stability helps us with our other objectives. Low and stable inflation is a precondition to theattainment of full employment and it promotes our collective welfare. As I have said on otheroccasions, we are not targeting inflation because we are inflation nutters. Rather, we are doing sobecause delivering low and stable inflation is the most effective way for Australia's central bank topromote our collective welfare.So where does the labour market fit into all this?The answer is that it is central to all three objectives.The connection with the second objective – full employment – is obvious. The RBA is seeking toachieve the lowest rate of unemployment that can be sustained without inflation becoming an issue.In doing this, one of the questions we face is what constitutes full employment in a modern economywhere work arrangements are much more flexible than they were in the past. I will return to thisissue in a moment.The labour market is, of course, also central to the third objective in our mandate – our collectivewelfare. It is stating the obvious to say that for many Australians, having a good job at a decent rateof pay is central to their economic prosperity.Trends in the labour market also have a major bearing on inflation outcomes, so they are importantfor the first element of our mandate as well. Over time, there is a close link between wages growthand inflation. And a critical influence on wage outcomes is the balance between supply and demandin the labour market; or in other words how much spare capacity is there in the labour market? Thisquestion is closely linked to the one about what constitutes full employment.So, it is natural that we focus on the labour market as the Board makes its monthly decisions aboutinterest rates.Spare CapacityWith that background I would now like to discuss how we assess the degree of spare capacity in theAustralian labour market. I will do this from four perspectives:1. The rates of unemployment and underemployment2. The flexibility of labour supply3. The effectiveness with which people are matched with job vacancies4. Trends in wages growth.
Unemployment and underemploymentThe conventional measure of spare capacity in the labour market is the gap between the actualunemployment rate and the unemployment rate associated with full employment. Even at fullemployment, some level of unemployment is to be expected as workers leave jobs and search fornew ones. As my colleague Luci Ellis discussed last week, we don't directly observe theunemployment rate associated with full employment – we need to estimate it. Over recent timesthere has been a gradual accumulation of evidence which has led to lower estimates. While it is notpossible to pin the number down exactly, the evidence is consistent with an estimate below5 per cent, perhaps around 4½ per cent. Given that the current unemployment rate is 5.2 per cent,this suggests that there is still spare capacity in our labour market.The fact that the conventional estimate of spare capacity is based on the unemployment rate reflectsan implicit assumption that if you have a job you are pretty much fully employed. In decades past,this might have been a reasonable assumption. But it is not a realistic assumption in today's modernflexible labour market.As more people work part time, it has become increasingly common to be both employed and towork fewer hours than you want to work. In the 1960s, less than one in ten workers worked parttime (Graph 1). Today, one in three of us works part time. Almost one in two women work part timeand more than one in two younger workers work part time.Graph 1[1]
A few more facts are perhaps helpful here. According to the ABS, around 3 million people work parttime because they want to, not because they can't find a full-time job. Most people who are workingpart time do so because they are studying or have caring responsibilities, or for other personalreasons. So we should not think of part-time jobs as being bad jobs, and full-time jobs as being goodjobs. Rather, one of the success stories of the Australian labour market is that we have been able toaccommodate this desire for part-time work and flexibility.Having said that, around one-quarter of people working part time are not satisfied with the hoursthey are offered and would like to work more hours: we can think of these people as underemployed(Graph 2). The share of part-time workers who are underemployed moves up and down from year toyear, and the current share is above its average level over the past two decades.Graph 2As part of the ABS's monthly survey of 50,000 people, it asks underemployed workers how manyextra hours they would like to work. On average, they answer that they would like to work an extra14 hours per week. It is interesting that this figure has trended down over the past two decades; itused to be more than 16 hours. Over the same period, the average hours worked by part-timeworkers has increased by around 2 hours to 17 hours per week. Taken together, these data suggestthat businesses are doing a better job of providing the hours that part-time workers are seeking.
This shift to part-time work means that in assessing spare capacity we need to consider measures ofunderemployment as well as measures of unemployment. The RBA has been doing this for sometime. As part of our efforts here, we have constructed a measure of underutilisation that takesaccount of the part-time workers who want to work more hours. This measure adds the extra hourssought by these workers to the hours sought by those who are unemployed (Graph 3). Theseextra hours are equivalent to around 3.3 per cent of the labour force, which, taking account ofconventional unemployment, means that the underutilisation rate is 8.1 per cent. This hours-basedmeasure is preferable to heads-based measures of underutilisation that treats an unemployed personin the same way as a part-time worker seeking a few more hours.Graph 3Unlike the unemployment rate, which has trended down over the past 20 years, theunderemployment rate has been relatively stable. These different patterns in unemployment andunderemployment suggest that fewer inroads have been made into spare capacity in the labourmarket than suggested by looking at the unemployment rate alone. This is something we take intoaccount in thinking about monetary policy.There is, though, one other perspective on the measure of underemployment that I would like toshare with you. In the past, when part-time work was not as readily available, many people – mostlywomen – faced the choice of taking full-time paid employment or no paid employment at all. Many[2]
chose to, or had to stay outside the labour force because working was not a realistic option. Fromthe perspective of society as a whole, this was a serious form of underutilisation – it just wasn'tmeasured as such by the ABS.Given the trend towards part-time and more flexible jobs, people have more options than they hadbefore and many have chosen to join, or have deferred leaving, the labour force. From theperspective of adding to the productive capacity of the nation, this is a good outcome and if therewas a measure of underutilisation that took account of exclusion from the workforce, it would surelyhave declined. I don't want to downplay the issue of underemployment, but it is worth recognisingthis broader perspective, and remembering where we have come from.Flexibility of the supply sideThis naturally brings me to my second window into spare capacity in the labour market – theflexibility of labour supply.Over the past 2½ years, the working-age population has increased at an annual rate of around1¾ per cent. Over that same time period, employment has increased at an average rate of2¾ per cent. The fact that employment has been increasing considerably faster than the working-age population has led to a reduction in the unemployment rate, but the reduction is not as large asmight have been expected. The reason for this is that the supply of labour has increased in responseto the stronger demand for workers.This flexibility in labour supply is evident in the substantial rise in labour force participation. Theparticipation rate currently stands at 66 per cent, which is the highest on record (Graph 4).Reflecting this, the share of the working-age population in Australia with a job is currently aroundthe record high it reached at the peak of the resources boom. As I discussed a few moments ago,the availability of part-time and flexible working arrangements is one reason for this.[3]
Graph 4There are two groups for which the rise in participation has been particularly pronounced: womenand older Australians (Graph 5). The female participation rate now stands at 61 per cent, up from43 per cent in 1979. Australia's female participation rate is now above the OECD average, although itremains below that of a number of countries, including Canada and the Netherlands.The participation rate of older workers has also increased over recent decades as health outcomeshave improved and changes have been made to retirement policies. The eligibility age for thepension was progressively raised from 60 to 65 for females and is now being gradually increased to67 for everybody by 2023. The preservation age at which individuals can access their superannuationis also being gradually increased. These changes are contributing to higher participation by olderAustralians.
Graph 5Another source of potential labour supply is net overseas migration. Migration, including temporaryskilled workers, increased sharply during the resources boom when demand for skilled labour wasvery strong, and has subsequently declined (Graph 6). While migrants add to both demand andsupply in the economy, they can be a particularly important source of capacity for resolving pinch-points where skill shortages exist.
Graph 6A related source of flexibility stems from our unique relationship with New Zealand. When labourdemand is relatively strong in Australia, there tends to be an increase in the net inflow of workersfrom New Zealand to Australia. When conditions are relatively subdued here, the reverse occurs.During the resources boom, the inflow from across the Tasman was as large as the inflow oftemporary skilled workers.The overall picture here is one of a flexible supply side of the labour market. When the demand forlabour is strong, more people enter the jobs market or delay leaving. This rise in participation is apositive development. But it is one of the factors that has meant that strong demand for labour hasnot put much upward pressure on wages.The matching of people with jobsA third perspective on spare capacity in the labour market can be gained from examining how wellpeople looking for jobs are matched with the jobs that are available. Looking at the labour marketfrom this perspective, things look a little tighter than suggested by the other two perspectives that Ihave discussed.Currently, almost 60 per cent of firms report that the availability of labour is either a minor or amajor constraint on their business (Graph 7). This share is not as high as it was during the resourcesboom, but it is still quite high. Reports from the RBA's liaison program suggest that there arecurrently shortages of certain types of engineers, workers with specialised IT skills and some
tradespeople associated with public infrastructure work. Businesses in regional areas are also morelikely to report a greater degree of difficulty finding suitable labour.Graph 7One contributing factor here is an underinvestment in staff training. In the shadow of the globalfinancial crisis many firms cut back training to reduce costs. We are now seeing some evidence ofthe adverse longer-term implications of this. As the labour market tightens further, I would hope thatmore firms are prepared to hire workers and provide the necessary training.Another lens on job matching is the ratio of the number of unemployed people to the number of jobvacancies (Graph 8). At present, there are fewer than three unemployed people for each vacancy.This compares with over 20 people for every vacancy in the early 1990s recession and five people forevery vacancy in 2014. From this perspective the labour market looks reasonably tight. There is alsosome tentative evidence that, on average, unemployed workers are not as well matched to jobvacancies as was the case in 2007, when the ratio of the two was at a similar level.
Graph 8One such piece of evidence is that as the unemployment rate has come down over recent years,there has been little progress on reducing very long-term unemployment, defined as those who areunemployed for more than two years (Graph 9). Addressing the causes of this chronicunemployment remains an important challenge for our community. More positively, the share of thelabour force that has been unemployed between one and two years has trended down over recenttimes.
Graph 9Another lens on job matching and the overall tightness of the labour market is the rate of jobmobility; that is, how often people change their jobs. Here, the evidence is interesting. Despite thefrequent reports of a lack of job security and regular job switching by millennials, the average timethat workers are staying with an employer is increasing. Reflecting this, the share of employedpeople who switch employers in a given year is the lowest it has been in a long time (Graph 10).Looking at the data by occupation, the rate of job mobility is lowest for managers and businessprofessionals and highest for tradespeople and workers in the hospitality industry.
Graph 10In a tight labour market, we would expect to see either strong wages growth or frequent jobchanging as businesses seek out workers. But we are seeing neither at present. One possibleexplanation for this is the uncertainty that many people feel about the future. This uncertaintymeans that if you have a job you want to keep it rather than take a risk with a new employer. Thismight be especially so if you also have a large mortgage. So it is possible that the high level ofhousehold debt is also affecting labour market dynamics.WagesI will now turn to the fourth perspective on labour market tightness – that is wages growth.Over the past year, wages growth has picked up as the labour market tightened. This is notsurprising given the strength of demand for labour. But the pick-up has been fairly modest and isonly evident in the private sector (Graph 11). Over the past year, the private-sector Wage PriceIndex increased by 2.4 per cent, up from 1.9 per cent in the previous year. The past two quartershave, however, seen lower wage increases than in the previous two quarters.In contrast to trends in the private sector, wages growth in the public sector has been steady ataround 2½ per cent, largely reflecting the wage caps across much of the public sector.
It is also worth pointing out that overall wages growth in New South Wales and Victoria has beenrunning at just 2½ per cent despite the unemployment rate being 4½ per cent or lower over thepast year.Graph 11Another perspective on wages growth is from the national accounts, which reports average earningsper hour worked (Graph 12). This measure is volatile, but the latest data painted a fairly weakpicture, with average hourly earnings up by just 1 per cent over the past year.
Graph 12In summary, the overall picture from these various windows into the labour market is that despitethe strong employment growth over recent times, there is still considerable spare capacity in thelabour market. We remain short of the unemployment rate associated with full employment, there issignificant underemployment and there is further potential for labour force participation to increasewhen the jobs are there. Consistent with all of this, wages growth remains modest and is below therate that would ensure that inflation is comfortably within the 2 to 3 per cent range. The one caveatto this assessment is the difficulty that some firms are having finding workers with the necessaryskills. This underlines the importance of workplace training.Monetary PolicyI would like to finish with a few words on monetary policy.As you are aware, the Reserve Bank Board reduced the cash rate to 1¼ per cent at its meetingearlier this month. This was the first adjustment in nearly three years.This decision was not in response to a deterioration in the economic outlook since the previousupdate was published in early May. Rather, it reflected a judgement that we could do better than thepath we looked to be on.

All rights reserved.The Reserve Bank of Australia acknowledges the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples of Australia as the Traditional Custodians of thisland, and recognises their continuing connection to Country. We pay our respects to their Elders, past, present and emerging.The analysis that I have shared with you today supports the conclusion that the Australian economycan sustain a higher rate of employment growth and a lower unemployment rate than previouslythought likely. Most indicators suggest that there is still a fair degree of spare capacity in theeconomy. It is both possible and desirable to reduce that spare capacity. Doing so will see morepeople in jobs, reduce underemployment and boost household incomes. It will also provide greaterconfidence that inflation will increase to be comfortably within the medium-term target range.Monetary policy is one way of helping get us onto to a better path. The decision earlier this monthwill assist here. It will support the economy through its effect on the exchange rate, lowering thecost of finance and boosting disposable incomes. In turn, this will support employment growth andinflation consistent with the target.It would, however, be unrealistic to expect that lowering interest rates by ¼ of a percentage pointwill materially shift the path we look to be on. The most recent data – including the GDP and labourmarket data – do not suggest we are making any inroads into the economy's spare capacity. Giventhis, the possibility of lower interest rates remains on the table. It is not unrealistic to expect afurther reduction in the cash rate as the Board seeks to wind back spare capacity in the economyand deliver inflation outcomes in line with the medium-term target.It is important though to recognise that monetary policy is not the only option, and there arelimitations to what can be achieved. As a country we should also be looking at other ways to getcloser to full employment. One option is fiscal policy, including through spending on infrastructure.Another is structural policies that support firms expanding, investing, innovating and employingpeople. Both of these options need to be kept in mind as the various arms of public policy seek tomaximise the economic prosperity of the people of Australia.Thank you for listening. I would be happy to answer your questions.EndnotesI would like to thank Natasha Cassidy, Blair Chapman and Ewan Rankin for assistance in the preparation of this talk.[*]Ellis L (2019), ‘Watching the Invisibles’, The 2019 Freebairn Lecture in Public Policy, University of Melbourne, 12June.[1]The ABS also produces a similar ‘volume’ measure of underutilisation with a much shorter history.[2]For more on trends in workplace flexibility and the rise in part-time work see Heath A (2018), ‘The EvolvingAustralian Labour Market’, Speech at the Business Educators Australasia 2018 Biennial Conference, Canberra,5 October.[3]

Benjamin E Diokno: Sustaining the Philippine growth momentumSpeech by Mr Benjamin E Diokno, Governor of Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP, the centralbank of the Philippines), at the Rotary Club of Manila centennial year celebration, Manila, 6 June2019.*   *   *President Susing Pineda, fellow rotarians, friends, all the RCM Journalism Awardees specialguests, ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon.Thank you for inviting me to be one of your speakers in this historical centennial anniversarycelebration of the Rotary Club of Manila. Not many organizations have the distinction of reachingthe all-important “century” milestone. Attaining this momentous landmark is certainly not a walk inthe park for any organization. That the RCM have lasted this long is a reflection not only of itslong-standing commitment to its ideals and goals, but also of its dynamism, relevance, andinfluence to the community it serves. For this, the men of the RCM deserve our congratulations!(Governor leads applause).I thus consider it a privilege that I stand here before you today to share with you the BSP’sassessment of the country’s growth prospects. The Philippine economy is sound, its prospectsare bright. Along many dimensions, allow me to highlight several factors that continue to steerour story of resilience and stability, and to point out some key challenges that need to beaddressed in our drive towards sustainable and balanced growth.Let me begin with this slide which shows that overall prospects for the Philippine economy for2019 and in 2020 remain bright, amid mounting global uncertainties along with emergingdomestic challenges.While the Q1 2019 growth of the Philippine economy of 5.6 percent was short of our target of 6.0to 7.0 percent, it remains one of the highest in the region and perhaps the world. Thisperformance was achieved notwithstanding the delay in the approval of the 2019 national budgetwhich held back the implementation of key programs and projects.Based on the statistics by the National Economic Development Authority (NEDA), the Philippineeconomy should have grown by at least one percentage point higher, at 6.6 to 7.2 percent in thefirst quarter, had the 2019 fiscal program been approved on time. Nonetheless, the governmenthas crafted a “catch-up” plan to make up for the lower-than-planned state spending in the firstquarter. And the consensus is that we will hit our target of 6-7% growth this year.On the supply side, economic activity was boosted mainly by the services sectors’ robustperformance. Meanwhile, the strong expansion in both investments and consumer spending alsosupported growth on the demand side. With the sustained 81 consecutive quarters (spanningmore than 2 decades from 1999 to 2019) of uninterrupted growth, we remain optimistic that thePhilippine economy can sustain its growth momentum over the medium term.Third-party assessors share the same optimism. Shown in this slide are the growth projectionsreleased by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank (WB) and the AsianDevelopment Bank (ADB) in their latest surveillance reports.The World Bank just reaffirmed, they are sticking to 6.4 percent growth this year for our country.These third-party assessments are also not far from the NEDA’s target for 2019. It may be notedthat the Development Budget Coordination Committee (DBCC), during its meeting on 13 March2019, approved a Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth target range of 6.0 percent – 7.0percent for 2019, 6.5 percent – 7.5 percent in 2020, and 7.0 percent – 8.0 percent from 2021 to2022.   1 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
In addition, the strength of the Philippine economy was further validated with the upgrade in oursovereign credit rating by Standard & Poor’s to BBB+ with a stable outlook. This is the highestletter grade for the foreign currency and an improvement from the BBB grade for the localcurrency rating. At the same time, Fitch—another rating agency—recently affirmed thePhilippines’ investment BBB rating, also with a stable outlook.  Recent demand indicators continue to point to overall firm domestic growth prospects in the nearterm. In fact, results of the Q1 2019 survey-based consumer and business sentiment showed animproved outlook. The consumer outlook index registered an all-time largest quarter-on-quarterincrease since the start of the nationwide survey in Q1 2007.At the same time, the confidence index for business showed marked improvement after decliningfor four consecutive quarters.Furthermore, with the end of the 2019 budget impasse, the continued implementation of thegovernment’s infrastructure program – which we fondly call “Build, Build, Build” – is envisioned togenerate an “impressive multiplier effect” on the economy by increasing its productive capacity,creating jobs, raising incomes, and enhancing the investment climate in the country.Moving on to inflation dynamics, price pressures have gone down significantly, falling toward themidpoint (at 3.0 percent in April 2019) of the target band. This brought the year-to-date (January –April) average to 3.6 percent year-on-year for 2019. This is firmly within the government’s 2-4percent target range.This is a stark contrast to last year’s rapidly rising inflation figures that was only arrested throughthe adoption of timely monetary action by the BSP and non-monetary measures by the Executivedepartment.Looking ahead, we expect inflation to remain on a target-consistent path for 2019 and 2020. Thelatest baseline forecasts (as of 9 May 2019 MB policy meeting) indicate that inflation is projectedto average at 2.9 percent this year while inflation forecast for next year is slightly higher at 3.1percent. This is due largely to the rebound in global crude oil prices.Similarly, forecasts of other institutions generally convey the same expectations. Results of theBSP’s April 2019 survey of private sector economists showed lower mean inflation forecast for2019 at 3.1 percent down from 3.3 percent in the previous survey round. The mean inflationforecasts for 2020 and 2021 both declined to 3.3 percent from 3.4 percent. Meanwhile,projections from other institutions also show inflation within target for this year and the next.Given prevailing conditions, the BSP decided to reduce its policy rate by 25 basis points (bps) to4.50 percent from 4.75 percent, effective 10 May 2019. The BSP also pre-announced a phased200-bp reserve requirement reduction for universal and commercial banks, thrift banks (TBs)and non-bank financial institutions with quasi-banking functions (NBQBs); as well as a 100-bpRR reduction on demand deposits and NOW accounts for rural and cooperative banks.Moreover, long-term negotiable certificates of time deposit (LTNCDs) will have uniformed RRratio of 4.0 percent.In reducing the BSP’s policy rate and reserve requirement ratios, the Monetary Board recognizedthe progressive decline in domestic inflation. It was further guided by the target-consistentinflation path with inflation expectations converging with the government’s target. This is also partof the BSP’s ongoing initiative to enhance the effectiveness of monetary policy and deependomestic money market.Nevertheless, we recognize the uncertainty in the global economic environment, with the IMFfurther revising down its global growth prospects due to volatilities in commodity prices,uncertainty over advanced economies’ policy normalization, as well as ongoing trade tensions as 2 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
a result of the US-China [trade] war.But while the external environment is challenging, I am cautiously optimistic about the currentstate of the Philippine economy.“Keeping our house in order” remains the first and best line of defense. We are improvingeconomic openness through liberalization of trade and foreign direct investment, we areenhancing external competitiveness by strengthening domestic industries; we are diversifyingproducts and markets to non-traditional growing economies; and we are sustaining domesticeconomic resilience by building adequate buffers. These are some of the policy actions andreforms that we can pursue or continue to pursue in order to ward off the potential negativeeffects of external shocks, especially from rising protectionist measures and heightened policyuncertainty.Let me talk briefly about the US-China trade dispute. There was no direct imposition against thePhilippines in terms of the country’s exposure to the products imposed with tit-for-tat measuresbetween US and China. But the extent of impact would depend on the industries affected. Forinstance, the Philippines could possibly boost exports of food and agricultural products to the US,taking advantage of the tariffs imposed on Chinese goods of similar nature. The same goes forUS agricultural goods imposed with steep tariffs by China.We see one positive impact that the US-China trade war could have on the Philippine electronicsindustry. That is if companies on either or both of the countries use the Philippines as analternative manufacturing site. This scenario, however, would take time and the Philippines wouldhave to compete with other potential relocation sites like Vietnam and Indonesia. The potentialupside may not come about for a few years as firms would need to complete the lengthy processof shifting production sites.We also recognize that the continued trade friction could negatively affect overall investmentsentiment and increase caution and uncertainty in the global growth prospects. This could takeits toll on the country’s external sector. Nevertheless, given that the economy’s growth is mainlydriven by domestic demand, the trade friction would have limited negative impact on Philippineexports.Before I close, let me emphasize the importance of sustained collaboration between thegovernment and the private sector in pursuing hard yet necessary structural reforms to fuel thePhilippine growth engine over the long-term.Towards the end of the administration of the late president Corazon Aquino, a world class teamof economist, headed by no less than Paul Krugman, analyzed the Philippine economy. And theyconcluded that given the economic conditions at that time, during President Cory Aquino’s time,the long-term growth of the Philippine economy was in the neighborhood of 3 percent. Repeat, 3percent. We could only grow at 3 percent. That was then. Things are significantly different now.Over the past 25 years, meaningful reforms have helped build and fortify the institutions thatfacilitate growth by expanding the role of market forces in key sectors of the economy;encouraging investments and private sector activity; removing bottlenecks for doing business inthe country; and strengthening the country’s fiscal position and the financial sector, to name justa few.No doubt, the Duterte administration is in a strong position to push for reforms by leveraging onits strong political capital as evidenced by the number of laws enacted in less than 3 years of thecurrent administration’s leadership. These include, among others, recent enactment of the taxreforms, amendments to the BSP Charter and Rice Tariffication Law. These reforms, along withthe other structural reforms in the pipeline, will continue to play a significant role in propelling theeconomy on a path of balanced, sustainable, and inclusive growth. 3 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
Let me take the chance to talk about Republic Act No. 11211 which was signed on 14 February2019. This is a monumental milestone for the BSP. Our three pillars of central banking—pricestability, financial stability, and an efficient payments and settlements system—were furtherboosted with the expansion of the BSP’s policy toolkit.  RA 11211 restored the BSP’s authority to issue its own debt papers as part of its regularmonetary operations, establishes a stronger prudential regulatory framework to promote asafe and sound financial system through the expansion of supervisory coverage andauthority to prescribe metrics attuned to international standards and practices.The amendment likewise empowers the BSP to oversee the country’s payment andsettlement systems (PSS) including critical financial market infrastructures that are vitalcomponents of the PSS.Looking ahead, we will continue to monitor domestic and global developments to ensure that theBSP is able to meet its inflation targets. The BSP is also ready to use all appropriate measuresas needed to ensure an inflation environment conducive to sustainable growth of the Philippineeconomy.Rest assured that the future policy actions of the BSP will continue to be guided by the followingprinciples:1. Our primary focus will be price stability.2. We will be pre-emptive rather than reactive and3. Our policy will be data-driven and evidence-based.Finally, let me leave you with the assurance that the Philippine economy is sound. It is one of thebest performing economies in the world. Its prospects are bright—extremely bright.And if you have money to invest, and I can see, some people here have money to invest, this isthe best time to invest, invest, invest in the Philippines. Do not delay, do not waver. Because ifyou do, you will regret it. To wrap up, let me end my presentation with these key take-aways.The BSP’s monetary policy actions will help ensure that 2019 and 2020 inflation targets areachieved. Nevertheless, the BSP will remain watchful and vigilant, utilizing its analytical andsurveillance tools for any potential risks to its monetary and financial stability objectives.The Philippine economy has demonstrated uninterrupted economic expansion and has builtdomestic sources of resilience to help cushion against uncertainty in external environmentand emerging domestic challengesStrategic policy and structural reforms, addressing infrastructure gaps, and leveraging thecountry’s demographic opportunities have played a significant role and will continue tounderpin the economy’s path towards balanced, sustainable, and inclusive growth.Commitment to pursue infrastructure and reform agenda will help promote globallycompetitive industries in order to sustain the country’s economic growth momentum.Lastly, on behalf of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, I congratulate all the energetic andirrepressible members of the Rotary Club of Manila, both young and old, for reaching 100 years! Mabuhay ang Rotary Club of Manila!  Mabuhay ang Pilipinas! Mabuhay po tayong lahat! 4 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches

Why it makes business sense to move on from LIBOR    Speech given by Andrew Hauser, Executive Director, Markets   At Risk Live, London 27 June 2019   
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches 2  2   Introduction  There seem to be two rather distinct themes to your conference today:  The first is all about opportunity, the future, things you might want to do:  fintech, AI, new tools and ways of working.  All symbolised by a rather inspiring yellow lightbulb icon on your agenda:     The second is all about the grim stuff:  black swans, operational risks, or whatever else might lurk in your ‘hall of horrors’ sessions later – and the things you have to do in response.    I’m not 100% sure which camp this speech has been put in.  But I think there’s a clue in the icon you’ve put next to my name in the programme – which is a revolutionary clenched fist…    In one sense I understand why I’ve been given a pugnacious icon.  The programme to move the market from LIBOR to risk-free rates is a huge undertaking.  Its goal is vital, and simply stated:  to eliminate the profound system-wide vulnerabilities posed by LIBOR.  And the deadline is clear:  end-2021.  But delivering it is as complex a task as any the financial sector has faced over the past decade, involving a global network of market participants and public authorities, and touching most systems, products and markets in some way.1   Small wonder then that many firms see LIBOR transition as a ‘must do’ more than a ‘want to do’.  But that perspective misses a key point:  LIBOR is past its sell-by date – not just in risk terms, but in business terms too.  It was designed to solve the problems of a very different era, when markets were far less transparent, and far less adept at packaging and repackaging risk.  With the tools we have today, a post-LIBOR world offers many new and better opportunities:  to meet the borrowing needs of households and firms; to allocate and manage risk; to express views on, or hedge against, the future paths of interest rates and credit risk; and to exploit new technologies.  So more lightbulbs – fewer clenched fists!  Firms who grasp these opportunities early will have a real edge.  In sterling markets, we have already seen how quickly specific instruments can switch away from LIBOR when the necessary foundations have been laid and first-line business teams then put their shoulder to the wheel.  In Floating Rate Notes, sterling securitisations and large swathes of the cleared derivatives market, innovation and competition has driven a virtuous circle of rising liquidity and rising volumes.  Taken together, these changes put sterling markets at the leading edge of global transition.                                                          1 For a summary of the case for LIBOR transition and an account of the early steps the Bank took to support it for sterling markets, see https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/speech/2017/the-bank-and-benchmark-reform-speech-by-chris-salmon.pdf?la=en&hash=597E3C1B41FBFFAFB6A05DFFE148F1E0B53BEB3F 
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches 3  3   By contrast, firms that miss these opportunities risk finding themselves behind the curve:  stranded with LIBOR-linked systems and obligations that are no longer fit for purpose.  That risk is material – and will only grow as 2021 approaches.    Of course not every problem can be solved through innovation alone:  - Some require collective, or public sector, action – and that is being co-ordinated through the market-led Working Group on Sterling Risk-Free Reference Rates here in the United Kingdom, and similar bodies overseas.  The report card for that collective process reads ‘a lot achieved, a lot left to do’, as we discussed at a conference at the Bank on 5 June.2  - And some do fall under the ‘must do’ heading for firms.  To summarise the key conclusions of our first ‘Dear CEO’ exercise:  you need to have identified and quantified your LIBOR-linked exposures; you need a granular transition project plan, including an identified responsible executive covered by the Senior Managers Regime (where applicable); you need to stress test that plan against the base case of LIBOR ceasing to exist at end-2021; you need to identify and manage your prudential and conduct risks; and you need to engage with the work of the relevant market working groups.3  But we won’t get there through compliance and risk management alone.  We also need businesses – your businesses – to grab the opportunities presented by a post-LIBOR world to meet customer needs in better, safer ways.  In the rest of my remarks I want to cover three main topics.  First, I want to summarise the business problem LIBOR was originally designed to solve – and how the world has changed since then.  Second, I want to sketch some of the opportunities that a post-LIBOR world may bring – and thus why there is a business, as well as a risk, imperative to shift.  And, third, I want to explain some steps we at the Bank of England are taking to de-risk our own LIBOR-related business.  Why LIBOR once made business sense – and what’s changed LIBOR’s origins date back to the syndicated loan market of the late 1960s.  Risky borrowers from developing or emerging markets were looking to raise large sums, in dollars, at term.  But the most plausible lenders –US banks – faced two problems.  First, rapidly-rising inflation and short term interest rates made it risky to fix the interest rate on such loans for the full term.  And, second, caps on deposit rates under ‘Regulation Q’ made it hard for US-domiciled banks to raise the necessary funding.  In their place, banks in London – often US-owned, but unencumbered by onshore borrowing limits – formed themselves into ‘syndicates’ to take slices of floating rate, dollar-denominated loans, funded by short-term, offshore dollar deposits.                                                          2 https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/events/2019/june/last-orders-calling-time-on-libor 3 https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/prudential-regulation/publication/2019/firms-preparations-for-transition-from-libor-to-risk-free-rates.pdf?la=en&hash=EA87BD3B8435B7EDF25A56C932C362C65D516577 
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches 4  4   The challenge was what rate to charge.  Rates on US Treasury debt were judged too volatile, affected as they were by volatile economic policy at that time, and ‘flight to quality’ flows.  And giving any one firm in the syndicate the right to pick a rate was both inequitable and hard for the borrower to police.  So the rate was instead based on an average of the short-term wholesale unsecured funding rates of a set of banks in the syndicate, adjusted for outliers, and periodically updated every three or six months.  There was no incentive for banks to lowball this number, dubbed the ‘London interbank offered rate’, because that would reduce their income.  And competition to be in the syndicate was meant to curb excessive increases.  This approach to setting a floating dollar rate was so successful that its use rapidly spread to pricing marketable corporate debt in the early 1970s – and later to the eurodollar markets that sprang up, first in the form of derivatives contracts to hedge against macroeconomic volatility, and then as bank funding instruments.  The latter accounted for over half of the dollar money market by the mid-1980s.  Demands for a more formalised governance and data collection process led to the BBA taking on responsibility for producing LIBOR in 1986.  And the rest is history…  I have dwelt on this story not so much for its intrinsic interest than to illustrate just how far we have come from those origins.  For me, three key points stand out:  - First, the early success of LIBOR led to its widespread adoption well beyond its original application.  At first that posed few apparent problems, as bank funding costs moved in line with risk-free rates.  But the financial crisis changed that.  Market participants using capital instruments apparently unconnected to banks (for example, those issuing bonds, or seeking exposure to risk-free interest rates through derivatives) found themselves nonetheless heavily, and unexpectedly, exposed to variation in bank funding costs (Figure 1).

The red area of the chart is influenced by bank funding costs, as well as liquidity and supply/demand conditions.  Source: Bloomberg data and Bank calculations   - Second, LIBOR’s widespread use persisted long after the underlying market on which it was based – the short-term wholesale unsecured funding market – largely ceased to exist.  The use of judgment to set term LIBOR rates – once simply a convenient tool to fill in for temporary gaps in an otherwise well-specified curve – became the norm.  And it was that ‘design feature’, coupled with weak governance, and the huge stock of assets priced off LIBOR, which gave such a strong incentive for manipulation.  Though governance arrangements for LIBOR have since been strengthened, the vast majority of term LIBOR rates remain largely or wholly based on judgment, reflecting the absence of any material underlying market (Figure 2).  - Third, despite these two profound drawbacks, the informational and liquidity advantages of using a common established benchmark, coupled with the deep embedding of LIBOR in a range of systems, accounting and regulatory requirements have meant moving away from the use of LIBOR has required determination, forward-thinking and co-ordinated effort – even for those large parts of the market where it is manifestly the wrong rate to use.

Taken together, these three observations show why LIBOR transition is both necessary from a risk perspective and beneficial for the long-term efficiency of the financial markets, whilst also being unpopular in terms of the one-off transition costs involved.  Indeed, there is a material risk that those transition costs are obscuring a clear perspective of the commercial benefits to users of moving beyond LIBOR.  What are those benefits?  It would be brave for me as a public official to attempt anything approaching a complete answer to that question.  But let me sketch three broad areas that seem important to us.  First, successful transition away from LIBOR in its current form will unbundle the risk-free and bank sector credit risk elements of the interest rate curve.  Including compensation for banking credit risk may have made eminent sense for those syndicated loans made in the 60s and 70s, without greatly affecting variation in the level of LIBOR (as shown in Figure 1).  But many LIBOR-linked instruments no longer directly involve banks, yet remain exposed to variations in the perception of bank risk seen in the past decade.  That does not reflect an efficient allocation of risk in the economy, and poses material economic and distributional risks at times of stress, as we saw during the financial crisis.  Using a near risk-free benchmark, such as SONIA in sterling markets, rather than LIBOR should, amongst other things:                                                         4 https://www.theice.com/publicdocs/ICE-LIBOR-Weekly-Report-10Jun_2019-14Jun2019.pdf 
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches 7  7     Reduce the funding mismatch for Bank Rate tracker mortgages bundled into securitisations;   Increase certainty for corporate borrowers wanting to lock in a fixed credit component at the time bonds are originated;   Allow market participants to take or hedge risk related to the evolution of monetary policy rates through swaps and other instruments without unintentionally introducing a variable credit component; and  Incentivise the development of new products, such as swaptions based on risk free rates, allowing more efficient hedging of interest rate volatility, either on their own or as part of structured products.   It has been argued that moving away from LIBOR will increase risks to banks, by making it harder for them to hedge variability in their cost of funding related to their own credit risk.  It is clearly very important for banks to be able to manage this risk.  But, as we have seen, LIBOR is not the right tool, because it no longer accurately measures banks’ true cost of funding.  And, even if it did, it is stretching credibility to suggest that the optimal place to house funding risk is with real economy borrowers.  This feels a particularly fruitful area for innovation, drawing on the much more sophisticated range of tools now available for managing such risks.  The second broad area of opportunity in a post-LIBOR world comes from the potential for concentrating sterling liquidity into a single interest rate curve referencing compounded overnight SONIA.  Today, someone managing a portfolio of sterling interest rate risk can easily find themselves having to deal with multiple different reference curves, each based on a different interest rate index.  Figure 3 illustrates five  commonly-traded curves (based on SONIA and the one, three, six and twelve month LIBOR fixings) at the start of August 2017 (shortly after Andrew Bailey’s 2017 speech announcing the 2021 deadline for LIBOR transition).  Figure 3: Zero coupon swap yield curves (as of 1 August 2017)  Source:  Bloomberg data and Bank calculations 
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches 8  8   It is challenging enough to manage five or more different interest rate levels.  But, to make matters worse, the gaps between these curves – so-called ‘basis’ – can also change quite sharply over time, reflecting variations in the credit premium associated with different lending tenors, structural flows, and other factors.  Figure 4 illustrates how the basis between a three year sterling swap referencing the 6 month LIBOR fixing and three swaps referencing 1, 3 and 12 month fixings has moved since 2008.  Managing interest rate risk in the presence of such movements is a risky and administratively complex process.  Figure 4:  Basis between index tenors for a three year £LIBOR swap  Source:  Bloomberg data and Bank calculations  LIBOR transition, if executed effectively, offers the prospect of concentrating the liquidity currently split across these multiple curves into a single SONIA curve, providing a materially deeper, more transparent and less complex single market in which to hedge interest rate risk.  Unlike some other currencies involved in LIBOR transition, sterling starts with the distinct advantage of already having a liquid, well-traded SONIA curve at shorter maturities based on OIS swaps, supplemented by three futures contracts which also settle on realised compounded SONIA.  Rolling the liquidity currently in term LIBOR curves into this curve would further improve price formation at the short end and, importantly, improve the definition of the curve at longer maturities too.   A single curve would have many potential benefits:   It is the logical completion of the move away from LIBOR discounting to SONIA-referencing OIS discounting begun a decade ago, eliminating the basis between swap exposures and how they are valued, and thereby simplifying risk management of swaps portfolios;  It could simplify the risks arising from the optionality embedded in certain products such as credit facilities where funds can be drawn across multiple tenors of benchmark reference rates;  It would simplify curve construction and validation processes; 
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches 9  9    A switch from term to overnight compounding would provide customers with the scope to construct a more complete interest rate hedge by using the minimum possible period for each observation5; and  It could help guide further ‘electronification’ of the sterling market, through the provision of executable quotes and central limit order books, which itself could provide new opportunities for product development.  The potential role that a well-specified SONIA curve could play in helping to price cash instruments has been the subject of a great deal of discussion amongst market participants.  Many issuers have found it easier than had been initially expected simply to use compounded realised SONIA as a reference rate.  This has rapidly become a convention for a range of sterling Floating Rate Notes and securitisations; and recent announcements suggest similar approaches are also feasible for a range of corporate bonds and loans.6  We urge all sterling lenders and issuers to consider following suit, making use of the guidance material now available or emerging from the sterling working group and other sources.7  For the more limited range of borrowers in cash markets who feel an operational imperative for a forward-looking term SONIA rate, it should in principle be possible to take daily ‘snapshots’ of the SONIA curve at periodic maturities.  A number of potential providers have come forward to develop such functionality.8  A third benefit of LIBOR transition lies in the opportunity it provides to modernise the technology and infrastructure supporting sterling markets.  I have already mentioned the scope to bring the SONIA curve out of the shadows, deepening liquidity, increasing transparency and providing new term benchmarks.  The emerging trading conventions for SONIA products will require new functionality in corporate debt management systems.  In itself that is of course a cost.  But that infrastructure upgrade provides a  much-needed opportunity to rationalise aging architecture in both front and back office systems.  Firms preparing to novate legacy LIBOR positions – one of the most challenging and sensitive parts of the transition programme – may choose to backload previously uncleared trades into clearing houses.  That would allow them to take advantage of auction or trade compression mechanisms with providers working on developing innovative solutions specifically tailored to LIBOR transition.  Not only will this increase the efficiency of those compression mechanisms, reducing the system-wide gross notional position, it will also reduce operational and counterparty risks for the system as a whole through the increased use of clearing.  An infrastructure forum held at the Bank earlier this year revealed substantial interest from firms across the sterling markets to exploit these opportunities.9                                                        5 For example, this removes so-called ‘stub risks’ which arise from the potential for interest rates to change during the period covered by term fixings, typically of say, 3 or 6 months in the case of common LIBOR swaps. 6 See for instance https://www.risk.net/derivatives/6726026/abp-noteholders-agree-frn-change-from-libor-to-sonia and https://www.rbs.com/rbs/news/2019/06/natwest-to-offer-markets-first-sonia-loan.html 7 The global FSB also recently issued a ‘user guide’ designed to show the potential benefits of linking new business to daily risk free rates, available at:  https://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/P040619-1.pdf 8 https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/markets/benchmarks/statement-on-the-progress-on-adoption-of-risk-free-rates-in-sterling-markets.pdf?la=en&hash=24893EB812640CC61E640BEB98D8E7415439210B 9 Material from this event on 31/01/19 is available at https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/markets/transition-to-sterling-risk-free-rates-from-libor 
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches 10  10   These observations illustrate only a small fraction of the ways in which transition away from LIBOR will change the landscape of sterling markets for the better.  They are benefits for the market, and the economy, as a whole.  But those who get there first stand to gain the most.  Intermediaries, lenders and infrastructure providers who win the race to be ready to transact in SONIA, or develop and market innovative  SONIA-based products, are more likely to be rewarded with larger syndicate shares, stronger and more remunerative loan growth, or more favourable flow revenue.  As the pace of activity intensifies, we are seeing a sharp increase in interest from both lenders and borrowers in taking advantage of such opportunities.  Those who don’t, risk getting caught napping.  How the Bank is adapting its own operations to the use of SONIA  Before concluding, I want to spend a moment setting out some of what the Bank of England, as a financial institution with a sizeable balance sheet in its own right, is doing to ensure that it is also ready for LIBOR transition.  One of our key messages to firms has been to stop writing new LIBOR-related business that fixes or matures past 2021.  The main area in which the Bank undertakes such activity is in the swap programme used to hedge the government’s foreign exchange reserves, which we manage as agent for HM Treasury.  Last year, we set up a separate project team to advise the Treasury on its options – scaling the issue, assessing the available trading methods and liquidity in alternative markets, and evaluating the implications for risk and return.  In light of that advice, the Treasury decided some months ago to instruct the Bank to cease writing new LIBOR business with fixings falling after 2021, and transact only in SONIA-linked contracts.  Our experience of SONIA market liquidity so far has been positive:  at least as good, if not rather better, than expected.  Another way in which LIBOR potentially touches the Bank’s operations lies in the collateral that we accept in our sterling liquidity facilities.  Roughly a tenth of banks’ current drawing capacity10 is collateralised by assets referencing sterling LIBOR.  Those assets include:  securities paying a LIBOR-linked coupon, securitisations with embedded LIBOR-linked swaps; and LIBOR-linked loans, in either raw or securitised form.  The Bank must be able to value and risk manage any collateral taken in its operations in case it has to take that collateral on to its own balance sheet in a default.  As 2021 approaches, that will be increasingly difficult to do for some classes of collateral referencing LIBOR.  In many cases, firms may choose to re-reference LIBOR-linked collateral to SONIA, either by amending its terms or by issuing new instruments.  We can already accept SONIA-linked collateral, subject to meeting appropriate eligibility requirements.  An alternative would be to ensure LIBOR-linked collateral includes adequate fallback language specifying an alternative rate in the event that LIBOR ceases to exist.  The main                                                       10 https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/sterling-monetary-framework/annual-report-2018-19.pdf?la=en&hash=E4B7FDB6E9048DBD71F5C8CE4E00D3BE9F6A96A2 
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches 11  11   challenge arises with any remaining LIBOR-linked collateral that matures after 2021 but lacks adequate fallback provisions – and we are today publishing a discussion paper seeking views on how best to respond in this situation, through some combination of rising haircuts and future eligibility restrictions.  No immediate changes are planned.  But we are seeking input on these questions from market participants, by  27 September, to help the Bank formulate clear and well-signposted guidance on its future approach.  These examples illustrate the importance we attach to getting ahead of the curve on LIBOR transition, to condition and give clarity to market expectations about our likely policy settings, and to provide an early indication of what is possible.  Conclusion  With only 30 months to go until end-2021, it’s time to join the revolution and move on from LIBOR.  Companies and their boards right across the sterling markets need to focus on what they must do to shift new business from LIBOR to SONIA, and planning how to mitigate their legacy risk.  And lenders need to be educating their customers too.    Just as importantly, though, firms should also be thinking creatively about ways to take advantage of the new opportunities of a post-LIBOR world to innovate and serve their customers better.  I have tried to set out some of the ways in which this may be possible – but I am confident the best of you will quickly leave those far behind.  Thank you.  
Sabine Lautenschläger: Euro Cyber Resilience Board for pan-European Financial InfrastructuresIntroductory remarks by Ms Sabine Lautenschläger, Member of the Executive Board of theEuropean Central Bank, at the third meeting of the Euro Cyber Resilience Board for pan-European Financial Infrastructures, Frankfurt am Main, 28 June 2019.*   *   *It is a pleasure to welcome you back to Frankfurt. As you may know, I recently becameresponsible for market infrastructures and payments at the ECB. As this includes the ECB’swork on the cyber resilience of financial market infrastructures (FMIs), I have taken over BenoîtCœuré’s chairmanship of the Euro Cyber Resilience Board for pan-European FinancialInfrastructures (ECRB). I would first like to thank Benoît for his contribution in establishing theECRB and for this opportunity to continue the excellent work on cyber resilience at Europeanlevel which he has personally driven forward.Six months have passed since our last meeting in December, during which time, all of us –whether on behalf of a public or private financial infrastructure, a supervisor or an overseer –have been busy enhancing the cyber resilience of our respective financial infrastructures and ofthe financial sector as a whole. But cybercriminals have been making progress too, and theyremain persistent and relentless in their pursuits. As widely reported in the press, a major cyberincident occurred at a significant bank earlier this year, seriously affecting the real economy in aspecific European country. This publicly known incident reminds us of the debilitating impact acyberattack can have on our financial system. So the need for continued vigilance, work andcollaboration in this field is imperative.You will recall that – in December 2018 – the ECB published its cyber resilience oversightexpectations, a tool meant for both FMIs and overseers. These expectations contain detailedbest practices for implementing the CPMI-IOSCO Cyber Guidance and are now being followedby FMI operators at national and European level. Overseers are working with their respectiveFMIs to ensure that they do what is necessary to enhance their cyber resilience. I am alsopleased that the World Bank has recently embraced our cyber resilience oversight expectationswith a view to boosting the cyber resilience of FMIs in developing and emerging countries underits mandate, and consequently promoting global harmonisation.Last year, the Eurosystem also developed the European Framework for Threat Intelligence-based Ethical Red Teaming (TIBER-EU). Red teaming helps entities assess, by means ofcontrolled “ethical hacking”, if and how they are capable of withstanding a cyberattack. Andbecause TIBER-EU involves high-end testing on live production systems, we are currentlyreflecting on how to foster an accreditation and certification capability in the EU. This would allowcybersecurity service providers to raise standards around threat intelligence and red team testingand to have their capabilities in this field validated.I am pleased to say that, since its publication, TIBER-EU has been implemented – or is currentlybeing implemented – in Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Romania andSweden, and by the ECB in its oversight capacity. The ECB is also in close dialogue with otherEU and non-EU jurisdictions that are considering TIBER-EU as a tool for their respective financialsectors. The gradual roll-out of TIBER-EU will ensure that threat-led penetration testing isconducted in a harmonised way across the EU, avoiding duplication of work for financial entitiesand authorities alike.Already in March 2018, at the first ECRB meeting, we presented the results of a cyber resiliencesurvey that had been developed under the Eurosystem oversight cyber resilience strategy. Thesurvey had been conducted across more than 75 payment systems, central securities123 1 / 2BIS central bankers' speeches
depositories and central counterparties throughout Europe. You will recall that the surveyhighlighted a number of weaknesses prevailing at the time, such as cyber governance, trainingand awareness, and cyber incident response. Today we will update you on the second round ofthe cyber resilience survey, which we conducted again across mostly the same population ofFMIs throughout Europe. The results have given us an insight into how the sector hasprogressed, and indeed, while we see improvement in some areas, there is still much to bedone.When we established the ECRB, the aim was essentially to create a forum for strategicdiscussions at board level, to raise awareness of the topic of cyber resilience, to catalyse jointinitiatives to develop effective solutions for the market and to share best practices and foster trustand collaboration. In this context, I am very pleased that the spirit of the ECRB is living up toexpectations. As you will recall from the UNITAS crisis communication exercise last year , weidentified two key areas in which the ECRB could drive improvements forward: informationsharing and crisis management. This year, thanks to your commitment and contribution, wehave set up two working groups of experts drawn from your institutions and we have madesignificant progress in these areas. I would like to sincerely thank you for your contributions andfor sustaining our spirit of trust and collaboration.The ECRB working group on information sharing will tell us about their proposed model, whichsets out the building blocks for sharing information and intelligence. It is clear that, among otherthings, financial infrastructures should have effective cyber threat intelligence processes; theyshould actively participate in information-sharing arrangements and collaborate with trustedstakeholders within the industry. The working group’s proposal seeks to address this byfacilitating information and intelligence sharing, enabling you to better protect yourselves and thewider ecosystem. As discussed at our last meeting, regulatory reporting on cyber incidents isintentionally not part of this work.We will also receive an update on the work of the ECRB working group on crisis management,and we will touch upon third-party risk and ecosystem recovery and coordinated reconciliation.As you may guess from my brief remarks today, we have a great deal of work ahead of us. Ibelieve that sharing information, knowledge and expertise among financial infrastructures andauthorities in a non-regulatory context remains essential for tackling the cyber challenge we allface. I am convinced that we can only do this by joining forces. I want to thank you for being heretoday and I look forward to a fruitful discussion.ECB (2018), Cyber resilience oversight expectations, December.Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures and International Organization of Securities Commissions(2016), Guidance on cyber resilience for financial market infrastructures, June.ECB (2018), TIBER-EU Framework, May.ECB (2018), UNITAS Crisis communication exercise report, December.41234 2 / 2BIS central bankers' speeches
Yakiv Smolii: Financial Inclusion Forum - opening speechSpeech by Mr Yakiv Smolii, Governor of the National Bank of Ukraine, at the Financial InclusionForum, Kyiv, 12 June 2019.*   *   *Dear ladies and gentlemen,participants of the second international Financial Inclusion Forum.Today, the slogan Leaving No One Behind unites us all. Why this particular slogan, you mayask.First, as a UN member country, Ukraine shares and supports the Global SustainableDevelopment Goals.  We apply the principle Leaving No One Behind.Second, if we explain the meaning of the term “financial inclusion” in one word, this word wouldbe accessibility.Technical accessibility and price accessibility.At present, over one third of people all over the world still have no access to financial services. Our mutual goal is to reduce the share of Ukrainians in this huge number.I will not be mistaken if I confidently say that all present here are aware of the fact – financialinclusion offers broader opportunities for people.Access to loans advances business and access to insurance creates a safety cushion.For the least secured social groups, an access to high quality financial services means safetytoday and social mobility tomorrow.Numerous studies, particularly by such respected international institutions as the World Bankand the International Monetary Fund, have proved a strong connection between financial inclusionand financial stability.At the macroeconomic level this translates into the country’s capacity to tackle crises.At a personal level, it gives Ukrainians a chance to be prepared for rapid changes andunexpected developments that have permeated the life of our country for the past two decades.Ladies and gentlemen,It should be noted that financial inclusion is not only about an increase in the number ofconsumers of financial services, or their sales, so to say.It is about social responsibility – transparency and clarity of products to their consumers.Protection of consumers is important because it is the prerequisite for the safe use of loans.  It isimpossible for anybody to benefit from the full potential of financial services without financialliteracy.This is where the NBU sees great opportunities for everybody gathered here.Anyone has a purpose and anyone can play a role:commercial sector can develop new technologies and offer progressive solutions 1 / 2BIS central bankers' speeches
nongovernmental organizations can ensure control and enhance communal capacity inan informal waywhile we at the public sector will continue creating conditions for the increased well-beingof Ukrainians.What are our plans?First. The NBU will improve the quality of regulation and lay the grounds for strengthening thefinancial sector.Our foremost task, as we see it, is enhancing protection of rights of financial servicesconsumers.I will be honest with you – at the NBU we truly hoped that Ukraine would get a real protectionsystem guaranteed by laws.But the parliament decided otherwise.However, this is not an excuse to abandon people with their problems with banks and nonbankfinancial institutions.Today, I am very happy to inform you of the following:The NBU assumes responsibility for protection of rights of financial services consumers andestablishes a special unit in charge of these issues.First of all, it will enable regulation of the information disclosure system that will deal withinformation on financial products and services.  Information transparency is at the core of trust inthe financial services and safeguards higher prosperity of the public.We will continue our work on people’s complaints, but from now on it will be more systematic.The chain “complaint – response – changes in regulations” will become shorter and moreefficient.This will help reduce the number of misunderstandings between financial institutions and theircustomers, improve their information awareness, and teach the financial market to address theircustomers’ questions and comments.Second. The NBU has assumed the leadership and developed a vision for the future strategy offinancial literacy.Why does the central bank need it, considering that we are not part of the education system?Our goal is to prepare young people for life in the real world full of challenges and rapidchanges.Today, we encourage everybody present to join in common work based on our vision. I hope in ayear we will be able to sum up our first results.Ladies and gentlemen,I am confident that many of you have joined the Forum with brilliant ideas of how to makefinancial services more accessible for Ukrainians.So, let’s get to work! 2 / 2BIS central bankers' speeches
Lael Brainard: "Fed Listens" in Cincinnati- how does monetarypolicy affect your community?Speech by Ms Lael Brainard, Member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,at the Policy Summit 2019 "Connecting People and Places to Opportunity", Federal ReserveBank of Cleveland, Cincinnati, Ohio, 21 June 2019.*   *   *It is good to be here in Cincinnati. I want to thank my colleague, Loretta Mester, for inviting me toparticipate today, and it is a pleasure to participate in the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland’sPolicy Summit.Today’s session is part of a series called Fed Listens. The Federal Reserve is reaching out tocommunities around the country to hear how Americans are experiencing the economy day today and to make sure we are carrying out the monetary policy goals assigned to us by theCongress in the most effective way we can.The Congress has assigned the Federal Reserve to use monetary policy to achieve maximumemployment and price stability. These two goals are what we refer to as our dual mandate. Byprice stability, we mean moderate and stable inflation. The Federal Open Market Committee(FOMC)—the group at the Fed responsible for determining monetary policy—has announcedthat our goal is to keep inflation around 2 percent over time. The maximum-employment part ofour dual mandate means that the Congress has directed us to achieve the highest level ofemployment that is consistent with price stability.The OutlookEarlier this week, President Mester and I participated in the meeting of the FOMC, where we hadthe opportunity to share our views on the economy and policy. My own assessment is that themost likely path for the economy remains solid. The latest data suggest that consumer spendingis robust, and consumer confidence is high. Although the pace of payroll gains has moderatedrecently, unemployment is at a 50-year low, wages are growing, participation in the labor forcehas expanded, and unemployment insurance claims are at cycle lows. Despite recent volatility,financial conditions overall remain supportive.Recent weeks, however, have seen important downside risks. Crosscurrents from policyuncertainty have risen since early May, crimping business investment plans, raising concerns insome financial market segments, and weighing on global growth prospects. Foreign authoritiesare seeking additional policy space to address growth and inflation shortfalls. In addition, recentindicators of inflation and inflation expectations have been disappointing, making it all the moreimportant to sustain the economy’s momentum.The downside risks, if they materialize, could weigh on economic activity. Basic principles of riskmanagement in a low neutral rate environment with compressed conventional policy spacewould argue for softening the expected path of policy when risks shift to the downside.Our ReviewWith recent indicators suggesting the expansion is continuing at a solid pace and unemploymentat a 50-year low, inflation has not yet moved to our goal on a sustained basis. In many ways, thatcan be viewed as an opportunity, with the sustained expansion providing critical job opportunitiesto a broader set of applicants. In parallel, it is also vital that a central bank meets its inflationtarget on a sustained basis, which will provide more capacity to buffer the economy if itencounters headwinds.123 1 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
We are undertaking our review to ensure we are well positioned to meet our goals for manyyears to come, especially in light of the way the economy is changing, which I have beenreferring to as the “new normal." There are a few key features of that new normal. First, interestrates have stayed very low in recent years in the United States and in many other advancedeconomies, and it seems likely that equilibrium interest rates will remain low in the future. Lowinterest rates present a challenge for traditional monetary policy in recessions. In the past, theFederal Reserve has typically cut interest rates 4 to 5 percentage points in order to supporthousehold spending and business investment. However, when equilibrium interest rates are low,we have less room to cut interest rates and less room to buffer the economy using ourconventional tool.Another big change in the economy is that inflation does not move as much with economicactivity and employment as it has in the past, which is what economists mean when they say thePhillips curve is very flat. A flat Phillips curve has important advantages: The labor market canstrengthen a lot and pull many workers who may have been sidelined back into productiveemployment without an acceleration in inflation, unlike what we saw in the 1960s and 1970s.On the other hand, today’s low sensitivity of inflation to slack, along with the limited ability to cutinterest rates in a recession, means it can be more difficult to achieve our 2 percent inflationobjective on a sustainable basis. The limited ability to cut interest rates could provide less abilityto buffer the economy in a downturn, while the very flat Phillips curve could make it harder toboost inflation during an expansion. And that could further compress policy space in a negativespiral.As we have seen in other countries, if inflation consistently falls short of the central bank’sobjective, consumers, workers, and businesses start to expect lower inflation to continue.Expectations of low inflation can create a self-fulfilling dynamic with actual inflation, making iteven more difficult for the central bank to boost inflation. And because inflation is reflected innominal interest rates, that, in turn, can reduce the amount of policy space the central bank hasavailable to prevent the economy from slipping into recession. In fact, in recent years, centralbanks around the world have had to use a larger variety of policy tools than they have traditionallyused to support the recovery.Some Issues to ExploreGiven the new normal of low equilibrium interest rates and low sensitivity of inflation to slack, it isprudent to assess how well various approaches worked both here and around the world, with aview to identifying the best ways to promote the goals the Congress assigned to us. Earlier thismonth, we held a conference in Chicago where we heard from experts as well as communityorganizations, small businesses, labor organizations, and retirees. We are looking at our toolsand strategies, assessing not just the various approaches that were undertaken, but alsoapproaches that have been proposed but not tried.One of the ideas discussed in Chicago is that the Federal Reserve should explicitly promise to“make up” for misses on inflation during a downturn. The Federal Reserve could hold interestrates lower after a recession is over, perhaps by promising not to raise interest rates untilinflation or the unemployment rate have reached particular levels. A related idea discussed inChicago is average inflation targeting, meaning the Federal Reserve would aim to achieve itsinflation objective, on average, over a longer period of time—perhaps over the business cycle.This approach could also have aspects of a makeup policy, depending on how it is designed.While such approaches sound quite appealing on their face, they have not yet been implementedin practice. There is some skepticism that a central bank would in fact prove able to supportabove-target inflation over a sustained period without becoming concerned that inflation mightaccelerate, and inflation expectations might rise too high.456 2 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
At the Chicago conference, we also heard how difficult it can be to estimate with any precisionthe “maximum employment” leg of our dual mandate. There is no fixed destination point formaximum employment—no single number where we can be sure we are “there.” Maximumemployment is something that we must learn about by seeing how the job market is operating.That is very different from the longer-run level of inflation, which central banks are presumed ableto determine over time.At our conference in Chicago, we also asked the panelists about our communications with thepublic, and the responses were humbling. The Federal Reserve communicates with the publicabout monetary policy through a variety of channels. At each of our policy-setting meetings, theFOMC issues a statement, and Chair Jerome Powell holds a press conference. Three weeksafter the meeting, the minutes of the meeting are published. Twice a year, the Federal Reservesubmits a Monetary Policy Report to the Congress.We heard in Chicago that most members of the public care a lot about the job market and thecost of credit, but they are not aware of our communications about monetary policy. Of course,the media plays an important role in communicating our monetary policy actions and how theyaffect the economy. And the Congress, which plays an important role in overseeing the Fed, is akey audience as well. Nonetheless, considering how we can provide greater visibility to the publicabout what we do will be one of the issues we will be considering as our policy review continues.ListeningNow, how does today’s event fit into all of this? Since I arrived at the Fed, I have derivedtremendous benefit from visiting communities all over the country to hear from them how theyare experiencing the economy. Today President Mester and I want to hear from you. How is yourcommunity experiencing today’s economy? Is everyone who wants a job able to get one? Canthey get the necessary training? Are businesses finding it relatively easy to hire the workers theyneed? How does price inflation and wage growth affect you? What about the availability and costof credit—whether to start or expand a small business, buy a car to get to work, or invest inowning a home or getting a degree? And are there ways we can better communicate with you? Ilook forward to hearing your views on these and other questions.I am grateful to John Roberts of the Federal Reserve Board for his assistance in preparing this text.

Luis de Guindos: Euro area banks - the profitability challengeKeynote speech by Mr Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the European Central Bank, at the ABIannual conference "Banking Union and Basel III – risk and supervision 2019", Rome, 25 June2019.*   *   *Euro area banks’ profitability remains weakThe resilience of the euro area banking sector has continued to improve over the past few years,supported by a sustained economic expansion. Banks’ aggregate Common Equity Tier 1 ratio, akey measure of capital strength, stood at 14.3% at the end of 2018, up from 12.7% in mid-2015.Cyclical factors have also helped banks’ profitability recover from its trough in the wake of thesovereign debt crisis.That said, banks’ return on equity (ROE), at around 6%, still falls short of their cost of capital,which is estimated at around 8-10% for most banks. Euro area banks’ ROE also remains belowthat of some of their international peers, for instance US and Nordic banks. Recently, profitabilityconcerns have again come to the fore as the operating environment for banks has become morechallenging, with economic growth projected to slow down in 2019. Banks’ profitability prospectscould thus be dampened by deteriorating growth expectations, adding to structural weaknesses.A number of banks continue to have depressed market valuations, with price-to-book ratios wellbelow one, mirroring their weak current and expected profitability. In other words, price-to-bookratios below one indicate that those banks are not earning their corresponding cost of equity(COE). However, it is important to stress that the situation of individual banks across the euroarea varies considerably in terms of both ROE and COE. There is still a large gap betweenoverperformers and underperformers; in the past few years around one-quarter of significantbanks delivered an ROE of at least 8%, while the ROE of the worst-performing quartile remainedbelow 3%. The COE situation is also very mixed: over 20% of European banks surveyed by theEuropean Banking Authority estimate their COE to be above 10%, while around 10% of themestimate it at below 8%.Why is low profitability a concern from a financial stability perspective?So why does low bank profitability matter for financial stability? Perhaps most importantly,persistently low profitability can limit banks’ ability to generate capital organically. This makes itharder for them to build up buffers against unexpected shocks and limits their capacity to fundloan growth. At the same time, banks with weak profitability prospects and low market valuationscould find it very costly, or even prohibitively expensive, to raise capital from market sourcesshould the need arise.In addition, banks with limited current earnings power may also be tempted to take on more risk.Higher risk-taking by banks can cause financial imbalances to build up, should risks becorrelated. In fact, in the banking sector, profitability which is (too) high may be as much of aproblem as profitability which is (too) low, as it may be an indication of excessive risk-taking ofthe sort observed in the run-up to the global financial crisis.Against this background, today I will focus my remarks on the main determinants of banks’profitability outlook. I will cover both cyclical and structural factors, as well as possible ways forbanks to return to sustainable profitability.Cyclical factors have helped improve bank profitability in recent yearsBank performance is closely linked to economic activity. In fact, bank profitability has improved in1 1 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
the past few years on the back of continued economic growth, with euro area banks’ ROEreaching 6% in 2018, up from 3% two years earlier. Cyclical factors have supported theseprofitability improvements via three channels. First, the broadening economic expansion, coupledwith low interest rates, has made it easier for borrowers to repay their loans, leading to bettercredit quality and lower bank provisions. Second, increased lending volumes have helped offsetthe negative impact of shrinking net interest margins. And third, a favourable macroeconomicenvironment has also supported NPL work-outs and the reduction of risk premia, leading tohigher NPL sales, which have contributed to lower provisioning needs.In this context, it is important to recall that the overall effect of our monetary policy on bankprofitability has so far been broadly neutral. Nevertheless, the overall effects of negative rates onthe banking sector need to be carefully monitored, particularly because the balance of theireffects will depend on how long rates remain in negative territory.Progress in tackling structural challenges has clearly been insufficientNotwithstanding the weakening economic prospects, banks’ profitability is mainly weighed downby structural factors. Improving cost efficiency is one of their key challenges. Cost efficiency, asmeasured by cost-to-asset and cost-to-income ratios, has deteriorated since 2010 as costcontainment has not offset a marked decline in revenues and total assets. As a result, euro areabanks continue to underperform some of their international peers in terms of cost efficiency withan average cost-to-income ratio of 66%, compared with 55–57% at Nordic and US banks. It isimportant to keep in mind, however, that the picture is extremely varied at the level of individualbanks, and the best-performing banks in the euro area have shown evidence of sustainedprofitability improvements supported by efficiency gains.Second, despite notable progress in reducing legacy NPL stocks, some banks continue to faceearnings headwinds due to low returns on NPLs, which tie up capital, absorb operationalcapacity and incur legal and administrative costs.Third, excess capacity has been offered as an explanation for the euro area banking sector’s lowprofitability, as it can reduce cost efficiency and erode banks’ pricing power. And based on acomposite indicator of overcapacity constructed using various measures of size, competitionand efficiency, euro area banks indeed score relatively poorly compared with other advancedeconomies.Finally, while market funding conditions remain favourable, the need to issue more bonds that areeligible under the minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities, or MREL, may posechallenges for some banks in the coming years, especially smaller banks and those with lowercredit ratings. A possible increase in funding costs might complicate their efforts to build up thenecessary loss-absorption capacity and could weigh on their profitability.Possible ways for banks to return to sustainable profitabilityLet me now turn to discussing the possible solutions to the profitability problem. First, there is no“one-size-fits-all” strategy for banks to return to sustainable profitability. Each bank’s preferredstrategy will likely depend on multiple factors.Let’s start with reducing costs and improving efficiency. These are necessary steps, andpotential strategies to achieve them range from more traditional measures, such as downsizingand branch closures, to adopting new, cost-saving technologies aimed at digitalising financialintermediation services, for example increasing reliance on internet-based banking.It must be remembered, however, that benefits will typically accrue only gradually. Reducingovercapacity entails restructuring costs in the short run, with the benefits materialising later. Andfor digitalisation, there are typically significant short-run costs involving severance payments and234 2 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
IT investment, while the potential profitability gains may only accrue over the medium to longterm.Digitalisation can be an important and permanent cost-saving strategy for banks, particularly incountries with a dense branch network. But it needs to be underpinned by certain structuralrequirements. Banks’ ability to cut costs will depend on factors such as labour laws, populationdensity and the overall level of digitalisation in society. The Scandinavian (and Benelux) countriesprovide examples of successful cost optimisation strategies through digitalisation.In addition to cutting costs, many banks will also need to improve their income-generatingcapacities. One possible avenue for better income diversification is by enhancing fee andcommission-based activities. However, the extent to which banks can diversify into areasgenerating more fee and commission income is likely to depend on their specific businessmodels. In particular, banks that rely heavily on maturity transformation business to generateincome could benefit the most from increasing the amount of their total income accounted for byfee and commission-based activities.Consolidation can further bolster efficiency through cost-cutting synergies. Evidence suggeststhat domestic mergers and acquisitions (M&As) tend to focus on achieving cost synergies, whilecross-border M&As appear to be driven more by expansion opportunities. This is mainlybecause banks have greater scope to streamline overlapping distribution networks within theirdomestic market.So domestic consolidation is crucial. Domestic M&As can deliver substantial cost savings,particularly in less concentrated banking markets. This can be achieved through economies ofscale, for example, lower administrative expenses and branch rationalisation, and throughrevenue synergies, such as lower funding costs for the merged unit.However, consolidation across countries is an indispensable complement to domestic M&As.Banks that are more geographically diversified have tended to display stronger revenueperformance in recent years. Furthermore, cross-border holdings of deposits and loans canhelp bolster economic resilience within the euro area by helping to smooth shocks throughincome-sharing. These private sector risk-sharing channels play an important role in smoothingshocks in the United States but are of a much smaller magnitude in the euro area.There are still some significant obstacles preventing us from reaping the full benefits of cross-border consolidation. In order to facilitate larger M&As within the euro area banking sector, wemust make further progress towards completing the banking union and the capital marketsunion, and overcome prevailing regulatory and supervisory obstacles. Truly pan-European banksneed to conduct liquidity and capital management at the consolidated level to be efficient.Concrete steps in this direction involve establishing a European deposit insurance scheme and,subsequently, removing national options and discretions, for example regarding capital andliquidity, as well as harmonising insolvency laws and taxation regimes. Discrepancies ininsolvency and judicial systems hamper cross-border activity in capital markets. A consistentand efficient framework for pursuing failed contracts is vital to reduce uncertainty for cross-border investors.Concluding remarksLet me conclude.The persistently weak profitability of the euro area banking sector remains a key concern forfinancial stability, as it constrains banks’ ability to build up buffers against negative shocks. Whilecyclical factors have helped improve bank profitability over the last few years, progress in tacklingstructural challenges has clearly been insufficient.567 3 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
Reducing costs and improving efficiency are necessary steps, and digitalisation can be animportant and permanent cost-saving strategy for banks, but it needs to be underpinned by thestructural requirements I mentioned earlier, such as a general environment that is conducive todigitalisation. Many banks also need to improve their income-generating capacities, for exampleby enhancing fee and commission-based activities.In terms of the euro area banking sector as a whole, consolidation, both domestic and cross-border, is vital if we want the sector to become more efficient. We need to facilitate this. And weurgently need to make further progress towards completing the banking union and the capitalmarkets union.The Single Market is still fragmented along national lines. National options and discretions in theregulatory and supervisory frameworks reduce the economies of scale for banks operatingacross borders. Decisive steps to overcome these, the establishment of a European depositinsurance scheme as well as the harmonisation of insolvency laws and judicial frameworks arenecessary bold steps to allow for the emergence of efficient pan-European banks and greaterprivate risk-sharing in the European Union.European Banking Authority (2018), Risk Assessment Questionnaire – Summary of the Results, December.See Andersson, M., Kok, C., Mirza, H., Móré, C. and Mosthaf, J.

Jens Weidmann: Macroprudential policy through the lens ofSherlock HolmesWelcome address by Dr Jens Weidmann, President of the Deutsche Bundesbank andChairman of the Board of Directors of the Bank for International Settlements, at the 5th AnnualMacroprudential Conference, Eltville, 21 June 2016.*   *   *1 IntroductionLadies and gentlemen,Every contact leaves a trace. That is a basic principle of forensic science. In the early decades ofthe 20th century, it was established by the pioneering French criminologist Edmond Locard, andthus became known as Locard’s exchange principle. But Locard’s approach itself may havebeen affected by an exchange – he developed his methods after having come into contact withdetective fiction.Years before Locard set up his forensic laboratory in 1910, a fictional character had declared in apopular story: “As long as the criminal remains upon two legs so long must there be someindentation, some abrasion, some trifling displacement which can be detected by the scientificresearcher.” You all know this fictional investigator – it was none other than Sherlock Holmes.When Arthur Conan Doyle published his first stories about the consulting detective in Victoriantimes, criminal investigations usually started out from testimonies and motives. Physicalevidence was sought after theories had been built. And detectives were still lacking or renouncingfundamental forensic tools. It was only in 1901 that the British police adopted fingerprinting, forexample.Sherlock Holmes’ method of deduction, to reach conclusions based on observed facts, helpedhim to unravel mysteries virtually from the comfort of his armchair. But the master detective alsohad to go to crime scenes to search for tiny traces with his magnifying glass and collect the datahe needed.The analysis of risks to financial stability can resemble piecing together strands of evidence in acriminal case. Indeed, Richard Barwell, the Head of Macro Research at BNP Paribas AssetManagement, once referred to the principle of evidence-based macroprudential policy as the“Sherlock Holmes approach”.2 Macroprudential policy measures in GermanyTake Germany’s intention to activate the countercyclical capital buffer, for instance. On 27 May,Germany’s Financial Stability Committee issued a recommendation to activate a countercyclicalcapital buffer of 0.25%. The step was based on thorough detective work by the Bundesbank. Inlast year’s Financial Stability Review we presented evidence pointing to cyclical systemic riskswhich had built up over the years. Viewed in their entirety, these risks implied that precautionaryaction was required, which prompted the committee to issue the recommendation.Let’s take a closer look at the evidence available.2.1 The case for macroprudential policy actionExhibit A, so to speak, in the case for macroprudential action is the danger that marketparticipants may underestimate future credit risk whilst overestimating loss-absorbing capacity.123 1 / 7BIS central bankers' speeches
In the wake of the prolonged economic expansion, many market participants may no longer takesufficient account of periods of crisis and downturn in their risk assessments. And since riskprovisioning is at a low level now, possible future losses could eat directly into the equity buffersof banks.Besides, analyses by the Bundesbank as well as the IMF suggest that credit has been grantedincreasingly to enterprises that are comparatively weaker financially.  In the event of anunexpected economic downturn, the solvency of these firms could come under pressure and thelevel of non-performing loans may rise faster than in the past. Exhibit B in the case for macroprudential action is developments in the housing market. TheGerman residential property market has taken off since 2010. Within the last nine years, houseprices have risen nationwide by almost 60%. While this average increase can be explained byfundamental factors, real estate prices in German cities last year were between 15% and 30%above what fundamentals would suggest, according to Bundesbank estimates. And indicatorslike the price-to-rent ratio paint a similar picture of overvaluation in urban areas.In general, the residential property market can nourish major financial imbalances. After all, of the46 systemic banking crises in various countries for which house price data are available, morethan two-thirds followed boom-bust patterns in house prices.Now, when weighing the potential economic fallout of conceivable price corrections in thehousing market, it is not just the size of the overvaluation and adjustment itself that matters. Howthe boom is funded is also of crucial importance. Sharp declines in asset prices can beparticularly harmful to the economy when their impact is propagated and amplified through thefinancial system. If overvaluations of assets are driven by rapidly expanding credit, in a downturnthe deteriorating balance sheets of borrowers and lenders constrict new lending.  This, in turn,curtails investment and so worsens the economic contraction. In the 1980s, rising bank credit also fuelled a surge in land prices in major cities in Japan. Thisreal estate bubble is often deemed to be the origin of the Japanese financial crisis in the1990s, a period of time which gave rise to the term “lost decade” due to the economicstagnation it brought. Mitsuhiro Fukao will elaborate on the Japanese experience in a fewminutes.   In Germany, however, credit has not been the main driver of rising house prices in recent years.Even though the growth rate of housing loans had accelerated to 4.6% year-on-year by the end of2018, overall growth has been moderate, cumulating to 26% within the last nine years. And in itslast Financial Stability Review, the Bundesbank came to the conclusion that credit standards hadnot been relaxed considerably. Thus, overall, the available evidence does not point tosubstantially heightened financial stability risks from new lending for housing.Still, potentially overvalued property means potentially overvalued collateral. This is to say that, inan adverse scenario, if household income and house prices were to take a hit simultaneously,the share of non-performing loans could rise, while the value of the collateral could drop. Incombination, this would cause bank losses to increase markedly, as housing lending makes up45% of total bank loans to private households and enterprises.Exhibit C in the case for macroprudential action is heightened interest rate risk, of whichmortgages are a good example. At present, 47% of newly issued mortgages have an interestrate lock-in period of more than ten years, compared to 26% in 2010. If interest rates were toquickly spike higher, this would instantly drive up the costs of funding for banks. But interestincome would only increase with a time lag. And because many institutions would be affectedsimultaneously, other banks could not cushion the impact by stepping up new lending business.4567891011 2 / 7BIS central bankers' speeches
The opposite scenario, a protracted continuation of very low interest rates, would not bode wellfor banks’ earning capacity, either. In particular, it would increasingly burden those banks whichrely on traditional retail deposit-taking and lending operations as their main source of income.So, banks find themselves in a sort of a diver’s dilemma. Staying underwater for too long entailsthe risk of running out of oxygen. But coming up too quickly may cause decompression sickness.Hence, banks need to be resilient to both interest rate scenarios: rates that stay low for longerthan expected, and rates that spike higher.Just as many criminal cases have to be solved by piecing together small shreds of evidence, theGerman Financial Stability Committee here had to assess the cumulative weight of the cluesthey had gathered. And these clues did point to a common suspect: the possible underestimationof risks and increased vulnerabilities in the financial system. The preponderance of evidencesuggests that macroprudential action is in order.In the event of an unexpected severe economic slump, the identified risks in the financial systemcould materialise simultaneously, forcing many banks to cushion losses. Without sufficientbuffers, banks might seek to offload assets and cut back on lending, thereby aggravating theeconomic downturn.Higher capital buffers make the financial system more resilient to adverse shocks. In contrast toother regulatory capital, the buffer is not designed to be permanent. Banks can draw on thisbuffer in times of stress. Likewise, authorities can reduce or eliminate the buffer if thevulnerabilities in the financial system have dissipated. In this way, activating the countercyclicalcapital buffer now should serve as insurance against future financial turbulence.2.2 Macroeconomic conditions and the timing of macroprudential policy actionThe word already implies it: when judging whether to activate a countercyclical buffer, thequestion of timing is vital.Activation bears important consequences for banks. Therefore, such a measure must be takenwith legal certainty. Thorough investigations were necessary and meant observing the financialsystem over a longer period of time. All the available evidence needed to be gathered andcarefully assessed. Its cumulative weight had to be substantial to warrant action. This is why therecommendation comes at this point in time, not earlier.Some observers may wonder whether the window for action has already closed, given that theGerman economy has been cooling down markedly since the middle of last year. According toBundesbank macroeconomic projections published two weeks ago, economic activity is likely togrow by just 0.6% this year. But our experts consider this to be a soft patch that is largely due toa slowdown in external demand, weighing on export-oriented sectors. Indeed, manufacturing hasentered a downturn.By contrast, sectors with a greater domestic focus continue to grow robustly, supported byfavourable financing conditions, loosened fiscal policy and a labour market that is still in excellentshape. As long as this dichotomy within the German economy persists, the underlying cyclicaltrend will likely remain weak.Going forward, our economic experts thus anticipate that the soft patch will last a little longer. Butgiven that exports will regain traction, economic activity will pick up in the second half of the year.As a result, the economy is expected to grow at a pace of 1.2% next year and 1.3% in 2021. Inthis baseline scenario, the utilisation of aggregate capacities is likely to remain at a level distinctlyabove normal. Thus, macroeconomic conditions are still benign, while cyclical risks have beenidentified in the financial system. So now is the appropriate time for the banking sector to takepreventive action and build up resilience. 3 / 7BIS central bankers' speeches
For at least two of the researchers in the room, the recommendation to activate thecountercyclical capital buffer may not have come as a surprise. After lunch, Nellie Liang willpresent evidence she and her co-author Rochelle Edge have found that countries with financialstability committees which have stronger governance mechanisms are more likely to use thecountercyclical capital buffer. And Germany falls into this category.Indeed, eight other European countries already have a countercyclical capital buffer in place. Thebuffer has been implemented in the United Kingdom, Sweden, Denmark, the Czech Republic,Slovakia, Lithuania, Norway and Iceland, while France, Ireland, Luxembourg and Bulgaria will beimplementing it in the coming months.3 Macroprudential policy and monetary policyThe preventive build-up of sufficient capital buffers is also helpful from a monetary policyperspective. Banks whose capital ratios hover barely above the regulatory thresholds and whichcannot easily increase their equity through capital markets are especially prone to cut lending in adownturn. This potentially impairs an important transmission channel of monetary policy. Byupping capital ratios when times are good, macroprudential policies can help preserve monetarypolicy’s potency in more difficult times.A recent paper by Bundesbank researchers has shown that if macroprudential policy is too lax,this might actually create a situation akin to financial dominance. Monetary policy may then beforced to step in by driving inflation above its price stability target and reducing the real burden ofprivate debt. Thus, a stringent macroprudential reaction to financial stability risks is also a meansto protect monetary policy.But not only does macroprudential policy impact monetary policy: monetary policy influencesfinancial stability and thus macroprudential policies as well. As our keynote speaker Jean Tirolehas pointed out before, monetary policy can affect the risk appetite of market participants. Inline with such a risk-taking channel of monetary policy, Bundesbank economists have foundsurvey-based evidence that low earnings on interest can induce banks to take on additionalrisks.To some, this might raise the question of whether monetary policy should be given a financialstability mandate as well, maybe even on a par with its price stability mandate. In my view, thiswould be a perilous proposition.A multitude of objectives might force monetary policy into unfavourable trade-offs of the kind Ihave just outlined. For a central bank which has been tasked with aiming for both price stabilityand financial stability, time-inconsistency problems can arise. In this case, a central bank mayhave an incentive to deviate from the socially optimal rate of inflation ex post. The first line ofdefence against financial imbalances should therefore be macroprudential policies. They allowfor more targeted interventions, too.Monetary policy in the euro area is a one-size-fits-all approach, since key interest rates, inparticular, are set for the currency union as a whole, in keeping with our objective of pricestability.Given the subdued price pressures in the euro area in the aftermath of the financial andsovereign debt crises, monetary policy accommodation has certainly been warranted. But thelong period of ultra-low interest rates comes with risks and side effects, some of which I havementioned earlier.And what might be, by pure chance, the right amount of monetary stimulus to kick-start lending inone Member State might over-rev the financial engine in another.12131415161718 4 / 7BIS central bankers' speeches
That’s when macroprudential policies come into play. They can act on a national level, taking thestate of the specific financial system into account, and can counteract the build-up of financialimbalances even in an individual sector. Moreover, macroprudential policy tools can differentiatebetween borrower and lender vulnerabilities, a topic Guido Lorenzoni will tackle in greater detail insession 4 of our conference.By contrast, the impact of monetary policy on the economy is much broader. Let’s dip back intothe world of crime for a comparison here: of course, the police could muster strong forces toround up many suspects in order to catch a single criminal. But Sherlock Holmes may havebeen equally successful without arresting innocent citizens – just with the help of science, logic,and his magnifying glass.However, since financial imbalances can jeopardise price stability, monetary policy should beaware of its ability to affect risk taking. As we have learned painfully from the financial crisis,severe problems in the financial system could eventually spill over to the real economy and toinflation.Ideally, macroprudential policies can quell a fire before it turns into a blaze. We therefore needfurther research to find out how to make macroprudential tools as effective as possible.4 The state of too-big-to-fail  More research is also required to examine one of the central promises made in the aftermath ofthe financial crisis – the promise that taxpayers will not be on the hook again for losses incurredby banks: the promise to end too-big-to-fail. Ending too-big-to-fail is not only a question offairness. It is elementary for the functioning of financial markets, as it restores proper incentives.Much has been done to remedy the issue. Higher capital requirements, resolution regimes,standards for loss-absorbing debt instruments are all important in our efforts to do away withimplicit subsidies to banks. But we need to find out exactly how far we have come. Within theevaluation framework of the Financial Stability Board, Claudia Buch is chairing a working groupinvestigating the state of play of too-big-to-fail. Input from all stakeholders, in particular academia,will be crucial for the process to be as stringent and transparent as possible, and Claudia willelaborate on this in her dinner speech this evening.5 Stablecoins and their possible implicationsLearning from the past leaves us better equipped to master the future. “History might not repeatitself, but it does rhyme.” Mark Twain supposedly said. But the Bundesbank is also monitoringthe possible emergence of new risks to financial stability that might not be an echo from the past.Technological progress is rapidly transforming the way we live. This is especially true forpayment systems. “Stablecoins”, as they are known, are crypto-tokens or accounts whose valueis pegged to existing fiat currencies – or a basket of currencies. Being a stable store of value isan important precondition for the use of crypto-tokens or accounts in everyday transactions.The allure of stablecoins lies in their potential use for digital peer-to-peer transactions, without thevolatility in value we usually observe in other crypto-tokens. But they can also create risks forconsumers. In particular, there is the question of how the value of stablecoins can beguaranteed.One approach would be to fully back stablecoins with funds stored in a trust account. But thenthere needs to be certainty that stablecoins are not issued in excess of these funds, and thatconvertibility is guaranteed and almost free of charge. Moreover, the trust funds should not investin risky or illiquid assets as collateral. In the end, some form of regulation is needed at the globallevel. 5 / 7BIS central bankers' speeches
If stablecoins became widely used, they would almost certainly become systemic by nature, notonly because of their operational risks, but also in a more fundamental way: they couldundermine the deposit-taking of banks and their business models. This might disrupt transactionbanking and financial market intermediation.Tobias Adrian, Director of the IMF's Monetary and Capital Markets Department, pointed to aspecific possibility in a recent speech. One way of addressing the risks associated withstablecoins would be to provide their suppliers with access to reserve accounts at central banks,and at the same time to entrust those central banks with the task of supervising stablecoinproviders as well as wallet providers and distributors. This, Mr Adrian says, would actually create“synthetic central bank digital currency”, as users could, ultimately, hold and transact in a centralbank liability.But this would mean that the risks usually associated with digital central bank currencies mightalso emerge with stablecoins. In particular, there could be a danger that, in times of stress,depositors could easily shift funds out of private banks, thereby possibly triggering or acceleratingbank runs.Session 2 of our conference will explore the pros and cons of digital central bank currencies andmight therefore also shed light on this aspect of stablecoins.Of course, any evaluation very much depends on the specific characteristics a digital currencymight have. A thorough analysis of the intentions, set-up and possible implications for thefinancial system will be essential. The G7 has therefore tasked a high-level central bank workinggroup to report on stablecoins to the next meeting of finance ministers and central bankgovernors this July in Chantilly.At all events, their emergence illustrates the need for cheap, convenient, and instantaneouscross-border means of payment. Thus, central banks and the financial sector should provide thepublic with modern, fast and digital payment instruments. It is about keeping our finger on thepulse, and our eye on the state of the art, in our efforts to promote the smooth functioning ofpayment systems without unduly endangering financial stability. In particular, real-time paymentsystems have to become the standard in Europe over the medium term.6 ConclusionDuring their very first encounter, our master detective told Watson that he had invented the“Sherlock Holmes test” for blood stains. And a few chapters later he impressed the doctor byidentifying the brand of a cigar from its ashes and referring to a study he had written on thesubject. Decades after the first adventure of Sherlock Holmes had been published in 1887,Edmond Locard eventually turned this fiction into reality when he issued a paper on theidentification of tobacco by analysing ashes.Since those early days, science has been driving breakthroughs in the field of forensics at afurious pace. The possibilities created by DNA analysis are just one such example. In much thesame way, we need academia to help advance financial stability analysis and policy.When it comes to practical applications and policy advice, let me remind you of the words of theimmortal Sherlock Holmes: “It is a capital mistake to theorise before one has data. Insensibly onebegins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts." By sharing insightssteeped in data, I am confident that this conference will move us further ahead in the quest for ascientific underpinning of macroprudential policy.I wish us all a rewarding and exciting conference!1920211 6 / 7BIS central bankers' speeches

Michelle W Bowman: Minority depository institutionsSpeech by Ms Michelle W Bowman, Member of the Board of Governors of the Federal ReserveSystem, at the 2019 Interagency Minority Depository Institution and CDFI Bank Conference,Arlington, Virginia, 25 June 2019.*   *   *Thank you, Makada. Good morning and let me also welcome everyone to the Seidman Center. Iam very pleased to join you today for this discussion, which highlights the important role thatminority depository institutions (MDIs) and Community Development Financial Institutions(CDFIs) play in their communities. It is your presence in these communities and the services youoffer that support local businesses, jobs, and economic growth.I know this because before joining the Federal Reserve, I was a community banker in a smallrural town and more recently served as Kansas’ State Bank Commissioner. I understand what itmeans to try to meet the financial needs of a community, whose needs are varied and canpresent unique challenges to a credit underwriter. I remember working with a customer on amortgage loan for less than $20,000 with a first-time homebuyer’s credit to purchase a mobilehome. It was one of the most complicated and time consuming loans that I made during my timeas a banker. Some larger banks might not be able or even be interested in putting that together,but community bankers know how important this kind of service is to their lower-incomecustomers. I’m proud to bring that perspective to the Federal Reserve Board as the first governorto fill the role designated for someone with community banking experience.One way to fulfill my responsibilities is by meeting with and listening closely to minority andcommunity bankers, consumers, small business owners, and local leaders—all of thestakeholders with an interest in their communities. MDIs and their staff play a key role, and I willuse the knowledge we gain from these interactions to improve our work at the Federal Reserve.We aim to help MDIs in three ways: by finding ways to ease your regulatory burden, bysponsoring valuable and actionable research on your contributions to your communities, and byseeking to better support you through outreach and hands-on technical assistance.To achieve these goals, the Fed has developed an extensive outreach program, the Partnershipfor Progress (PFP). The PFP helps MDIs confront business model challenges, cultivate safebanking practices, and compete more effectively in the marketplace—all topics that I expect willbe addressed today.Regulatory BurdenOne of the most important ways to help MDIs is by reducing regulatory burden. We are acting toimplement provisions of a new law, S-2155, and reviewing comments on several proposalsmade in 2018 to ensure they do not unduly burden community banks. Our community bankleverage ratio proposal would allow qualifying banks to opt out of a more complicated risk-basedcapital framework. Other proposals include raising to $400,000 the threshold for when anappraisal is required for a residential real estate transaction and narrowing the Volcker rule tobanks engaged in riskier activities. We raised the threshold from $1 billion to $3 billion in assetsfor banks that could qualify for an 18-month examination cycle. Further, we raised the assetthreshold to $3 billion for the Small Bank Holding Company and Savings and Loan HoldingCompany Policy Statement. This change, which exempts small holding companies fromconsolidated risk-based capital rules, fosters local ownership of small banks by allowing morebanking companies with limited access to capital markets to use debt in bank acquisitions.With respect to supervision, the Federal Reserve continues to tailor and reduce burden byconducting portions of examinations offsite for community banks that prefer that option. The 1 / 2BIS central bankers' speeches
Bank Exams Tailored to Risk (BETR) program identifies low-risk or, conversely, high-riskactivities within state member banks and appropriately streamlines or expands examination workprograms commensurate with the identified risk. This minimizes the burden for banks that arewell managed and directs supervisory resources to higher-risk activities where they are mostneeded.Related to regulatory burden is an important initiative, in concert with the Federal DepositInsurance Corporation, to identify healthy minority banking organizations capable of acquiring ormerging with MDIs in troubled condition. Our PFP team has assisted with the process forestablishing new MDIs and worked with MDIs to identify advantageous federally sponsoredprograms with which to collaborate. I note that today’s agenda includes a session on this topic.ResearchThe Board and Reserve Banks also conduct valuable research on the impact of MDIs onunderserved households and communities. Last November, we held a webinar, which I hopesome of you were able to participate in, on recent research on MDIs. All of our MDI research isavailable on the Partnership for Progress website. The PFP continues to seek to sponsor high-quality research to enhance our understanding of the MDI business model and how MDIs servetheir communities. We welcome your input on research topics you find interesting and helpful.Tech Assistance/OutreachThrough this biennial conference and several PFP conferences and outreach events each year,the Federal Reserve facilitates networking among MDI institutions. District coordinators fromeach Federal Reserve Bank will serve on local exam teams during examinations, and collectfeedback from MDIs on how the PFP can provide additional assistance. District coordinatorsmeet regularly with MDI management to discuss emerging issues and provide technicalassistance, especially to those in troubled condition, to explain supervisory guidance, discusschallenges, and respond to management concerns and inquiries. High-interest items include theCommunity Reinvestment Act, IT and cybersecurity, concentrations in commercial real estate,interest-rate risk, capital planning and rules, anti-money-laundering compliance, and third-partyvendor management. We want to help MDIs navigate supervisory and regulatory requirements.To do that well, we want to continue to develop an open dialogue so we can better understandthe challenges you face and how we can best help you wherever we have the ability to do so.Personal contact and relationship building are important to community banking and, I believe,also to community bank oversight. We want, and need, to hear your questions and concerns.Last April, we invited the leaders of all Fed-supervised MDIs to a Leaders Forum so we couldspend a day and a half building relationships and talking about the needs of MDIs. We alsoencourage staff to reach out to MDIs and ensure that you are aware of our outreach meetingsand research. Let’s keep this communication going. We engage is these efforts because yourinstitutions are vital to your communities and to the American economy. On behalf of the FederalReserve, I’d like to once again thank you for the work you do in your communities and welcomeyou to this year’s conference. 2 / 2BIS central bankers' speeches
Guo Shuqing: Rejuvenation of China is unstoppableSpeech by Mr Guo Shuqing, Party Secretary and Deputy Governor of the People's Bank ofChina, at the Tsinghua PBCSF Global Finance Forum, Beijing, 25 May 2019.*   *   *Distinguished guests, professors, students and friends,Good morning!It gives me great pleasure to attend the Tsinghua PBCSF Global Finance Forum. Taking thisopportunity, I would like to share with you my observations on some economic and financialissues of common interest. I would also welcome your questions and comments later on.I. The escalation of trade friction by the United States does not help solve any problem.On May 10th, the US government announced the increase of tariffs on $200 billion of Chineseexports. It then further declared to impose ban on Huawei and other Chinese companies, andalso decided to launch anti-subsidy investigation on the renminbi exchange rate. Such actionsdid not surprise the Chinese government, companies and people, as we have believed that atrade war does not help solve any problem, but could only do harm to the others while notbenefiting the inflictor, resulted in collateral damage to the whole.From the perspective of China, though in theory the US could raise the tariffs on Chinese exportsto the maximum, the impacts on China’s economy would be very limited. Firstly, the vast majorityof China’s exports to the US are suitable for domestic sale. Now China is right in the process ofconsumption upgrade, which means a rapidly expanding domestic market could absorb a largeamount of the products intended for export, without exerting a “crowding out” effect on theexisting consumer goods. Secondly, the export market has been further diversified. With greatprogress made in the Belt and Road Initiative, Chinese products are also welcome in overseasmarkets other than the US. Thirdly, despite the tariff increase, a substantial amount of theChinese products are still expected to export to the US, as on the one hand, there is currently nobetter substitute for these products, and on the other, the US importers are more than willing toshare the increased cost given the ample profits of the import business. Fourthly, China is nowupgrading its industrial structure, which requires the transfer of certain production activities tooverseas, and thus facilitating high-quality growth in China. Fifthly, financial market in Chinawithstood the over-impacts caused by the trade tension last year. Hence, it has become moreresilient to stand up to any further shocks.From the perspective of the US, it would expose to the corresponding backlash of tariff increaseto almost the same extent. For example, the US exports to China will contract, which wouldundermine the interests of many US companies and lead to notable income decline of some UShigh-tech firms. A large number of the US companies that have been long accustomed to relyingon the processing, assembly, transportation and distribution of the Chinese exports for creatingvalue added will be severely impacted, with some even face the danger of going bust.  The USconsumers would also pay higher costs, with the low- and middle-income people, farmers andblue-collar workers in particular, suffering more welfare losses in real terms. Besides, the UShas huge assets and liabilities overseas, and relies on the Wall-street dominated internationalfinancial system more than any other country. A trade war will undoubtedly lead to marketfluctuations and ultimately a lackluster international financial market.From the logic perspective, the US tariff increase aims to reduce trade deficit with China. Butwith China’s retaliatory measures, the forthright outcome of tariff increase could be quite murkyand even counter-productive in the end with other factors considered. Firstly, to put China’s high-tech firms on its sanction list, to which the US government explicitly forbids the sale of products 1 / 9BIS central bankers' speeches
and technologies by its companies, is an action of directly increasing the trade deficit by the USitself. Secondly, the launch of a the trade war has sent waves to the international financialmarket, leading to a rapid depreciation of the renmibi, which again aroused the US governmentconcern of compromising the effect of tariff increase. Thirdly, a substantial tariff increase wouldinflate commodity prices, denting the advantage of a low inflationary environment enjoyed by theUS economy. Fourthly, the gap left by curbing Chinese imports would be filled by exports fromother economies, resulting in unchanged total US trade deficit.From the perspective of history, the trade frictions between the US and other rising economieshave been lasting for over 40 years, such as first with Germany, then Japan, and later the fourAsian Dragons. In 2000, China overtook Japan as the country recorded the biggest trade surpluswith the US. Now, countries such as India, Vietnam, Indonesia, the Philippines, Bangladesh andsome Latin American countries are developing with strong momentum, which are jointlypromoting the change of international pattern of trade in goods and services. Hence, China’sexports to the US may decrease gradually, but the overall pattern of US trade deficit will be hardto change.II. The United States has benefited substantially from its trade deficit with China.If we only look at statistics, it seems that the US has been on the losing side given its large valueand  percentage of trade deficit with China. But with more granular analysis, it is not difficult tosee that the US has actually got huge benefits from trade with China in many aspects. To use ametaphor here, the US gained benefits from bilateral economic and trade exchange with Chinaare just like peeling several layers of skins off the same bull.First，the US importers and multinationals have grabbed the lion share of the added value of thetrade balance. Nearly 60 percent of the US-China trade deficit in goods was attributed to foreign-invested companies in China, most of which are US-owned companies. Thus, sales of theseproducts ultimately contributed to the revenue and profits of the US companies. 61 percent of thetrade imbalance between China and the US comes from processing trade, and China gets verylittle in the actual value distribution. Besides, one-third of the growth in US companies’ overseassales was contributed by the Chinese market.Second, the US consumers have enjoyed huge “consumer surplus” through trade with China.According to statistics, about one-fourth of retail goods in the US market were imported fromChina. For example, 26 percent of the products sold by Wal-Mart came directly from China. Thesteady flow of China’s inexpensive and quality products into the US has helped lower the cost ofliving for the US households and improved welfare.Third, it is China that supported the prices of US exports of products and services. For example,if without China’s large purchase of commodities such as grain and energy, as well as civilianaircrafts and chips, their prices would by no means be at today’s level. Besides, according to USstatistics, it has a surplus of more than $40 billion in trade services with China every year.Fourth, the US has experienced the miracle of “high consumption and low inflation” since the1990s. Even during the ten years of quantitative easing, there was no distinct inflation in the US.One of the significant reasons is that China, with its population larger than that of Europe, the USand Japan combined, and in the matured stage of industrialization, has unprecedentedlyincreased the global supply of consumer goods.Fifth, the US has gained from a huge volume of cheap capital repatriation. The capitalaccumulated by China through its trade surplus underpins US consumption and investment inthe form of China investing in the US dollar-denominated assets such as the US Treasury bonds.By the end of last year, China held a total of $7.3 trillion worth of international financial assets,more than half of which were denominated in US dollar. With continued inflow of the Chinesecapital, the funding cost of the US market has remained extremely low, creating extremely 2 / 9BIS central bankers' speeches
favorable conditions for US economic recovery and prosperity.Sixth, the US has long occupied China’s huge savings resources. The Chinese people arehardworking and frugal. Even when their monthly salary was around a dozen or dozens ofdollars, they tried to put aside some money for savings. Hence, China’s domestic savings rateand household savings rate have always been at a relatively high level. While on the contrary, theUS has had a relatively large investment-to-savings gap. By that token, the US huge currentaccount deficit with China means a US occupation of China’s net savings of the same scale.Since the capital repatriated from China into the US mainly takes the form of securities and otherassets investment, coupled with a high share of direct financing in the US financial system,deposit creation in the US has remained low. Over the past several decades, broad moneysupply and cash in the US have both been growing slowly, in sharp contrast to the phenomenonof the 1970s and 1980s, sufficing to explain a new secret of the US, that is, it has even saved lotsof money from printing and issuing the dollar notes. In that sense, the famous Triffin dilemma inthe international economics study has found an effective solution.III. The alleged “China’s theft of US technology” is the logic of power politics.Forty years ago, China started to introduce foreign investors, who were allowed to set up threedifferent kinds of foreign-invested enterprises (i.e. Sino-foreign joint ventures, Sino-foreigncooperative enterprises and wholly foreign-owned enterprises), and have since gained hugeprofits in China. Now the market sales of foreign investors in China have amounted to trillions ofdollars and with profits reaching hundreds of billions of dollars. All these were based on theprinciple of reciprocal cooperation with mutual benefits, without any one of the investmentcontracts forced to be signed by the Chinese government. Strict observance of the contract hasalways been advocated by Europe and the United States, and is gradually appreciated by theChinese enterprises and residents. But now all of a sudden, the US alleged that Chinese lawsand economic practices impose “forced technology transfer”, “forced IPR transfer” and evenused the word “theft”. That was not only a challenge to the basic facts, but also a humiliation tothe Chinese people.It is a common practice for any rising economy to learn the knowledge and experiences ofdeveloped countries. That is why there emerged the so-called “catching up and imitation”concept in development economics. Over more than ten centuries in history, China’s scienceand technology was second to none in the world. Our intangible assets have made exceptionalcontributions to the development of human civilization. The well-known “Four Great Inventions” ofAncient China have contributed to the emergence of capitalism in Europe. Without gunpowder,compass, and the printing technology, there would be no modern industrial economy. Great menin history such as Francis Bacon and Karl Marx have all spoke highly of that. That being said, itseems in retrospect that our ancestors have their own regrets. Though they have invented somany things, they only failed to invent “IPR”.Looking back into history, it should be noted that imitation and even plagiarism of technologyamong countries were very common during the industrial age of Europe and the US. Somecompanies even tried to acquire advanced technology through dishonest and unprincipledmeans. This is a specific historical time phase which can not be bypassed. The developedcountries have all gone through the process of standardizing intellectual property protection. Butit is by building upon the work of their predecessors that each of the country achieved newbreakthroughs in and made new contributions to technological advancement. Thus, we believethat no country, including the US, can realize modernization by theft. But rather, modernizationcan only be achieved through hard work and strenuous efforts of their own peoples.It was originated from the western countries to trade technology for market or to trade market fortechnology. Based on the principle of fairness, technology trading is a fundamental marketeconomy activity commonly accepted. Over the past years, developed countries, including 3 / 9BIS central bankers' speeches
European countries and the US, have always claimed to voluntarily transfer knowledge andtechnology on the principle of free and fair trade, so as to help the third world countries get rid ofpoverty and backwardness and realize economic independence. If such goal can be achieved, itwill undoubtedly be conducive to the development of the world economy. But now it seems thatUS does not have the willingness to fulfill its commitments.By technology transfer, developed countries have been continuously gaining substantial returns.Through such means as patents grant and franchising, developed countries have made hugeprofits with their technologies applied in the developing economies. Some of the profits were inturn re-invested for research and development (R&D), forming a “perfect cycle” for thetechnological advancement of the developed countries. Besides, many of the technologies weretested through application in the developing countries. With contributions from project managersin those countries to further improve the technologies, the overall technological capacity of thedeveloped countries was further promoted.It is totally groundless for the US to make the accusations against China by citing intellectualproperty protection as a cover while aiming in essence for trade protectionism. In contemporaryworld, China is already a firm defender and active builder of international intellectual propertyrules. The Director General of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), FrancisGurry, said in an interview with China Intellectual Property News in 2019 on the sidelines of thehigh-level Forum on China IP Protection that “China is now a world leading player in intellectualproperty creation and protection”. Only a few years ago the US government, agencies, andpoliticians openly acknowledged China’s progress in intellectual property protection. Are these allchanged overnight?The history has proven, and will continue to prove that, sanction and blockade will not stop acountry’s technological and economic development, but on the contrary will make it furtherdetermined to continue its own research and push forward its technological development. Duringthe 1950s and the 1960s, despite the blockade and embargo imposed on us, China stilldeveloped the atomic and hydrogen bombs, missiles and man-made satellites under poor,backward and tough situations, gradually making itself one of the leading science andtechnological powers in the world.IV. China will further deepen the reform of renminbi exchange rate regime.China’s CPC Central Committee and the State Council have decided to deepen the reform onrenminbi exchange rate formation mechanism, increase the flexibility of renminbi exchange rateand keep it largely stable at a reasonable and equilibrium level. Over recent years, the renminbiexchange rate against a basket of currencies has kept stable in a global context. The Chinesegovernment has made great efforts to maintain a balance between the flexibility and stability ofrenminbi exchange rate, which was widely recognized by the international community.Since the early 1990s, the US has constantly threatened China with the allegation of “exchangerate manipulation”. By definition of the US Treasury Department, three quantitative criteria needto be fulfilled concurrently to become a currency manipulator, including: 1) an annual tradesurplus of over $20 billion with the US, 2) a current account surplus accounting for 3 percent ofGDP, and 3) the value of foreign exchange purchased for exchange rate interference purposeexceeding 2 percent of GDP. In 2018, China’s current account surplus was only 0.37 percent ofits GDP, and there was no large amount of foreign exchange purchase, neither did China gaincompetitive advantage of trade through currency depreciation. So the US government can hardlylabel China a currency manipulator.Over the past decade, all dramatic renminbi depreciations were triggered by external factors.The most recent one in May this year, when offshore Chinese yuan dropped over 3 percentagainst the dollar, was totally caused by the escalated trade friction by the US government. Overthe years, developed countries had always called for greater flexibility of renminbi exchange rate. 4 / 9BIS central bankers' speeches
However, once the renminbi exchange rate formation mechanism became more market-orientedand more elastic, some countries soon adopt an attitude of “Lord Ye’s Love of Dragons”, theactual fear behind professed love, with unfounded suspicion and accusation towards China,which is absolutely ridiculous.As is well-known, despite the recent FX market fluctuations, so far there is no panic amongChinese firms and residents. More and more people have realized that it is not realistic to makemoney from currency speculations. Nor is it safe to transfer financial assets overseas. Insophisticated markets, nearly no companies or individuals live on investment returns of foreigncurrency speculation. Even the so-called Mrs Watanabe in Japan actually turned out to be anoverstated investment story.It is normal to have temporary fluctuations on renminbi exchange rate. But for the long run, givenChina’s economic fundamentals, continued renminbi depreciation is unlikely. With huge marketsize and growth potential, China remains to be the biggest engine for global economic growth. Asthe quality of China’s economic development improves, the renminbi exchange rate will keepapproaching the purchasing power parity (PPP), and the speculators who tried to short sell theChinese currency will inevitably suffer huge losses. V. China does not practice the so-called state capitalism.In recent years, there have been views in the world that the rapid development of China’seconomy is the result of the practice of “state capitalism”, which explains why Chinese productsare extremely competitive in the international market. That is a groundless reasoning.In fact, China’s economic structure has become increasingly diversified, with the market share ofstate-owned enterprises continuing to decline. Factoring in public services by the government,China’s state-owned economy now accounts for less than 40 percent of GDP. Many of the state-owned enterprises have got listed in China and abroad, thus having become companies withmixed ownership in nature. Enterprises 100 percent state-owned are now very limited. For largestate-owned enterprises, a number of their subsidiaries’ ultimate control have been transferred toprivate companies. Even among the central government-owned enterprises, they compete witheach other. More than 20 years ago during the reform of the military industrial enterprises, eachsector was divided into two or more companies.At present, private and foreign capital can enter into almost all industries and sectors, only withfew facing legal or policy restrictions. Be it rail transportation, equipment manufacturing, or rawenergy materials, enterprises with different kinds of ownership structure are found in all thesesectors. China adopts the principle of neutral competition, emphasizing that all market playersare treated equally. We encourage them to both compete and cooperate, and to complementeach other for a win-win relationship. China’s industrial and credit policies are of a guiding nature.When implementing those policies, the principles of the market and law must be observed. Suchpolicies are no differences from the US National Export Initiatives and the European IndustrialRenaissance. Internationally, there are always people complaining that the Chinese governmentprovides huge subsidies for all products. In fact, this kind of criticism is logically difficult to stand.If all enterprises are to be subsidized, resources must be equally taken from all of them.The financial industry has also cultivated a diversified structure. China has state-owned financialinstitutions, as well as foreign-owned ones. Listed institutions and rural credit cooperatives evenhave natural person shareholders. There are more than 3,000 private-controlled institutions out of4,588 banking institutions in China, and most of the 170 Chinese insurance companies areprivate-controlled. Most of the securities companies and fund companies are private-owned aswell. Even for the top five commercial banks, foreign ownership accounted for as high as 25percent a decade ago, while at that time it was very difficult for them to even apply for a branch inthe US. Currently, the big banks’ ownership shares from private sector, domestic or foreign,account for an average of 30 percent, with some even exceeding 40 percent. It shall also be 5 / 9BIS central bankers' speeches
pointed out that although the KPIs of the top five banks are improving, their market sharecontinue to decline, now only 37 percent. So in terms of market concentration, China is notablylower than some major economies, like the US and the European countries.Another typical example is China’s Fintech, which takes the lead in the world. The mostimportant underlying reason is that the government adopted a prudent yet inclusive attitudetowards private internet companies, thus creating a fair competition environment. Large state-owned banks adopted the attitude of both competition and cooperation from the very beginningtoward Fintech companies. For example, more than a decade ago, Ali-pay was born and swiftlygrew through cooperation with the large and medium-sized banks, including China ConstructionBank. Now, all Fintech companies have established strategic cooperative partnerships with thelarge and medium-sized banks. Other banks themselves have also made great efforts to developFintech business. They carried out all-round cooperation with IT companies in fund raising,account opening, payment and settlement, inclusive finance etc. They draw on each other’sstrengths to make up for each other’s shortcomings, and have achieved remarkable results.Thus, it demonstrates that even in such most significant and essential field, the Chinesegovernment didn’t simply exercise state monopoly.VI. The goal to improve corporate governance structure will remain unchanged.In recent years, some foreign institutions and organizations have been skeptical about China’scorporate governance, especially about the CPC’s role in it. Private enterprises in China havealways been operating independently and effectively based on their Articles of Association andgovernance structures. They are independent entities operating in the market and abide by therules of the market. The CPC has not interfered in their operation.In the state-owned enterprises, the leadership of the CPC has always played a central role. It isthe most distinctive feature of the Chinese corporate governance model to integrate theleadership of the CPC. President Xi Jinping has stressed that it is a major political principle toadhere to the CPC’s leadership in state-owned enterprises, which must be implementedconsistently; and that the reform of state-owned enterprises should follow the direction ofestablishing a modern enterprise system, which must also be implemented consistently. Tofurther deepen the reform of state-owned enterprises, corporate governance must be improvedwhile the role of the CPC must also be fully recognized, so that the two can integrate with andbetter promote each other.From the perspective of global theoretical research and empirical studies, there is neither aunified model of corporate governance nor an “optimal model” that can be blindly copied. Thefundamental corporate governance principles and framework of Chinese enterprises are in linewith the international prevailing standards. At the G20 Hangzhou Summit held in China in 2016,we have made clear in the communiqué to support the principles of corporate governanceadvocated by the G20 and the OECD. Under such a general principle and framework, it complieswith the international common practices to make some adjustments and refinements in practiceto reflect each country’s specific conditions.Establishing a modern enterprise system and upholding the CPC’s leadership are fullycompatible with each other. First, of in terms of establishing a  mechanism where effectivechecks and balances are in place, the general meeting of shareholders, the board of directors,the senior management and the board of supervisors are encouraged to assume their respectiveresponsibilities and roles in accordance with the law. The CPC Committee mainly takes theresponsibility to lead the direction, to manage the overall situation and to ensure implementation.It plays a key role to ensure that the company abide by the law and policy, cultivate a healthycorporate culture and fulfill social responsibilities. Business strategies and decision-making areup to the board of directors. Second, in the protection of stakeholders, good corporategovernance means taking full account of the legitimate rights and interests of shareholders, 6 / 9BIS central bankers' speeches
employees, customers, communities, creditors, as well as that of the upstream and downstreamcompanies of the supply chain. CPC has always adhered to the fundamental principle of servingthe people. It has both rich experiences in mass work and the capacity to organize and motivate,which can better protect the legitimate rights and interests of all parties. Third, the CPCorganizations adopt collective leadership, and the members of the CPC Committee, the board ofdirectors, and the board of supervisors can also be cross-appointed, which can better solveproblems like internal controls, large shareholder manipulation, inadequate performance ofdirectors, and the non-independence of independent directors, and so on.Past practices have proved that cultivating a corporate governance model with the Chinesecharacteristics is absolutely feasible. For example, the core leading roles of the CPC Committeehave been fully brought into play in the five large banks, i.e. ICBC, ABC, BOC, CCB and BOCM.These banks have made historic breakthroughs in corporate governance and businessperformance after a series of major initiatives such as reform of ownership structure,introduction of strategic investors, and getting listed domestically or overseas. Some of thebanks had won international awards on corporate governance more than a decade ago. Thesebanks have also been highly internationalized with a global network of shareholders and outlets.Some key business indicators of these banks have reached the international advanced level,including productivity, return on capital, cost-to-income ratio, capital adequacy ratio andprovisioning coverage ratio, to name just a few. It also shows that while learning from theinternational experiences, China is capable of proactively exploring good corporate governancemodels with the Chinese characteristics.VII. China will unswervingly keep opening up the financial sector.The opening-up of the financial sector is the trend of the times, and it will neither stop nor gobackward. In 2013, China overtook the US to become the world’s largest trading nation. In 2018,the imports and exports of China accounted for 10.8 percent and 12.8 percent of the world’s totalrespectively. China has been regarded as the largest trading partner by over half of the worldcountries. Compared with the production and exchange of commodity goods, the opening-up ofChina’s service industry has been relatively lagging behind. The financial sector is a vital part ofthe service industry and needs to further open up to better serve the real economy and people’slives.In 2018, 15 pieces of opening-up measures in the banking and insurance sectors wereannounced. In May this year, 12 new opening-up measures were further unveiled. All thesemeasures are being implemented step by step on schedule. Going forward, there still remainsample room for further opening-up, since currently foreign capital only takes up 2 percent ofChina’s A-share market capitalization and 2.9 percent of China’s bond market, while foreign-funded banks account for 1.6 percent of the total commercial banking assets, and foreign-fundedinsurance companies account for 5.8 percent of the total insurance assets in China. Foreigninstitutions with good market reputation, sound credit record, and expertise in risk management,credit rating, wealth management, factoring, consumer finance, pension, health insurance andother business areas are particularly welcome to do business in China. With participation ofthose institutions, financial market entities can be further enriched, financial product innovationfurther promoted and the financial market vitality further unleashed.In the process of further opening up, the complexity and contagion of financial risks will no doubtfurther increase. For a large developing country like China, it is crucial to mitigate and controlfinancial risks, in particular, large-scale inflows and outflows of cross-border capital and thespeculation of “hot money". Efforts must also be taken to resolutely prevent excessive bubbles inthe property market and financial assets. VIII. China should also have its own house cleaned first. 7 / 9BIS central bankers' speeches
The fate of the Chinese nation should be held firmly in the hands of itself, as no external forcescan alter the direction of its development. At present, the whole country is advancing thetransition from high-speed growth to high-quality development in accordance with the strategymade by the 19th CPC National Congress. China’s stable development depends on whethersome internal challenges can be well addressed, especially those prominent ones such asageing population, environmental pollution, income disparity, imbalanced regional development,weakness in innovation capacity, and etc.In China, people aged sixty and above account for approximately 18 percent of the totalpopulation and are expected to reach over 300 million by 2025, making China a typical ageingsociety then. The accelerated ageing pace will bring profound impacts to all aspects of theeconomy and society. There will be less participants in the labor force with lower savings rate,which is detrimental to long-term economic development. In addition, China’s elderly care, healthcare and social security systems will also face critical challenges.Meanwhile, environmental pollution remains a serious problem in China. Every year, theeconomic losses caused by environmental pollution and ecological damage could be as high ashundreds of billions of yuan. The CPC Central Committee led by President Xi Jinping attachesgreat importance to ecological preservation. As underscored by President Xi Jinping, “cleanwaters and green mountains are invaluable assets”. Despite the high cost of pollution control,firm actions must be taken to combine economic, legal and administrative measures to addressthis issue so as to protect the interests of the Chinese people.Income disparity is another prominent issue. Since the reform and opening-up, income gap inChina has widened across industries, sectors, classes and communities. Among that, incomegap caused by certain unfair competition was particularly acute. Though the imputed rent ofowner-occupied property in China is significantly underestimated and the calculation methods ofhousehold income needs to be further optimized, China’s Gini coefficient remains at a high level,which deserves high attention. Currently, China is facing the critical task of winning the battleagainst poverty. Even when the phased-in objective is achieved, poverty alleviation will stillremain a long-term social undertaking.Regional gap is also distinct. Marked imbalance in economic development exists between theeastern and western regions as well as between the southern and northern regions. Some oldindustrial areas and resource-dependent cities in particular are faced with the huge pressure ofunsustainable development. A more severe problem is the net population decline in someregions. If this problem is not handled well, it will adversely affect industrial transformation, evenposing threat to the sustained national economic development.In addition, insufficient innovation restricts economic development to a large extent. In recentyears, despite the attention, efforts and investment made in the development of science,technology and education, the outcomes are not quite satisfactory. There remain institutionalbarriers in such fields as science, technology and education. For example, the evaluationmechanism of scientific and technological outcome, together with corresponding governmentalresource allocation mechanism, should be further improved. Economic transformation towardhigh quality growth has been restricted by bottlenecks in the transformation and application oftechnological achievements as well as by key impediment to grasping core technologies. The above-mentioned issues need to be addressed with comprehensive deepened reform,multiple-pronged measures, integrated approaches and on-going efforts. The financial industrycan make great contributions in that process, which I believe, is also the direction and objectiveof the financial supply-side structural reform. We are convinced that under the strong leadershipof CPC Central Committee with President Xi Jinping as its core, the Chinese people will achievethe two centenary goals with great success!Last but not least, I wish the Forum a great success. 8 / 9BIS central bankers' speeches

    All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches 2  2    New Economy – New Finance  There’s a new economy emerging driven by changes in technology, demographics and the environment. This new economy requires a new finance.  A new finance to serve the digital economy.  A new finance with products that are more cost effective, better tailored, and more inclusive. A new finance to support the transition to a sustainable economy. A new finance that balances innovation with resilience. With its leadership in fintech and green finance, the UK private sector is creating the new finance, but your efforts will be more effective with the right conditions in which to innovate and the level playing fields on which to compete.  New Finance - New Bank  That’s why a new finance demands a new Bank of England.  Our strategy is to enable innovation and to empower competition, while ensuring monetary and financial stability.  Our levers are the hard and soft infrastructure that we control:   Our hard infrastructure, such as access to our balance sheet and access to our Real-Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system, the heart of the UK payments system.   And our soft infrastructure, such as our rules, regulations and standards.  In this spirit, last year at Mansion House I announced that Huw van Steenis would lead a review of the future of the UK financial system, including recommendations for how the Bank could best support innovation while continuing to promote resilience.1 I would like to thank Huw and the Bank of England team, who over the past nine months have met 300 entrepreneurs, investors, consumer groups, charities, business leaders and policymakers across the country and around the world to produce an excellent report.  Today, we published Huw’s recommendations and the Bank of England’s response.2  And tonight, I would like to focus on a few of the actions that the Bank will take to enable the new economy; to ensure the resilience of the financial system; and to support the UK’s transition to a carbon-neutral economy.                                                       1 Carney, M (June 2018) ‘New Economy, New Finance, New Bank’ speech given at Mansion House. 
    All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches 3  3   First, to enable the digital economy The very nature of commerce is changing.  Last year, one fifth of all sales in the UK were online.3  Next year, it will be one quarter.  Over the past decade, the proportion of total payments made in cash has declined from two thirds to one quarter.4 The digital economy is more inclusive, offering easier and more cost effective routes to market for firms both large and small, and greater access for consumers both near and far. This new economy is placing new demands on finance.  Consumers and businesses increasingly expect transactions to be settled in real time, checkout to become an historical anomaly, and payments across borders to be indistinguishable from those across the street.  While there have been some notable successes, the UK system has a way to go before it meets these expectations.  Thus far, most innovation has happened around payment initiation – the method used to instruct a payment – such as credit or debit card, banking app or mobile wallet.  There have also been some advances in the networks – or rails – that underpin some of these apps.  For example, the Faster Payment System (FPS) launched a decade ago has made payments quicker (within two hours) and more cost effective by encouraging direct bank-to-bank transfers.  While mobile app PayM uses FPS to facilitate direct bank-to-bank payments between individuals via text, it requires both the sender and recipient to be signed up to the third party service.  But few are.5  And FPS is not yet used for in-store or online purchases as the infrastructure required at the point of sale does not reliably exist in the UK.6  In these regards, the UK is still a long way behind countries such as Sweden, the Netherlands and India where users can make direct, free and real time bank-to-bank payments in stores and online with a text or a scan of a QR code.7 UK card payments are convenient and they are now the most popular means of payment, but they can cost between 0.5% and 2% of the total transaction value, and it can take three days for the merchant to receive their money.8                                                                                                                                                                                 2 See: https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/research/future-finance. 3 ONS: Comparing “bricks and mortar” store sales with online retail sales (August 2018). 4 UK Finance: UK Payment Markets Summary (2019). 5 See: https://paym.co.uk/how-it-works/.  6 Particularly the soft infrastructure – such as rules around use and consumer protection. 7 In Sweden, Swish launched in 2012 by the six largest Swedish banks and connects bank accounts to mobile numbers, allowing money transfer in real time and eradicating the need for a card reader. In the Netherlands, iDEAL facilitates direct bank-to-bank payment for online purchases. India uses GooglePay technology to enable direct bank transfers through its Unified Payments Interface, a central platform which connects entities for real-time payment.  8 McKinsey research for Future of Finance Report; and UK Card Association Data. 
    All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches 4  4   And all these systems in the UK – whether card or bank payment – still depend on existing core infrastructure meaning they either carry the associated costs and limitations on speed or they require the right point of sale infrastructure for their full benefits to be realised.  The scope for improving cross border payments is bigger still.  These can cost up to 10 times their domestic equivalent.9  Anti-money laundering checks that are rightly required can be cumbersome, and settlement is slow with money taking up to a week to reach the recipient.   Most fundamentally, the new payment system must end the inequity that the people with the least money pay the most for financial services. The revolution of payments may not be driven by the old bank-based systems but by a new architecture.  Major changes are on the horizon, bringing enormous advantages but also more than a few new challenges.  That’s why the Bank fully supports the Payments Strategy Review the Chancellor has launched this evening. To support private innovation and to empower competition, the Bank is levelling the playing field between old and new.  This means allowing competitors access to the same resources as incumbents while holding the same risks to the same standards.  The Bank is in the midst of an ambitious rebuild of its Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system, which processes £650 billion of payments on average every day.  Until recently, only commercial banks10 had direct access to it, and alternative payment service providers (or PSPs) had to route through participating banks. That made sense in the old financial world arranged around a series of hubs and spokes, but it is increasingly anachronistic in the new, distributed finance that is emerging.  So we are now making it easier for a broad set of firms to plug in and compete with more traditional providers.  In July 2017, we became the first G7 central bank to open up access to our payment services to a new generation of non-bank PSPs.  Since then, six have become members, processing over four million transactions over the past year.  There is now a growing pipeline of twenty firms looking to join.11  Responding to demands from innovators, the RTGS rebuild will also now provide API access to users to read and write payments data, as well as implementing a system whereby each payment will be tagged with information in a standardised format across the world.  This global messaging standard will speed up settlement both domestically and across borders. It is not a one-way street, however.  As we extend access, we will safeguard resilience by holding settlement account holders to the appropriate standards.  Along with the FCA and HMRC, who together supervise these institutions, we are committed to applying a strengthened supervisory regime for those who apply for an                                                       9 McKinsey Global Payments (2016): strong fundamentals despite uncertain times. 10 As well as Financial Market Infrastructure providers such as Visa.  11 See: Bank of England: A Blueprint for a new RTGS service for the United Kingdom (May 2017).

We can go even further.  Today, the Bank of England is announcing plans to consult on opening access to our balance sheet to new payment providers.12   Historically, only commercial banks were able to hold interest-bearing deposits, or reserves, at the Bank.13 That reflected their role at the core of the payment system.  As new payment providers and systems emerge, access to the Bank’s core infrastructure should change and it makes sense to consider whether they too can hold funds overnight on the Bank’s balance sheet.   From the Bank’s perspective, expanding access can improve the transmission of monetary policy and increase competition.  It can also support financial stability by allowing settlement in the ultimate risk free asset, and reducing reliance on major banks.  Users should benefit from the reduced costs and increased certainty that comes with banking at the central bank. From the perspectives of UK households and businesses, wider access can improve inclusion and services.  This access could empower a host of new innovation.  In wholesale markets, consortia of broker dealers are working to develop settlement systems using distributed ledger technology that could overhaul how markets operate.  These consortia, such as USC, propose to issue digital tokens that are fully backed by central bank money, allowing instant settlement.  This could also plug into ‘tokenised assets’ – conventional securities also represented on blockchain—and smart contracts.  This can drive efficiency and resilience in operational processes and reduce counterparty risks in the system, unlocking billions of pounds in capital and liquidity that can be put to more productive uses.14 The potential transformation in retail payments is even more fundamental.   Earlier this week, a cooperative of technology companies proposed a new payments infrastructure based on an international stablecoin – Libra.  Libra would be backed by reserve assets in a basket of currencies including sterling.  It could be exchanged between users on messaging platforms and with participating                                                       12 Currently, the criteria for access to our balance sheet, defined at the time of the Winters Review, are three-fold:  firms should be inherently exposed to overnight liquidity risk, they should be systemically important, and they should be regulated to the same standard as UK banks.  In practice, that means banks, CCPs and broker-dealers are eligible for access, but other firms are not.  The Bank will reach out to firms and to users of payments services to understand the needs of participants in this market and the barriers that still exist to competition and innovation. This dialogue will allow us to consult on the appropriate level of access to the Bank’s infrastructure.  For more information, see the Bank of England’s response to the Future of Finance Review available at: https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/research/future-finance.  13 In recent years we have expanded access to our balance sheet to central counterparties and broker-dealers to recognise the important role played by these firms in the provision of critical financial services to the real economy. In providing these critical functions, both broker-dealers and CCPs are exposed to liquidity risk. As the supplier of the economy’s most liquid asset, central bank money, the Bank is able to be a ‘back-stop’ provider of liquidity, and can therefore provide liquidity insurance to the financial system, promoting financial stability. 14 Oliver Wyman: Fintech 2.0 Paper: rebooting financial services (June 2015) and McKinsey: Global Payments report (2016).

As designed, Libra may substantially improve financial inclusion and dramatically lower the costs of domestic and cross border payments.15   The Bank of England approaches Libra with an open mind but not an open door.  Unlike social media for which standards and regulations are being debated well after they have been adopted by billions of users, the terms of engagement for innovations such as Libra must be adopted in advance of any launch Libra, if it achieves its ambitions, would be systemically important.  As such it would have to meet the highest standards of prudential regulation and consumer protection.  It must address issues ranging from anti-money laundering to data protection to operational resilience.  Libra must also be a pro-competitive, open platform that new users can join on equal terms.  In addition, authorities will need to consider carefully the implications of Libra for monetary and financial stability.  Our citizens deserve no less.  Leveraging our position at the heart of the international financial system and one of the world’s largest fintech hubs, the Bank of England will help lead the way on these issues at the G7, G20, the FSB, BIS and IMF. Whatever the fate of Libra, its creation underscores the imperative of transforming payments.  The Bank’s strategy to open access to a wide range of payment solutions combined with appropriate regulatory oversight of them maximises the likelihood that the payments revolution will meet the demands of the new economy and the needs of all our citizens.  Supporting more lending to SMEs through an open platform  Big data is opening up new opportunities for more competitive, platform-based finance of SMEs.  Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques are already mining fields of data generated by online activity.  This has the potential to yield enormous benefits for households and businesses by opening up new lines of credit, providing greater choice, better-targeted products and keener pricing. Putting data to work is critical to closing one of the biggest funding gaps in the country.  SMEs are the engine room of our economy, generating around 60% of all private sector employment and accounting for over half of all private business turnover.16  And yet SMEs face a £22bn funding gap.17  Almost half of all SMEs don’t plan to use external finance, citing the hassle or time associated with applying.  Of those that have approached their bank, two fifths have been rejected.18  Part of the problem is that the assets that SMEs are seeking to borrow against are increasingly intangible – the value of a brand or user base – rather than physical assets, like building or machinery.  SMEs that have not borrowed lack the historic data required for credit scoring.  And legal requirements to prevent money                                                       15 See: https://libra.org/en-US/. 16 Federation of Small Business: https://www.fsb.org.uk/media-centre/small-business-statistics.  17 NAO report ‘improving access to finance for SMEs (Nov 2013).  18 Report by British Business Bank: Small Business Finance Markets (2019).

This should not be the case in a data-rich world.  Lenders should be able to access a broader set of information on which to base credit decisions.  Already, search and social media data are supplementing traditional metrics to unlock finance for smaller enterprises whose assets are increasingly intangible.  In the UK, Iwoca has made over £900mn worth of loans based on trading data, such as sales and customer reviews, to over 25,000 small businesses over the past five years.  Even the big banks are getting in on the action.  Earlier this month, Santander announced that it was partnering with eBay to offer small business loans, based on sales, cash flow and customer review data to sellers on the eBay platform.  These initiatives are welcome but are still too small to plug the SME funding gap in the UK.  To make real inroads, SMEs must be able to identify the data relevant to their businesses, incorporate it into their individual credit files, and easily share these files with potential providers of finance through a national SME financing platform.  This would put into practice the recommendations from Professor Jason Furman’s Digital Competition Panel report on how to extract value from data and promote competition.  One of the most important recommendations in this regard is to give consumers control of their data.  This would allow consumers to move their personal information from one platform to another and avoid lock-in effects, opening the door to new services.19  To some extent, this is what Open Banking hopes to achieve.  Although to make this a success means establishing common off the-shelf API standards and operating platforms onto which developers can build. An open platform for SME lending would enable open banking and empower SMEs.  It would help avoid lock-in on existing platforms and enable providers of finance to compete for SME lending, helping to broaden the products available to companies and offer more competitive rates, making access to finance quick, easy and cost effective.20   It is not for the Bank of England to build this platform but we can help lay some of groundwork.  The messaging standards we are adopting in the new RTGS will also include tagging payments with a unique ID called a Legal Entity Identifier (LEI).21  This will be mandated for financial institutions and as a next step we are considering how to extend this to corporate payments.  That could mean that the payment data sent via CHAPS of non-financial firms could be made available for inclusion in a portable credit file.  The LEI could                                                       19 See: Furman, J ‘Unlocking digital competition’ Report of the digital competition expert panel (March 2019). 20 See: https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/research/future-finance. 21 The introduction of Legal Entity Identifiers (LEIs) will enable consistent and accurate identification of legal entities on a global basis. Their introduction was pioneered by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) following the financial crisis as a means of precisely identifying counterparty risks and exposures. The LEI is linked to a publically available database about each registered entity. LEIs are not yet widely used in payments or supply chains.  Following a consultation, the Bank is making LEIs mandatory for all payments initiated between financial entities.

The Bank will submit a formal response on how to develop an open platform for competitive SME finance to the Smart Data Review referenced by the Chancellor this evening. Strengthen resilience in the face of new risks The City of London has maintained its pre-eminence by innovating.  This was as true in the First Industrial Revolution when finance oiled the pistons of the steam engines, as it is today at the dawn of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, with the advent of cloud computing and the robosapien fund manager. Today the key competitive advantage in financial services is how firms – and supervisors—collect, store and analyse the explosion of data.  Just as the steam engine transformed manufacturing, AI, ML and cloud-based technologies are transforming services. Accordingly, the second focus of the Bank’s initial response is how new general purpose technologies, like the Cloud and AI, can be used to strengthen the resilience of the system.   Embracing these technologies could herald leaner, faster and more tailored financial services.  Banking is already the second biggest global spender on AI systems (after retail) and the sector is expected to invest a further $6 billion on AI this year.22   A quarter of major banks’ activities and almost a third of all UK payments activity are already hosted on the Cloud, and there are considerable opportunities for even more intensive usage.23  Cloud service providers offer ready-made solutions that can speed up time to market, provide superior analytics, and enable businesses to adjust quickly their business models.  If deployed at scale, cloud technology could provide low-cost, resilient computing power and easy access to AI capabilities, unlocking 30-50% unit cost savings.24   These savings can be passed onto customers and, if properly managed, improve the resilience of the overall system.  For these reasons, the Bank of England is open to greater adoption of the Cloud and usage of AI.  This means ensuring that these technologies are adopted in a safe manner, in ways that increase resilience.    Careful attention will have to be given to risks, including of those associated in the single point of failure and market concentration.  Two providers account for nearly half of revenues in cloud computing, bringing scale and efficiency, but also concerns about dependence and a single point of failure in the case of a cyber-attack.  In AI and ML, there is a reliance on data, but when there are biases in data or algorithms, or the situation isn’t captured by past experience prediction becomes difficult and judgement becomes more important.  These situations require robust governance at board level.                                                        22 IDC: Wordlwide Semiannual AI Systems Spending Guide (March 2019). 23 See: https://www.bis.org/review/r180727a.pdf and Finastra, FTI Consuting Survey 2019.  24 McKinsey & Company research for the Future of Finance review.   
    All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches 9  9   To ensure that the benefits of cloud computing are realised and the associated risks are well managed, the PRA will issue a Supervisory Statement in the autumn that sets out its supervisory approach.  The Bank, together with the FCA, will also establish a forum to discuss the results of a survey that it has conducted on AI use in finance and determine an appropriate supervisory approach.   The Bank’s management and analysis of data is critical to our effectiveness as regulators and to the City’s competitiveness.  The Bank now receives 65 billion data points each year of firm-related information.  To put that into context, reviewing it all would be the equivalent of each supervisor reading the complete works of Shakespeare twice a week, every week of the year.  For firms, while the Cloud and AI have reduced the costs of storage and analysis, producing regulatory submissions is still labour intensive and costs the industry an estimated £2-4.5 billion per year.25  This is the new frontier of regulatory efficiency and effectiveness.  The PRA is exploring how new technologies could streamline firms’ compliance and regulatory processes while improving our ability to analyse relevant data.   We see opportunities at each of the three stages of the supervisory process: 1. Rule-setting and reporting;  2. Analysis and monitoring; and 3. Setting and communicating a supervisory strategy to mitigate identified risks. Consider rule setting and reporting compliance.  At over 638,000 words, the PRA Rule Book is longer than War and Peace.  It is also somewhat less interesting and infinitely more complex.  We are currently using advanced analytics to understand that complexity and to simplify our rules in order to make compliance with them easier and less expensive. An even bigger opportunity lies in the Bank re-thinking completely how we collect, store and analyse data.  We cannot do this in isolation but will engage with industry to explore a range of options. Our vision is that the Bank could be able to “pull the data on demand” from firms rather than “sit back and wait to receive data” from them.  With the right API, Web Portal or Platform, manual interventions could become obsolete, making the process quicker, more efficient and hugely less expensive.  It would free up resources for firms to focus on delivering a better service to their customers, and it could discipline us to take only the data that we need to use and have the capacity to review.                                                         25 “McKinsey & Company research for the Future of Finance review”.  
    All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches 10  10   Equally important, utilising ML and AI to analyse the data could free up supervisors’ time to add the greatest value where humans excel over machines: judgement.  That is why the Bank is today launching a Review to explore a transformation of the hosting and use of regulatory data over the next decade.  This review will be conducted in close consultation with banks, insurers and financial market infrastructures.  We are also embarking on proofs of concepts, in collaboration with firms and the tech sector, to test how we can automatically extract regulatory firm data.  And we will identify and implement near term improvements in how we use data, including greater use of AI and ML to interpret the information.  Support the transition to a carbon-neutral economy  My final example of how the new finance can serve the new economy is the most fundamental. Indeed, it is existential. This year, the threats from climate change spurred demonstrations across the country and prompted Parliament to declare a ‘climate emergency’.  In response, last week, the Prime Minister announced legislation that would make the UK the first G7 country to commit to net zero emissions by 2050.  The changes required to achieve this are enormous.  Carbon emissions will have to decline by 45% from 2010 levels over the next decade.26  This will require a massive reallocation of capital creating unprecedented risks and opportunities.  As one example, it is estimated that annual investment in sustainable infrastructure could top £20 billion for decades. 27 Firms that align their business models to the transition to a carbon-neutral world will be rewarded handsomely; those that fail to adapt will cease to exist.  The new finance can smooth the transition to a carbon-neutral economy.  The City has been leading the way.  UK underwriters, led by the former Lord Mayor Sir Roger Gifford, helped create the green bond market which has doubled every year since 2012 to reach $500bn outstanding.28  UK-based banks, like Barclays and HSBC, insurers, like Aviva, and asset managers, like Generation, helped develop climate financial disclosure standards and were amongst the TCFD’s first adopters.  Now a range of firms at the heart of the City are beginning to reshape the management of climate-related risks and opportunities.  But we must go much further if the UK is to reach net zero carbon emissions.  Disclosure must become comprehensive.  Risk management must be transformed.  Sustainable investing must go mainstream.                                                       26 See: https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/790626/2018-provisional-emissions-statistics-report.pdf.  27 See: https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/703816/green-finance-taskforce-accelerating-green-finance-report.pdf. 28 Source: Climate Bonds Initiative Data. 
    All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches 11  11   Fortunately, the momentum is growing. Four years ago in the run-up to the Paris Climate accord, the Bank called for improved financial disclosure of climate-related financial risks in order to break the Tragedy of the Horizon.29  Just two years ago, the TCFD led by Michael Bloomberg made its final recommendations to the G20 Leaders Summit in Hamburg.30  Since then there has been a step change in climate reporting by the private sector. On the demand side, current supporters of the TCFD control balance sheets totalling $120 trillion and include the world’s top banks, asset managers, pension funds, insurers, credit rating agencies, accounting firms and shareholder advisory services.31  On the supply side, the TCFD report published last week showed that four fifths of the 1100 G20 companies surveyed were now disclosing climate-related financial risks and three quarters of users of the information had seen a marked improvement in the quality of disclosures.32 In the future, to achieve a carbon-neutral economy, disclosure must become mandatory.  Before it does, we need to get it right.  Over the next few years, the current iterative process of disclosure, reaction and adjustment will be critical to ensure that these market standards are as comparable, efficient and decision-useful as possible.   Disclosure is just the start.  Analysis needs to go beyond the static to the strategic.  The nature of climate risks mean that the biggest challenge is in assessing the resilience of firms’ strategies to transition risks. Transition risks result from the huge adjustments required to create a low-carbon economy.  Changes in policies, technologies and physical risks will prompt a reassessment of the value of a large range of assets as new costs and opportunities become apparent.  The longer meaningful adjustment is delayed, the more transition risks will rise.   Where credible policy frameworks are in place (and when firms disclose the risks accordingly), the market will allocate capital to deliver the necessary innovation and growth and pull forward the adjustment to a carbon-neutral future.  The Bank of England is overhauling its supervisory approach in anticipation of these major shifts.   Earlier this year the PRA published a Supervisory Statement that sets out our expectations for banks and insurers regarding their governance, risk management, scenario analysis and disclosure of climate-related                                                       29 Carney, M.

The FPC and the PRC are announcing that they will stress test the UK financial system for resilience against different climate pathways.  The design of this stress test will start in the autumn, and the tests will be completed in 2021.  The stress test will reveal the UK financial system’s ability to withstand the financial risks from climate change that arise from the increased frequency of weather events and from the transition to a carbon-neutral emission economy.  The test will motivate firms to address data gaps and to develop cutting-edge risk management consistent with a range of possible climate pathways: ranging from early and orderly to late and disruptive. This test will be the first of its kind to integrate climate scenarios with macroeconomic and financial models. The Bank will develop the approach in consultation with industry, including insurers, and other informed stakeholders including experts from the Network for Greening the Financial System and the PRA’s Climate Financial Risk Forum. With this new supervisory approach, the Bank will help ensure that the financial system is resilient to the risks and can take full advantage of the enormous opportunities in a carbon-neutral economy. The path to a carbon-neutral economy will affect every institution in this country—very much including the Bank of England.  We need to do more than just cutting out cups and bringing up bees.35 We must lead by example. From next year, the Bank will become the first central bank to adopt the TCFD recommendations across our entire operations.  And to improve our strategic resilience, the Bank will reduce the Bank’s carbon footprint by almost two thirds by 2030, consistent with a transition to a 1.5 degree world.36  Conclusion  The new finance has the potential to unlock stronger, more sustainable and more inclusive growth.  By taking the measures I outlined this evening, the Bank can enable the new economy; empower greater competition and ensure the resilience of the financial system.                                                       33 Available at: https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/prudential-regulation/supervisory-statement/2019/ss319.pdf?la=en&hash=7BA9824BAC5FB313F42C00889D4E3A6104881C44.   34 See: https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/2019/march/first-meeting-of-the-pra-and-fca-joint-climate-financial-risk-forum.  35 The Bank has cut its use of cups and food boxes by over 80% since 2016, that’s over 2 million fewer items of single use plastic each year.  We are also working on promoting natural biodiversity at our sites. We have a beehive in place at our Debden print works, and we are due to introduce our next hive at Threadneedle Street this year.  36 The Bank commits to reduce its emissions from gas and fuel, electricity and business travel by 63% by 2030. We plan for all the electricity and gas we purchase and use across our buildings to come from 100% renewable sources, such as wind, solar and biogas by April 2020.Our target is (1) informed by Science Based Targets, (2) in line with the aims of the Paris Agreement and (3) consistent with limiting global warming to 1.5°C [above pre-industrial levels]. The target has been fully validated by the Carbon Trust (CT).

Small and medium sized businesses should have access to new credit to grow.  Banks themselves should be more productive and supervision more efficient.  And the financial system should seize the opportunities and manage the risks associated with the UK’s transition to a carbon-neutral economy.  The success of the new finance will be assured if we remember some old lessons, namely: - That similar activities should be regulated consistently;   - That markets don’t always clear, liquidity is state contingent and the riskiness of an asset depends in part on the entity that holds it; - That individual responsibility is essential for collective welfare;  - That ending Too big to Fail is a moral and a financial imperative; and - That when it comes to financial stability, success is an orphan.  Memories fade, complacency sets in and the virtues of prudence are soon forgotten.   Most fundamentally, we must always remember that finance is not an end in itself.  It is a servant of the real economy, of the households and entrepreneurs that make this country great.   They are demanding a more sustainable, inclusive and prosperous future.  The ultimate test of the New Finance is whether it helps deliver just that.   
Eddie Yue: Hong Kong - the Asian hub for sustainable financeOpening remarks by Mr Eddie Yue, Deputy Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority,at the Euromoney’s 2nd Asia Sustainable & Responsible Capital Markets Forum, Hong Kong, 25June 2019.*   *   *Distinguished guests, Ladies and Gentlemen,1. I would like to thank Euromoney for inviting me to speak at this 2nd Asia Sustainable andResponsible Capital Markets Forum today.  It is indeed an honour to have this opportunity to talkabout this important topic, especially here in Hong Kong, where we place a high priority on anddirect much effort towards developing our sustainable finance platform.2. I understand that we will have a very comprehensive programme today, covering not just thepotential of sustainable finance in the region and the role of different stakeholders, but alsoexciting developments of green bonds and other innovative products.  Allow me then to focus myremarks on the bigger picture and on three areas in particular: (i) First, the potential for sustainable finance in Asia; (ii) Second, Hong Kong’s role as Asia’s hub for sustainable finance; and (iii) Third, some of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)’s latest initiatives on this topic.Potential for sustainable finance in Asia3. The effects of climate change are already visible around the world: more severe weatherevents, infrastructure damage, problems with food security, water resources, and even humanhealth.  No country or community is immune.  According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF),in the past four decades, we have witnessed the warmest years on record and the number ofnatural disasters has more than doubled.4. The global community is already taking concrete actions to tackle climate change and therehave been many admirable efforts.  For example, countries around the world are putting in placepolicies to implement the 2015 Paris Agreement.  In the world of finance, central banks, financialregulators and institutions are increasingly adopting agendas to promote green finance.  The IMFhas highlighted in its latest Global Policy Agenda the importance for international collaboration tocombat climate risk and what the IMF will do to support this effort.5. Here in Asia, huge investments in green and climate-resilient infrastructure are needed acrossthe region.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) estimates that US$1.7 trillion per year will beneeded through 2030 for the region to maintain growth momentum, eradicate poverty andrespond to climate change.6. There is also growing awareness in the region of the need to ensure not just the level but alsothe quality of growth.  This has forced policymakers to make a fundamental shift towards a moresustainable economic model which is less resource and carbon-intensive.7. This requires a massive reallocation of capital and substantive involvement of the capitalmarkets.  Hence, the momentum of sustainable finance is building up strongly and will continueeven more so in the coming years.  For the global financial community, sustainable finance is nolonger nice-to-have, but a necessary direction.  We must therefore ensure that we are preparedto embrace it.Hong Kong’s role as the Asian hub for sustainable finance 1 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
8. What role can Hong Kong play in this global effort?  Most importantly, it is critical that we useour strengths as an international financial centre to contribute to this endeavour.9. Hong Kong is already one of the major green finance hubs globally.  Last year, green bondsarranged and issued in Hong Kong reached US$11 billion, up from US$3 billion in 2017.  Theissuers included multilateral development banks, such as the ADB and the European InvestmentBank, as well as private sector participants from Hong Kong, Mainland China and abroad.10. In fact, a green finance ecosystem is already taking shape in Hong Kong.  Many internationalgreen advisory firms and external reviewers have a presence in Hong Kong.  They combine on-the-ground knowledge of the Asian market with robust international standards. We also have alocal Green Finance Certification Scheme developed by the Hong Kong Quality AssuranceAgency (HKQAA) with reference to a number of widely recognised international and Mainlandstandards.11. The Hong Kong Government is a strong supporter of green finance, and puts in placesupportive policies to promote green finance, such as the Green Bond Grant Scheme, whichsubsidises the cost of obtaining certification under the HKQAA’s Green Finance CertificationScheme, as well as the Pilot Bond Grant Scheme, which covers issuance costs of eligible first-time bond issuers in Hong Kong, including green bonds.  Furthermore, under the OutlineDevelopment Plan for the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, Hong Kong is alsothe designated green finance centre in the area.12. We also have a strong presence of banks and other financial intermediaries with experiencedspecialists in green finance, and international institutional investors based in Hong Kong whohave made strong commitments to green investments.13. So there is already strong momentum and an ecosystem here.  But there is more that wecan do.HKMA’s latest initiatives14. This brings me to my third point on HKMA’s initiatives – the HKMA’s commitment to fullysupport green finance to combat climate change.  As a bank regulator, one of the largest assetowners globally, and key promoter of market development, we can make use of our various rolesand take meaningful actions to support and nurture green finance.  We have already been takinga number of concrete actions to drive awareness and development of the market: for example,we co-hosted major conferences last year with the International Capital Market Association,which determines the Green Bond Principles and Social Bond Principles, and with the People’sBank of China to raise awareness and knowledge of green finance in Hong Kong.  To grow themarket on green bonds, the HKMA has also been actively reaching out to potential green bondissuers.  Building on these efforts, and to further promote green and sustainable finance in HongKong, the HKMA announced three further sets of measures in May:15. First, a three-phased approach to promote Green and Sustainable Banking. (i) In the first phase, we will develop a common framework to assess the existing baseline ofindividual banks in order to establish how “green” they are. (ii) The second phase is to engage and consult the industry and other relevant stakeholders todevelop our supervisory expectation or requirements, particularly on how to incorporateEnvironmental, Social and Governance (ESG) risk elements in banks’ corporate mandate, riskmanagement practice and financial disclosure. The key objective of this phase is to set tangibledeliverables for Hong Kong’s banking industry to become greener and more sustainable. (iii) The third phase will focus on implementation, monitoring and evaluation. During the process, 2 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
we will take into account the unique circumstances, risk profiles, nature and scale of business ofeach bank.16. The second measure is adoption of the responsible investment principle by the ExchangeFund. (i) Apart from it being a good cause, responsible investment makes good investment sense.ESG risk has become too significant to be ignored in the investment decision making process.Assets or companies with high ESG risk might see diminishing value over time or even riskbecoming “stranded” assets. By integrating ESG factors into investment, we aim to seek betterrisk-adjusted return in the long run, which is consistent with the objectives of the Exchange Fund. (ii) While we have been weaving ESG factors into our investment process over the past fewyears, the HKMA will now adopt a guiding principle that priority will be given to Green and ESGinvestments if the long term return is comparable to other investments on a risk-adjusted basis. (iii) Going forward, we will be more proactive in embracing ESG in Exchange Fund investment inboth public markets and private assets, for example, by: (a) growing the green bond portfolio bydirect investment or investing in green bond funds; (b) on the public equities side, we aim tocreate ESG mandates by adopting ESG equities index as benchmark for passive portfolio, or byengaging active equities managers who use an ESG filter in equity selection; and (c) in theprivate markets, we will include green accreditation as a predominant factor for investment in realestate, and will also conduct ESG evaluation as a mandatory part of due diligence of all privatemarkets investments, especially in infrastructure area.17. The third measure is to strengthen our capacity building efforts by launching the Centre forGreen Finance (CGF) under the HKMA Infrastructure Financing Facilitation Office (IFFO). (i) The purpose of the Centre is to ensure that our financial institutions are equipped with theknowledge, skills, tools and other resources in green finance, particularly with the launch of thegreen and sustainable banking initiative. The CGF will serve as a one-stop shop in capacitybuilding for the financial industry, especially banks, in the coming months. We are already indiscussions with international organisations such as the International Finance Corporation onhow to leverage their expertise on this.18. Apart from these three initiatives, the HKMA helped to issue Hong Kong Government’sinaugural US$1 billion, 5-year green bond under the Government Green Bond Programme earlierin May. (i) We have seen strong demand for this issuance, attracting orders exceeding US$4 billion,allowing the green bond to be priced at a tight spread against the US Treasury at issuance. Theissuance has helped to set an important new benchmark for potential green bond issuers inHong Kong and the region. (ii) The deal has attracted interests from a diverse group of conventional and green investors.Orders were received from over 100 global institutional investors, and 50% of the Green Bondwas distributed to Asia, 27% to Europe and 23% to the United States. By investor type, 29% wasdistributed to banks, 30% to fund managers, private banks and insurance companies, and 41%to sovereign wealth funds, central banks and supranationals. Based on some rough calculationsby our Joint Global Coordinators, about half of the investors participating in our deal could beloosely defined as “green investors”.19. By going through the issuance process ourselves, along with the help of external parties, wehave hopefully showcased to potential green bond issuers, both locally and overseas, that HongKong is a convenient platform for issuing green bonds, for three reasons: 3 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
 (i) Hong Kong has a strong presence of finance and legal professionals, who can advise on allaspects of the bond offering and assist in arranging, managing, co-ordinating and marketing thegreen bond certification and issuance; (ii) Hong Kong combines the best market practice from internationally renowned greenreviewers and local agencies. For example, we obtained a Second Party Opinion from VigeoEiris for the Green Bond Framework and the inaugural transaction under the Framework hasalso received the “Green Finance Certificate” (Pre-issuance) from the HKQAA; and (iii) Hong Kong is home to leading international institutional investors, including many of theinvestors who have made strong commitments to green investments.20. During the roadshow for the green bond, we were joined by our Environment Bureaucolleagues to reach out to overseas investors in major cities such as London, New York, Paris,and Frankfurt, in order to demonstrate to the international community the HKSAR Government’scoordinated commitment to green finance and our broader objective to address climate changerisks.  We believe the exercise has gone a long way in asserting Hong Kong’s branding as thepremier regional green finance hub to the leading institutional investors around the world.21.To join like-minded peers globally in promoting best practices in green and sustainablefinance, we have signed up to or are in the process of joining several international charters ororganisations, such as the United Nations-supported Principles for Responsible Investment(UNPRI), Focusing Capital on the Long Term (FCLT), the Financial Stability Board (FSB)’s TaskForce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), and the Central Banks and SupervisorsNetwork for Greening the Financial System (NGFS).22. The HKMA is not alone in driving green and sustainable finance in Hong Kong.  For example,the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) announced its Strategic Framework for GreenFinance in September last year and published guidance on enhanced disclosures for green orESG funds earlier in April.  The Hong Kong Stock Exchange also launched a consultation in Mayon enhancing ESG reporting and disclosure.  With these ongoing efforts, we hope to bringsustainable finance in Hong Kong to the next stage.Concluding remarks23. Finally, I would like to emphasise that this is just the beginning of a very long journey.  Whiledevelopments in sustainable finance have been encouraging, we are still at the initial phase ofdevelopment and a lot more still needs to be done.  Today’s forum is a most welcomeopportunity to help prepare for the future.  I look forward to working closely together with all of youin our common effort to develop the sustainable finance market.24. Thank you. 4 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
Non-Bank Finance: opportunities and risksSpeech by the Deputy Governor of the Bank of Italy Luigi Federico SignoriniNaples, 18 June 2019Euromed Workshop“Non-Bank Finance and Financial Intermediation”

Access to financial resources is essential for growth. The financial system channels resources through intermediaries and markets, allocating them within the economic system. The mix of banks, other intermediaries and market-based finance varies across countries and over time, depending on history, institutions, and stage of financial development, but certain common trends have emerged in the last decade. Since the global financial crisis, the regulation of banks has been redesigned to address the vulnerabilities that led to accumulation of excessive risks. The reforms resulted from a reassessment of the role of banks in the post-crisis world, justified by the adverse systemic effects of their distress. As banks’ role has somewhat shrunk, non-bank financial intermediaries have taken on an increasing role in the global financial system.1 At the same time, advances in technology have fuelled the emergence of technology-enabled financial innovation (“FinTech”), which is one of the areas where non-bank finance is expanding most rapidly. A diversified financial system benefits savers and borrowers because it offers multiple ways of channelling financial resources, including to support long-term investment, and diversifying risks. The non-bank financial sector competes with banks, thereby stimulating efficiency and innovation. It can reduce the vulnerability of the real economy to financial shocks because funding sources for the real economy can be diversified.At the same time, the expansion of non-bank finance poses new challenges to regulators, as the activities of non-bank financial intermediaries can have their own significant implications for systemic risk. In the case of the asset management industry, on which I shall mostly focus today, identifying, monitoring and preventing the build-up of risks from non-bank 1 Based on BIS data, in 2007 banks in the euro area accounted for 70 per cent of financing to the private sector,54 per cent in the United Kingdom, and 34 per cent in the United States; in June 2018 their share declined by 12 and 2 percentage points in the euro area and the United Kingdom, respectively, while it has remained unchanged in the United States, where it was lower. FSB data on total assets of financial corporations in 21 jurisdictions and the euro area show that the share of banks declined by almost 5 percentage points since 2007.
4finance appears to require fresh thinking, more data, deeper analysis, and, quite possibly, new policy instruments. FinTech opens financial intermediation and credit markets to new players and, at the same time, is bound to change the way traditional intermediaries operate. It can expand access to financial services, increase competition and efficiency, by lower transaction costs; but it may also mean that old risks take new forms and that new (or substantially increased) risks, such as cyber risk, arise. Detecting such evolving and emerging risks requires understanding and closely monitoring FinTech activities, especially with a view to closing regulatory loopholes: among them deviations from the key principle that the same risk should be subject, in effect, to the same regulatory and supervisory treatment, regardless of the nature of the agent and its technical means of operation.There is substantial scope for international cooperation and coordination in these fields because developments in asset management and FinTech tend to cross borders quite easily. There is also a lot to be done in cooperation between different authorities. International coordinating bodies, such as the Financial Stability Board, are the natural fora for the authorities to elaborate common strategies.I shall first review the benefits of non-bank finance; then I shall highlight the potential sources of systemic risk, particularly those from asset managers, and make some considerations about how they are being / should be approached by the supervisory authorities. I shall also touch upon the potential risks from Fintech. As testified by the agenda for these two days of discussion, these issues are relevant for countries facing very different economic and financial conditions.The benefits of a diversified financial system The role of non-bank finance in the global economy has been increasing, and is now at least as significant as that of banks. Data collected by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) show that at the end of 2017 the assets of non-bank financial intermediaries reached 180 trillion dollars, about 48 percent of the global financial sector’s total assets; the assets of banks accounted for 39 percent of the total.22 FSB, Global Monitoring Report on Non-Bank Financial Intermediation 2018, 4 February 2019. The data refer to 21 countries and the euro area, and include insurance companies, pension funds and other financial intermediaries.
45The non-bank financial sector includes a variety of intermediaries. Some of them perform credit intermediation functions, either issuing loans directly or facilitating credit provision through financial market instruments; others support equity financing in various ways. In certain business models, entities that intermediate market instruments engage in liquidity transformation, maturity transformation, and the creation of leverage just as banks do. These activities used to be referred to as “shadow banking” because they are usually subject to less stringent prudential regulation and supervision than banks. Last year the FSB decided to avoid using this definition, recognising that non-bank credit intermediation can be beneficial, provided its risks are appropriately monitored and regulated.Activities that could generate bank-like risks are identified by the FSB under a narrow definition of non-bank financial intermediation, and include various entities, such as collective investment vehicles with features that make them susceptible to runs; finance companies engaging in loan provision that is dependent on short-term funding; market intermediaries that depend on short-term funding or secured funding of client assets (mostly broker-dealers); trust companies and structured finance vehicles.3 The assets of these entities represent 14 percent of total global financial assets in the jurisdictions monitored by the FSB, and have grown by almost 60 percent since 2007.4 The importance of non-bank finance varies across jurisdictions, and depends, among other things, on the degree of financial development. Non-bank finance tends to be quantitatively more significant in countries with well-developed markets. In the United States, the assets of non-bank financial institutions account for 62 per cent of the total assets of financial corporations, exceeding those of banks. In the larger European economies the sector is less developed: the corresponding figure is about 35 per cent in France and Germany and below 30 percent in Italy and Spain. While in most emerging markets banks are still the largest sector of the financial system, in some of them non-bank finance has grown very rapidly.Banks traditionally perform a key role in the financial system because of the monetary nature of their main funding source (deposits), and their 3 The FSB definition based on economic function is described in its report on “Strengthening Oversight and Regulation of Shadow Banking: Policy Framework for Strengthening Oversight and Regulation of Shadow Banking Entities”, 29 August 2013. 4 Data refer to 29 jurisdictions.
ability to bridge the gap between lenders and borrowers through the creation and accumulation of knowledge on the behaviour of the former and the creditworthiness of the latter. One of the advantages of banks with respect to other institutions is that they bundle different information-based products, exploiting synergies between payment services, liquidity provision and monitoring. There is an enormous literature to explain why banks exist, which I cannot even start to summarise here. At the same time banks may be less efficient than other intermediaries in providing certain standardised services in isolation. While bundling can provide synergies and economies of scope, unbundling can allow specialised intermediaries to operate at a lower cost and to exploit other advantages of specialisation. FinTech is widely expected to enhance the ability of non-banks to challenge banks on this ground.In other cases non-bank intermediaries profit from the ability to tailor their services to specific needs. In developing economies, to make one example, finance companies may be important, as they can cater to households and micro and small enterprises, improving financial inclusion; small loans are often bundled with the provision of liquidity services to clients that are too small to be profitable for banks.5 To make another, quite different, example, bank loans might not be suitable – or available – to support businesses engaging in research and development as banks require collateral to mitigate risks; venture capital firms and private equity funds could be more effective in this specific domain.6 From the point of view of savers, collective investment vehicles, such as mutual funds and pension funds, provide investors with a wide range of investment options, with different risk-return profiles. Institutional investors such as insurance companies, and pension funds can focus on long-term “patient” finance more than banks, due to the nature of their liabilities. Non-bank financial intermediaries also facilitate the deepening of financial markets. They channel savings towards market instruments, 5 See A. N. Berger and G. Udell, “A more complete conceptual framework for SME finance”, Journal of Banking and Finance Volume 30 (11), 2006, on the role of different lending technologies to address business opacity. 6 A survey of the role and distinct features of venture capital can be found in B.

7supporting issuers and providing liquidity and diversification to savers. Asset managers, and other entities that specialise in market finance, increase the efficiency and liquidity of capital markets, and investors’ opportunities for diversification. A vibrant non-bank financial sector increases competition in the financial system, reducing transaction costs and improving the quality of services. Incumbents, including banks, can see some of their advantages eroded as new players enter the market, exploiting economies of scale in specific business segments. Examples of this are institutions offering payment services or asset managers specialised in catering to the needs of investors with certain risk-return profiles. New digital technologies are increasing the options for alternative providers of financial services, because they can be used to unbundle some of the services offered by banks. Technology-driven financial innovation can be particularly beneficial for developing countries because it makes services more affordable and accessible; but it can increase access to finance in advanced economies too. Thanks to technology there are greater opportunities to acquire and process information, reducing some of the traditional advantages of banks. Banks of course can adopt these technologies themselves, but non-bank entities sometimes are in apposition to exploit them more effectively, because they do not have to upgrade legacy systems and internal procedures; they can effectively “leapfrog” them. Some see these developments as an existential threat to banks. The banks’ future is linked to their ability to exploit the unique features of their core mix of activities to the full; but they need to evolve and adapt.7 The benefits of physical proximity to clients afforded by the banks’ traditional large, costly networks of branches, are becoming less important as savers and borrowers can access financial service providers remotely. Banks are in fact reducing the number of branches to cut costs. But in order to reap the benefits of technology they will need to go beyond cost-cutting and adopt farsighted and possibly quite far-reaching innovations in their approach to business and customers. Banks that are both creative and efficient in the use 7 See R.G. Rajan, “Why banks have a future: Toward a new theory of commercial banking”, Journal of Applied Corporate Finance 9 (2), 1996; and A.W.A. Boot, “Banking at the crossroads: How to deal with marketability and complexity?”, Review of Development Finance 1, 2011.
8of technology, while preserving their traditional business advantages, are likely in my view retain a key role.What is the optimal mix between banks, non-bank financial institutions and markets? The academic debate used to contrast intermediary-based financial systems with market-based ones, often looking for evidence that one or the other was superior. A more nuanced view is now usually held.8 The optimal structure of the financial system is often found to change with economic development9. Whatever the nuances, I suppose most would nowadays agree that a balanced financial system with multiple, lively channels of financial intermediation is likely to provide both healthier competition and better resilience to shocks. Research has shown that when banks are distressed frictions in credit provision have negative real effects;10 in countries that have well-developed markets, firms can borrow by issuing securities when banks tighten credit supply conditions.11 On the other hand, banks can smooth temporary shocks affecting borrowers and somewhat shield them from financial market shocks by supporting financial flows, as suggested by the evidence from studies using microeconomic data on bank-firm relationships.12 Cross-country evidence on various stages of the recent financial crisis has 8 R. Levine, “Bank-Based or Market-Based Financial Systems: Which is Better?,” Journal of Financial Intermediation 11 (4), 2002; for a review of the finance and growth literature see R.

Levine, “The evolving importance of banks and securities markets,” World Bank Economic Review, 27(3). – As economies evolve, the benefit of further developing traditional financial institutions tends to decline whilst that of markets increases. Moreover, an IMF study shows that the relationship between financial development and growth is bell-shaped: financial development increases growth, but the effect weakens at higher levels of financial development, and eventually becomes negative. Considering sub-indices of an overall financial development index, this bell-shaped relationship is due only to the “depth” components of the index; “access” exhibits a positive linear relationship with growth, while “efficiency” has no robust association with long-term growth (IMF Staff Discussion Note “Rethinking Financial Deepening: Stability and Growth in Emerging Markets,” 15/08, May 2015).. 10 G.

89thus provided evidence for both views, which should therefore be seen as complementary rather than mutually exclusive.Another key message from the research literature is that an overly rapid expansion of finance can lead to financial instability, especially if it is accompanied – as is often the case – by equally excessive leverage and risk-taking. This reconciles the long-standing view that financial development is beneficial for growth with post-crisis analyses suggesting that too much finance can be detrimental.13 Stable growth is promoted by the ability of financial systems to provide financial services and perform their allocation function effectively, while keeping risks in check. This rather general and even obvious observation leads me to the second part of my speech, where I shall endeavour to make its implications a bit more specific, and thus also possibly a bit less uncontroversial.The risks from non-bank finance: the case of asset managementBenefits do not come without costs. There would be little development without a financial system, yet the economic functions that the financial system performs, such as credit provision and maturity / liquidity transformation, imply the creation of risks. These risks not only affect the stability of individual financial intermediaries: they can also have an impact on the financial system as a whole, with adverse effects on the real economy. A long experience with banking informs the regulation and supervision of the risks generated by banks, imperfect as it will always remain; but as the financial system becomes more complex, risks take different forms and extend to different types of intermediaries; the authorities will need to adapt and evolve in response. I shall focus here on the risks from one industry that I find particularly challenging from a supervisory point of view: asset management. This industry manages a very significant volume of assets, and influences the allocation of financial resources globally. It includes a variety of asset management models, and families of funds investing in products with different risk profiles. Some types of funds, like hedge funds, feature leveraged financial risk, which may 13 See J.L. Arcand, E. Berkes, and U. Panizza, “Too Much Finance?,” Journal of Economic Growth, 2015; S. G. Cecchetti, and E. Kharroubi, “Why Does Financial Sector Growth Crowd Out Real Economic Growth?,” BIS Working Paper, No. 490, 2015; S. H. Law and N. Singh, “Does too much finance harm economic growth?,” Journal of Banking and Finance 41, 2014.
10be further compounded by securities lending activities and the creation of synthetic leverage via derivatives.14 Others, particularly open-ended funds, perform (among other things) liquidity and maturity transformation, because they invest in financial instruments that often have a longer maturity than the funds’ shares. Asset managers mostly provide investment services as fiduciary agents for their clients; hence, the risks associated with the investments are borne by the owners of the funds’ shares, not by the fund managers. The risks that are traditionally of concern for the authorities mainly involve agency problems and information asymmetries between the investors and the asset managers (misconduct, lack of transparency in the behaviour of the asset managers or investors not fully understanding financial risks). Accordingly, the purpose of market regulation and the mandates of market authorities mainly concern conduct and transparency.When markets function smoothly, liquidity and maturity mismatches can be managed because the asset managers deal with a large number of investors with diversified liquidity needs. In certain situations, however, the collective behaviour of investors can generate significant externalities, leading to excessive procyclicality, amplifying the cyclical properties of asset prices and credit flows. It is well understood that in financial markets procyclicality can be determined by behavioural phenomena (euphoria and panics), such as herding.15 In the case of the asset management industry, procyclicality can be exacerbated by the pricing rules for fund shares, the incentive structure for fund managers and the benchmarking of fund performance.1614 Some asset managers provide their clients with indemnification, a type of insurance associated with securities lending. When the borrower of a security defaults on the loan and the collateral received is insufficient to cover the repurchase price of the lent securities, the shortfall is borne by the indemnification provider.15 See for example D.S. Scharfstein and J.C. Stein, 1990. “Herd Behavior and Investment.” American Economic Review 80; T. Lux, “Herd Behaviour, Bubbles and Crashes,” Economic Journal 105, No. 431, 1995; and Shiller, R. J., “Conversation, Information and Herd Behavior,” American Economic Review, Vol. 85 (2), 1995. For a review of the literature D. Hirshleifer and S. H. Teoh, “Herd Behaviour and Cascading in Capital Markets: a Review and Synthesis,” European Financial Management 9 (1), 2003.16 Inflexible net asset value (NAV) fund share pricing, that does not factor in the investment losses of trading illiquid assets, can generate a first-mover advantage for an open-end mutual fund and exacerbate the incentive for investors to run. Benchmarking and relative performance mechanisms, which are common tools to address the principal-agent problem in the investment management industry, may lead to a focus on short-term returns and thus reduce the investment horizon of the manager. Incentive structures may increase risk-taking and short-termism by asset managers. 
1011In times of stress the behaviour of investors can depress the prices of assets by pushing them well below their fundamental values. If investors fear that the liquidation value of their shares will decline as other investors liquidate their positions, they will have an incentive to redeem their shares. When they invest through funds, their joint behaviour could produce massive redemptions, putting pressure on funds. Funds will be forced to liquidate, with adverse effects on asset prices and market liquidity.17 Trades by large investors are more likely to turn into fire sales, magnifying the impact of temporary shocks on market prices and leading to severe liquidity stress and extreme volatility. As asset prices decline, other intermediaries holding those assets (including banks) face losses, collateral becomes less valuable and borrowers are affected, with negative consequences for the real economy.Interconnectedness is another source of externalities from a systemic risk perspective. Externalities related to interconnectedness can arise because intermediaries are linked through bilateral balance sheet exposures or on the derivatives market, or because they are jointly exposed to common shocks. Ownership links between intermediaries might require the provision of liquidity support in case of fund distress, either because of existing guarantees or committed credit lines, but also with a view to avoiding reputational damage. For very large financial institutions the web of interconnectedness is highly complex and opaque.18 Interconnectedness mitigates the impact of small shocks but can amplify large ones. In asset management, a commonality of exposures can arise because the assets in which funds can invest are a finite set. Each fund holds a diversified portfolio but the portfolios of rationally-managed funds of a certain kind are not likely to be particularly diverse, as most if not all funds will use basically the same insights from finance theory and therefore follow similar investment strategies. If everybody in a market owns more or less the same portfolio and reacts in more or less the same way to disturbances, shocks can be amplified and spread more easily across markets and asset classes. 17 Leveraged funds that rely on borrowing or derivatives may also be exposed to run-like behaviour if they cannot roll-over funding or positions when they are under stress. 18 J. Abad, M. D’Errico, N. Killeen, V. Luz, T. Peltonen, R. Portes, T. Urbano, “Mapping the interconnectedness between EU banks and shadow banking entities,” ESRB Working Paper Series  No 40, March 2017.
12The real significance of these risk is the subject of an ongoing debate. There are many reasons to believe that they are not negligible, at the very least. Not only is the asset management industry very large, but it is also increasingly concentrated. According to one source the market share of the top twenty firms is more than 40 percent.19 In the United States, the top 10 managers owned about 5 per cent of the United States stock market in 1980; in 2016 they owned about 23 per cent.20 The commonality of exposures is substantial; evidence suggests that during stress episodes bonds with concentrated mutual fund ownership tend to experience larger price drops.21 Some other structural changes may further exacerbate the potential for externalities. First, the diffusion of funds with passive investment strategies, for example ETFs, could create distortions in the pricing of individual securities by applying mechanical investment rules, and thereby amplify trading patterns.22 Second, automated trading may lead to less diversified behaviour in response to shocks, increasing the procyclicality of prices and liquidity.23Applications of new technologies, such as high-frequency trading, algorithmic trading and robo-advisors, may improve market efficiency and reduce intermediation costs during normal times, but have the potential for making the behaviour of intermediaries (or, indeed, even individual investors in the case of robo-advice) more responsive to market news. More analytical work surely needs to be done, but available studies suggest that mutual fund investments affect price dynamics in less liquid markets, certain share pricing 19 Data from “The world’s largest 500 asset managers”, Thinking Ahead Institute and Pensions & Investments joint research, based on 2017 figures for assets under management.20 I. Ben-David, F. Franzoni, R. Moussawi, and J. Sedunov, “The Granular Nature of Large Institutional Investors”, NBER Working Paper No. 22247, May 2016.21 See Manconi A., Massa M. and Yasuda A., “The role of institutional investors in propagating the crisis of 2007–2008”, Journal of Financial Economics 104. More recently, I. Ben-David, F. Franzoni, R. Moussawi and J. Sedunov, show that ownership by large institutions predicts higher volatility and greater noise in stock prices (“The Granular Nature of Large Institutional Investors”, CEPR Discussion Paper 13427, 2019). The International Monetary Fund Global Financial Stability Report, April 2015, reviews available evidence.22 See V. Sushko and G.Turner, “The implications of passive investing for securities markets,”  BIS Quarterly Review, March 2018, for a discussion of the issue. The evidence is ambiguous, see for example “The Shift from Active to Passive Investing: Potential Risks to Financial Stability?,” K. Anadu, M. Kruttli, P. McCabe, E. Osambela, and C.H. Shin, Federal Reserve Board, FEDS WP 2018-060; also I. Ben-David, F. Franzoni, and R. Moussawi, “Do ETFs Increase Volatility?”,  NBER Working Paper No. 20071, April 2014.23 IOSCO Research Report on Financial Technologies (Fintech), February 2017.
1213rules create first-mover advantage incentives, and the behaviour of portfolio managers displays significant herding tendencies.24Countries with a small asset management industry and less developed financial markets are not immune to these risks. On the contrary, and maybe rather paradoxically, they could be even more subject to volatile capital flows as global players adjust their investment strategies, leading to surges in bond yields and sharp depreciation of the domestic currency.25 There is evidence that international investors engage in more herding and momentum trading in emerging markets than in developed countries.26 Large firms borrow from international markets, often in foreign currency, which exposes them to the refinancing and exchange rate risks from the reversal of capital flows.Policy approaches to risks in non-bank financeThe externalities I have just described require a macroprudential approach. One of the lessons from the global financial crisis is that aggregate – i.e. systemic – risk can build up largely unchecked if authorities lack a broad perspective, and that the consequences of a crisis originating in financial markets may extend far beyond the fortunes of individual investors. The authorities in charge of financial regulation and supervision need to be able to monitor the potential sources of risks, to anticipate the build-up of systemic risk, and to deploy instruments to prevent it from materialising when possible; or, failing that, to mitigate their fallout. As I already mentioned, traditionally the focus of the regulation and supervision of the asset management industry has been the conduct of these intermediaries, and its purpose has been to ensure integrity and transparency, 24 See the International Monetary Fund, Global Financial Stability Report, April 2015. While most of the earlier literature focused on equity trading, the different features of other types of assets can result in different herd behavior. Analyses of herding in the U.S. corporate bonds among bond fund managers find that corporate bond herding is substantially higher than the stock market herding (e.g. Cai, F., Han, S. and Li, D., “Institutional Herding in the Corporate Bond Market,” Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System International Finance Discussion Papers No. 1071, December 2012).25 E S. Prasad, K. Rogoff, S. Wei, and M. A. Kose, “Effects of Financial Globalization on Developing Countries: Some Empirical Evidence,” IMF Occasional paper 220, 2003.26 A number of studies focus on emerging markets, investigating the behavior of mutual funds, for a survey see G. Gelos, “International Mutual Funds, Capital Flow Volatility, and Contagion – A Survey,”  IMF WP/11/92, 2011; the evidence in the literature suggests that funds tend to avoid opaque markets and assets, and this behavior becomes more pronounced during volatile times, with portfolio rebalancing mechanisms contributing to explain contagion patterns.

14given the limited relevance of the risk of managers’ insolvency. More recently, the focus on liquidity management has increased, but still mainly from the perspective of individual funds. These issues should continue to receive all the attention they deserve; but there seems to be a case that they need to be accompanied by a macroprudential approach. The authorities should assess how shocks originating in one part of the financial system can be transmitted to the others components, both directly and through their impact on markets. This is a very challenging objective, requiring data and complex analytical frameworks. One tool that could be useful is macroprudential stress testing. The work on stress testing tools for non-banks is still in its infancy.27An additional challenge is the identification and design of appropriate policy instruments. Tools aimed at protecting the stability of individual asset managers are available in many jurisdictions, for example liquidity requirements, rules restricting the amount of illiquid assets that can be held by open-end funds, redemption suspension and redemption gates. Their effectiveness for macroprudential purposes should be evaluated. Standards aimed at preventing the excessive accumulation of risk ex ante, such as minimum maturity-matching rules, are more effective in this sense than those meant to manage a fund’s crisis ex-post, such as gates, which may even have counterproductive signalling effects. The former set of standards should in my view include mandatory rules to ensure that funds investing in illiquid assets beyond a certain share of their portfolios may not operate as open-ended funds.Finally, the adoption of a macroprudential approach to the risks arising from asset management could require the adjustment of the institutional framework for financial supervision. In many countries, the authorities in charge of the regulation and supervision of these entities have no financial-stability mandate. Should their mandate be expanded to include financial stability? Given the cross-sectoral nature of financial stability risks, if several authorities are in charge of financial stability, how can the exchange of information and the coordination of policies be ensured? Incentives to redesign institutions are usually stronger in the wake of a crisis but tend 27 See the work by Y. Baranova, J. Coen, P. Lowe, J. Noss and L.Silvestri, “Simulating stress across the financial system: the resilience of corporate bond markets and the role of investment funds,” the Bank of England Financial Stability Paper No. 42 (July 2017),. Also S. Calimani, G. Hałaj, S. Zochowski, “Simulating fire-sales in a banking and shadow banking system,” ESRB Working Paper Series 46, 2017.
1415to wane during good times. Consideration of these issues should not be procrastinated until the next crisis.Central banks play a key role in macroprudential policy because their mandate includes in one way or another a macroeconomic and financial stability perspective. They also have access to timely information as a result of monetary policy implementation. Finally, they have the unique ability to provide liquidity through banks. This proved crucial during the global financial crisis.28 In designing the institutional framework for macroprudential policy, authorities should consider if the scope of the lender-of-last resort function should be expanded to include institutions other than banks. Under what circumstances, and how, should central bank intervene if the liquidity stress of a non-bank financial intermediary appears likely to cause contagion and disrupt markets?International cooperation is necessary to avoid regulatory arbitrage. The FSB is the forum that is best suited to coordinating the any efforts to analyse financial stability risks stemming from non-bank finance, and to devise common approaches and regulatory standards. With its annual monitoring exercise the FSB provides the policymaking community with a framework for analysing risks, and a very useful source of data on non-bank finance; the coverage in terms of jurisdictions and the degree of harmonisation of the data have much improved in recent years. The FSB issued policy recommendations in 2017 to address structural vulnerabilities in asset management activities, mandating the IOSCO, the relevant standard setter body, to operationalise them. This work has led to the development of policy tools for asset managers in the area of liquidity risk management, and of leverage measures for investment funds to facilitate monitoring for financial stability purposes and to enable comparisons across funds at the global level.29 The FSB has also made some progress in studying the impact of large investors’ strategies on market liquidity. In a recent pilot simulation exercise, the FSB employed a modelling approach to assess the consequences of market stresses and examined the resilience of liquidity across a range of corporate bond markets.30 28 The central bank provided liquidity to mutual funds in the United States, to selected broker-dealers and central clearing counterparties in the UK. Similar arrangements were made by the Bank of Japan. 29 IOSCO, “Recommendations for Liquidity Risk Management for Collective Investment Schemes,” February 2018.30 The approach was an adaptation of a model of the Bank of England.
16This line of action deserves to be brought further forward. There have been from time to time episodes of hesitations and reversal, such abandoning the idea of identifying globally systemic non-bank intermediaries (in my view an ill-advised move), some timidity in prescribing ex-ante liquidity rules, and now perhaps a sense that all that needed to be done has been done. The risks, however, are too new, too complex and too little understood for any complacency. Continued evaluation of the effectiveness of the available tools in a macro perspective, and increased coverage, as well as improved analytics, of systemic resilience testing, should in my view be actively pursued.FinTech, regulation and systemic risk FinTech, broadly defined, includes very diverse technology-enabled financial innovations encompassing the provision of a whole range of financial services, such as payments, insurance, lending and crowdfunding, trading and investment services.31 FinTech is changing the landscape in which intermediaries and policymakers are operating, as new business models are developed by exclusively Fintech firms or by incumbents responding to competition. FinTech activities can generate institution-specific risks, financial and operational, and systemic risks. The financial risks are not in principle different from those borne by other intermediaries, and depend on the business model adopted by the service provider. For example, some platforms providing FinTech-enabled credit directly match borrowers with lenders, acting as agents. If investments and loans are matched by maturity, and investors are unable to liquidate their investments before the loan matures, the platform bears no liquidity risk. Only a small proportion of platforms currently engage in leverage, as they use their own balance-sheet to fund loans.32 These platforms are exposed to credit risk, like others that offer return guarantees, and could be subject to liquidity risk if investors can liquidate on short notice their positions.31 The IOSCO maps eight groups of innovations, considering also those in planning, data and analytics, and security. A mapping can be found in IOSCO, “Research Report on Financial Technologies (Fintech), 2017.32 See the FSB-CGFS “Report on Fintech credit,” May 2017.
1617Regulators and supervisors have to focus their lenses better in order to see more clearly the potential risks arising from each kind of Fintech activity and business model. There is one general principle that should inspire the way authorities tackle FinTech from a microprudential point of view: to the extent that FinTech activities involve the same risks that justify supervision of other activities, they should be regulated and supervised in much the same way. Following this principle also ensures a level-playing field between different institutions (i.e., banks and non-banks) performing the same activities. The current regulatory framework may or may not be adequate to ensure that this principle is followed; in many jurisdictions regulation of non-bank agents that engage in bank-like activities is lighter than that of banks, and many non-financial entities, large and small, appear determined to enter the financial-services field. Authorities should be prepared to evaluate on an ongoing basis the regulatory perimeter and the effectiveness of existing prudential rules. Operational risk, while not unique to FinTech activities, is especially relevant for them, irrespective of whether they are performed by separate service providers or by banks or other, supervised, traditional intermediaries. Cyber risk is not a new phenomenon, but the diffusion of FinTech activities could increase the vulnerability of the financial system due to greater use of digital technologies, which raises the number of potential entry points for cyber-attacks. Another source of operational risk is the reliance of banks and other intermediaries on services provided by third parties. FinTech activities, including those performed by traditional intermediaries, often involve outsourcing one or more functions or processes that are integrated into the value chain; these third parties could be outside the financial system, or within the financial system, but subject to lighter regulation and supervision. Reliance on third parties exposes FinTech activities to the risk of disruptions; furthermore, if these third parties manage confidential data, the legal risks may be substantial. FinTech innovations need to be carefully monitored to avoid that opportunities open up for illegal activities that could pose a threat to financial integrity.These risks have potential implications for financial stability to the extent that their materialisation can trigger distress in an entire sector, or propagate significant stress to other sectors of the financial system and the economy. Developments in FinTech could also become important from a 
18macroprudential perspective if they have the potential to amplify shocks or create new channels of contagion as a result of externalities.I already mentioned ways in which technology may enhance the amplification risk implicit in market intermediation. FinTech can also increase the risks of contagion arising from interconnectedness through several other channels. First, FinTech entities are connected with banks and other financial entities through partnerships or other joint ventures. Digital platforms in some cases intervene at some stage of the value chain of a given financial service. For example, they act as an interface between institutional investors and borrowers or provide screening services for banks. While specialisation of intermediaries in the different stages of credit intermediation may increase cost efficiency, it could also exacerbate agency problems. At this stage, reputation risk and a collapse in trust in one or more large FinTech entities might conceivably be a major source of contagion. Second, digital technologies exhibit very significant economies of scale, which may drive consolidation in the financial industry and in financial market infrastructures, increasing concentration and leading to the emergence of a few systemically important players; similarly, third-party service providers may become fewer and larger, which increases the potential for exposure to common shocks. While policies for microeconomic and financial risks from FinTech are currently defined by individual jurisdictions, there is significant scope for coordination33. Regulatory and supervisory authorities have the difficult job of protecting the safety and soundness of the financial system without curbing innovation. They may be tempted to impose unduly restrictive rules in response to the challenge they face, arising from the complexity and dynamism of technology. Or they could be tempted to lower standards to encourage innovation and attract business, leading to the exploitation of regulatory arbitrage by firms. In European jurisdictions the volume of investment in FinTech companies appears to be negatively correlated with the stringency of financial regulation.34 While the optimal point in this trade-off may be difficult to find, it needs 33 Realistically, one has to recognise that national security concerns may in certain cases dictate limits to cross-jurisdiction cooperation in this field.34 Barba Navaretti, G., G. Calzolari and A.F. Pozzolo, “FinTech and Banks. Friends or Foes?”, European Economy 2017 (2). 
1819to be found; international cooperation is key to avoiding an excessive divergence across jurisdictions.From a macro-financial perspective risks appear to be limited at this stage, but they could increase rapidly if the authorities lag too much behind the market in understanding technological and business developments. International cooperation in monitoring FinTech trends would be highly beneficial; assessing the material nature of the risks arising from FinTech is a difficult task because of the lack of data and experience.35 The FSB is monitoring developments of FinTech in its annual review of non-bank finance, and has just released a report on decentralised technologies.36  Collaboration with the industry can be very useful. In April the European Commission and European Supervisory Authorities launched a new platform, the European Forum for Innovation Facilitators (EFIF).37 Through this network, participating authorities can share experiences from their engagement with firms through innovation facilitators. The Bank of Italy will contribute its experience with its innovation hub.38Given the cross-cutting nature of FinTech, international coordination on policies is already involving many institutions and standard setting bodies, each according to its mandate.39 The FSB has identified two issues that deserve the authorities’ attention from a financial stability perspective, and should be a priority for international cooperation: managing operational risks from third party service providers, and mitigating cyber risks. Many third party service providers are outside the regulatory perimeter, and the authorities should carefully evaluate whether the existing oversight frameworks are 35 FSB, “Financial Stability Implications from FinTech, Supervisory and Regulatory Issues that Merit Authorities’ Attention,” 27 June 2017.36 FSB, “FinTech and market structure in financial services: Market developments and potential financial stability implications,” 14 February 2019.37 The European Commission has developed a FinTech Action plan, as outlined in a document released in 2018 (see “FinTech Action plan: For a more competitive and innovative European financial sector”).38 FinTech Channel, accessible through the website, is a direct interface through active start-ups and firms that would like to offer technological solutions to banks and financial intermediaries, or the latter if they are directly involved in the development of innovative solutions in the area of financial services, can contact the Bank of Italy.39 Initiatives have been launched by the Financial Stability Board (FSB), the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS), the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructure (CPMI), the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS), the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). The IMF and World Bank have developed the Bali Fintech agenda in 2018, to guide its work and the dialogue with member countries.
20appropriate. Cross-border coordination and collaboration may also involve authorities in charge of IT security, especially in the regard to cyber risk. Finally, technology may also offer significant opportunities for authorities to improve their ability to protect financial stability. Many central banks and supervisory agencies are experimenting in this area.40 At the Bank of Italy we are exploring the use of new technologies in supervisory activities: specifically, we are testing ways in which artificial intelligence can help in forecasting economic and financial variables, understanding changes in investors’ sentiment, and improving the effectiveness of anti-money-laundering activities.41Conclusions A more diversified financial system, with banks and non-bank financial institutions complementing each other, can improve resource allocation and promote growth. Effective regulation and supervision have to ensure that non-bank financial institutions reinforce the financial system, and this requires understanding and managing the attending risks. Certain types of non-bank finance could exacerbate the tendency  of the financial system to behave procyclically, and increase the degree of interconnectedness between intermediaries and markets. Authorities should look at a possible macroprudential approach, and consider adjusting the policy framework accordingly, however challenging this may seem. Although FinTech has not raised issues from a systemic risk perspective so far, the authorities need to be vigilant and constantly update their knowledge of how these activities are evolving, to harness the opportunities for innovation while keeping risks in check. 40 Some of the initiatives by early users are described in a survey-based analysis by D. Broeders and  J. Prenio, “Innovative technology in financial supervision (suptech) – the experience of early users,” Financial Stability Institute, FSI Insights on policy implementation, No 9 July 2018.41 Examples are M.

2021Coordination and cooperation among central banks and market and supervisory authorities is of the utmost importance, not only to avoid negative spillovers across jurisdictions, but also because the exchange of knowledge and best practices yields concrete benefits when navigating such a rapidly changing world.

Yi Gang: Welcome address – 11th Lujiazui ForumWelcome address by Mr Yi Gang, Governor of the People's Bank of China, at the 11th LujiazuiForum, Shanghai, 14 June 2019.*   *   *Honorable Vice Premier Liu He, Secretary Li Qiang, Mr. Zhou Xiaochuan, Ladies and Gentlemen,Vice Premier Liu He has just elaborated in his speech on the triangular framework in theeconomy made up of supply, demand and the financial system. He has underscored theimportance of following market-oriented and law-based reform approaches and drawing oninternational practice to promote the healthy development of the stock market, particularly theSTAR Market. Also he has put forward requirements on accelerating the development ofShanghai as an international financial center, which are highly instructive as to what we shoulddo in the financial field to provide support. Next, in line with the theme for this forum “Acceleratingthe International Financial Center Development and Promoting High Quality Economic Growth”, Iwant to give my opinions from the following three aspects.First, impressive progress has been achieved in the development of Shanghai as an internationalfinancial center.1. The financial market system has been undergoing improvement, featuring more of theessential factors. So far, there have been all types of major financial markets in Shanghai, suchas the stock market, the bond market, the money market, the foreign exchange market, thecommercial paper market, the futures market, the gold market and the insurance market, withtrading volumes in quite a number of varieties ranking high globally.2. The system of financial institutions has further grown so that the influence of Shanghai as afinancial center has risen significantly. In recent years, as a host of important financial institutionsor organizations have come to be based in Shanghai, such as the BRICS New DevelopmentBank, the Global Association of Central Counterparties (CCP12), the Cross-Border InterbankPayment System (CIPS), the China Insurance Investment Fund, and the National InternetFinance Association of China, the radiant effect and influence of Shanghai’s financial industryhave been enhanced remarkably. As shown by the latest two editions of the Global FinancialCentres Index (GFCI) released by Z/Yen, a British think-tank, Shanghai ranks fifth among theworld’s financial hubs.3. The progressive opening-up of the financial sector has contributed significantly to the city’sinternational competitiveness. Shanghai has become home to a large number of foreign-fundedfinancial institutions in China. With the financial sector opening up wider and wider, the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect, the Shanghai Gold Exchange international board, the Bond Connectand crude oil futures have been introduced successively; the interbank bond market, foreignexchange market and money market have been opening up with quickened pace; and pilotprograms, such as overseas RMB investment and lending funds and cross-border exchange-traded funds (ETFs), have been launched successfully. Shanghai has become one of the citiesin the world where financial products and business categories are most diversified andconcentrated.4. Financial reform and innovation have been pushed forward in an all-round way, with financialbusiness innovation increasingly gaining momentum. Shanghai has pioneered manyfundamental measures in the reform and opening-up of the financial sector. Among others, aseries of pilot financial reform measures taken in the Shanghai Pilot Free Trade Zone have beenreplicated and applied nationwide.Second, the People’s Bank of China (PBC) will implement resolutely the decisions and 1 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
arrangements of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and the StateCouncil to strongly support Shanghai accelerating the international financial center development.In January 2019, to fully implement the important instructions that General Secretary Xi Jinpinghad given during his inspection of Shanghai last November, with the approval of the StateCouncil, the PBC issued in collaboration with eight ministries the Action Plan for ShanghaiInternational Financial Center Development (2018–2020), which sets forth key tasks and theroadmap for the undertaking. Going forward, the PBC will wholly support Shanghai’s endeavor tocomplete the three major tasks entrusted by the CPC Central Committee in the new era. Thepriorities are as follows.1. We will support the establishment of an integrated RMB and foreign currency account systemin the new area of the Shanghai Pilot Free Trade Zone, and put into place a more convenientsystem for the administration of cross-border funds.2. We will continue to improve the interbank foreign exchange market and bond market, broadenthe spectrum of foreign exchange options products, expand market participants, and support thedevelopment of “Silk Road” themed bonds.3. We will support the cooperation between the Shanghai Gold Exchange (SGE) and the ChicagoMercantile Exchange (CME), and the launch of derivatives based on the Shanghai GoldBenchmark Price on the CME.4. We will support the establishment of representative offices by international financialorganizations, and the establishment of subsidiaries by foreign-funded financial institutions inShanghai.5. We will support the establishment of a cross-region platform for financial cooperation in theYangtze River Delta region, enhance the connectivity of financial infrastructure, and promote theintegration of financial businesses across the region.6. We will support the development of the “G60 Science and Technology Innovation Corridor”driven by the building of Shanghai into a science and technology innovation center, promote theapplication of Shanghai’s financial opening-up innovative policies to the Corridor, and improvefinancial services for sci-tech innovation enterprises.7. We will support the Shanghai Commercial Paper Exchange expanding in the Yangtze RiverDelta region the use of commercial papers for accounts receivables, and launching the pilotprogram of expanding the “Discount Connect” business to wider regions.8. We will support the pilot program in Shanghai lifting the foreign ownership cap in securitiesfirms and fund management companies, and expanding the business scope for foreign-fundedfinancial institutions. We pledge full support for the development of the STAR Market.9. We will further enhance the functions of the PBC Shanghai Head Office.Third, the core of Shanghai international financial center development is to make Shanghai theglobal center of RMB-denominated financial asset allocation and risk management .During the visit to Shanghai in 2018, General Secretary Xi Jinping noted that Shanghai shouldstrive to strengthen its capacity of allocating global resources in an effort to comprehensivelyenhance the influence and competitiveness of Shanghai among cities in the world. Vice PremierLiu He stressed in his speech just now that Shanghai international financial center developmentshould serve the overall picture of national strategy and national economic development, promoteBelt and Road Initiative and accelerate the economic integration in the Yangtze River Delta.Based on my working experience, I think Shanghai is bound to be an international financial centerbased on RMB-denominated assets. Therefore, efforts will be focused on developing the 2 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
following “five centers” to further accelerate the development of Shanghai into an internationalfinancial center based on RMB-denonminated asset management and financial market.1. Developing Shanghai into a center of RMB-denominated financial asset allocation. With RMB-denominated assets incorporated into MSCI Index, Bloomberg Barclay Global Aggregate Indexand other major equity and bond indexes widely used across the world, global asset managers,passive and index-oriented ones in particular, will increase allocation of RMB-denominated equityand bond assets. Up to now, over 60 central banks have increased their holding of RMBreserves, which encouraged equity and bond managers’ investment in RMB-denominatedassets. This requires Shanghai to quicken up the development of supporting measures forfinancial market in trading, service and consultation to meet the demand of RMB-denominatedasset investors globally.2. Developing Shanghai into an RMB-denominated financial asset risk management center. Withthe RMB globalization proceeding, overseas economic entities hold more and more RMBpositions and RMB exchange rate becomes increasingly market-oriented. As a result, theoverseas entities will face market, liquidity and other risks in asset allocation and fundmanagement, which produces the demand for risk management. Pricing and hedging are twomajor aspects of risk management. For the first aspect, the financial market in Shanghai shouldprovide accurate product pricing and continuous trading and quotes so that Shanghai couldbecome a major asset pricing center in the world. Meanwhile, the depth of financial market andmarket liquidity should be enhanced. For the second aspect, efforts should be made to improverisk hedging tools, promote derivative innovation and market development, actively developderivative products and orderly enhance convertibility of RMB under the capital account, andintensify the interaction between onshore and offshore financial markets.3. Building Shanghai into a Fintech center. In the future, the growth point for global finance lies inFintech, which is also the focus of competition among international financial centers. Therefore,we should attach great importance to Fintech development. With the development of scienceand technology innovation center in progress, Shanghai has bright prospects in Fintechdevelopment. The PBC actively supports Shanghai to explore for correct methods and paths forthe application of new technologies, such as artificial intelligence, big data, cloud computing,blockchain and e-commerce, in the financial field, so as to seize the commanding heights ofFintech and promote in-depth integration of finance and technology.4. Building Shanghai into a center of high-quality business environment. The development of aninternational financial center is inseparable from a sound growth environment. Shanghai shouldbecome the birthplace and proving ground of the first-class financial operation rules, financiallaws and regulations and other business environment and regulatory standards. Shanghai shouldalso be in the forefront in such aspects as regulatory sandbox tests, financial supervisioncoordination, comprehensive financial statistics and financial risk monitoring. Effective measurescan be extended nationwide.5. Building Shanghai into a financial talent center. The competition among financial centers arefundamentally the competition of talents. The number of high-end and internationally competitivefinancial talents is an important index to measure an international financial center. The PBCsupports Shanghai to improve its institutional mechanism and development environment forattracting financial talents, to attract, retain and cultivate talents, and to bring together the bestfinancial practitioners in China and the world to Shanghai, hence making Shanghai a place thatglobal financial practitioners yearn for.I believe that Shanghai will be able to build on schedule an international financial center incompatible with the economic strength of China and the international status of RMB and basedon RMB-denominated financial assets, and play a key role in promoting China’s financial reformand opening up, economic transformation and upgrading, and high-quality development. 3 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches

Yandraduth Googoolye: Renewed protectionist tendencies - someimplications for macroeconomic policy in AfricaSpeech by Mr Yandraduth Googoolye, Governor of the Bank of Mauritius, at the ContinentalSeminar of the AACB for the year 2019, Balaclava, 6 May 2019.*   *   *Deputy GovernorsMr Papa Lamine Diop, Executive Secretary of  the AACBDelegates from member central banksLadies and GentlemenMembers of the mediaGood Morning and a warm welcome to you all in Mauritius for this 2019 AACB ContinentalSeminar. This is the first time that the Bank is hosting this event. We are pleased to haveparticipation from 24 member central banks and 12 institutions. I am given to understand that wehave about 70 participants. The large turn-out demonstrates the importance of the chosentheme.The Bank of Mauritius has participated actively in AACB meetings and activities over the pastyears. Mr Diop, who is with us today, can bear testimony to this. We hosted the Governors’meetings of the AACB Eastern Africa sub-region in July 2007 and July 2008 and we also hostedthe AACB Annual Meetings in August 2013 in our capacity as Vice – Chair of the Association.Last year, as Chair of the sub-region, the Bank hosted for the third time the Governors’ meetingfor the Eastern Africa sub-region.The theme for this 2019 Continental Seminar: ‘Renewed Protectionist Tendencies: SomeImplications for Macroeconomic Policy in Africa’ is highly pertinent and topical. In its latestRegional Economic Outlook for sub-Saharan Africa, the IMF has estimated growth to pick upfrom 3 percent in 2018 to 3.5 percent in 2019.The economic recovery under way is a positive development. However, one can reasonablyargue that current and expected growth levels are somewhat inadequate to lift millions of peopleout of poverty and provide decent jobs to an estimated 20 million new entrants to labour marketseach year.The IMF has also cautioned against downside risks stemming from heightened trade tensions,slower growth in China, lower commodity prices, and tighter global financial conditions, whichcould lower growth in sub-Saharan Africa by 2 percentage points this year. As expected, theimpact would be more pronounced for commodity exporters and countries with stronger links toChina and global markets.A review of the performance of African countries with respect to the African MonetaryCooperation Program criteria in recent years indicates clearly that African countries are notbuilding adequate fiscal and external buffers to cope with a range of shocks – both internal andexternal. Our economies rely too much on mineral resources and agriculture. They also facesignificant infrastructural gaps and have fragmented markets. Regional integration is alsorelatively low. Africa is far more dependent on overseas trade than any other economic region or global player.The fact is that Africa is integrated asymmetrically in global trade.  Originating mainly from 1 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
resource-rich countries, African exports are concentrated in raw materials and agriculturalproducts. These range from crude oil, gold and diamond to cocoa and timber, fruits and nuts,copper, natural gas, cotton, iron ore, uranium, just to name a few of these. Imports are mainlydominated by capital goods.Openness to trade brings many benefits to the supply side of the economy. That is why wecannot but welcome the African Continental Free Trade Area agreement which, once completed,will establish a market of 1.2 billion people with a combined GDP of 2.5 trillion dollars. Theagreement could significantly boost intra-African trade whilst promoting foreign direct investmentand technology transfers. This can potentially raise the competitiveness of African economiesand enhance their integration into the global economy.Before the global financial crisis, trade growth has been a major engine of global growth and anenhancer of living standards worldwide. The integration of economies into global trade, notablythrough participation in global value chains, has improved incomes. It has also moved millions ofpeople out of poverty. Since the crisis, trade has generally lagged behind output growth.Some economies have borne the brunt of open trade. A number of them have been running apersistent trade deficit and have been facing intense competition. We have also witnessedscenarios of protectionism resulting in an increase in non-tariff barriers. The anti-globalisationsentiment which emerged since the crisis has been gradually cemented through what has beentermed a “trade war", leading to a broader reversal of globalisation. Some economies have evenannounced retaliatory measures.Recourse to trade protectionism has been posited to foster recovery from economic downturns. This, by creating barriers aiming at protecting the economy from the negative impacts of opentrade and improving their trade balances.Ladies and gentlemen, protectionist measures impact on the free movement of goods andservices and they obviously affect economic performances across the world. Higher tariffs havean effect on growth and inflation whilst influencing financial conditions, expectations andconfidence in the near to medium term.For us central bankers, such elements can influence the conduct of monetary policy. Highertariffs could translate into higher import prices and these could increase firms’ production costs.This could ultimately reduce households’ purchasing power. Ultimately, depending on theseverity of these impacts, they would weigh on consumption, investment and employment, whichcould negatively affect the GDP performance.The uncertainty about growth prospects is bound to postpone investment decisions. This issomething that we would never wish to see. Barriers to trade would also cause both productivityand potential output to decline. What this means is that protectionism does matter for centralbank policy. And that is why this Seminar will enable our participants to ponder on theimplications of protectionism.Before I end, allow me to quote former US President Barrack Obama… I quote: “There arelegitimate concerns and anxieties that the forces of globalisation are leaving too many peoplebehind – and we have to take those concerns seriously and address them. But the answer isn’tto turn inward and embrace protectionism. We can’t just walk away from trade”. Unquote.Ladies and gentlemen, there cannot be winners in trade wars. Protectionism is not the rightanswer to the economic challenges that some economies are witnessing.On this thought, I wish you all fruitful deliberations.I look forward to your report for consideration of Governors at the 2019 AACB Annual Meeting 2 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches

Lawrence Schembri: The merits of a floating exchange rateRemarks by Mr Lawrence Schembri, Deputy Governor of the Bank of Canada, to the EconomicsSociety of Northern Alberta (ESNA), Edmonton, Alberta, 17 June 2019.*   *   *IntroductionIt is a pleasure to be in Alberta for my speech today, given the importance of commodities,including oil, and their prices to the Albertan and Canadian economies.While it may seem that many of us think about the value of the Canadian dollar only when we areabout to travel, at the Bank of Canada, we view it as the most important price facing oureconomy because it directly affects much of what we produce, consume and trade.That’s why this is the right place to explore the critical role our flexible exchange rate plays inCanada’s economy. And the time is right as well. Canada has just entered its 50 consecutiveyear with a floating currency, the longest of any country, dating from when it was last unpeggedfrom the greenback in May 1970.This is my second speech in our public engagement campaign called “Toward 2021.” We call itthat because 2021 is the next renewal date for our five-year inflation-control agreement with theGovernment of Canada, first adopted in 1991. For the renewal, we’ve committed to a wide-ranging review of our monetary policy framework to ensure it best achieves our mandated goal ofprice stability and thereby promotes strong and sustainable output and employment growth forthe benefit of all Canadians. The framework has two components: our 2 per cent inflation targetand our flexible exchange rate.The inflation target normally gets most of the attention, so the value of our floating dollar risksbeing overlooked at a time when the performance of flexible exchange rates is coming undergreater scrutiny in international policy circles.My purpose today is to review the evidence and make the case that Canada and many otheropen economies have been well-served by a market-determined flexible exchange rate. Inparticular, Canada’s experience with inflation targeting underpinned by a floating currency is aninstructive example of the most durable monetary policy framework in the post-war period. Theflexible exchange rate has helped our economy adjust to external shocks, primarily changes incommodity prices. Although our floating currency does not completely offset the impact of all ofthese shocks, it has complemented the Bank’s inflation target to help achieve low and stableinflation and keep our economy functioning well.While we’re not going to alter the flexible exchange rate component of our monetary policyframework, it is incumbent on policy-makers to review even successful regimes regularly toensure that they are serving the best interests of Canadians. To this end, it’s worthwhile toexplore the four main benefits of our floating dollar:It allows monetary policy independence to achieve domestic price stability.It facilitates adjustment to external shocks, thereby buffering their impact on economicactivity.It contributes to policy clarity and effectiveness.It promotes financial sector development.We also examine recent criticisms of flexible exchange rates. Because exchange rates aremarket prices that trade daily, they are intrinsically volatile. This volatility increases the cost ofth1 1 / 11BIS central bankers' speeches
making international transactions and poses risks that have to be managed, especially byexporters and importers. Nonetheless, we come down squarely on the side that the benefits of aflexible exchange rate for Canada far exceed any such costs.The Canadian caseCanada exports a wide range of commodities, representing about 45 per cent of our exports(Chart 1 and Chart 2). Consequently, their prices, whether it is for oil, gold or wheat, are criticallyimportant, both to the success of Canadian exporters and to the Canadian economy morebroadly. Their prices, however, are largely determined by the global market forces of demandand supply. Most of Canada’s key commodity exports are also priced in US dollars—a point I willcome back to later.Canada’s flexible exchange rate is also determined by market forces, though the Bank of Canadaclearly has some influence on it through our policy interest rate. When we raise interest rates, orraise expectations for higher interest rates, the loonie tends to appreciate against othercurrencies—and vice versa. In this way, the dollar is an important channel for the transmission ofmonetary policy.We typically measure the value of the Canadian dollar relative to the US dollar, since the USdollar is widely used in the valuation of both commodities and other currencies. That’s becauseof its dominant place in the global economy and its widespread use as a global reserve currency.But, as important as the currency’s value is to exports, imports and the overall economy, theBank of Canada does not have a specific target for the dollar. The flexible exchange rate worksbest when it is determined by market conditions within a credible policy framework.Consequently, we haven’t intervened in currency markets on our own behalf in more than 20years.Our analysis of exchange rate fluctuations indicates that major movements in the dollar arelargely driven by the market forces theory would predict, namely movements in commodityprices and in interest rate differentials. Fortunately, deep and liquid financial markets havedeveloped to help Canadian trading firms manage at low cost the risk associated with suchvolatility.Price stability, not a fixed exchange rate, is our main monetary policy objective. Maintaining lowand stable inflation around 2 per cent provides a credible nominal anchor. Well-anchored inflationexpectations allow monetary policy and our flexible exchange rate to respond to external shocksand help shelter the Canadian economy and its workforce from excess fluctuations.To illustrate how the flexible exchange rate fits with the inflation target within our monetary policyframework, consider Figure 1. Our monetary policy framework has two pillars: the inflation targetand the flexible exchange rate.Figure 2 illustrates the framework in action. The policy interest rate is controlled by the Bank ofCanada and is primarily influenced by our outlook for economic activity and inflation. In contrast,the exchange rate is determined by global market forces, both real and financial, that encompassthe global demand and supply for Canadian goods and services as well as assets. Because ourflexible exchange rate responds to and helps absorb those external forces, it allows us to targetinflation with the policy rate.Our success, and that of similar countries that also target inflation, speaks for itself. Our inflationtarget of 2 per cent within a 1 to 3 per cent range has been jointly reviewed and renewed by theBank and the government five times since 1995.While the value of the loonie has ranged from a value in the low 60 cents US to above parity with234 2 / 11BIS central bankers' speeches
the US dollar during that quarter century, inflation has remained within the 1 to 3 per cent rangeroughly 80 to 85 per cent of the time, with an overall average of just below 1.9 per cent. Thatprice stability came despite the financial crises of the 1990s in emerging-market economies, thestrong expansion at the turn of the millennium, the global financial crisis, the Great Recessionand the subsequent slow recovery—all of which have generated large fluctuations in commodityprices.Our monetary policy framework is supported by several critical advantages we have as a nationthat enhance its credibility and effectiveness. They include sustainable fiscal policy, which theCanadian government has followed since the mid-1990s. Such a policy leaves space tostimulate the economy in the event of an economic downturn, through countercyclical fiscalmeasures, such as regional transfers. It also includes a flexible labour market and a high degreeof internal economic integration and capital mobility as well as a resilient financial system, whichI’ll circle back to later.Given this context, let’s turn to the four benefits of our flexible exchange rate.Steering our own courseThrough its history, Canada has relied on foreign trade and investment for its economicprosperity. But this economic openness leaves Canadians vulnerable to events in the rest of theworld. Like a freighter ship, which benefits from trade, Canada is exposed to the winds of globaleconomic storms. The best strategy to minimize this vulnerability is to keep our own ship in goodorder, including a monetary policy aimed at achieving price stability.How does a flexible exchange rate give us the leeway to set our own course for monetary policyand inflation? To illustrate, it’s worth going back to September 1950, when Canada firstabandoned the post-war Bretton Woods pegged exchange rate. The decision was widelycriticized—it was seen as a radical move because Canada had been one of the originalsignatories to the post-war system. The passage of time has proven it was a trail-blazing policyshift. It demonstrated the value of a flexible exchange rate, likely sparing Canadians several yearsof double-digit inflation.At the time, the US economy was growing strongly, fuelled by military spending for the KoreanWar. Because of the increased US demand, inflationary pressure was building and commodityprices were rising. In Canada, foreign exchange rate reserves were accumulating under thepegged exchange rate. Rather than continue to allow US inflationary pressure to spill over toCanada, authorities allowed the exchange rate to float—in other words, to be determined bymarket forces. The Canadian dollar rapidly appreciated, helping stem the inflationary pressure.It’s insightful to compare our experience with Mexico’s over the same period. In contrast toCanada, Mexico maintained the peg of the peso to the US dollar. We can see what happened bylooking at Chart 3a. Canada’s flexible exchange rate absorbed the inflationary spillover, and wehad much lower rates of inflation.Canada returned to a pegged rate for the period from 1962 to 1970 but left the Bretton Woodssystem for good in 1970. The circumstances were similar to those in 1950. Replace the KoreanWar with the Vietnam War, and the same story can be told for Canada and Mexico, so I won’trepeat it, except to draw your attention to Chart 3b.Similar lessons can be drawn when we compare Canada with Latin American countries from1970 to the mid-1990s. It was a relatively unstable period, both economically and politically, yetmany Latin American countries tried to maintain pegged exchange rates to the US dollar.Consequently, they experienced frequent exchange rate crises as their pegs became untenableand collapsed.5678 3 / 11BIS central bankers' speeches
With pegged rates, their monetary policy was being largely driven by US monetary policy, whichoften proved inappropriate for domestic circumstances. In contrast, Canada’s floating currencyallowed our policy to deviate from US monetary policy as needed, and this contributed to ourbetter economic performance.As mentioned, Canada adopted its current monetary policy framework with an inflation target andflexible exchange rate in 1991. Right from the outset, it was successful in lowering inflation andmaking it more stable. This experience was shared by the other early adopters of inflationtargeting, including New Zealand (1990) and Sweden (1995). With the success evident, othercountries with close ties to the United States followed suit: Brazil (1999), Chile (1999), Colombia(1999), Mexico (2001) and Peru (2002), and their adoption—along with broader reforms—alsoled to much lower and stable rates of inflation.In summary, Canada and many other countries, almost 40 in total, have been able tosuccessfully chart an independent course for monetary policy and exert domestic control overinflation because of the leeway provided by a flexible exchange rate.And yet the events leading up to the global financial crisis and its aftermath have led someobservers to question the value of the flexible exchange rate in insulating the domestic economyagainst external financial forces and providing sufficient monetary independence. According tothese observers, domestic financial conditions were largely determined by global forces,irrespective of the exchange rate regime, thereby rendering domestic monetary policy ineffective.Consequently, to increase monetary policy control, they recommend using capital controls,particularly in emerging-market economies. Imposing capital controls, however, would distortincentives and likely hinder financial sector development, which is necessary for the effectivetransmission of domestic monetary policy.The theoretical backdrop for this thinking is known as the impossible trinity, or Mundell’strilemma. Simply put, it means that a country that wants monetary policy independence and freecapital movement cannot also have a fixed exchange rate. It can have only two of those threethings. In other words, a flexible exchange rate is necessary for achieving monetaryindependence and influence over domestic monetary conditions.Rey (2013) has recently argued that the trilemma is no longer appropriate because a globalfinancial cycle drives capital flows, and these flows primarily determine domestic financialconditions, not domestic monetary policy. Therefore, policy-makers face only a dilemma(between free capital movement and independent monetary policy), and countries would needcapital controls to conduct independent monetary policy.However, Shambaugh (2004) and Obstfeld, Ostry and Qureshi (2019) show that exchange rateregimes do matter, even for emerging-market economies, when it comes to the transmission ofglobal financial shocks. Both studies find that flexible exchange rates provide greater monetaryindependence and are consistent with the trilemma.More fundamentally, in a world of open capital markets, the Mundell framework would imply that,while the impact on interest rates from monetary policy actions may be more muted, more of thetransmission of monetary policy will take place through the exchange rate. Simply put, flexibleexchange rates still preserve some degree of monetary policy independence.In summary, for commodity exporters like Canada, the need to chart a course for domesticmonetary policy independent of that in the United States typically arises when there are largeswings in commodity prices. Because the United States is a net commodity importer, suchmovements have a large differential impact on the two countries, necessitating a differentmonetary policy, made possible by a flexible exchange rate, to maintain price stability.Facilitating adjustment91011 4 / 11BIS central bankers' speeches
A flexible exchange rate helps attain price stability not only by allowing domestic monetary policyto focus on this goal but also by facilitating the domestic economy’s adjustment to externalshocks. Whether that shock is a global trade war or a recession in a key trading partner,commodity prices are typically hit first. They are the bellwether for global economic conditionsbecause they are actively traded in global markets where new information is rapidly processedand embedded in their prices.Chart 4 shows how commodity prices respond to global forces. For example, the entry of Chinainto the World Trade Organization and into the global economy sparked a run-up in the demandfor commodities and their prices from 2002 to 2007, while the opposite occurred during the GreatRecession of 2008–09. In both cases, the exchange rate moved largely in tandem with the indexof commodity prices.But how does our flexible exchange rate actually smooth economic adjustment to a commodityprice shock? Let’s analyze a recent example in more depth.During the oil price shock of 2014–15, the price of West Texas Intermediate declined by about 67per cent, from US$103 per barrel in the second quarter of 2014 to US$34 in the first quarter of2016. Over the same period, the Canadian dollar depreciated by about 20 per cent from 92 centsUS to 73 cents US.But what if we had attempted to hold the Canadian dollar steady, even as our key exportcommodity was dropping in value? It wouldn’t have been easy. The obvious way to limit the fall ofthe dollar would have been for the Bank to raise interest rates. We estimate that propping up theloonie—avoiding that 20 per cent depreciation—would have required us to increase the policyrate to 6.75 per cent in 2015 and by an additional 25 basis points in early 2016. You will recallthat in 2015 we actually cut our policy rate twice, by 25 basis points each time, from 1.0 to 0.5per cent.Those hypothetical rate increases to hold the dollar fixed would have had tremendous adverseeffects on the real economy. Instead of stimulating growth with our rate cuts, our rate increaseswould have lowered the level of gross domestic product (GDP) by $60 billion by early 2016—3.1per cent below what was actually achieved.In addition, total hours worked would have been 4.7 per cent lower in early 2016. That translatesinto about 900,000 fewer jobs—increasing the unemployment rate by up to 4 percentage pointsin 2016. In addition, nominal wages would have been 2.5 per cent lower. Finally, inflation wouldhave been 0.8 percentage points lower in 2016.But how did the 20 per cent depreciation of the dollar facilitate economic adjustment? Becausethe dollar declined less than the price of oil, the relative price of other goods and services rosecompared with oil. This relative price change provided a strong signal to firms to allocate peopleand capital away from the oil sector and toward other sectors of the economy. The depreciationalso made foreign goods and services more expensive, causing Canadian firms and householdsto switch their spending away from foreign goods and services toward those that aredomestically produced. Therefore, the flexible exchange rate doesn’t absorb the commodity priceshock as much as it helps the economy adjust more easily to the shock by smoothing theadjustment in relative prices.This relatively smooth adjustment is in stark contrast to the counterfactual exercise where therelative price adjustment occurred from a sharp fall in output, a pronounced rise inunemployment and lower wages and prices.In Alberta, you’ve seen both sides of this adjustment. When oil prices rose between 2002 and2008, the Canadian dollar soared alongside to reach parity with the US dollar. Ontario’smanufacturing sector lost competitiveness as its goods became more expensive overseas, and121314 5 / 11BIS central bankers' speeches
investment and workers flowed into the energy sector in Alberta and Saskatchewan.Of course, the flow reversed in 2014–15 as oil prices fell and the dollar depreciated. Alberta’seconomy ebbed while other regions expanded, and the Canadian economy was forced toadjust.Recently, some economists have argued that this adjustment benefit of a flexible exchange rateis less than advertised, in part because the US dollar has become the dominant currency inpricing many goods that are traded between countries. Consequently, exchange rate movementsmay not affect the relative price of imports and exports (also known as the terms of trade). This,in turn, would reduce the role of exchange rate movements in facilitating adjustment. Forexample, because commodity exports are typically priced in US dollars, an exchange ratedepreciation would not have a large impact on their US-dollar price and thus not lead to moreexport sales.However, the evidence for Canada does not support this argument. Even though more than 80per cent of our imports and more than 90 per cent of our exports are priced in US dollars,exchange rate movements have played a critical role in helping the Canadian economy adjust tolarge commodity price movements.Recent work by Gopinath (2017), for example, maintains that the prevalence of US-dollar pricingimplies that export prices in US dollars do not fall when a country’s currency depreciates, so thetraditional stimulative effect on exports does not occur. But her evidence is based on exports ofnon-commodities. Such differentiated goods normally carry profit margins that can be used toabsorb exchange rate movements. Consequently, her argument is less relevant for Canada andother major commodity exporters because their exporters will see their profits rise with adepreciation and will tend to expand production and exports. Moreover, US-dollar pricing does notnecessarily entail fixed US-dollar prices in all cases; large and persistent exchange ratedepreciations may encourage exporters to reduce their US-dollar prices to expand sales.Clarifying and enhancing rolesBefore the adoption of our current inflation-targeting framework, the goals of monetary policywere unclear. Market participants often perceived that the Bank of Canada placed some weighton stabilizing the exchange rate as an objective for monetary policy, clouding its role anddiminishing its ability to respond to external shocks.However, the primary goal of monetary policy became much clearer once inflation targeting wasadopted, especially as the 2 per cent target gained credibility. With monetary policy now moreclearly and credibly focused on price stability, the role of the exchange rate also became sharper—specifically responding to external shocks, and, in particular, commodity price movements.The most compelling evidence of this clarification of roles comes from recent researchconducted at the Bank. This research finds that, before 1991, the Bank’s policy rate responded tomovements in both the exchange rate and the US Federal Reserve funds rate in addition toeconomic conditions. Since 1992, however, the reaction of the policy rate to the exchange rateessentially disappeared. Simply, inflation targeting allowed the Bank to focus its monetary policyon price stability.This finding is corroborated by evidence that suggests that the exchange rate became moresensitive to commodity price movements after inflation targeting was adopted. In Chart 4 andChart 6, the correlation between the exchange rate and country-specific commodity priceindexes increased in Canada, in Australia and in Chile, for example, after inflation targeting wasintroduced.15161718192021 6 / 11BIS central bankers' speeches
Chart 7 illustrates the success of our framework. When inflation targeting was adopted in 1991,inflation became low and stable. At the same time, the flexible exchange rate helped facilitateadjustment to commodity price movements and other global shocks.Hence, monetary policy became more effective with the adoption of inflation targeting becausethe roles of monetary policy and the exchange rate became clearer and more credible.Promoting financial developmentBut even with independent monetary policy and a flexible exchange rate buffering the worst of theeconomic storms, sustaining strong economic growth in Canada requires a well-developedfinancial sector. Over our history, our financial markets and institutions have developed tosupport the free flow of capital and trade. A strong macrofinancial policy framework and ourflexible exchange rate have contributed importantly to this financial deepening. Moreover, thisfinancial deepening has, in turn, enhanced the transmission of monetary policy and improved thefunctioning of the flexible exchange rate.Our financial system has evolved to provide the safe and efficient intermediation of foreign capitalflows. In addition, the stability of the Canadian financial system and the credibility of Canadianeconomic and political institutions has allowed domestic firms and governments to issue debtabroad in Canadian dollars.With the adoption of a flexible exchange rate in 1950 and again in 1970, financial markets inCanada came into being not only to trade currencies, but also to help manage the riskassociated with the floating currency. These markets remained relatively thin in the 1970s and1980s, and the Bank of Canada had to intervene on an ongoing basis to provide liquidity andreduce volatility. However, by the 1990s, this intervention ended as the foreign exchange marketand forward FX and FX swap and interest rate swap markets all became much deeper and moreliquid. These markets allow Canadian firms to manage exchange rate risk and other risksassociated with international transactions at relatively low cost.Canada’s experience indicates that having a market-determined exchange rate, especially withan inflation target—in conjunction with a robust financial regulatory and supervisory frameworkand sustainable fiscal policy—fosters financial development. In other words, markets becomemore complete. The intermediation of foreign capital flows becomes safer and more efficient anda country’s ability to issue debt in its own currency increases, thereby reducing the likelihood ofcurrency mismatches on its balance sheet.The lesson is not unique to Canada. There is much evidence of such financial deepening ascountries adopted monetary policy frameworks that target inflation. Recent Bank research findsthat adopting a monetary policy framework consisting of an inflation target and a more flexibleexchange rate has led to an increase of about 10 to 20 per cent in measures of financialdevelopment. This finding is illustrated in Chart 8.Some observers have expressed concerns about the impact of a flexible exchange rate onfinancial stability, especially in emerging-market economies. They argue these countries shouldmore actively manage their exchange rates or impose capital controls because of theirunderdeveloped financial sectors, their lack of credibility in monetary and fiscal policy and theirwidespread use of the US dollar in debt issuance and trade. Consequently, they are exposed tobalance sheet currency mismatches and broader currency risk and are thus vulnerable to wideswings in their exchange rates. In these circumstances, exchange rates should be managedjudiciously to limit extreme volatility in thin markets. Active use of exchange rate intervention orcapital controls, however, risks reinforcing this second-best argument for such marketintervention by distorting market incentives and inhibiting the development of financial marketsand institutions that are best suited to mitigate these risks. Clearly, the best solution would be to222324 7 / 11BIS central bankers' speeches
work toward addressing these shortcomings as Canada and other similar countries have done.Concluding remarksLet me conclude. Canada’s long-standing commitment to a flexible exchange rate has served uswell. It has contributed importantly to low and stable inflation and strong and sustainable outputand employment growth. It has done this by supporting and enhancing the effectiveness ofindependent monetary policy and by helping the economy adjust to external shocks, primarilysignificant fluctuations in commodity prices.As you know, we are conducting a formal review of our monetary policy framework leading up tothe 2021 renewal of our inflation-control agreement with the federal government. As part of thisreview, we are engaging with academics and other central banks as well as a wide range ofprivate sector stakeholders and interested Canadians.While the inflation target gets most of the attention, our flexible exchange rate is a criticalcomponent of the framework and is necessary for its success. We have operated with a largelymarket-determined flexible exchange rate for 61 of the past 69 years—by far the longest of anycountry.At the same time, we know that the ingredients that have contributed to the success of Canada’ssystem are not in place everywhere. Emerging-market economies may need more time todevelop well-functioning financial markets and institutions and to achieve sufficient policycredibility to realize the benefits of a floating exchange rate.But Canada’s experience is not unique. Many other countries have learned from our experienceand have realized many of the same benefits I have described today by adopting a frameworkanchored on a flexible exchange rate and an inflation target. Just as the gold standard was onceaccepted as orthodoxy, this monetary policy framework has proven to be the most durablemonetary policy standard in the post-war period. None of the 40 or so countries that havecredibly adopted it has subsequently abandoned it. It has truly withstood the test of time.AcknowledgementsI would like to thank Minnie Cui, Hélène Desgagnés, Edouard Djeutem, Jacob Dolinar, Wei Dong,Geoffrey Dunbar, Natasha Laponce, Amy Li, Eric Santor and Jing Yang for their help in preparingthis speech.ReferencesAmano, R.

He also finds this combination has proven to bea very durable framework overall because no country has yet to abandon it under duress.The Bank of Canada has undertaken extensive work to model the Canadian dollar, including Amano and VanNorden (1995); Issa, Lafrance and Murray (2008); and Djeutem and Dunbar (2018). All find an important role forcommodity prices in the determination of the Canadian exchange rate.Our inflation target is flexible. While price stability is the primary goal, the path for the policy rate and the horizonfor returning inflation to target are chosen to limit undue volatility in output and employment as well as anexcessive buildup in financial vulnerabilities. For more information, see Bank of Canada (2016).The exchange rate is, by definition, the relative price of the Canadian dollar compared with another currency,most often the US dollar. Therefore, global forces that influence the value of the US dollar would also affect theexchange rate.This figure is obtained using monthly data on annual consumer price index inflation for all items. Data are fromStatistics Canada.The joint inflation-control agreement between the Bank of Canada and the federal government commits bothparties to the inflation target and provides political legitimacy. The federal fiscal consolidation, which began inearnest in the aftermath of the Mexican peso crisis of December 1994, when the Canadian dollar was alsoseverely affected, enhanced the credibility of the inflation target.These advantages strengthen the traditional argument (Mundell 1961) for Canada being an optimal currencyarea. See Carney (2013) for a broader discussion of these advantages, especially those related to the highdegree of interprovincial trade and the strength of the financial system. In practice, the optimal currency areashould be the nation state (Laidler 1999) because its citizens should decide its monetary policy goal andframework.See Powell (2005) for further information about the circumstances leading to these changes in exchange rateregimes in Canada. The Canadian experience had important implications not only for the International MonetaryFund and the Bretton Woods system, but also for macroeconomic theory and policy in open economies (Bordo,Gomes and Schembri 2010).This argument that a flexible exchange rate is less effective in insulating the domestic economy from externalfinancial shocks rather than real ones makes the case for developing and consistently implementing global123456789 10 / 11BIS central bankers' speeches
minimum standards for financial regulation and supervision. This process is being led by the G20 andcoordinated by the Financial Stability Board. See Schembri (2016) for further details.In addition, Cerutti, Claessens and Rose (2019) uncover little evidence of a global financial cycle that drivescapital flows.Poloz (2014) offers useful supporting evidence. Also see Murray (2000) who compares terms of trademovements in Canada and the United States in response to commodity price changes.This counterfactual exercise was conducted using the Bank’s ToTEM model. See Murchison and Rennison(2006), Dorich et al. (2013), and Bank of Canada (2017) for a description of ToTEM.The results from this counterfactual exercise are illustrative and are likely larger than what would have been thecase if Canada had had a pegged exchange rate with the US dollar at the time of the oil price decline becauseexpectations about the conduct of monetary policy would have been different.The actual monetary and exchange rate response to the oil price shock provides an example of the “divinecoincidence” (Blanchard and Galí 2007). By attempting to maintain stable inflation, monetary policy helpedstabilize output and employment.See Patterson (2016) for more details on the adjustment of the Canadian economy to the 2014–15 oil priceshock.This dominant currency argument applies primarily to exports because the domestic price of imports would beaffected by exchange rate movements and the volume of imports would adjust.Devereux, Dong and Tomlin (2017) find that, by value, 88 per cent of Canadian imports were invoiced in USdollars over the period from September 2002 to June 2008. Gopinath, Itskhoki and Rigobon (2010) find 96 percent of Canada’s exports to the United States over the 1994–2005 period were priced in US dollars.In other words, the Bank of Canada’s reaction function to various shocks was not well understood.The delineation of roles between monetary policy and the exchange rate corresponds to the concept of policyassignment of Mundell (1961).See Champagne and Sekkel (2018) for more details.In both Canada and Australia, the correlation coefficients between the exchange rate and the commodity priceindex increased significantly after inflation targeting was put in place: from –0.73 to 0.84 in Canada, from 0.51 to0.84 in Australia and from 0.35 to 0.49 in Chile. All of these correlation changes are statistically significant at the1 per cent level. See Cui (forthcoming) for further details. Note part of the increased correlation in the Canadiancase reflects the increasing importance of oil exports over the sample. See Issa, Lafrance and Murray (2008) formore details.Canadian government policy now restricts such interventions to the most exceptional circumstances.Dodge (2007) explains that maintaining a fixed exchange rate may require controls on both the financial and realsides of the economy. Thus, a flexible exchange rate would preclude the need for such intervention.See Dunbar and Li (forthcoming) for more details. They find that the benefits in terms of financial developmentare largest for early adopters of inflation targeting—for example, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Thesample was of 30 countries that adopted inflation targeting between 1980 and 2016.Canada is perhaps the best example of the outcomes predicted by Milton Friedman (1953) in his well-knownarticle, “The Case for Flexible Exchange Rates.”Dodge (2007) cogently argues that many countries should strive to achieve a well-functioning flexible exchangerate because it is a key component of a market-based liberalized trade and financial order that will promoteglobal economic growth and prosperity.1011121314151617181920212223242526 11 / 11BIS central bankers' speeches

     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/default.aspx 2  2   Introduction It is an honour to participate in such a distinguished panel on such a special occasion. Before I begin, I should emphasise that the usual caveat of the past providing no guide to future performance applies particularly to my remarks today.  My reflections are on history alone.  I am speaking in the MPC’s blackout period, so my comments have no bearing whatsoever on the decision to be announced by the MPC on Thursday.   There are no messages – coded or clarion – in what follows … about policy.   But there is one message that my presence here today is meant to convey.  I want to pay homage to President Draghi’s extraordinary leadership of the ECB, the ESRB, the FSB and, by example, of the G7 and G20.  The crisis years here have been extraordinarily challenging but these challenges have been met because of his leadership, innovation and determination. The theme for this year’s conference is “20 years of European Economic and Monetary Union”.  I will focus my remarks today on how monetary policy has evolved over that period, drawing on the experiences of the ECB and Bank of England. Economic performance The global financial crisis divides the past twenty years.   In the decade prior to the crisis, in both the euro area and the UK, inflation was low, stable and predictable.  Inflation targets were achieved without causing undesirable volatility in output and employment, the so-called “divine coincidence”.1  Both regions experienced continuous expansions in activity.  It is not entirely surprising that “end of history” declarations of the Great Moderation were increasingly commonplace.  But such nominal stability masked growing financial imbalances and increasing strains in competitiveness.   The financial crisis would expose how a healthy focus on price stability had become a dangerous distraction.  Central banks had won the war against inflation only to lose the peace. When the music stopped, the consequences for the real economy were dire.  In both the euro area and UK, output fell by around 6% and unemployment rates rose initially by 2½ percentage points.  It took 7 years for GDP per capita to recover to pre-crisis levels.   In response, the financial system and the institutional architecture have been fundamentally reformed.  The capital requirements of large global banks are ten times higher than the pre-crisis standard.  Liquid assets –                                                       1 See Blanchard, O., and J.

We are ending too big to fail and transforming the resilience of financial market infrastructure.  Macroprudential is no longer the policy that dares not speak its name. To safeguard these hard-won reforms, Europe now has a Single Supervisory Mechanism and European Systemic Risk Board.  The Bank of England now houses the Prudential Regulation Committee and the Financial Policy Committee.  The independence of these committees and their accountability to the people they serve through their respective parliaments are essential bulwarks against the inevitable recidivism that follows a financial crisis.  The longer we go without disruption the more important it is to remember, remember that when it comes to financial stability, success is an orphan. Since the crisis, macroeconomic outcomes have been much less benign.  Growth in both the euro area and the UK has been, on average, a percentage point lower; and inflation has been twice as volatile.  There has been a persistent margin of spare capacity, with unemployment, on average, 1-1½ percentage points higher. But there have also been important differences.  While the euro area has continued to experience ‘divine coincidence’ the UK has not (Chart 1).  In the euro area, inflation has averaged half a point below target, reflecting in part the drag from persistent slack in the labour market.  In contrast, UK inflation has been above target, averaging 2.3%, during a period where the economy was operating well below potential.   That reflects the inflationary impacts of two large exchange rate depreciations and weak productivity that have offset a major positive shock to labour supply.  This has created tensions between short-term output and inflation stabilisation in the UK that have not been evident in other major economic regions.

It directs the MPC to “promote understanding of the trade-offs inherent in setting monetary policy” including importantly “the horizon over which the Committee judges it appropriate to return inflation to target”.  The MPC used this flexibility to support activity following the referendum in the wake of the large depreciation. In exceptional circumstances, like Brexit, when the economy is facing profound structural change, the MPC can extend the horizon over which it returns inflation to target from above in order to balance the effects on jobs and activity.  After all, even though monetary policy cannot prevent the weaker real income growth likely to accompany the transition to new trading arrangements with the EU, it can influence how this hit to incomes is distributed between job losses and price rises.  This flexibility cannot be used without limit of course, and the MPC has set out its framework for managing the trade-off including guidance for its tolerance of the overshoot of inflation.3 Developments in monetary policy In response to the challenging post-crisis environment, the conduct of monetary policy has made important advances that have helped to shape the expectations of both market participants and the public we serve.                                                       2 The ECB also has flexibility to pursue its inflation target, but given the absence of trade-off inducing shocks has not yet had cause to use it.  The ECB General Council adopted a quantitative definition of price stability in 1998 as a year-on-year increase in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) for the euro area of below 2%; and from 2003, they clarified that this objective was to maintain inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. 3 See Carney M (2017), Lambda, speech given at the London School of Economics, 16 January 2017. -20246-6-5-4-3-2-101234Great moderationFinancial crisis and afterExcess demand (%)Inflation (%)Inflationary,no trade-offDisinflationary,no trade-offDisinflationary,with trade-offInflationary, with trade-off

In parallel, monetary policy communications have been transformed.  Committee decisions are now explained more fully, in a more timely and targeted way.  Given greater supply uncertainty, more details are provided about the assumptions underpinning forecasts.  And in the face of large downside tail risks, more facets of the reaction function are being spelt out. While there have been many innovations, given the time available today, I will focus on two:  communications including forward guidance; and central bank facilities.  Communications including forward guidance For both the euro area and UK, the past decade has been marked by increased transparency and more focused communications. The ECB has followed each monetary policy decision with a statement and press conference at each meeting since its creation in 1999 and these were supplemented a year later with macroeconomic projections.  In 2015, it dropped the frequency of meetings from twelve to eight to allow for a fuller passage of time between decisions, and supplemented the statement with a fuller account of its monetary policy deliberations, published four weeks after policy announcements. Twenty years ago, the Bank of England was publishing minutes of its monthly policy meetings and quarterly economic forecasts in its Inflation Reports.  It didn’t however always issue statements following decisions. Following the Warsh Report in 2015, we overhauled our communications.  For similar reasons to the ECB, we moved from twelve to eight meetings per year, and we began publishing a statement every time we met and releasing Minutes, Inflation Reports and Monetary Policy Summaries simultaneously on the logic that one decision should merit only one news event.  The MPC now provides much more detailed information on the assumptions that underlie our forecasts and regularly assesses them versus actual outturns.  We release our key judgements for the global economy, domestic demand and the pace of demand relative to supply capacity, and we publish paths for variables that we and others can monitor to see whether the forecast is on track.  We also now publish annual stock takes of the supply side of the economy and of the forecast errors we have made over the past year. Last year, the MPC introduced layered communication to reach the broadest possible audience.  In addition to the Inflation Report we now publish a visual summary, or top layer, which distils the document down to its main messages with a few accompanying diagrams.  It is intended for a non-technical audience.  Following

The objective has been the same for both the ECB and the Bank of England – to clarify our reaction function in a highly uncertain world.  In a perfect world, guidance would be redundant.  People would know how the Committee intends to set rates over the future and how those intentions would adjust to economic developments in all eventualities – the so-called reaction function.  But the world is complex and people (outside this audience) don’t have endless time to devote to understanding monetary policy.  In practice, therefore, guidance can be useful in providing people with information about how the Committee sets policy and, over time, in improving the understanding of how monetary policy will adjust to news. This can make monetary policy more effective by reducing unwarranted volatility in interest rate expectations and the extent to which the central bank has to move the policy rate to meet the inflation target.  The more those expectations are aligned with the policy path necessary to achieve the inflation target, the higher the probability that the policy objective will be achieved.   The ECB’s experience provides a classic example. The ECB’s use of forward guidance has evolved over time with the first use in 2013.  The previous year President Draghi had skilfully given assurance that the ECB would do “whatever it takes to preserve the euro”5 and the Governing Council followed through with a program of Outright Monetary Transactions which restored sovereign bond spreads to more sustainable levels.   In the wake of spillovers from the US taper tantrum, guidance was used to anchor policy expectations in the face of a still fragile euro-area recovery (Chart 2).  The ECB stated that rates were expected to remain at present or lower levels for “an extended period of time” based on “an overall subdued outlook for inflation extending into the medium term and subdued monetary dynamics”.   In subsequent episodes, ECB guidance on interest rates has always been tied to the outlook for inflation, with its time contingent nature becoming more specific, first with links to the duration of asset purchases and more recently to specific calendar dates.  In its most recent statement, the ECB indicated it expected interest rates to “remain at their present levels at least through the first half of 2020”.                                                           4 See Bholat, Broughton, Parker, Ter Meer and Walczak (2018), Enhancing central bank communications with behavioural insights, Bank of England Staff Working Paper No. 750. 5 See verbatim of the remarks made at the Global Investment Conference in London, 26 July 2012.

In the September 2014 press conference the President said that the aim of policy was to steer the balance sheet towards its size at the beginning of 2012. This guidance was important to dispel any doubts about the ECB’s ability to deliver. The Bank of England introduced guidance in 2013 in order to secure the nascent recovery while granting the MPC the flexibility to learn more about the rapidly changing supply capacity of the economy.  When the long-awaited UK recovery began to take hold, even though inflation had been persistently above target, there remained a significant but highly uncertain margin of spare capacity in the economy and it was unclear whether productivity growth would pick up.   We felt that guidance was essential to help clarify our reaction function so that stakeholders could learn alongside the MPC. During previous periods of accelerating growth and firming business confidence, the MPC had always tightened policy significantly.  Indeed, on the basis of this past behaviour in the great moderation, the MPC would have raised interest rates by 2 to 3 percentage points between August 2013 and the end of 2014 (Charts 3 and 4).6                                                        6 See Carney M (2018), ‘Guidance, Contingencies and Brexit’.  For anyone who might suggest the MPC should have followed that reaction function, note that, even on unchanged policy, CPI inflation by the summer of 2016 was running at only about ½% and core CPI inflation around 1¼%. -0.6-0.4-0.20.00.20.40.620132014201520162017201820192020Euro Fwd 1y rateEuro Deposit Facility RateIntroduced rates guidanceLinked forward guidance to APPDate based guidance to summer 2019Extended by 6 months toend 2019Extended by6 months tofirst half of 2020Per cent

Notes: Combined CIPS output survey is a weighted average of the Markit/CIPS PMIs for services, manufacturing and construction. Average MPC vote includes both decisions on Bank Rate and QE, with every extra £25bn of asset purchases (gilts and corporate bonds) treated as equivalent to a 25bp cut in Bank Rate (see Joyce, Tong and Woods, 2011). Six years ago, the MPC recognised that past should not be prologue. The MPC was pretty certain there was a large amount of slack, although it had questions over how much productive capacity had been destroyed following the crisis; how quickly productivity growth would recover; and whether labour supply would change in the wake of reforms and a heavy burden of household debt. Such uncertainties about supply meant that knowing what was happening to demand was no longer sufficient for gauging the appropriate policy response.  That is why the Committee provided forward guidance that explicitly linked any potential change in interest rates to the unemployment rate – a clear and widely understood indicator of the degree of slack.  The message the Committee gave UK households and businesses was simple: the MPC would not even think about tightening policy at least until the unemployment rate had fallen below 7%, consistent with the creation of around three quarter of a million jobs.  What we – and others – learnt as the recovery progressed was that the UK economy had substantially more spare capacity than previously thought.  The MPC could be patient. As a consequence, even as the recovery strengthened and survey indicators of output growth reached levels previously associated with sharp policy tightenings (Chart 4), market expectations about the future path of policy remained subdued (Chart 3). Participants understood the conditionality of guidance, as they and the MPC learnt that there was still considerable spare capacity in the economy. -125-100-75-50-25025503035404550556065199820002002200420062008201020122014201620183 month moving average, bps3 month moving average, balanceCombinedCIPS output survey (LHS)Average MPC vote, including QE(RHS)

Out of that guidance came the phrase ‘limited and gradual’, so often repeated it is now part of the monetary policy furniture.  In fact, it recently celebrated its fifth birthday. This guidance was grounded in an early exposition of why r* was low and not expected to recover soon.7   Secular drivers that had pushed down the equilibrium rate prior to the crisis – including slower potential growth, demographic forces, changes in income distribution and excess saving in emerging markets – were likely to persist.  The MPC judged there is a further wedge pushing r* in the UK below global r* because of fiscal drag and heightened uncertainty.8 The MPC clearly signalled that the policy path was likely to be very different from during past recoveries. It observed that the appropriate path of interest rate increases to eliminate slack and keep inflation close to the target was expected to be gradual and, even once spare capacity had been absorbed, the appropriate level of Bank Rate was expected to be materially below the pre-crisis average of 5%. This may be obvious now, but it wasn’t then when it mattered most. Importantly, the interest rate expectations of UK households and businesses have remained well anchored both as the recovery has progressed and even as policy was tightened in November 2017 and August 2018 (Chart 5).                                                       7 See Carney, M (2013), “The spirit of the season” at The Economic Club of New York; and the box on page 42 of the August 2014 Inflation Report. 8 See the box on page 39 of the August 2018 Inflation Report.

As intended, “limited and gradual” guidance has dampened interest rate volatility (Chart 6) and reduced the correlation between interest rate volatility and economic uncertainty (Chart 7).

Liquidity and lending facilities I would also like to touch on the critical but sometimes underappreciated role that liquidity and lending facilities have played in securing the recoveries in both our economies. During the crisis and its immediate aftermath, the focus of these innovations was to maintain market functioning.   At the first signs of tension in 2007, the ECB was quickest to respond to demands for additional liquidity, injecting additional reserves in August as asset-backed commercial paper markets dried up.  As the crisis intensified, the ECB launched innovative long-term repo operations, with wider collateral eligibility.  And the ECB worked with the Bank of England, the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Canada amongst others on a network of central bank swaps to make liquidity available in G10 currencies across a range of jurisdictions.   The Bank of England’s initial response was not as comprehensive as that of the ECB, not least because its framework for providing liquidity lagged market developments.  Once under pressure, the Bank could neither stabilise overnight rates nor support the banking system.  Fortunately, in the jaws of the crisis, the Bank innovated rapidly and admirably to avoid the collapse of the system. In 2013, following the Winters review, we overhauled our facilities drawing on the ECB’s example and made it clear the Bank was ‘open for business’.

We also begun a broadening access to our facilities both within the banking sector and beyond it to reach central counterparties and large broker dealers. The most recent addition to the toolkit came in March of this year when the Bank launched a new Liquidity Facility in Euros (LiFE) as part of our Brexit contingency planning.  This is backstopped by the swap line between our two institutions, and underpinned by our open communications and effective supervisory cooperation.  The LiFE is a testament to the commitment of central banks to cooperate to secure the stability of the system to the benefit of all our citizens. Liquidity facilities have not just been about firefighting.  Given the constraints of the effective lower bound (ELB), lending facilities have been recast into stimulus tools.   Drawing on the 3-year long-term refinancing operations (LTROs) launched by ECB the previous year, the Bank of England launched a Funding for Lending Scheme (FLS) in 2012, as the nascent recovery was threatened by a sharp rise in banks funding costs and subsequent tightening in credit conditions amid the euro-area crisis. The FLS combined four year funding with sharp incentives to support lending to households and businesses.  Banks expanding lending were able to access the scheme for a 25bp fee, a sizeable discount to retail and market funding costs at the time, with higher fees, of up to 150bp, for those that were contracting their lending.  Banks could access 5% of their initial stock of lending immediately and to provide a further incentive to lend this allocation was adjusted upward by the amount of their net lending in the 18 months following the launch of the scheme.9 Building on the experience of the FLS, the Bank launched a Term Funding Scheme (TFS) in August 2016 as part of a package of measures in response to the hit to confidence in the UK following the vote to leave the European Union.   The TFS was designed to reinforce pass-through of a cut in Bank Rate from 0.5% to 0.25% and in doing so reduce the effective lower bound in the UK.   The pricing was calibrated so that the combination of the TFS and cuts in Bank Rate, if passed through fully, would have no impact on the margins of banks and building societies.  The subsequent behaviour of lending and deposit rates suggest the scheme worked in reinforcing pass-through (Chart 8).10   The existence of the TFS meant that the MPC reduced its estimate of the effective lower bound from 0.5% to close to, but a little above, 0%.                                                       9 The scheme was subsequently amended to give sharper incentives for participants to lend to SMEs. 10 See Nardi, Nwankwo and Meaning (2018), The Term Funding Scheme: design, operation and impact.

When conditions had improved enough to warrant an increase in Bank Rate to 0.5% in November 2017, the TFS was no longer needed and it was closed to further drawings in February 2018.  The Bank of course retains the ability to relaunch the scheme as necessary and in light of that the MPC judges the effective lower bound to Bank Rate to be now close to but a little above 0%. The ECB’s targeted long-term refinancing operations (TLTROs), first launched in 2014, also built on the experience of the FLS, as part of the three-pronged easing strategy, which also included cuts in the ECB deposit rate into negative territory and the launch of asset-backed security and corporate bond purchase programs.   The facility was initially launched at margin of 10bps over the ECB’s marginal lending rate, though over time the pricing was reduced and tied instead to the deposit rate.  As with the FLS and TFS, higher interest rates for banks that are contracting lending provide an incentive to lend. As with the UK, the TLTRO provided an innovative way to reduce the effective lower bound.  With the link to the ECB’s deposit rate the TLTRO provided a way for the ECB to take wholesale interest rates significantly below zero without counterproductive compression to margins in the banking sector (Chart 9).

To sum up on liquidity and lending facilities, reforms over the crisis leave behind a much more comprehensive backstop to dysfunction in funding markets.  Liquidity is available more freely, against a wider range of collateral and in all major currencies.  Moreover, through careful calibration targeted lending schemes can lower the effective lower bound on interest rates, unlocking more stimulus.   ----------------------------------------------------- To return to where I started, the past ten years have spurred tremendous advances in the conduct of monetary policy.

The global financial crisis has been a watershed for the global economy. Its impli-cations for growth, distribution, and public finances have been severe. Structural changes have affected both the real economy and the financial sector. Reforms of the financial regulatory system have not only been a consequence, but also a driv-er of these trends. The G20 countries undertook an internationally coordinated overhaul of the financial regulatory landscape. It has been the broad objective of these reforms to reduce the probability and impact of future financial crises. The crisis has particularly challenged the perception that the stability of individual institutions automatically guarantees the stability of the entire financial system. Macroprudential now complements microprudential supervision. The purpose of macroprudential policy is to ensure that the financial system can perform its role for the real economy, even in times of crises or distress.  In the following, I will briefly review the origins of financial crises and the im-portance of taking a systemic view. I will then review the reform agenda of the past 10 years. As the implementation of key reform elements is well underway, the Fi-nancial Stability Board (FSB) has started a structured approach towards ex post evaluation as an integral part of a policy cycle. Ex post policy evaluation assesses whether reforms have achieved their objectives and whether there have been ma-jor unintended side effects. I will conclude by discussing elements of an evaluation process which ensure independence and transparency.   1) What causes financial crises? A stable financial system is consistently in a position to absorb both financial and real economic shocks, especially when confronted with unforeseen events, in stress situations and in periods of structural adjustment. A resilient financial system is able to absorb losses from unexpected developments, it prevents contagion and adverse feedback effects.

Financial stability is at risk if systemic risks emerge. At the heart of systemic risks are externalities: Systemic risk may occur, for instance, when the distress of one or more market participants jeopardises the functioning of the entire system. This may be the case when the distressed market participant is very large or closely in-terlinked with other market players.  Interconnectedness can be a channel through which unexpected adverse devel-opments are transmitted to the financial system as a whole, thus impairing its sta-bility. Market participants can be connected directly through contractual relation-ship such as on the interbank market. Besides this, indirect channels of contagion may exist. Many market participants may conduct similar transactions or hold simi-lar types of assets. In such a situation, investors may interpret negative news as signals that other market participants are adversely affected as well. Hence, sys-temic risks also exist if a large number of small market participants is exposed to similar risks or risks that are closely correlated with each other. In the presence of systemic risk externalities, the optimal level of risk taken by fi-nancial institutions from a private perspective is thus higher than the socially effi-cient level of risk. Owners of financial institutions may reap the potential benefits of their decisions in full, but bear the potential risks only partially if they can expect to be bailed out by the government bailout in the event of distress.  This excessive risk taking implies costs for society: if risks materialize, govern-ments may be pressured to bail out banks, thus imposing costs on taxpayers. Regulatory reforms aimed at internalizing these externalities comprise higher loss-absorbing capacity and provisions to facilitate the orderly resolution of banks. These reforms have the potential to increase social welfare. However, they may come at a net private cost for the affected institutions: they will forgo the net private benefit (profits) associated with their excessive risk taking, they may incur costs re-lated to compliance with new regulations, and their funding may be more costly as it must provide greater capacity to absorb losses. Through these channels, chang-es in regulations affect the incentives for banks to take on risks.

Capital flow/default cycles have been around since at least 1800 – if not before. Technology has changed, the height of humans has changed, and fashions have changed. Yet the ability of governments and investors to delude themselves, giving rise to periodic bouts of euphoria that usually end in tears, seems to have re-mained a constant. (Kaminsky and Rogoff 2008, p. 53)1. Is this time different? Have policymakers learned from the recent financial crisis? One key insight of the financial crisis has been that supervision needs to go be-yond the individual institution and take a system-wide perspective. Macroprudential policy aims to mitigate systemic risks, i.e. risks to the financial system as a whole. It builds on microprudential regulations which are concerned with the stability of in-dividual financial institutions. The need for a macroprudential perspective is a les-son learned from the global financial crisis: even though individual financial institu-tions may seem stable from a microprudential perspective, the financial system may be highly vulnerable to shocks, and it may amplify these shocks. Since 2009, the G20 has implemented a wide range of policies which aim at reduc-ing the probability and the effects of future financial crises (Figure 1). These fall in-to four areas:2  A first set of policies aims at enhancing the resilience of the finan-cial sector with regard to adverse shocks. These policies include higher capital and liquidity requirements for all banks and in particular for systemically important banks. More resilient financial institutions can better withstand negative shocks and are less likely to amplify them. This mitigates negative repercussions on the real economy. One key insight of the financial crisis has been that large, complex, and connected financial institutions can be particularly systemic and “too big to fail”. Large and systemically important financial institutions are thus required to fulfil additional _____________ 1 Reinhart, Carmen M. and Kenneth Rogoff (2018), “This time is different: a panoramic view of eight centu-ries of financial crisis”, NBER Working Paper 13882, March 2018. 2 For more information: https://www.fsb.org/2018/11/implementation-and-effects-of-the-g20-financial-regulatory-reforms-fourth-annual-report/

Requirements for their total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC)3 are intended to ensure that systemically important banks have issued a sufficient amount of bail-inable debt and can be resolved without recourse to taxpayer money, while main-taining their vital economic functions. Recovery and resolution planning identifies critical functions that can be ring-fenced and shielded from the negative conse-quences of adverse scenarios. Finally, enhanced supervision of systemically im-portant banks includes higher supervisory expectations for risk management func-tions, risk governance, and internal controls. Additional policies aim at making derivatives markets safer and more transparent. They include requirements on trade reporting, central clearing, platform trading, margins and higher capital requirements for non-centrally cleared derivatives. Their broader aim is to mitigate systemic risk, contagion, and to avoid market abuse. A final set of policies aims at transforming shadow banking into resilient market-based finance. These policies include new regulations for money market funds and securitizations. Their broad purpose is to mitigate systemic risks associated with non-bank financial intermediation. 3) What are the effects of the reforms?4  Many post-crisis financial regulatory reforms have entered uncharted territory: reli-able assessments of reform effects and knowledge about transmission channels were lacking. Reforms had to be implemented in an environment characterized by a high degree of uncertainty. Hence, a structured policy cycle is needed to reduce the risks of ineffective policies, miscalibrated policy instruments, and unintended side effects. Such a cycle involves four steps (Figure 2):  (1) defining policy objectives,  _____________ 3 A related policy measure in the European context are Minimum Requirements for own funds and Eligible Liabilities (MREL). 4 This section draws on Buch, Claudia M., Edgar Vogel, Benjamin Weigert (2018), “Evaluating macropru-dential policies”, European Systemic Risk Board Working Paper No 76, Frankfurt a. M.

(2) choosing intermediate objectives and appropriate indicators,  (3) linking instruments to indicators through ex ante impact assessments, and  (4) analysing policy effects through ex post evaluations.  In a first step, the policy objective(s) of macroprudential policy need to be speci-fied. Macroprudential authorities use different definitions of the policy objective, but they all aim at reducing systemic risk arising from externalities. Ideally, the policy objective is derived from an analytical framework which links performance of the fi-nancial system to the functioning of the real economy.  In a second step, intermediate objectives need to be specified and appropriate in-dicators chosen. Intermediate objectives are linked to the drivers of systemic risk, such as leverage, risk-taking incentives, interconnectedness, or exposure to com-mon shocks. In many cases, it will not be possible to specify a direct, simple, and linear relationship between intermediate objectives and financial stability. For ex-ample, the link between the interconnectedness of financial institutions and the probability of financial contagion is non-linear.5  Intermediate objectives can thus be state-dependent as their relationship to financial stability depends on the struc-ture and state of the financial system and real economy.  In a third step, the activation or recalibration of policy instruments that address evolving vulnerabilities and financial stability risks needs to be considered. The de-cision on whether and how to activate policy measures should be based on a structured process of ex ante policy evaluation. This provides information about the relative contribution of policy instruments reducing systemic risk. Trade-offs be-tween stability and other policy objectives can be taken into account when per-forming such an analysis and when calibrating instruments.  _____________ 5 Allen, Franklin and Douglas Gale (2000), “Financial Contagion”, Journal of Political Economy, Vol. 108(1).

In a fourth step, and once sufficient time has elapsed, the effects of the instru-ments need to be assessed in an ex post evaluation. This step provides infor-mation about the effectiveness of the measure(s) taken, about intended or unin-tended side effects, and it also serves as an input into a possible recalibration of the policy instruments.  Ultimately, policy evaluation provides insights beyond the assessment of specific policy instruments by answering the question of “how to get there”. Indeed, it can also help address the question of “where to go” by providing information about the appropriateness of the specific policy objectives and targets, which may be revised if needed. This is particularly important given that macroprudential policy is a rela-tively new area and given that experience with the above policy cycle is limited. Evaluation of financial sector policies: The approach of the Financial Stabil-ity Board  The Financial Stability Board (FSB) has recently developed a framework to guide its own evaluation work related to the G20 post-crisis reforms of financial sector regulation.6  According to the FSB Framework, evaluation methods need to answer three questions:  • Did the reform “cause” an outcome (attribution)?  • Did the reform have similar effects across relevant markets, states of the world, or jurisdictions and regions (heterogeneity)?  • Did the reform achieve its overall objective (aggregation/general equilibri-um)?  _____________ 6 Financial Stability Board (2017), “Framework for Post-Implementation Evaluation of the Effects of the G20 Financial Regulatory Reforms”, Basel, https://www.fsb.org/2017/07/framework-for-post-implementation-evaluation-of-the-effects-of-the-g20-financial-regulatory-reforms/

Analytical tools vary in their ability to answer these questions. Which evaluation approach to choose depends on their relevance to the objectives of the evaluation, their feasibility and replicability for implementation across countries, and their costs in terms of resource inputs and data requirements. As shown by the first FSB eval-uations, a robust evaluation strategy combines different (both qualitative and quan-titative) analytical approaches. In addition to fleshing out analytical concepts, the FSB framework contains a num-ber of arrangements concerning the governance of evaluation work. For instance, the framework recommends that the evaluation process should include means for engagement with external stakeholders. These may include the publication of in-formation on forthcoming evaluation projects, public consultations on evaluation reports before publication, and the publication of evaluation reports. Workshops and roundtables of FSB members with academia and participants from the industry and the civil society are means of interaction.  The first two evaluations under the framework have been delivered to the G20-Summit in November 2018:7   • The first project investigates the extent to which post-crisis reforms incentiv-ized the central clearing of OTC derivatives. It has been the aim of these reforms to make derivatives markets both, safer and more transparent. Evaluation results suggest that reforms are providing the intended incentives for central clearing, es-pecially for the most systemic market participants.  • The second project evaluates the effect of reforms on the financing of infra-structure. It concluded that effects of the reforms on infrastructure finance were of second order importance relative to other factors such as the macro-financial envi-ronment, fiscal and monetary policies. The analyses do not point to a significant ef-fect on the volume and cost of infrastructure finance, while there are some indica-_____________ 7 Consultative and  final reports are available at: https://www.fsb.org/work-of-the-fsb/implementation-monitoring/effects-of-reforms/

More projects are underway. An evaluation of reform effects on SME financing will be delivered to the G20 Summit this year. The respective consultation report was published recently.8  According to this report, the evaluation does not identify per-sistent negative effects of the G20 regulatory reforms on SME financing overall. At the same time, the adjustment patterns in the data are not inconsistent with stronger effects of the reforms on those banks for which the new rules on capital regulation have been binding the most. A new project which has been started in 2019 focuses on a core objective of the reforms. This project will assess the extent to which the too-big-to fail (TBTF) re-forms have addressed the systemic and moral hazard risks associated with sys-temically important financial institutions:9   • The project will analyse whether the reforms were effective in reducing the perceived probability of the impact of failure of systemically important institutions – for instance, by assessing changes in estimates of implicit funding subsidies and analysing progress in the resolvability of systemically important banks.  • It will provide answers to the question of whether reforms are leading to changes in bank behaviour, for instance by attributing changes in business models and risk taking that reflect the internalization of the negative systemic risk externali-ties to relevant reforms.  • It will examine the broader effects of the reforms, including the functioning of the financial system, market fragmentation, cost and availability of financing to the _____________ 8 https://www.fsb.org/2019/06/fsb-publishes-consultation-on-sme-financing-evaluation/ 9 Financial Stability Board (2011), “Policy Measures to Address Systemically Important Financial Institu-tions”, November 2011. For details see the terms of reference (https://www.fsb.org/2019/05/evaluation-of-too-big-to-fail-reforms-summary-terms-of-reference/).

A key issue will be to focus on the achievement of intended out-comes but also analyse potential (positive or negative) unintended consequences. The FSB, in line with its aim to engage with a broad range of stakeholders, has in-vited feedback on this project, including supporting evidence of reform effects, by June 21, 2019. To put the evaluation on a solid analytical basis, academic advisors are working in close collaboration with the group on methodological issues.10  Stakeholders will have further opportunities to interact with the FSB and contribute to this project: as the project progresses, workshops and roundtables will provide an opportunity for externals to engage with the FSB evaluation team. Lastly, the FSB plans to publish a consultation report in June 2020.  4) Independence of policy evaluations11  Credible policy evaluation obviously requires independence. Independent and ob-jective assessments are needed to gain an unbiased picture of the effects of re-forms. There are several avenues leading to this goal. External experts can be in-volved who have a mandate for independent evaluations and who have no stake in the formulation of policies. These can be existing institutions such as research in-stitutes or policy advisory bodies. Independence of internal evaluations can be en-hanced through institutional arrangements such as peer reviews or independence from policy groups. Transparency is another precondition for a credible regulatory process. Policy evaluation means being transparent about the goals of regulatory policies and what these policies have actually achieved. Repositories of evaluation studies can improve transparency by making it easier and less costly for (internal) evaluators and external stakeholders to keep track of evaluation work. Other fields, such as development economics or medicine, often rely on repositories to structure the _____________ 10 See the call for nominations for more details (https://www.fsb.org/2019/02/call-for-nominations-appointment-of-academic-advisors-for-the-fsb-evaluation-of-too-big-to-fail-reforms/). 11 See also “Evaluating Financial Sector Reforms: A Joint Task for Academia and Policymakers”, Claudia M.

Beyond this, it also allows users to submit their own studies. Replicability is an important element of transparency. Replicability ensures that policy decisions are based on robust evidence. This requires transparency about the models being used, access to data, and documentation of how studies are set up. Replication studies repeat an original analysis using different data and are thus especially useful for policy work. Academic study often focuses on specific novel results, which may limit the external validity of findings in a different setting. Evi-dence-based policy decisions require information on whether a particular finding is robust with regard to changing the underlying setting. Hence, there is a potential tension between the novelty and uniqueness of findings that are appreciated in ac-ademia and the need to rely on sufficiently robust results as a basis for policy deci-sions. Enhanced appreciation of replication studies in academic work and en-hanced capacity of policy institutions to conduct their own replication studies can help relaxing this tension.  Finally, an active outreach strategy should also be part of an independent, trans-parent evaluation process. Stakeholders should be given the opportunity to give input and voice their concerns. This interaction can take place via public consulta-tions of reports, through workshops or conferences, or by appointing external aca-demic advisors. All this will ultimately improve the quality of evaluations.   _____________ 12 Examples for repositories from other policy areas are the McMaster Health Forum (https://www.mcmasterforum.org/) or the 3ie initiative (https://www.3ieimpact.org/) in development eco-nomics.  13 See https://stats.bis.org/frame/ and Boissay, F., C.

Luis de Guindos: Interview in Corriere della SeraInterview with Mr Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the European Central Bank, in Corriere dellaSera, conducted by Mr Federico Fubini on 13 June 2019.*   *   *The 5y5y forward inflation rate is at an all-time low and clearly below where it was whenMario Draghi first hinted at quantitative easing (QE) in 2014. The ECB has already donesome more easing and President Draghi himself mentioned that there was an interestingdiscussion at the latest Governing Council meeting on different tools to do some moreeasing – the asset purchase programme (APP) and others. What do you need to see inorder to decide to do more?What we need to see is a de-anchoring of inflation expectations. This has not yet happened,despite the fact that there has been a drop in market-based inflation expectations. If you look atthe survey of professional forecasters, the situation is a little bit different – expectations haveremained stable. Then we need to see if there is a significant additional drop in economic activity– a crystallisation of the downside risks that we have indicated. We can always try to lookforwards to get an idea of what might happen, but ultimately the reality is the reality. And, well,let’s see what happens. But I think the important part of our stance is that we are totally ready toreact. We will have time enough to know the future when it arrives.Does that imply that the current stance is appropriate, if your staff forecasts areconfirmed?Yes. And if there is a further deterioration, then we will react. But for now, our monetary policystance is fully compatible with both inflation and real activity. The important element is that weare totally ready to react. And I would add another element, if I may: risks are tilted to thedownside.Do you mean, in terms of real activity?Both in terms of real activity and in terms of inflation. So if those risks materialise, then we willreact.Can you think about different monetary policy tools to address different problems? If theissue is with the exchange rate, official rates are probably the answer; if it’s real activity,then QE; if it’s monetary transmission, then it’s targeted longer-term refinancingoperations (TLTRO)…We do not allocate our instruments to different objectives. Something that I think is relevant, butis sometimes a bit overlooked, is that monetary policy is not almighty. If there is a problem withprice stability, that’s within our mandate. But this is something everyone has to keep in mind toavoid creating expectations that will not be met: we do not have the philosopher’s stone.Are you implying that having something of a policy mix would be good, in total respect ofthe ECB’s independence?Sure. But my point is that wherever there is a problem, for instance a problem with tradedisputes, that is a real economic problem that is going to have real consequences. You cancertainly smooth the impact with monetary policy, but you will not be able to address and fix thiskind of problems with monetary policy. The real role of monetary policy is price stability. And inorder to guarantee price stability, we have to monitor the evolution of the real economy –domestic demand, external demand, the exchange rate, and the rest. But you cannot fix all the 1 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
economic problems of the world with monetary policy.President Draghi hinted recently that if there is a slowdown and those downside risksmaterialise, fiscal policy might also play a role.Yes, sure. It’s the policy mix. Of course there is monetary policy, and we have been the maingame in town since 2012. Monetary policy has been key to understanding the recovery of activityand employment creation, among other things. But it’s not the only policy in place. Fiscal policyhas to play a role, as do structural reforms. And in the case of fiscal policy, it’s not only thenominal deficit level, it’s the composition as well: the quality of public finances.Are you saying that the public investment-to-GDP share, which has remained flat, at2.6%, during the QE years, could now increase?It’s not even only public investment. One of the problems in Europe now is low productivity, whichis caused by the fact that we are not investing enough in education, R&D and publicinfrastructure. But public infrastructure is not a stabilisation instrument. When you start building aroad, for instance, the project is delivered much later, when the business cycle may have alreadyturned. But education and R&D are levers that have to be used. And at the same time I think it’simportant that we look at the composition of taxation and its impact on long-term growth andproductivity.Do you mean it would be better to have lower taxation on labour, compensated by otherareas of the tax base?It depends; there is no single recipe. But you can’t take the tax structure that we have now as afait accompli. You should use a combination that takes into account new elements, such asclimate change. All these aspects have to be taken into consideration. That is why fiscal policy isvery relevant; it’s not only the nominal deficit that matters.So when you and President Draghi go to Eurogroup and Ecofin meetings, you mighthave concepts to share with the ministers in this respect?Sure, when we go to Eurogroup and Ecofin meetings we are fully coordinated, also on fiscalpolicy matters.Italy and Spain were trading at very similar levels during the crisis. Today the Bonos-BTP spread on 10-year maturities is over 180 basis points. What do you think explainssuch divergence: the fiscal situation, growth rates or redenomination risk?First, I do not want make comparisons between Spain and Italy. But focusing on Italy, I think themain problem has been very low growth. You have not recovered the level of GDP that you had in2008.What do you think is the reason for that?I think there are two elements. The first is the extremely high level of public debt, which is asword of Damocles hanging over your head. Second, there is a problem with structural reforms.But there are pros and cons in the Italian economy. The cons are slow growth, public debt, a lackof structural reforms and so low productivity growth. But Italy also has some advantages that wehave to acknowledge. The first is that it has a current account surplus. The net investmentposition is good, and that reduces the vulnerability of the economy. And when one looks at thecountry’s budgetary track record, it has not been bad because it has had a primary surplusalmost every year. This is not something that is very easy to achieve, so it’s a very good trackrecord, especially when compared with other countries. So we come back to the problem of slowgrowth, which immediately leads us on to structural reforms, barriers to market entry, labour 2 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
market efficiency… These are the kinds of things that are sometimes a little bit overlooked.There is nothing unfair in comparing Italy to Spain in June and July 2012. The situationwas very similar.We were very close, we were on the edge…The situation was the same and the two countries took two different paths. Spaindecided to take an EU programme for the banks, whereas Italy committed itself to makingit on its own. Do you think that decision explains the divergence between the twocountries since then?Again, I don’t want to make a direct comparison. The situation in Spain in 2012 was different –the government had an absolute majority in Parliament, we were lucky in that. And the clean-upof banks in Spain was far-reaching. It was not easy; it was bloody, I can assure you. But we did itand, after that, we were able to deal with an issue like Banco Popular. That was not easy, either.Then, Spain gained a lot of competiveness because of labour market reforms. Those are the twofactors. But I don’t want to make a comparison with Italy. I am only focusing on Spain now. By2013 Spain had started to grow again, and it has outperformed its peers for the last five or sixyears.So do you think frontloading that effort paid off?Yes, I think so. In Spain there was a government with an absolute majority, but even then we hada difficult time, politically speaking, after that. But in Spain, regardless of the political party inpower, the pro-European approach is guaranteed, even when you look at the two extremes, Voxand Podemos.They don’t question the euro.Maybe they have different approaches regarding fiscal policy, but they don’t say they want toleave the euro. No, not at all.In fact, when you look at credit default swap (CDS) markets, the implied probability ofSpain leaving the euro is very, very low. In the case of Italy, it is not very low. Is itpossible, then, that part of the spread between Bonos and BTPs is due to thatredenomination concern for Italy?Again, it’s not a matter of making comparisons between countries. In the case of Spain, the mainreforms were labour market reforms and cleaning up the banks. Those are the drivers of Spain’sgood performance, in my view. And those are the elements that have to be maintained over thecoming years.De Nederlandsche Bank President Klaas Knot recently said that divergence among euroarea countries is making it increasingly difficult to set a single monetary policy that fits allof them. He expressed concerns about the sustainability of ever-diverging trends.Would you agree with him?There are no ever-diverging trends. There is the concrete case of Italy, which is underperforming.But six or seven years ago the underperformers were Spain, Greece and Ireland, and now theyare overperformers. It’s changed quite a lot. For instance, now in 2019 Germany is going to beone of the countries with a lower growth rate. And yet it was the euro area’s growth engine two orthree years ago. There is not an accumulation of divergences, but situations change. Somecountries that were underperforming are now overperforming, and vice versa. And this is notgoing to depend on monetary policy. Monetary policy has to take care of price stability and somereal factors that can explain inflation levels across the euro area. But it’s exactly the same in the 3 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
United States.Do you think a single currency area can work in the long term without having a singlebudget to address shocks, banking problems or competiveness issues?I think the institutional architecture of the euro area has not been finalised at all. We have madesome progress with the creation of the European Stability Mechanism, and we have launched thebanking union, but this project is not complete. We have to finish the European DepositInsurance Scheme (EDIS) and we need to complete the capital markets union. I am fully infavour of having an instrument with a stabilisation capacity. It can take different forms.Of the kind French president Emmanuel Macron is proposing?If you look at what was agreed in the European Council, it was a first step in the right direction.But that should not be the steady state of the instrument. It could grow and have a very clearpurpose – countercyclical stabilisation. Now it’s more like a sort of competiveness instrument.We have to share more risk, for sure, if we want to improve the performance of the euro areaand reduce the burden of monetary policy because, as I said, monetary policy is not almighty.And there is one element that is going to be key to achieving these steps: trust.You have to trust other countries to behave. But when a country misbehaves, as seemsto be the case with Italy now, are you concerned that this may hamper trust?In the case of Italy, if you look at the fundamentals there are pros and cons. Italy is not a veryvulnerable economy on financial grounds, if you take into account the net investment position andother factors. If you want an example of a vulnerable economy, look at Spain in 2010. It had anexternal deficit of 10% of GDP and a net investment position of 90% of GDP in the red. That’s notthe situation Italy is in now. My point is that trust sometimes depends on the political intentions ofthe government.You mean the Italian government must provide some clearly stated objectives that areacceptable to the rest of the club.Yes, on both sides. This is a bilateral game, so it’s from both sides. And I think it’s very difficult tomake progress if we can’t build trust. And since we are talking about trust and uncertainty indifficult times, I think this idea of discussing mini-BOTs was a mistake. President Draghi saidthat if it’s legal tender, it’s illegal and if it’s debt, then it piles up more debt. Also, in my view, theworst consequence of this kind of decision is that it destroys trust. 4 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches

    All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches 2  2  It is an honour to join you today to celebrate this special occasion. The Women In Banking and Finance (WIBF) network is a place to connect with colleagues, share knowledge and like today, celebrate success.  In that spirit we have already connected at the reception and will conclude by celebrating your success, so let me take up a bit of the middle to share some knowledge that the Bank has gained as it seeks to improve diversity and inclusion at the heart of finance. Let me start by reflecting on the state of the UK financial services industry.  Over two million people across the UK work in the sector.  It makes up over 10% of the economy and runs a trade surplus of £72 billion, greater than all other exporting industries combined.  Financial services contribute enough taxes to fund the NHS.1 Most fundamentally, finance serves households and businesses at home and abroad.  Last year, the UK financial system channelled £300 billion in finance to UK businesses and helped 700,000 households to purchase homes. Finance insures the contents of 20 million homes and provides pensions to 21 million people. Finance offers so much, but it still doesn’t offer enough for women.  Jayne-Anne Gadhia’s review of gender diversity in finance shows that female representation on boards is less than a quarter and a mere 14% on executive committees. And these executive roles tend to be in corporate and support functions, such as HR and legal, as opposed to corporate leadership roles such as the CEO and CIO.2 This is especially striking as more women than men start out in financial services, only for their representation to diminish steadily through the ranks.  The value of diversity  This is an enormous missed opportunity.  Research on the value of diversity is abundant. For example, McKinsey finds that companies in the top quartile of gender diversity are 15% more likely to have financial returns above their industry median.3 According to Credit Suisse, companies with more diverse boards outperformed peers by 26% and had higher return on equity, lower leverage, and higher average net income growth.4                                                       1 The City UK, Key Facts about UK-based financial and related professional services (April 2017).

First, it is the right thing to do; a public institution should reflect the people it serves. Second, diversity can build the trust required to deliver our remits, as people are more likely to trust people they recognise, reducing misperceptions that we are experts making esoteric decisions in ivory towers for the benefit of others.5 Third, diversity leads to better decision-making, more creative thinking and reduces the risks of groupthink and bias.6  This last point is critical. Almost all decisions in finance are taken under uncertainty, making it especially important that decision makers are exposed to a range of views, and engage in open debates with people whose perspectives challenge the prevailing wisdom. Articulating why diversity and inclusion are important has helped the Bank move the dial.  When I joined the Bank, only 17% of senior managers were women, so we set an ambitious target to reach 35% by 2020.  The Bank is on track to achieve this: today, 32% of senior management are female, considerably above the 14% industry average. Our pipeline of future leaders also looks healthy: 46% of colleagues below senior management are women. This didn’t just happen. Reaching this point has required a deliberate, concentrated effort throughout the organisation.  The power of organisations like the WIBF is that they help such approaches permeate through the industry.  I hope that sharing the Bank’s experience will reinforce the current initiatives you may have in your organisations and perhaps even trigger some new ideas about what more we all can do to achieve gender equality in the industry.   Lessons from the Bank’s diversity and inclusion initiatives Diversity is not a one hit wonder: focus on the whole process from recruitment to development to promotion  The Bank recognises that how it recruits affects whom it recruits.  From school leavers to career returners, the Bank has programmes to attract diverse talent at each stage of life.   To help develop the next generation, the Bank is working with schools to encourage a more diverse set of students to study economics and finance. We provide free classroom materials for students aged 11‐16 to equip them with the analytical skills to make informed financial decisions, using real‐world examples, captivating videos and accessible case studies.7 By the end of 2018 we had reached 90,000 students through our “EconoMe” programme, one quarter of all state secondary schools in the country. In an attempt to inspire children into finance, over the past year we have also made more than 300 school visits, of which 75 were by the Bank's policy committee members.                                                        5 Farmer, H, McKay, R, Tsakiris, M, Trust in Me (2013): “Trust in Me: Trustworthy Others Are Seen as More Physically Similar to the Self”, Psychological Science.  6 Kahneman, D (2012) “Thinking Fast and Slow”, London.

The Bank offers on the job training for all ages to entice diverse talent.  Our Future Capability programme is aimed at pupils keen to get their careers started after leaving school.  Almost 90% of our 2018 Future Capability intake were from a state school and over half were female.  Historically, one impediment to improving diversity in central banking has been the lack of diversity among economics graduates. Just under a third of students studying economics to A-level and undergraduate level in British Universities are female.8,9  To enable the Bank to hire from a broader set of disciplines and train them as economists and technical specialists we have introduced an in-house Central Banking Qualification (CBQ), in which graduate hires can earn a Masters Degree in Central Banking. This means that only half of our graduates study economics, with the remainder plucked from the sciences, business and the humanities.  In recent years, our graduates have come from 40 different universities, a six-fold increase in the past decade. In the Bank’s September 2019 intake, we expect that almost half – 46% – of graduates will be female. This is the most diverse outcome since we began recording the diversity of graduate intakes. Last year, the Bank won the TARGETjobs 'Most Popular Graduate Recruiter in Banking, Insurance and Financial Services’ for the second year running. This year, Barclays pipped us to the post but in the spirit of sharing knowledge, we look forward to learning about the initiatives that have worked for them.   The Bank is also focusing on mid-career recruitment and last year almost half of our experienced hires were female. To attract diverse candidates we review all job adverts to ensure they use only gender-neutral language to avoid alienating or discouraging prospective applicants.   During the selection process, CVs are anonymised of all personal data, fostering a more objective assessment of a candidate’s skills. At the interview stage, we ensure that panels are diverse in order to mitigate affinity effects and unconscious biases.  To make these initiatives a success, all our managers are required to undertake unconscious bias training before recruiting.  Of course, not all talent develops on a linear career path; some people choose to take career breaks and may require support to return to the workplace. Recognising this pool of untapped talent, the Bank successfully piloted a Career Returners programme last year. The Bank offered a six-month placement to 16 people, with coaching and training support and fifteen women went on to take up permanent positions. Bolstered by this success, we are rolling out the programme across the institution.  Recruitment is only the first step. As Jayne-Anne Gadhia observed in her review of gender diversity in finance, a layer of “permafrost” sets in at middle management, where women get either stuck or leave the sector.                                                       8 Joint Council for Qualifications, 2017 GCSE and A-Level results, available at: https://www.jcq.org.uk/examinationresults/gcses/2017/gcse-full-course-results-summer-2017/gcse-full-course-results-summer-2017.  9 HE student enrolments by subject of study 2016/17 available at: https://www.hesa.ac.uk/data-and-analysis/students/table-9.

For the Bank that means identifying a pipeline of future leaders with a diverse and broad set of experiences and pushing them in order to prepare themselves for bigger roles.  Last year for internal appointments, the Bank introduced pooled (or co-ordinated) recruitment for senior appointments. Governors and Executive Directors come together to assess the roles available with the candidates that have applied to try and find the best fit for each team, and for the institution as a whole. This allows us to take a birds-eye view of diversity, rather than appointing in isolation, which risks reinforcing homogeneity in our senior appointments. Pooling our appointments makes everyone realise how their decision impacts the diversity of the whole organisation and helps to highlight the characteristics and skills that may be missing or overrepresented in the senior leadership.  And it provides real time feedback if someone’s career is being held back by gaps in their experience or training.  Pooled recruitment catalyses the creation of essential development plans that prepare colleagues for future roles.  Since its inception, over half of the 15 promotions to Head of Division level between May 2018 and February 2019 using this pooled recruitment were women.  An important aspect of successful job applications and interviews is being able to demonstrate personal development. For too long at the Bank, the opportunities to broaden skills and experience were granted on an informal basis to those who either knew about the opportunity or were recommended by a colleague. This tended to further reinforce homogeneity in senior leadership. In 2017, to level the playing field we launched an internal “opportunities” board.  This connects people who need help with a short-term project to those able to offer it. Since we launched the site two years ago, 700 opportunities, from speech research to  short-term holiday cover have been advertised across the organisation.  The Bank has also created a ‘high potential’ talent pipeline, which has 50% female representation, and coupled this with new approaches to development support. Our new sponsorship programme connects a high potential candidate and senior colleague to help sponsees identify assignments and opportunities to hone their skills and increase their experience. The pilot consisted of 19 colleagues, 84% of whom were female at the scale just below senior management. Building on this success, we have extended the programme and 80% of colleagues in the second phase are female.   As well as sponsorship the Bank recognises that mentoring (both formal and informal) can have a positive impact on an individual’s confidence to progress their careers. That’s why we launched our One Bank Mentoring Scheme in 2017 and ensured it is open to all staff. Between June 2018 and February this year we had 477 mentee applications, of whom 60% were women.

That is why executive leadership and communication on diversity is important. At the Bank, our Chief Operating Officer, Joanna Place has the prescribed responsibility for diversity under the Senior Managers Regime. She is accountable for organisation-wide progress against the Bank’s diversity targets and each and every Deputy Governor is expected to get involved with diversity initiatives.  Changing culture requires both leadership and embedded structural change. When the most senior people in the Bank demonstrate our core values - inclusive, collaborative, empowering, decisive and open - in their everyday work, it becomes easier to make the required changes in all layers of the organisation. With our senior leadership stepping up and both promoting and living the diversity agenda, we have been able to embed these values directly into the performance assessments and pay of all colleagues.  As you may have experienced, one of the problems in finance can be bonus cultures based on self-promotion rather than objective metrics, a culture of presenteeism over flexible working, and de facto penalties imposed for maternity leave.  Let me explain how the Bank addresses each of these in turn.  First, the Bank has implemented a performance management process that promotes objectivity. Colleagues are invited to have conversations with managers ahead of performance evaluation meetings. The Bank has also disposed of fixed distribution curves for performance ratings, making the process less adversarial. We also published clear guidelines internally on what is used to assess and reach a judgement on performance and how pay is awarded against different measures.  Second, an inclusive culture recognises that work can be done in many ways; and that our best ideas can occur at any time and in any place. 14% of our staff are employed on a formalised flexible working arrangement, including remote working. And more men and senior management (almost one in five) than ever before have taken up flexible working arrangements at the Bank.  We have also recently completed a technology update to enable more ad-hoc flexible working arrangements for all colleagues.  This approach has proved its worth as two thirds of colleagues at the Bank agreed in our survey last year that there was a good balance between their work and personal life, five percentage points higher than the national average. This is especially important as nearly two fifths of university graduate cite good work life balance as the main thing they look for in an employer.  Third, the Bank encourages shared paternity leave and over the last year, 59 colleagues took up the offer, compared to 187 people on maternity leave. We have a generous pay package of six months at full pay and

Colleagues are given ten Keep In touch (KIT) days and are offered IT equipment to take home during maternity leave to enable them to maintain contact with the Bank and ease their eventual return to work. The Bank has been successful in retaining female talent, with the Bank’s maternity returner rate at almost 90% over the past few years.   What gets measured gets managed: be transparent about progress  Building an inclusive culture is impossible without transparency.10  In recent years, important strides have been made on transparency around the gender pay gap. Transparency delivers accountability and in making this information public, the sector must acknowledge the work it has to do to close the gap. In the financial sector, the average mean pay gap at banks and building societies is 35% and 31% in insurance companies. For the Bank, the mean gender pay gap is better than the industry average at 20%. The gap is driven by the difference between male and female representation at senior levels. This is not an excuse. As I hope I have demonstrated, the Bank is making strides to close this gap in a fair and sustainable manner that empowers all colleagues at the Bank. Nonetheless, the disclosure helps everyone to track progress and hold the Bank to account. To that end, HR publishes diversity metrics by division every quarter. The internal committee of Governors as well as the Court of Directors (the equivalent of our Board) regularly review and discuss the Bank-wide and divisional figures to identify areas for improvement.  In 2018 we were also one of the first organisations to conduct and publish a special Cognitive Diversity Survey to gain a better understanding of how our colleagues feel about working at the Bank. The survey measured seven inclusivity metrics including interpersonal interactions, flexible working, communication with leaders as well as recruitment and promotion, and results are cut across twelve different aspects of diversity. Our results indicate colleagues are generally positive about inclusiveness at the Bank on every metric measured by the survey. 80% of colleagues in our annual employee survey reported that the Bank takes diversity seriously, seven percentage points higher than the UK average. And 87% of Bank colleagues say they are treated with respect as an individual, six percentage points higher than the UK average. These survey results and the progress against our targets are encouraging, but there is always more to do.  And diversity is, of course, about more than gender, including ethnicity, age, disability, sexual orientation and socio-economic background. The steps that we have taken to improve gender diversity and the lessons we learn from the industry are supporting the Bank’s approach to increase diversity and inclusion more broadly.                                                       10 Women in Finance, House of Commons Treasury Committee, Fifteenth Report of Session 2017 – 19.

Without delaying the awards any longer, let me leave you with three reflections that sum up what the Bank of England has learned from its experience of promoting diversity and inclusion.   First, in a world of division, fusion will bring breakthroughs. Diversity delivers value, but it is also, quite simply the right thing to do. So select your teams wisely and recognise that while diversity is a reality, inclusion is a choice that we should all take. Second, developing the right people requires a culture of inclusion that values diverse ideas, encourages open debate, and empowers people at all levels to take initiative. These efforts must be purposeful and coordinated. Third, we’re all in this together. Share your experiences; if something has worked well in your organisation afford others the opportunity to try it in theirs.    Finally, we should take opportunities to celebrate successful achievements of women in finance and of the men and women who have given their time and effort as we strive to achieve equality. These are the role models for the next generation.   
26.09.2019| Frankfurt am Main | Jens Weidmann  1 IntroductionGovernor Villeroy de Galhau, dear François,Ladies and gentlemen, dear colleagues,It is my great pleasure to give you all a warm welcome to this get-together at the Bundesbank guest house to set the tone for our joint conference with the Banque de France on household expectations.In the early 20th century, the world was stunned. Wilhelm von Osten, a German mathematics teacher, presented a horse which appeared to be able to correctly perform arithmetic calculations. The horse, called “Kluger Hans” (or “Clever Hans”), could also read the clock, form sentences and reply to other questions, giving answers by tapping his hoof. A public commission was set up to study this intelligent animal, but could ﬁnd no evidence of a hoax. It was a young researcher who eventually discovered what was going on. After years of training, “Clever Hans” was able to identify tiny changes in the questioners’ facial expressions that unintentionally signalled the expected behaviour. Without facial contact, the horse could not perform any of the tasks. This shows that observers’ expectations can impact the observation.Expectations matter Welcoming remarks at the Joint Conference on Household Expectations  1 Introduction2 Taking different inﬂation expectations into account3 Gaining deeper insights from household surveys4 Conclusion[1]
Similarly, our economies are not just mechanical systems combining labour input, capital and technology: they are also driven by our expectations. At least since John Muth introduced the concept of rational expectations in 1961, it has been the case that expectations of economic agents play a key role for both economic theory and policy. After the experience of stagﬂation in the 1970s, central banks around the world today acknowledge the importance of anchoring inﬂation expectations and preserving the credibility of monetary policy. This is also reﬂected in estimates of the Phillips curve which demonstrate that inﬂation expectations are one of the key determinants of actual inﬂation.2 Taking different inflation expectations into accountHowever, there is the question of whose inﬂation expectations matter to monetary policy and which indicators should be monitored. In terms of inﬂation pressures arising from labour and goods markets, it would be appropriate to consider inﬂation expectations across ﬁrms and households which are engaged in these markets. Economic experts, meanwhile, may be better informed about monetary policy and central bank intentions. And their forecasts could also provide guidance to other agents. In contrast to such survey-based indicators, high-frequency data on expectations can be extracted from ﬁnancial market indicators such as swap rates or break-even inﬂation rates. However, such measures may combine expectations with preferences of investors. As a result, indicators extracted from market prices may deviate from expected inﬂation from surveys. Moreover, market prices may include liquidity premia which blur the picture.Recently, the ﬁve-year inﬂation-linked swap rate ﬁve years ahead has dropped considerably in the euro area. By contrast, long-term inﬂation expectations in the ECBSurvey of Professional Forecasters, for instance, have remained more stable, while qualitative consumer expectations as expressed in the European Commission’s survey are virtually unchanged.According to ECB calculations, the recent drop in market-based indicators reﬂects, ﬁrst and foremost, a fall in the inﬂation risk premium, rather than in expected inﬂation.As possible reasons, Bundesbank analysis points to differences in liquidity and scarcity premia across bonds. Furthermore, the behaviour of speciﬁc groups of investors might have contributed to recent developments. For example, life insurers and pension funds may face higher risks of interest rate changes arising from their liabilities, as bond yields drop. They could respond by investing more heavily in longer-dated bonds, thereby aggravating the decline in yields and affecting market-based indicators of inﬂation expectations.[2][3][4]
Overall, such market-based measures are probably not representative at present, and below the inﬂation expectations relevant for our monetary policy. This episode highlights that the various indicators have different advantages and shortcomings.In general, they should not be viewed as substitutes, but used instead as complementary information.3 Gaining deeper insights from household surveysUnfortunately, we still lack frequent, detailed and quantitative data on inﬂation expectations of households and ﬁrms. There are diﬃculties involved in implementing surveys at the ﬁrm level. In particular, it is hard to identify and reach those persons within a company who are involved in price and wage setting. Surveys of households are more straightforward to implement, and have been studied by academics and central bankers for quite some time. Moreover, recent work by Yuriy Gorodnichenko and our keynote speaker Olivier Coibion has shown that household surveys can, in some instances, provide better information about ﬁrms’ expectations than professional forecasts or market-based inﬂation expectations. For example, disagreement among ﬁrms about macroeconomic prospects resembles the dispersion of expectations among households in terms of its size, persistence and asymmetry.But household expectations are also of direct importance to the monetary transmission process. Households’ inﬂation expectations, for instance, are related to their purchase intentions and can therefore affect private consumption. Furthermore, household expectations on economic variables other than inﬂation are also relevant to central banks. If conducted at the national level, additional household surveys could focus on and detect idiosyncratic features. In particular, such data may matter for the national mandate of macroprudential policy.In order to gain a more comprehensive picture, the Bundesbank has carried out a pilot study for an internet-based household survey on a monthly basis. The focus lies on consumer expectations regarding inﬂation and developments in the real estate market. The ﬁeld phase was completed in July. In two sessions of this conference, the ﬁndings from several studies by internal and external researchers based on the pilot’s data will be presented to a specialist audience for the ﬁrst time.As an appetiser, I have the privilege of giving you a sneak peek at key results from core questions of the pilot survey in advance: First, the median of inﬂation expectations over a twelve-month horizon is 2% in all three survey waves. That is lower than in similar USsurveys and indicates that German consumers’ inﬂation expectations are well-anchored. Second, only a small fraction of individuals in Germany – namely 3% to 4% – expect inﬂation to fall. And the share of very high inﬂation expectations is also relatively small. Overall, results vary across socio-demographic categories such as income or the level of [5][6][7]
education in ways consistent with previous studies. Third, most individuals in Germany think that house prices will continue to rise sharply. Roughly 70% of those questioned answered that they already consider real estate in their neighbourhood to be overvalued; nonetheless, more than half of these persons expect prices to rise further. Fourth, tenants predict stronger house price increases than owners. This interesting difference is consistent with results from our Panel on Household Finances (PHF).The Bundesbank already conducts the PHF survey of German household wealth and debt every three years – in 2017, almost 5,000 households participated. In this third wave, the PHF questionnaire was expanded in some areas to include questions on house price expectations, for example. The PHF surveys and the recent pilot study have allowed the Bundesbank to acquire expertise and experience. Going forward, we would very much welcome cooperation with the Banque de France on a high-frequency survey focusing on household expectations. In addition, the ECB has recently started to develop a new consumer expectations survey. According to the announcement, a pilot survey will soon be implemented. Aside from serving practical purposes within central banks, additional surveys on household expectations would also help to promote research. The US is clearly ahead in this ﬁeld, and an important question is whether the results obtained there would also be valid for other countries.4 ConclusionLadies and gentlemen, the discovery of the “Clever Hans phenomenon” was a major breakthrough for experimental psychology and led to further research on the effects of expectations. For example, evidence was found that teachers’ expectations could have an impact on students’ performance. More generally, “Clever Hans” may highlight the importance of designing experiments properly in order to avoid biased results. Of course, our researchers also took this lesson to heart when they devised their pilot study. By resorting to an internet-based survey, they have effectively eliminated any possible impact of face-to-face contact.To conclude, I wish you a pleasant evening and a fruitful conference. And, ﬁnally, I am very glad to open this joint event together with Governor Villeroy de Galhau.

For release on delivery 12:00 p.m. EDT September 26, 2019        Government of Union: Achieving Certainty in Cross-Border Finance     Remarks by  Randal K. Quarles  Vice Chair for Supervision  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System  Chair  Financial Stability Board  at  Financial Stability Board Workshop on Pre-Positioning, Ring-Fencing, and Market Fragmentation  Philadelphia, Pennsylvania        September 26, 2019  
Regulatory and supervisory colleagues, members of the Financial Stability Board’s (FSB) Resolution Steering Group (ReSG) and Standing Committee on Supervisory and Regulatory Cooperation (SRC), representatives from academia, and the private sector:  Thank you for being here, and for taking part in today’s workshop on pre-positioning, ring-fencing, and market fragmentation.  I particularly want to thank Ryozo Himino, our new SRC chair, for his leadership in highlighting these issues; his remarks and efforts around market fragmentation are especially timely, as we begin the difficult task of examining the post-crisis reforms.  I also want to recognize and thank Sir Jon Cunliffe, for proposing a workshop where we can explore these issues together; as he recently said, quoting Ben Franklin, “we must all hang together, or most assuredly, we shall all hang separately.”1  Finally, I want to thank the leadership and staff of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, for not just accommodating us, but making us feel welcome in the nation’s first capital.2  The Philadelphia Fed is three blocks north, and another three west, from the birthplace of American central banking.  That birthplace is not the site of the First or Second Banks of the United States, whose neoclassical headquarters are still standing and open to the public.3  Instead, the first national bank sat just west of North 3rd Street and Chestnut: the Bank of North America.4                                                  1 John Bartlett, Familiar Quotations (10th ed., 1919), https://www.bartleby.com/100/245.21.html. 2 U.S. Senate, “The Nine Capitals of the United States” (citing Robert Fortenbaugh, The Nine Capitals of the United States (1948), at 9), https://www.senate.gov/reference/reference_item/Nine_Capitals_of_the_United_States.htm. 3 National Park Service, “First Bank of the United States” (October 18, 2016), https://www.nps.gov/inde/learn/historyculture/places-firstbank.htm; National Park Service, “Second Bank of the United States” (April 12, 2017), https://www.nps.gov/inde/learn/historyculture/places-secondbank.htm. 4 Library of Congress, “Bank of North America, 305-307 Chestnut Street, Philadelphia, Philadelphia County, PA” (documentation compiled after 1933), https://www.loc.gov/item/pa1098/. 
 - 2 - Its charter came from a new nation on the verge of bankruptcy.5  Six years of war had drained an already-short supply of domestic specie, a necessity for international trade.  So little specie remained in the treasury that the “continentals,” used to finance the war, had depreciated to about two cents on the dollar.  The United States lacked a common, sound currency to settle its debts, and without federal authority to levy taxes, it lacked a ready path back to solvency.  (Another Franklin quote applies:  “Glass, China, and Reputation, are easily crack’d, and never well mended.”6) In desperation, the Founding Fathers made a successful Philadelphia merchant, Robert Morris, their new superintendent of finance.  Drawing on a plan from Alexander Hamilton, Morris proposed a new institution, with the power to issue notes backed by $400,000 in private capital.  When it could muster only a fraction of that in subscriptions, the country turned overseas.  A substantial loan in French bullion financed the new bank and saved the republic from collapse.  America could declare independence, but she could not secure it without credit from abroad. That lesson was both hard earned and short-lived.  Four years later, a new Pennsylvania legislature claimed that dividends to foreign creditors were draining much-needed specie from America’s shores.  James Wilson, Pennsylvania’s representative to the Continental Congress, wrote an impassioned legal and political defense of the bank, emphasizing its role in international commerce.  He quoted Sir James Steuart, one of the world’s first economists, calling banking “that branch of credit which best deserves the                                                  5 This account is derived from Edward S. Kaplan, The Bank of the United States and the American Economy (1999), at 3-10, and from Janet Wilson, “The Bank of North America and Pennsylvania Politics: 1781-1787,” 66(1) Penn.

 - 3 - attention of a statesman.”7  It wasn’t enough.  The charter was repealed—a pattern that would repeat with two more national banks, with even more disruptive results.8 International banking is a very different enterprise than two centuries ago, but it still “best deserves the attention of a statesman.”  Cross-border finance is an essential part of the international economic infrastructure.  It is a conduit to direct financial resources to their most efficient use, regardless of national borders.  It channels capital to places and projects it could not otherwise reach, fostering innovation, international ties, and the exchange of ideas.  At its best, it is also self-sustaining, extending the financial and technical capacity of emerging economies, and expanding their role in the global economy.  America’s experience, however, reminds us that the benefits of international banking are not automatic.  Cross-border finance is a common good, and like any common good, sustaining it requires collective action from a range of parties.9  These parties are both public and private, elected and appointed—not just central banks and supervisors, but finance ministries, legislatures, and commercial banking organizations.  Each has a distinct mission and a duty to serve a distinct set of stakeholders.  When those duties conflict, trust alone cannot sustain cooperation; only a careful configuration that                                                  7 James Wilson, Considerations on the Bank of North-America (1785) (quoting Sir James Steuart, An Inquiry into the Principles of Political Oeconomy [sic]: Being an Essay on the Science of Domestic Policy in Free Nations, in which are particularly considered Population, Agriculture, Trade, Industry, Money, Coin, Interest, Circulation, Banks, Exchange, Public Credit, and Taxes,” Vol. 2 (1770), at 358).  Supporters also produced more popular literature.  In a satire in the Pennsylvania Gazette, a critic of the bank complains:  “All honest men should support their country, by cheating their creditors:  Creditors are the bane of a young country:  So here is confusion to them all—a tender-law forever!”  Janet Wilson, supra note 5, at 12 quoting Pennsylvania Gazette (September 21, 1785). 8 Unlike its successors, the bank’s headquarters no longer stands; it was demolished sometime after 1959.

 - 4 - recognizes mutual and separate interests can do so.  With such a configuration, the cross-border financial system can be open, stable, and safe; without it, the system can become unpredictable and dangerous. “Ring-fencing” often serves as a catch-all for this dynamic, capturing any and all impediments to the free flow of finance, however and whenever they arise.  However, as I have noted previously, that term obscures a distinction that plays a vital role in cross-border finance—between prudently placing a constrained amount of capital and liquidity within jurisdictions and legal entities before a crisis, and competitively seizing capital and liquidity during a crisis.  This distinction determines more than just the possibility of an orderly cross-border resolution.  Pre-positioning of resources—when properly calibrated—can also provide the certainty that lets cross-border finance occur at all. Certainty is the critical ingredient in achieving the careful configuration of interests I described.  Financial institutions need some certainty about the requirements they face by participating in cross-border activity.  Supervisors need some certainty about safety and soundness, not just of the foreign banks they host, but of their domestic banks operating overseas.  Creditors and investors need some certainty that a foreign authority won’t abrogate their contracts.  Elected officials need certainty that their constituents are not unfairly disadvantaged.  All these parties—and the public—need some certainty that the resources promised to them won’t disappear at the first sign of stress. Certainty fosters financial stability.  It supports clear monitoring and thoughtful planning, by both institutions and their regulators.  It signals the clear intention of authorities to cooperate, during normal times and in an emergency.  It increases the odds that a cross-border financial institution will keep operating through a crisis.  It fosters 
 - 5 - more and deeper cross-border financial activity, by decreasing its risks and increasing its benefits, both to participants and to the global economy.  Certainty does require tradeoffs.  None of us has perfect foresight.  If we pursue certainty to the complete exclusion of any flexibility to respond to future events, we may end up undermining our ultimate goal: maintaining a financial system that is resilient to unexpected shocks. However, this workshop begins by revisiting the consequences when certainty disappears.  These consequences were on full display during the financial crisis—the collapse in cross-border activity, when trust broke down; the rush to secure assets and prioritize domestic claims; the ambiguous relationship between banks’ resources and their needs; and the long, halting return to a more integrated financial system.  Today’s panelists will also revisit the steps that the international community took to address those consequences.  The workshop also examines the effect those steps have had on cross-border financial intermediation and the management of global financial institutions.  The panelists will provide their views on whether we have achieved the right balance among certainty, the kinds of economic opportunity that cross-border finance promotes, and the flexibility to manage through a future disruption. This decade-long account is the latest chapter in a much older story, whose moral is clear: in regulating cross-border finance, expectations matter.  When capital and liquidity requirements are imposed only at the level of the consolidated institution, they create a good deal of flexibility, but they cannot reassure host supervisors that sufficient resources will truly be available in a time of need.  Opaque, vague, and uncertain requirements for pre-positioning and reporting, and lack of clarity on when they may be 
 - 6 - imposed, make compliance difficult, costly, and potentially disruptive.  Pre-positioning, at levels that go beyond what may be needed in a given jurisdiction in stress, can also create rigidity and limit growth opportunities.  The consequence of getting the balance between these considerations wrong is a less integrated and less resilient global financial system.   These details are as complex as they are important, and I commend my FSB colleagues, particularly the ReSG, for exploring them in the context of the too-big-to-fail reforms.10  The FSB’s work brings together a wide range of experts to better understand the intent, implementation, and effects of our post-crisis work.  As with market fragmentation, the broader context of this work matters immensely, including the desired impact of the reforms and their anticipated and unanticipated consequences. Within the Federal Reserve Board, we are considering similar questions—not only what level of loss-absorbing capacity is appropriate for the material legal entities within a large, cross-border financial institution, but also what tools we and other supervisors use to ensure such capacity exists.  The roles that supervision and regulation play in addressing these issues are important.  There are clear advantages to setting liquidity and capital pre-positioning requirements through regulation.  Regulation ensures consistency and clarity; provides a conduit for improvement, through public notice and comment; and offers a clear rational basis for any measures imposed.  There is also a role for supervision, not just in addressing the particular conditions at a given firm, but in generating and sharing better                                                  10 Financial Stability Board, “FSB launches evaluation of too-big-to-fail reforms and invites feedback from stakeholders,” news release (May 23, 2019), https://www.fsb.org/2019/05/fsb-launches-evaluation-of-too-big-to-fail-reforms-and-invites-feedback-from-stakeholders/.

More information sharing by home to host supervisors may help convince host supervisors that they need fewer pre-positioned resources in their jurisdiction. Today’s workshop is a worthy step forward in discussing these issues, and towards preserving and expanding the benefits of cross-border finance.  We are all ultimately responsible for creating the conditions where capital can flow freely, giving rise to genuine opportunity and sustainable growth.  We should patiently and thoughtfully examine how best to create those conditions.

TMThe euro-area economy and the recent monetary policy decisionsSpeech by Ignazio Visco Governor of the Bank of ItalyGiornate di economia “Marcello De Cecco” Lanciano (Italy), 28 September 2019First of all, thank you for your kind invitation to take part in this panel on “Europe for All” which concludes this second day of the “Giornate di economia” in memory of Marcello De Cecco. Marcello followed the ECB Governing Council’s decisions and the related analyses and discussions with great interest and with the acumen for which he was known. Today I would like to touch upon three points: 1) the monetary policy decisions that we have just taken; 2) the economic analyses behind them; and 3) the debate concerning, and our assessment of, the effectiveness of the various measures that were adopted.1. At its September meeting the ECB Governing Council introduced a very broad package of expansionary measures. It lowered the interest rate on deposits that banks make with the Eurosystem (the deposit facility), which has been in negative territory since June 2014, by 10 basis points to -0.5 per cent. It decided to restart net asset purchases at a monthly pace of €20 billion beginning in November, after they were interrupted in December of last year, when they amounted to €2,600 billion since their launch at the end of 2014. It relaxed the terms of its new series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III) compared with those of the June decision by lowering their cost (to -0.5 or 0.0 per cent depending on the lending performance of the individual banks) and by extending their maturity (from two to three years). It introduced a zero interest rate, as opposed to a negative interest rate, on part of the banks’ liquidity reserves (“tiering”) to attenuate the risk, feared by some observers, that increasingly negative interest rates on the deposit facility could have counterproductive effects on banks’ balance sheets and, in turn, on lending.In addition, we have strengthened our forward guidance concerning the future path of monetary policy, signalling our expectation to keep the key ECB interest rates at their present or lower values until inflation gets to a level consistently close to 2 per cent over the medium term.
22. These decisions were not made in haste: they are the natural conclusion to the analyses started quite some time ago by the Governing Council and, taken together, are an appropriate and proportional response to the worsening macroeconomic outlook for the euro area. In previous meetings, there was already broad agreement that the outlook for economic activity and prices was disappointing. In July, we reiterated our determination to intervene decisively if the medium-term inflation outlook failed to improve. Over the last few months, the signs of economic slowdown and weakening inflation have instead intensified. Geopolitical tensions, including those relating to trade tariffs, and the sharp decline in international trade recorded in the last few quarters have continued to weigh on firms’ confidence, on investment and on industrial production. The assessments of those who, one year ago, expected that the weakening in economic activity would prove temporary and would eventually subside have been shown to be increasingly optimistic.The slowdown was substantial for German and, though less so, Italian industrial production, but it would be naïve to underestimate its scope by considering it an asymmetric shock. If the worsening in the manufacturing sector proves to be persistent, it will inevitably reverberate across the other sectors of the economy. This is confirmed by the most recent data, which point to an area-wide slowdown in activity in the service sector, especially in Germany.In a slowing economy, it is no surprise that inflation has remained very moderate and well below the objective of a close to 2 per cent annual increase in consumer prices in the euro area; even with all the margins of uncertainty, the forecasts indicate that inflation is expected to remain weak over the next two years. We must counter the significant risk that the economic slowdown and the low level of inflation translate into a permanent reduction in inflation expectations or a re-emergence of the threat of deflation. The analyses conducted by the Bank of Italy clearly demonstrate this risk, regardless of the measure of expected inflation used: similar trends have been observed in the expectations derived from the financial markets, which may be affected by excessive reactivity on the part of investors, and in those obtained from surveys of professional forecasters, firms and households.A very recent study by Bank of Italy economists finds that the medium- and long-term inflation expectations in the ECB’s Survey of Professional Forecasters are now much more susceptible to negative surprises to current inflation than they were in the past. This is a finding that confirms the one that our researchers had already obtained based on inflation expectations derived from inflation swaps. By all measures, in recent months, expectations have remained far from the objective of price stability; they increased slightly in the spring, but then turned down again.The Governing Council deemed it necessary to respond promptly to the worsening economic situation, in order to reiterate its intention to confront weakening aggregate demand and its effects on prices, to not fall behind the curve and to counter low inflation expectations with determination. The global financial crisis and the sovereign debt crisis 
23have taught us that in these circumstances excessive prudence is counterproductive: by not responding swiftly to the risks of too low inflation for too long, a lengthier and more incisive measure, which carries greater risks of unintended side effects, is then needed to counter the risk of deflation. 3. There was extensive discussion in the Governing Council on the decisions and measures to introduce; of course, opinions varied and some reservations were expressed regarding certain individual instruments and some of their characteristics. The package of measures adopted received the approval of a majority of the members of the Governing Council. The analyses conducted by the Bank of Italy indicate that there is no reason to doubt their overall effectiveness.In the current circumstances, uncertainty about the effects of the individual instruments is naturally widespread, but our analyses suggest that the purchase programme is, in the present conditions, the most effective instrument (aside from being the most “conventional” one, given that open market operations have always featured in central bankers’ “toolbox”). Our estimates suggest that the impact of the new purchases on economic activity and on inflation, through the contraction of term premia and the transmission to the yields of all financial assets, can be much bigger today than that of a cut in the official rates. From a conceptual and empirical perspective, there is no reason to rule out the possibility of further contractions in term premia, which in any event had already occurred with the consolidation of expectations of the new measures.As I have often observed, the effects of a reduction in official rates to negative values – the truly “unconventional” instrument among those introduced so far by the Governing Council – are surrounded by greater uncertainty. We estimate that so far, the cuts in the reference rates have had significant expansionary effects; down the road, however, their effectiveness could prove more doubtful, especially in view of the downwards rigidity of interest rates on deposits.In any event, it should not be forgotten that the persistence of negative nominal interest rates across a broad spectrum of maturities for lengthy periods cannot be attributed solely to the decisions of central banks, which react to macroeconomic conditions, but rather reflects the enduring underlying weakness of the economy and a possible market response to a resurgence of Fisherian debt deflation. We are still quite far from the “normal” economic conditions to which we ought to return (also in view of the structural factors that could explain lower growth rates worldwide than in recent decades). The introduction of a two-tier system for bank reserve remuneration – which was also adopted in other jurisdictions – is intended to prevent the reduction in official rates to negative values from having, beyond a certain level, the undesirable side effect of impairing banks’ ability to grant credit and, therefore, from being transformed into a restrictive factor. Nevertheless, encouraging greater trading between banks seeking higher returns on their liquidity may spark tensions on money market rates, a risk that is countered by the calibration chosen but one which must still be carefully monitored.
4In its forward guidance, the Governing Council confirmed its determination to respond symmetrically to inflation developments, in other words to intervene when inflation falls below the target with the same determination as when it rises above it. The aim is to avoid a further downward revision of inflation expectations, or the resurfacing of the deflation risks we successfully countered three years ago, whilst simultaneously guaranteeing financial conditions capable of supporting the economic cycle.Monetary policy resolutely pursues the objective of price stability. To achieve the maximum benefits from our action, the Governing Council unanimously agrees that, given the slowdown in production and the significant downside risks that weigh on the outlook, fiscal policy must make a more incisive contribution to strengthening aggregate demand. During this phase, the countries that have room to intervene can play an important stabilizing role; those with a high public debt must prioritize a rebalancing of expenditure towards measures that are better able to support growth, such as public investment, and to reduce the tax burden on businesses and employment. *    *    *In conclusion, I think that the package of measures we adopted was necessary and appropriate to counter the cyclical risks and the weak inflation outlook, and fully in line with our previous decisions. In the past, I have always avoided giving my opinion of monetary policy decisions immediately after Governing Council meetings. I have decided to do so today, a few weeks after the last decisions were taken, mainly because of the recent media attention given to the discussion that followed that meeting.Intense and detailed internal discussions on the monetary policy options are indispensable, and always take place. Many observers have wondered whether the dissemination of comments immediately following a common decision is a practice that is counterproductive, useful or even necessary. We can debate the merits of introducing at the ECB the procedure followed by other central banks, where, following their monetary policy meetings, they publish the positions of the participants (as well as the reasons for any disagreements). This solution, which I personally find appropriate, was at one point considered but then rejected by the Governing Council.In his remarkable scientific output, as in his numerous articles for the public at large, Marcello De Cecco always highlighted the close ties between geopolitical issues and economic events. It is interesting today to go back and read one of his last articles published in Affari e Finanza at the end of 2015. It dealt with the decision adopted by the ECB Governing Council in December of that year to expand asset purchases. Just as happened a few days ago, a member of the Council had publicly expressed disagreement with that decision; I am not sure that today the disagreement regarding the possible results of that decision would have been expressed quite so forcefully. I do not think that the comments made by some Governors at the end of the Governing Council meeting were guided by preconceived ideas or by political considerations, as Marcello seemed to think was the case back then, nor were they guided by an abstract 
45division into “hawks” and “doves” as the press sometimes likes to believe. I am sure that these comments reflect the genuine conviction of Council members about the most useful measures for the euro-area economy. However, in the institutional context of the Economic and Monetary Union, it is still important to avoid the risk that, also due to the extemporaneous nature of the remarks made, the positions of the individual Council members be interpreted as an expression of national perspectives or interests, rather than as relating to the area as a whole. For this reason, I believe we all need to work to make our decision-making process as transparent as possible.
TMSustainable development and climate risks: the role of central banksSpeech by Ignazio Visco Governor of the Bank of Italy18th International Conference for Credit Risk Evaluation “Assessing and Managing Climate Change Risk: Opportunities for Financial Institutions”Venice, 26 September 2019First of all, let me thank the conference organizers for setting up this important event and for their kind invitation. Today’s remarks are partly based on a speech that I gave in May at the Italian Alliance for Sustainable Development (ASVIS).I would like to start by noting that the issue of the compatibility between natural resources and the development goals of nations has been studied since at least the end of the 18th century, with the works of Thomas Malthus on food supply and population growth. It has then re-emerged a number of times in the public debate.The less young among us may recall, for example, the simulations produced for the project of the Club of Rome on the “Predicament of Mankind” – The Limits to Growth – in the early 1970s. These simulations came in the wake of a worldwide demographic explosion and set off a global alarm signalling the risks to the survival of our ecosystems and of the human race itself. At that time, it was observed that the depletion of natural resources resulting from the simulations, largely based on the extrapolation of the trend under way, did not take sufficient account of two important mechanisms that regulate the functioning of the economy: the rebalancing power of prices and the endogenous nature of technological change. When the resources used in production become scarcer, an increase in prices discourages demand; at the same time, higher prices provide an incentive to search for new production methods that utilize fewer of those resources.Over the last few decades, the biggest concern has been in relation to the effects of climate change. Is this concern different from that of the past? One key difference compared with the issue of the depletion of natural resources is that, in the case of climate change, there are no “natural” market prices. Climate change is, in fact, a classic example of a negative externality: a cost that spills over onto other markets besides the one in which it originated. In addition, as pointed out by William Nordhaus in his Nobel 
2lecture, climate change is a particularly thorny externality owing to its global nature, which puts it outside the domain not only of markets but also of national governments.The dangers of climate change, its close link with the emissions of greenhouse gases (including, but not limited to, carbon dioxide) and, in turn, with the human activities of production and consumption, have all been known for some time. For example, Professor Nordhaus himself, who wrote a sharp criticism of the results of the Club of Rome almost 50 years ago, now regards climate change as “a major threat to humans and the natural world” – a concern that is hard not to share. Since his pioneering studies in the mid-1970s on how the climate and the economy co-evolve, which earned him the 2018 Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences, the trend in the emissions of greenhouse gases has continued to be worrisome. In fact, the growing use of fossil fuels is pushing greenhouse gas concentrations to levels that, unless forceful measures are taken, is estimated to lead to an increase in the temperature of the planet ranging from 3 to 5 degrees Celsius by the end of this century. This is well beyond the threshold of 1.5 degrees that, if surpassed, would bring potentially catastrophic consequences for our planet, according to the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.Some effects are already evident. At the global level, the last four years have been the warmest since 1880; last July was the hottest month on record for our planet. In Italy, the year 2018 recorded the highest average temperature of the past two centuries (the period for which reliable data are available) and 2017 was already characterized by a significant intensification of extreme weather events, with severe cases of drought that had serious repercussions on the water supply.Stopping climate change will require not only a strong political determination and a firm commitment by all countries, but also sustained efforts by all institutions and individuals. Achieving this objective is first and foremost a responsibility of national governments, the only institutions that can provide incentives to allocate capital to “green” investments, levy taxes on carbon emissions, and introduce regulations limiting the amount of allowable emissions. Reaching international agreements on a global carbon tax or on shared targets for emissions also rests within their powers.The difficulties in reducing emissions sufficiently across countries are enormous, as has been evident in the last few years. Therefore, all institutions and individuals should play their part to foster economic growth that is “sustainable” – i.e. that meets current needs without compromising those of future generations (as defined by the UN “Brundtland Commission” in 1987). Public institutions could promote sustainable business practices by envisioning strategies that induce firms to take into account the environment, human rights, consumer rights and diversity, as well as best practices in corporate governance – the so-called Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) profiles.Firms that are successful in adopting appropriate ESG profiles and in adjusting their investments accordingly can expect significant advantages. In fact, the “green” sectors are steadily growing around the globe and in Italy as well. The available data show that the “eco-industrial” sector expanded markedly in our country in recent years: in 2017 
23it contributed 2.3 per cent to total value added, employing nearly 400,000 full-time equivalent workers.Given its central role in the allocation of resources, the financial sector can be key in influencing the scope, speed and smoothness of the transition to a low-emissions economy. However, it can only do so effectively if banks and other financial intermediaries integrate sustainability in their investment decision-making processes, especially in their corporate governance systems and in their risk management and investment strategies.Several challenges, however, lie ahead. Currently, there are neither widely accepted rules for ESG data disclosure by individual firms nor agreed auditing standards to verify the reported data. Moreover, there are intrinsic difficulties in deciding which indicators are relevant in assigning an ESG score – think, for example, of the problem of evaluating the “social” component – especially when compared to financial aggregates, where the key indicators, such as revenues, costs, earnings and cash flows, are widely available and are all auditable items. Apparently, ESG-score providers rely heavily on voluntary disclosure by firms and on subjective methodologies to select, assess and weight individual ESG indicators. This, of course, adds to the arbitrary nature of the scores. As a result, ESG scores of individual firms differ greatly across rating agencies if compared, for example, with credit ratings. According to our studies and in line with the existing literature, the correlation between the ESG scores assigned to the major listed companies in the euro area by three of the main providers ranges from 40 to 60 per cent, compared with a correlation between credit ratings that is over 90 per cent. There is also evidence of significant biases in ESG scores, which tend to overrate the companies that are larger and belong to specific industrial sectors and geographic regions.Central banks may play their part. First of all, with respect to the methodology, they can help to raise awareness and nurture a better understanding of the risks related to the sustainability factors and the channels through which they are transmitted to the financial system. The objective is to make financial intermediaries move from a backward-looking approach to a forward-looking one, prompting them to evaluate the return on their assets over a longer horizon, which entails making assumptions and building scenarios. In this respect, it is important to foster cooperation and the sharing of best practices between the various stakeholders in the financial system, including academia.Secondly, central banks can promote the dissemination of more and better information to bridge the current gaps in the quality, consistency and comparability of available data. Important contributions will be provided by the recommendations of the Financial Stability Board’s Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures and by the taxonomy and the transparency obligations that are being developed within the European Commission’s action plan on sustainable finance. These initiatives point to the setting of standards that, when widely adopted, will facilitate the disclosure of companies’ exposure to environmental risks and the measurement and management of climate-related risks by financial intermediaries. They can also limit the risk of “green washing”, i.e. the unfair use of the “green” label for production activities and financial investments intended to mislead potential customers. This risk is likely to increase with the demand for environmentally safe assets. Improvements in the standardization of 
4data and methodologies will also help to achieve sounder approaches in the issuance of ESG ratings.Central banks can also support the transition to a low-carbon and sustainable growth by leading private investors by example, through the adoption of suitable policies for managing financial resources and the related risks. In this regard, let me describe the recent decisions taken by the Bank of Italy as portfolio manager.This year the Bank has adopted a new investment strategy that integrates ESG factors into the management of its equity portfolio, as described in detail on our website. The principles of diversification and market neutrality already embedded in our previous strategy have been preserved and two ESG criteria have been added. The first discards companies that belong to the sectors, controversial weapons and tobacco, excluded by the United Nations Global Compact (an initiative that requires CEOs to commit to ten sustainability principles in the areas of human rights, labour, the environment and the fight against corruption as well as to take steps to support UN goals). The second gives preference to companies with the best ESG scores, according to the assessment of a carefully selected data provider. As we are aware of the current limits of ESG data, we have done everything we can to make this approach as robust as possible.The resulting portfolio achieves a significant improvement in its environmental footprint. Compared with the composition of the old portfolio, the shareholdings included in the new portfolio are characterized by much lower greenhouse gas emissions (down by 23 per cent) as well as by lower energy and water consumption (by 30 and 17 per cent respectively). These calculations rely on the data disclosed by the companies and, when these are not available, on those estimated by ESG-score providers.Our new investment strategy was adopted after considering and comparing various alternatives. In general, we have found that improving the overall ESG score of the portfolio by dropping the companies with the lowest scores comes at the expense of a slight increase in the ex ante tracking error vis-à-vis the market benchmark, which comprises all the listed non-financial corporations in the euro area. This finding is in line with other empirical studies and with the theoretical argument that constraining diversification opportunities increases the divergence from the standard market benchmark.The effect on the tracking error does not undermine the risk-return profile of our portfolio, mainly because, by filtering for the higher ESG-scored companies, the idiosyncratic component of the portfolio risk tends to diminish. A backward test over a ten-year horizon shows that our new portfolio would have provided, ex post, a better average annual performance in terms of both lower risk and higher return, thereby implying a higher Sharpe ratio compared with the previous portfolio and the market benchmark.The fact that sustainable investment does not appear to penalize financial performance is not necessarily surprising. Several studies confirm that sustainable investment leads to risk-adjusted market returns that are often higher than those achieved using traditional financial models. These empirical findings may be due to a number of factors. First, the ESG risk may have been underestimated in the past, while investors may 
45have not anticipated the higher returns due to the faster-than-average growth of the green sector. Second, in its practical implementation, the traditional risk-return model uses historical time series, which make it backward-looking, whereas the sustainability assessment implies a forward-looking view and, in particular, a long-term view, which could help to mitigate the “short-termism” that usually drives financial investments. Third, good ESG practices seem to provide firms with a competitive advantage stemming from innovation; they also contribute to reducing operating, legal and reputational risks and lead to a more efficient resource allocation (as resources can be shifted from risk management to productive activities), lowering the cost of capital and fostering better operational and market performance.Empirical studies carried out by the Bank of Italy have provided clear evidence of a return premium on the shares of European electricity utilities with lower carbon emissions. Historical experience has offered many examples showing that reputational risks and serious losses for firms and shareholders can arise from business practices that are inappropriate when viewed through the lenses of ESG.As I mentioned, our new portfolio was built in a way that preserves, in particular, the principle of market neutrality. It may be inquired, however, whether this principle should be fully preserved or be “adjusted” in a context in which, in the absence of further regulation, market forces are pushing greenhouse gas concentrations to levels that will soon be unsustainable. I believe that this is an important topic, which warrants further research.A last point that I would like to touch on regards international cooperation. As a result of the increasing concerns about the consequences of climate change, cooperation in the field of sustainable finance has been strengthened, with several initiatives promoted by institutions and industries.In our role as members of the Financial Stability Board, we have discussed the studies of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure and we have contributed to those of the G20 Green Finance Study Group. We also participate in the new Network for Greening the Financial System, which brings together 42 central banks and supervisors and 8 observers from countries responsible for half of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions. Last April the Network released its first report with a list of recommendations on how central banks and supervisors may contribute to the achievement of the Paris objectives. The Network is currently studying, with our active contribution, possible ways to integrate environmental and climate risks into central banks’ portfolio management strategies as well as into micro and macro-prudential supervision.In Europe, the Bank of Italy – together with the other national supervisory authorities – cooperates with the European Banking Authority in studying the risks that sustainability factors pose to financial stability, drafting methodologies to assess these risks and identifying suitable prudential responses. We also take part in the analysis scheduled by the Single Supervisory Mechanism, which has included climate change in its risk map for 2019.
6In Italy, we provide technical assistance to the Italian Ministry of Economy and Finance for the negotiations on the legislative proposals resulting from the European Commission’s action plan on sustainable finance. As part of the Italian Observatory on Sustainable Finance, established by the Ministry of the Environment, last year we conducted a survey of the main financial operators, finding that sustainability is mainly dealt with from a social responsibility point of view. Hence, more has to be done to raise awareness of the potential problems deriving from business strategies and risk management systems.*  *  *Let me conclude by saying that the transition towards an economy with low carbon emissions is essential if we want to reduce the risks that climate change poses to our well-being. Central banks, supervisory authorities and the financial sector cannot stand in for those who can make the policies necessary to decarbonizing our energy systems, but they may offer their contribution to facilitate this process.The Bank of Italy is playing its part. Although further progress is still needed to enhance the reliability of ESG ratings, we have started to introduce sustainability criteria in our investment policy, which is aimed at promoting corporate social responsibility and improving risk management. For the time being, our new investment strategy applies to equity investment; we are currently assessing the possibility of extending it to other asset classes, such as corporate bonds. As we keep working towards further improving the ESG profiles of our portfolio, we will provide regular reports on the results achieved, so that our best practices and our methodologies can serve as a reference for other investors. In our capacity as supervisory authority, we are actively committed to raising the awareness of the financial sector and of the public at large about these issues as well as to working jointly with other institutions to better understand how to measure and address these new risks.It is in the interest of financial intermediaries to be fully aware of how sustainability factors can affect their activities: it would make it easier for them to take into account the corresponding risks in their strategies and governance, thereby helping to improve their performance. Central banks and supervisory authorities are working to prepare  the financial system to face this transition. Greater use of green financial instruments will be fostered by the EU taxonomy of environmentally sustainable activities, the introduction of labelling schemes (especially the standards for green bonds), a wider uptake of the new low-carbon benchmarks, and the forthcoming application of the new rules on disclosure. All these factors will bolster data standardization and foster comparability.Italian investors have expressed considerable interest in sustainable finance in recent years, but the supply is still not sufficient to satisfy demand. Companies that provide the necessary information on the sustainability of their activities will be able to exploit the room that seems to be available for the financing of their projects. By doing so, they will also contribute to the development of a green financial market, which is still in its infancy. The battle to arrest climate change is under way: winning it requires the effort of each of us. Thank you for your attention.

Luis de Guindos: Concluding remarks - "Inflation in a changingeconomic environment"Concluding remarks by Mr Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the European Central Bank, at theECB conference “Inflation in a changing economic environment”, Frankfurt am Main, 24September 2019.*   *   *IntroductionYou have now been discussing issues related to inflation for two days, covering a wide variety oftopics. Conferences of this kind are very helpful to us as central bankers, as they enable us toadvance our thinking about policy-relevant questions, particularly if they are related to our coremandate. In concluding this conference, let me say a few words about economic slack in theeuro area and the wage-inflation pass-through. I think these are interesting topics at the moment,because, as you know, euro area inflation has been persistently low for several years, and morerecently we have observed some decoupling of wage inflation from price inflation.Current situationEuro area consumer price inflation currently stands at 1% (August 2019, year-on-year HICPinflation) and is thus considerably below our inflation aim. Unfortunately, this low inflation hasbeen a persistent phenomenon. Since November 2011, when euro area inflation peaked at 3%(year-on-year HICP inflation), the average rate has been less than 1.2% per annum.Long-term inflation expectations are also low. Market-based indicators are stagnating athistorically low levels. The five-year five-year inflation-linked swap rate has been hovering around1.25% in recent weeks. Survey-based measures have also fallen recently, to 1.7%. While thesenumbers are higher than those for market-based indicators, we shouldn’t take comfort fromthem. International evidence shows that survey expectations can react very slowly to persistentlylow inflation (as was the case in Japan, for example).Wage inflation, on the other hand, has behaved quite differently to consumer price inflation. Since2017, wage inflation, as measured by compensation per employee, has overtaken consumerprice inflation, peaking at 2.4% in the third quarter of 2018.These developments raise important questions. Is the euro area economy hitting its capacityconstraints? Or is there still economic slack that is holding headline inflation down? How willwage inflation pass through to price inflation?How to measure economic slackThere are signs of a tight labour market. In addition to the wage dynamics I just mentioned, wehave observed the unemployment rate moving close to its pre-crisis low, with participation ratesbeing higher than ever.At the same time, assessing the tightness in labour markets is not straightforward, for severalreasons. First, these aggregate statistics hide substantial cross-country heterogeneity. Second,and more fundamentally, the natural rate of unemployment is unobservable.Furthermore, tightness in the labour market provides only a partial picture of slack in theeconomy, as slack can vary across different parts of the economy. It is therefore risky to infer itfrom just a few economic variables. And for each measure of slack the same issue applies asfor slack in the labour market: it cannot be observed directly, because the potential (or “trend”)levels of economic variables are unobservable and time-varying. Accordingly, there are various1 1 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
estimates of the aggregate slack and these estimates differ from one another. Some of themare also subject to substantial ex post revisions. For all of these reasons, we need to be cautiouswhen assessing economic slack and look at many economic indicators to achieve a robustassessment.The wage-inflation pass-throughLet us turn to the wage-inflation pass-through. Given the recent growth of wages, it is crucial tounderstand how this will pass through to inflation. But coming to a robust assessment is notstraightforward. Both economic theory and the empirical evidence tell us that this pass-throughdepends on many different factors.One consideration is that the structure of the economy is not constant over time. Over the pastfew decades, we have been witnessing gradual changes in the economic environment, many ofwhich can be traced back to the ongoing IT revolution. These changes have importantimplications for inflation and pass-through, too.One such change is the growth of e-commerce, or, as some call it, the “Amazon effect”. Manycommentators argue that increased price transparency when shopping online has contributed tokeeping inflation low in advanced economies. Whether the growth of e-commerce makes pricesless responsive to wages is more debatable. Research suggests that the algorithmic pricingtechnologies of online retailers make retail prices more sensitive to aggregate, economy-wideshocks – which would imply that pass-through should eventually occur.However, while the optimistic view is that e-commerce, and the IT revolution more generally,contributes to more competition and economic dynamism, there are also concerns about itsmore pernicious longer-term effects, such as: rising market concentration, a falling labour shareand slower long-term growth.One of the factors behind these negative effects is that IT makes it easier for highly productive“superstar” firms to expand into new markets, generating efficiency gains in the short run, butleading to more concentration in the long run.A more general trend leading in the same direction is the rise of intangible inputs, such asbrands, software, technologies and databases. Investment in these types of input is steadilyincreasing as a share of overall investment, and they are becoming increasingly important forfirms’ success. The key feature of intangible inputs is that they can be deployed on a largerscale at almost zero additional cost. In other words, they primarily contribute to firms’ fixed costs.The increase in the role of fixed costs and the diminishing role of variable costs can haveimportant implications for the structure of an industry: these changes contribute to an increase inconcentration, a long-term decline in productivity (after an initial surge) and a fall in the labourshare. The lesson for our discussion is that the rise of intangibles implies that marginal costs(such as wages) may be playing a decreasing role in price-setting decisions, thereby leading to alower wage-inflation pass-through.Some theories suggest that the wage-inflation pass-through might also fluctuate depending onthe level of inflation. They start from the empirical observation that, at lower levels of inflation,price fluctuations are less persistent. In such an environment, firms are less inclined to matchcost increases with price increases. Hence, low inflation leads to lower pass-through and areduction in the expected persistence of cost and price changes.Turning to the euro area data, we can observe that the recent decoupling of wages and prices isnot unprecedented. We have seen a similar decoupling before, in 1999-2000 and in 2005-06.Formal econometric exercises confirm this observation and suggest that the wage-inflationpass-through is state-dependent. One finding is that the pass-through depends on the type of1234567 2 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
shock hitting the economy: it is stronger for demand shocks, and weaker for supply shocks. Another finding that is particularly relevant now and confirms the theories I have just discussed,is that the pass-through is lower in times of low inflation. Other research has also found that thepass-through is lower in times of economic slack.ConclusionTo sum up, the current low unemployment rate and the recent wage increases do notnecessarily imply that higher inflation is around the corner. First, measuring economic slack isfraught with well-known difficulties. Second, both theory and empirical studies suggest that thewage-inflation pass-through varies over time and depends on many factors. Arguably, thestructural changes under way in advanced economies imply that the pass-through may be on thedecline. The bottom line is that monetary policy decisions need to be based on a wide array ofeconomic indicators, not just the unemployment rate and wages.I have touched upon some of the economic effects of the IT revolution. While there might bedangers ahead, I have no doubt that, with appropriate regulation, this revolution will contribute togrowth and prosperity in Europe and the world. It will also change the way we work in centralbanks. We are actively trying to foster this change.For alternative estimates of the euro area output gap, see research from the European Commission and theIMF, or Jarociński, M. and Lenza, M.

Takako Masai Member of the Policy Board Economic Activity, Prices, and Monetary Policy in Japan  Speech at a Meeting with Business Leaders in Mie Bank of Japan September 25, 2019   (English translation based on the Japanese original) 
1 I. Developments in Economic Activity and Prices I would like to start my speech with a look at developments in economic activity and prices.  Following the discussion at the Monetary Policy Meeting (MPM) held on July 29 and 30, 2019, the Bank of Japan published the Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices, or the Outlook Report. In this report, the Bank presented its projections for Japan's economic activity and prices through fiscal 2021.  I will explain developments in economic activity and prices by presenting the main content of the Outlook Report.  A. Overseas Economies Let me first touch on developments in overseas economies. The Bank assesses that, although overseas economies have been growing moderately on the whole, slowdowns have continued to be observed.  Private consumption has been firm on the whole, mainly due to the favorable employment and income situation. However, the effects of trade friction are becoming evident in the form of deceleration in the pace of increase in the world trade volume, and it is confirmed that this, together with adjustments in the cycle for IT-related goods, has led to a deterioration in business sentiment and a decline in the propensity toward investment, particularly in the manufacturing sector. Indeed, the Global Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for manufacturing has been below the 50 mark and continued to decline since May 2019 -- that is, four consecutive months -- while the U.S. ISM Manufacturing Index also fell below 50 in August for the first time since August 2016 -- that is, about three years.   My view is that other central banks and international organizations have been sharing concerns about this situation. For instance, the G20 Osaka Leaders' Declaration adopted in June 2019 states that "[global economic] growth remains low and risks remain tilted to the downside." According to the World Economic Outlook (WEO) Update released in July 2019 by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the growth rate of the global economy is projected to decelerate to 3.2 percent in 2019 but pick up to 3.5 percent -- about the same 
2 level as the past average -- in 2020; however, these projections were revised downward from the previous ones made in the April 2019 WEO, marking the fourth consecutive downward revision. Moreover, it was indicated by the IMF itself that the projections are "precarious" and presume that progress will be made toward resolving trade policy differences.  Looking at developments by major region, the U.S. economy has continued to be underpinned by the household sector against the backdrop of solid growth in employment and income. Although economic growth in some countries -- such as France -- is being underpinned by consumption, the European economy as a whole, in contrast, has seen moves to defer investment, partly against the backdrop of uncertainty over political developments, and there are no signs of the business sentiment of manufacturing firms -- especially those in Germany -- bottoming out. With regard to Germany in particular, the Deutsche Bundesbank assessed that the growth rate of the economy for the July-September quarter of 2019 could be negative for the second consecutive quarter, following the April-June quarter. The Chinese economy has continued to see stable growth on the whole, but weakness has been observed in manufacturing, as suggested by such indicators as industrial output -- for which growth for July was at its lowest level in about ten and a half years and decelerated further in August. In other emerging and commodity-exporting economies, such as the NIEs and ASEAN economies, effects of adjustments in IT-related goods, for example, have been observed.  In terms of the outlook for overseas economies, slowdowns are likely to continue for the time being; thereafter, however, such economies are expected to grow moderately on the whole, with the growth rates rising somewhat, partly due to the effects of each economy's stimulus measures and a pick-up in manufacturing, where relatively weak developments have been observed mainly in IT-related and capital goods. Nevertheless, there are concerns that, with the Brexit deadline approaching, global financial market conditions might suddenly change depending on the outcome of negotiations on the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union (EU), and I am of the view that downside risks to business activity remain significant, mainly for manufacturing, with trade issues becoming chronic, 
3 particularly between the United States and China. Accordingly, I am paying particular attention to the timing and the pace of the pick-up in overseas economies.  B. Japan's Economy 1. Current situation Now I would like to move on to developments in Japan's economy.  The Bank assesses that Japan's economy has been on a moderate expanding trend, with a virtuous cycle from income to spending operating, although exports, production, and business sentiment have been affected by the slowdown in overseas economies. The assessment of the underlying trend as a whole is unchanged from the previous Outlook Report released in April 2019, but the slowdown in overseas economies seems to be affecting not only exports and production, as has been seen to date, but also the business sentiment of some firms as well as manufacturers' machinery investment, among others. In the meantime, domestic demand, such as business fixed investment, has maintained its firmness, mainly in nonmanufacturing, and private consumption has been increasing moderately, albeit with fluctuations; thus, the output gap has remained positive and the real GDP growth rate for the April-June quarter of 2019, which was released in August, was 1.3 percent on an annualized quarter-on-quarter basis, registering a positive figure for the third consecutive quarter.  Looking at developments by major expenditure item, with corporate profits staying at relatively high levels on the whole, the uptrend in business fixed investment has been maintained, mainly in investment intended for domestic capacity expansion, that aiming at saving labor in order to deal with labor shortage, and that in research and development for growth areas. Especially in nonmanufacturing, an increase has been observed in construction of logistics facilities, reflecting the expansion of e-commerce business, and of accommodation facilities to meet the demand of inbound visitors. Meanwhile, according to the Financial Statements Statistics of Corporations by Industry, Quarterly, business fixed investment by manufacturing firms for the April-June quarter of 2019 was minus 6.9 percent on a year-on-year basis, falling below the previous year's level for the first time in two years, due mainly to the effects of trade issues. Private consumption has maintained its 
4 moderate increasing trend with labor market conditions remaining tight and the income situation continuing to improve, albeit with fluctuations resulting from weather conditions. Exports have continued to show some weakness, mainly reflecting the effects of the slowdown in overseas economies. As a result of this situation, production mainly of export-related goods has exhibited some weak developments, but industrial production as a whole has been more or less flat. In these circumstances, business sentiment has been weakening somewhat, mainly in manufacturing.  2. Baseline scenario of the outlook for economic activity Japan's economy is likely to continue on an expanding trend throughout the projection period, which covers from fiscal 2019 through fiscal 2021.  In fiscal 2019, exports are projected to continue showing some weakness for the time being, reflecting the slowdown in overseas economies, and business fixed investment also is likely to decelerate somewhat, mainly for manufacturing. Thereafter, exports are projected to return to their moderate increasing trend, with the growth rates of overseas economies rising gradually. The rate of increase in business fixed investment is expected to rise somewhat due to increases, for example, in labor-saving investment. Private consumption is likely to be pushed down for some time due to the effects of the scheduled consumption tax hike, but is expected to continue increasing as the employment and income situation continues to improve. Public investment also is likely to increase, reflecting Olympic Games-related demand and expansion in expenditure such as for national resilience.   In fiscal 2020, the pace of increase in exports is expected to accelerate, with the growth rates of overseas economies rising, and government spending accompanying the hosting of the Olympic Games is expected to underpin the economy. Business fixed investment is likely to maintain a moderate uptrend. Private consumption and housing investment are expected to head gradually toward a recovery from a decline after the scheduled consumption tax hike.   In fiscal 2021, private consumption and housing investment are projected to increase because the effects of the reactionary decline to the scheduled consumption tax hike are 
5 likely to dissipate, although Olympic Games-related expenditure -- which had been increasing -- will have been completed. Exports and business fixed investment are likely to maintain their moderate uptrend.  In terms of the medians of the Policy Board members' forecasts in the July Outlook Report, the real GDP growth rate is 0.7 percent for fiscal 2019, 0.9 percent for fiscal 2020, and 1.1 percent for fiscal 2021.  3. Uncertainties regarding the baseline scenario for economic activity There are various uncertainties regarding the baseline scenario of the outlook for Japan's economic activity, and I would like to explain two points to which I currently pay particular attention.  First is the risk that the timing of the bottoming out of external demand will delay. Since the latter half of 2018, I have assessed that risks are tilted to the downside, particularly those regarding developments in overseas economies. Recently, due to political factors such as the strengthening of protectionist moves, downside risks seem to be increasing further. I am concerned that this could affect the timing of the bottoming out of external demand through various channels including disruptions in financial markets and a reduction in firms' incentive to invest caused by developments in trade.  Second is the effects of the consumption tax hike scheduled to take place in October 2019. The planned increase in the tax rate is smaller than that at the time of the previous hike in April 2014, and the government plans to implement measures such as a reduced tax rate, a point reward program when using cashless payments, and more flexibly passing on the rise in the consumption tax to sales prices. Taking these into consideration, the baseline scenario is that the negative impact of the tax hike on the growth rates will be smaller than that of the previous hike. Nevertheless, I am paying attention to future consumption, together with possible further heightening in the current geopolitical risks.  I would like to carefully examine the situation, including these two points, in the upcoming October Outlook Report. 
6 C. Price Developments 1. Current situation Next, I will turn to price developments in Japan.  The year-on-year rate of increase in the consumer price index (CPI) for all items less fresh food is currently at around 0.5 percent; it seems to have hit a lull somewhat in the uptrend, as the effects of energy price drops have started to appear. Nevertheless, the general public's gut feeling seems to be that prices are rising gradually. I believe that this is affected by the rise in prices of food products, which are staple purchases. Actually, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI saw an acceleration in its growth for an increasing number of food products since early spring; in addition, the Unit Value Price Index released by Hitotsubashi University (SRI-Hitotsubashi Consumer Purchase Index) and the Nikkei CPINow-T Index, both of which are calculated based on point-of-sales (POS) data collected at supermarkets, for example, maintained their high growth.   As described in the Comprehensive Assessment: Developments in Economic Activity and Prices as well as Policy Effects since the Introduction of Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE), which was released by the Bank in September 2016, the adaptive component plays a considerably larger role in Japan than in other countries in the formation of inflation expectations, which means that inflation expectations tend to be influenced by past inflation rates. A similar trend has been confirmed by subsequent studies.1 In other words, it is important to make cumulative efforts to raise inflation rates; as Gertler pointed out, for an economy that barely has a history of inflation being anchored at a targeted rate, "they [individuals] have to see it to believe it."2 From this viewpoint, my understanding of                                                    1 See, for example, Toshitaka Maruyama and Kenji Suganuma, "Inflation Expectations Curve in Japan," Bank of Japan Working Paper Series, no.19-E-6, April 2019, http://www.boj.or.jp/en/research/wps_rev/wps_2019/data/wp19e06.pdf. 2 Mark Gertler, "Rethinking the Power of Forward Guidance: Lessons from Japan," IMES Discussion Paper Series, No. 2017-E-8, Bank of Japan, Institute for Monetary and Economic Studies (IMES), October 2017, https://www.imes.boj.or.jp/research/papers/english/17-E-08.pdf. 
7 the several signs of changes that recently have started to appear is that they are arising in a situation where we gradually are taking positive steps.  In fact, in contrast to the year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI for all items less fresh food that I mentioned earlier, that for all items less fresh food and energy has remained flat at a level around 0.5 percent since the beginning of this fiscal year. In addition, signs of changes -- albeit slight -- seem to have appeared in view of the fact that price rises by firms are beginning to spread to a broader range of products, and given other data, such as the trimmed-mean CPI, which excludes extreme relative price changes. Turning to inflation expectations, the expected inflation rate for the next five years surpassed 1 percent for the first time since 2013, according to an estimation by the Bank's staff based on the results of the Opinion Survey on the General Public's Views and Behavior.  The fact that the adaptive component is playing a considerably large role can be explained by people's mindset and behavior based on the assumption that wages and prices will not increase easily having been deeply entrenched. I assume that households are gaining cumulative experiences through rises in base pay for six consecutive years and in the year-on-year rate of increase in employee income on a quarterly basis for 26 quarters in a row, although the rates of increase are modest. As a matter of fact, households' tolerance of price rises, which the Bank's staff calculated, seems to have been on an improving trend, and I am of the view that these also are signs of positive changes.  As I have explained so far, I have the sense that, although we still have some distance to go to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, there are some signs that the momentum toward achieving the target could strengthen again. In other words, I feel that we are approaching an important phase where firms' and households' tolerance of price rises could                                                                                                                                                      Based on empirical analysis, the following paper concludes that individuals' expectations of future inflation rates are influenced by the inflation rates that they actually have experienced. Jess Diamond, Kota Watanabe, and Tsutomu Watanabe, "The Formation of Consumer Inflation Expectations: New Evidence From Japan's Deflation Experience," Bank of Japan Working Paper Series, no.19-E-13, August 2019, http://www.boj.or.jp/en/research/wps_rev/wps_2019/data/ wp19e13.pdf. 
8 improve, and expected inflation rates could rise further. Therefore, I believe that it is extremely important to encourage this development.  2. Baseline scenario of the outlook for prices With regard to the outlook for prices, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI for all items less fresh food is likely to increase gradually toward 2 percent, mainly on the back of the output gap remaining positive and medium- to long-term inflation expectations rising. The medians of the Policy Board members' forecasts of the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI for all items less fresh food presented in the July Outlook Report was 1.0 percent for fiscal 2019, 1.3 percent for fiscal 2020, and 1.6 percent for fiscal 2021.  3. Risks to prices Specific risk factors to prices are developments in firms' and households' medium- to long-term inflation expectations, the fact that the responsiveness of prices of some items to the output gap is low, and developments in foreign exchange rates and international commodity prices going forward. My recent concern is that, amid significant downside risks concerning overseas economies, negative effects would be exerted on prices through the third risk factor in the case of disruptions in global financial markets.   II. The Bank's Monetary Policy Next, I will talk about the Bank's monetary policy.  A. Current Monetary Policy Framework The Bank has set the price stability target at 2 percent in terms of the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI and is conducting monetary policy to achieve this target at the earliest possible time. Specifically, under the framework of QQE with Yield Curve Control, it has supported the economic activity of firms and households by maintaining highly accommodative financial conditions.  This framework mainly consists of four components: yield curve control, purchases of risky assets, an inflation-overshooting commitment, and forward guidance for policy rates. The first component, yield curve control, is a policy under which the Bank aims to keep short- 
9 and long-term interest rates stable at low levels. Namely, in the guideline for market operations, the Bank sets the short-term policy interest rate at minus 0.1 percent and the target level of 10-year Japanese government bond (JGB) yields at around 0 percent, and conducts JGB purchases so as to achieve this target level. The second component is purchases of risky assets; with a view to lowering risk premia of asset prices, the Bank purchases exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and Japan real estate investment trusts (J-REITs) so that their amounts outstanding will increase at annual paces of about 6 trillion yen and about 90 billion yen, respectively. The third component, the inflation-overshooting commitment, is a policy under which the Bank commits itself to continuing to expand the monetary base -- the total amount of money the Bank directly supplies to the economy -- until the year-on-year rate of increase in the observed CPI exceeds 2 percent and stays above that level in a stable manner. The fourth component, forward guidance for policy rates, presents the Bank's stance of maintaining the current extremely low levels of short- and long-term interest rates for an extended period of time, at least through around spring 2020, taking into account uncertainties regarding economic activity and prices including developments in overseas economies and the effects of the scheduled consumption tax hike.  B. Persistently Continuing with Powerful Monetary Easing The Bank introduced QQE in April 2013 and has continued with powerful monetary easing. However, as it gradually became clear that it likely would still take time to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, it decided to strengthen the framework for QQE with Yield Curve Control in July 2018. Specifically, it decided to enhance the sustainability of powerful monetary easing by (1) strengthening its commitment to achieving the price stability target by introducing forward guidance for policy rates and (2) conducting market operations and asset purchases in a more flexible manner. To elaborate on the second point, the Bank announced that, in purchasing JGBs, the yields might move upward and downward to some extent, mainly depending on developments in economic activity and prices. It also decided to conduct such purchases in a flexible manner so that their amount outstanding would increase at an annual pace of about 80 trillion yen. Furthermore, it decided to purchase ETFs and J-REITs so that their amounts outstanding would increase at annual paces of about 6 trillion yen and about 90 billion yen, respectively. At the same time, with a view to lowering risk premia of asset prices in an appropriate manner, the Bank 
10 announced that it might increase or decrease the amount of purchases depending on market conditions. By allowing for some elasticity in the monetary policy framework, the Bank can respond flexibly to some extent to developments in financial markets.  Moreover, in April 2019, the Bank made clearer its policy stance to persistently continue with powerful monetary easing. Specifically, regarding its forward guidance for policy rates, the Bank added developments in overseas economies as a factor to consider when judging whether it would maintain the current extremely low levels of short- and long-term interest rates; in addition, it clearly presented a point of reference for the expression "for an extended period of time" as at least through around spring 2020. Furthermore, in order to contribute to smooth implementation of fund-provisioning and asset purchases as well as secure market functioning, the Bank decided to take the following measures and initiative: (1) expand eligible collateral for the Bank's provision of credit; (2) improve the use of the Fund-Provisioning Measure to Support Strengthening the Foundations for Economic Growth; (3) relax the terms and conditions for the Securities Lending Facility (SLF); and (4) consider introducing an ETF lending facility.  The Bank will persistently continue with powerful monetary easing in a sustainable manner under the framework of QQE with Yield Curve Control by devising measures considered necessary at the time and strengthening the framework.   C. Coping with Current Uncertainties My understanding is that global financial markets as a whole remain risk averse, and this development seems to be strengthening recently amid rapid alternation between pessimism and optimism due to factors of a very strong political nature. For example, in Germany, interest rates on all instruments from overnight loans to 30-year government bonds temporarily became negative, and in Switzerland, interest rates on all instruments up to 50-year government bonds were negative at one point. In the United States, yields on 10-year Treasuries have fallen close to the lowest levels marked after the global financial crisis; market participants seem to have various interpretations of the implication of an inverted yield curve, which has been observed since mid-August, with yields on 10-year Treasuries declining below those on 2-year Treasuries. In the meantime, major economies' 
11 central banks, such as the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank (ECB), have shifted to a more accommodative policy stance so as to prevent uncertainties over the global economy from affecting domestic and regional economic activity and prices. In this respect, the Bank considers it important to thoroughly examine risks to overseas economies and carefully assess how those risks could affect Japan's economic activity and prices. Based on such examination, the Bank, like other central banks, will not hesitate to take additional easing measures if there is a greater possibility that the momentum toward achieving the price stability target will be lost.  To clarify its intention, in the July 2019 Statement on Monetary Policy, the Bank presented its stance that it "will not hesitate to take additional easing measures if there is a greater possibility that the momentum toward achieving the price stability target will be lost." Moreover, in the statement released on September 19, the Bank judged that it was becoming necessary to pay closer attention to the possibility that the momentum toward achieving the price stability target would be lost. Based on this judgment, it added an expression that, taking this situation into account, it would reexamine economic and price developments at the next MPM, when it will discuss the October Outlook Report.  Actual economic conditions faced by central banks are extremely complex and change dynamically in the course of time. On this point, at the Jackson Hole symposium in 2018, there was discussion about implications for monetary policy arising from various structural changes that have occurred in recent years, including digital innovation and an increase in types of non-tangible assets such as software, intellectual property, and brand equity. Moreover, at the Jackson Hole symposium held this year, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell pointed to recent uncertainties as a new challenge for monetary policy management.3 In fact, a strengthening of protectionist moves recently appears to be one of the factors that makes the situation even more complicated.                                                     3 This economic symposium, held annually at Jackson Hole, Wyoming, in August, is hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. Prominent central bankers, finance ministers, and academics from around the world convene to discuss topics such as on the global economy and monetary policy. 
12 I intend to continue to conduct monetary policy appropriately toward achieving the price stability target while considering all conceivable adverse effects and positive effects from every angle as well as taking full consideration of these notable changes in the environment and risks on which to place emphasis.

23.09.2019| Leipzig | Claudia Buch On behalf of the Executive Board of the Bundesbank, I would like to welcome you to this year’s reception on the occasion of the Annual Meeting of the Verein für Socialpolitik. We have just heard some very interesting discussions on the role of central banks in the process of EUenlargement. I would like to thank all the panelists for their contributions!The discussion has shown that central banks play an important role in the European integration process – not only within the euro area but also in the European Union as a whole. Let me give a few examples of how the Bundesbank contributes as a constructive partner to decision-making in Europe: Monetary policy decisions are taken at the Eurosystem level, based on analytical work of committees within the European central banks to which the Bundesbank actively contributes. Cross-border cooperation and coordination also play a central role for ﬁnancial stability, which was established as a new mandate for central banks after the ﬁnancial crisis. In Europe, ﬁnancial stability falls under national responsibility but there is a close coordination between EU institutions and national authorities. The European level has the power to top up national policy decisions which are deemed insuﬃcient to address ﬁnancial stability risks. Likewise, banking supervision is a shared responsibility: Even for the systemically important banks which are supervised by the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM), national authorities play an important role in on-site supervision. And, not least, we work closely with our partners in Europe to ensure that statistical reporting of granular data is improved across Europe.These examples show that good analytical skills are key for central banks to play a competent role in the European integration process. Central banks certainly operate in an environment of political discussions on important societal questions. Central banks’ contributions to these debates need to be based on their mandates and on rigorous empirical analysis. Maintaining high analytical quality is, indeed, one of the core strategic goals of the Bundesbank.Therefore, we have been very careful observers of the initiative for evidence-based policy that the Verein für Socialpolitik (German Economic Association) has developed under the leadership of Professor Monika Schnitzer from the University of Munich. The core principles of this initiative were adopted by the Verein in 2015. According to these guidelines, economic policy advice should be based on sound and rigorous evidence. The guidelines also point out that transparency, replicability, neutrality and independence should be key aspects of impact assessments and ex post policy evaluation.Evidence-Based Policy: Progress and Next Steps[1] Reception hosted by the Deutsche Bundesbank - Annual meeting of the Verein für Socialpolitik [2][3][4][5]
A lot has happened since the initial adoption of these guidelines. Populism is on the rise, the economy is becoming increasingly digital, trade tensions have intensiﬁed and we may even see a reversal of globalization, there are concerns about climate change, and policy uncertainty surrounding Brexit but also more globally. All of these challenges increase uncertainty and may affect economic structures in the longer-term.  Evidence-based policy is needed more than ever. How else are we to answer key questions facing society? We need to understand the drivers of inﬂation, productivity and growth, the role of policy, the effects of post-crisis ﬁnancial sector reforms, and, more generally, the effectiveness of policies that internalize externalities – be it in the ﬁnancial sector or with regard to environmental spillovers. Not all of these questions can be answered with hard, causal evidence. But learning how the economy is functioning, and understanding the mechanisms and incentives through which policy instruments affect the way people and ﬁrms behave is crucial.The best strategy to counter distrust in public authorities and the spread of “fake news” is a structured policy process. We need transparency about what policy institutions are doing and how they operate, not least through good communication. Notwithstanding the erosion of trust in governments and political institutions since the crisis, there is indeed great demand for reliable evidence and expert knowledge. According to a survey by the Pew Research Center, for example, demand for scientiﬁc knowledge in the United States is fairly high and has even increased slightly in recent years. Yet, views diverge regarding the roles scientists should play in policy debates; potential biases and lack of independence in expert views are issues that many respondents consider to be relevant. Trust is thus important, and trust needs to be earned. Trust also implies that citizens want a transparent and objective decision making process. Therefore, we have taken the principles for evidence-based policy to heart and are working on operationalizing them in the policy areas for which we are responsible.Generally speaking, a lot has also happened with regard to evidence-based policy making over the past few years. Let me give you an example: Very nearby, the Halle Institute for Economic Research founded a Centre for Evidence-based Policy Advice (IWH-CEP) in 2014. This platform aims to create better foundations for the evaluation of policy measures, including the effects of regional policies. Research based on ﬁrm-level information on subsidies shows that such subsidies support the creation of new employment while the productivity of the recipient ﬁrms remains largely unaffected for the time span covered by the data. Of course, this is only one of the many examples of how research institutes in Germany contribute to evidence-based policy-making.Moving on to the national level, the 2018 coalition agreement foresees an evaluation of policy measures in a wide range of areas such as integration in schools, traﬃc laws and ﬁnes, cultural policy, an initiative to promote healthy diets and increased physical activity, programs to prevent political extremism, as well as data protection regulation. An important step towards operationalising policy evaluation and making it part of the policy process has been made by an initiative of the National Regulatory Control Council (Normenkontrollrat): Since March 2013, all national policy measures with annual implementation costs of more than € 1 million must be subject to ex post evaluation. These evaluations are reviewed by the Council.Implementing these initiatives requires an active exchange between the ﬁelds of academia and policymaking, learning and experimenting. In order to promote this dialogue, the German National Academy of Sciences “Leopoldina” has established an initiative for evidence-based policy. It aims to improve the transparency of political processes and to establish common [6][7][8][9][10][11]
standards on how policy measures should be evaluated. The initiative builds on an exchange of views between academia, administration, the media, and the political sphere through workshops, joint events, and (informal) networks.Another example of evidence-based policy comes from the international level: In 2017, the G20 endorsed a framework for the ex post evaluation of ﬁnancial sector reforms. In response to the global ﬁnancial crisis, the G20 leaders agreed on a package of ﬁnancial sector reforms with four elements: increasing resilience through higher capital requirements for banks, new regimes for the resolution of large and systemic banks, reforms of derivative markets, and improved monitoring and regulation of shadow banking. The objective of the evaluation framework is to attribute outcomes of reforms, to identify relevant heterogeneities with regard to reform effects, and to study broader, general equilibrium effects. First evaluations have already been conducted. They ﬁnd that, by and large, the reforms are working as intended and do not have major side effects. In an ongoing evaluation project, the FSB members assess whether the reforms addressing the too-big-to-fail issue are reducing the systemic and moral hazard risks associated with systemically important banks. The evaluation projects beneﬁt from academic support through dedicated academic advisors; input from stakeholders is actively sought through public consultations. Hence, you are all invited to engage!What are the key lessons that we can take away from these examples of evidence-based policy? What are the elements of a good evaluation process?Institutional knowledge and methodological diversity are the basis for good policy evaluations. Sound, evidence-based policy making needs to be based on a range of studies and methods. Different empirical models which have been replicated across different markets and time periods can provide insight into the robustness of empirical ﬁndings. Repositories of evaluation studies can provide overviews of empirical work and also provide the basis for meta studies. The Bank for International Settlements (BIS), for example, has recently launched a repository of studies on the effects of banking regulation. In addition to analytical and empirical methods, good identiﬁcation requires information about the relevant institutional background. Not least, sustaining the political momentum requires evaluation to be embedded in a policy process. This creates the incentives for administrations to actively support evaluations, both internally and externally.Sound evidence-based policymaking requires high-quality data: Data are needed early on in the process of policy evaluation, as collecting relevant data ex post can prove costly and ineﬃcient. The Bundesbank thus actively supports the provision of granular data for research purposes. The Bundesbank's Research Data and Service Centre (RDSC) provides access to granular ﬁnancial data. At the moment, researchers involved in 125 projects are working with RDSC micro data. To further facilitate access to these data, the RDSC has recently opened another site at our regional oﬃce in Düsseldorf. Furthermore, the Bundesbank is supporting a RePEc (Research Papers in Economics) initiative to highlight the value of data in empirical work. The idea of the initiative is to automate the search and discovery of datasets in the same way information on publications and citations can be collected. In the context of improving the infrastructure for good data, let me take this opportunity to thank Regina Riphahn (University of Erlangen-Nuremberg) and Thomas Bauer (RWI Essen) for their work for the German Data Forum (Rat für So-zial- und Wirtschaftsdaten).[12][13][14][15][16][17]
Academic involvement is important: Causal identiﬁcation of policy effects is at the heart of academic research. This is a very welcome development as it adds rigor, quality, and comparability to academic output. Yet, translating evidence based on causal identiﬁcation strategies into sound policy advice requires much more: external validity and robustness of results over time and across different institutional setups is important. Adding such information and deriving broader policy implications from one’s own work is not always rewarded by the academic community, though. Hence, we also need to think intelligently about ways to combine both – analytical rigor and quality controls with incentives to transfer knowledge from academia to policy.Footnotes:1.I would like to thank Stefan Bender, Manuel Buchholz, Philipp Marek, Christian Schumacher, Edgar Vogel, and Matthias Weiß for most helpful contributions and comments on an earlier draft.

Two decades with the euro: Portugal’s perspectiveLecture by Governor Carlos da Silva Costa on the occasion of his visit to Hrvatska Narodna Banka, Zagreb [1]1. Introductory remarksGood morning.I would like to thank Governor Boris Vujčić for his kind invitation to visit the Croatian National Bank and for the opportunity to share the Portuguese experiencewith the euro with you and the steps that led to its adoption in 1999.First of all I would like to express my satisfaction with Croatia’s intention to join ERM II and the Banking Union by mid-2020, as well as to congratulate the Croatian authorities on the remarkable progress the country has made since it became part of the European Union.As one of the eleven founding members of the euro area, Portugal's preparation for the introduction of the single currency took place in a very different context from the one in which Croatia will adopt the euro.On the one hand, because, at the time, the process involved the simultaneous assessment of all theEuropean Union (EU) countries and the launch of a completely new currency. In particular, it required:•(i) A decision on which of all those countries fulfilled the necessary conditions;Início > Intervenção do Governador, Carlos da Silva Costa, no Banco Central da Croácia (apenas em inglês) > Intervenção do Governador, Carlos da Silva Costa, no Banco Central da Croácia (apenas em inglês)Intervenção do Governador, Carlos da Silva Costa, no Banco Central da Croácia (apenas em inglês)
•(ii) The creation of multiple EU-wide preparatory work-streams and coordination networks at the level of central banks and public administrations among others, so as to ensure a smooth and balanced transition;•(iii) The launch of the euro and the subsequent physical introduction of previously non-existent notes and coins.On the other hand, because the European regulatory framework and institutional architecture have significantly evolved since then, notably following the responses to the financial crisis and the establishment of the Banking Union.However, despite all the differences in the framework conditions and starting points, I am convinced that the Portuguese experience with the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) of the European Monetary System and with the euro and thelessons that can be drawn from that experience may provide a useful point of reference for Croatia.In order to give you a more complete picture, allow me to highlight some key developments and regime changes experienced by the Portuguese economy over the last four decades, starting with a few words on the period before accession to the European Economic Community (EEC), in January 1986.2. Before EEC accessionIn the late 1970s and early 1980s the Portuguese economy was characterised by severe macroeconomic imbalances, significant market distortions, a large public sector and poor economic performance. The root cause of the macroeconomic imbalances was essentially excessive domestic demand growth in relation to the productive capacity of the economy, leading to external debt accumulation.To overcome its Balance of Payments difficulties, Portugal had to negotiate two IMF programmes, in 1977-1978 and in 1983. The implementation of both packages was very successful in attaining their targets.In a context of monetary sovereignty, the imbalances translated into currency depreciation, international reserves depletion and high and rising inflation rates (annual inflation was 21.4%, on average, for the period 1978-1985, reaching almost 30% in 1984). The policy prescription at the time consisted of interest rate increases, credit growth ceilings, capital controls and the devaluation of the national currency, the escudo, to contain domestic demand and restore export competitiveness. With this aim, a crawling-peg regime was introduced in August 1977, a few months before the first IMF stabilisation package.As a result of the adjustment strategy followed, the real value of wages, pensions and savings declined sharply and wealth was transferred from creditors to debtors. Money illusion blurred the perception of the adjustment costs and of the fundamentally unbalanced burden-sharing.The 1983 programme brought the current account back into balance and put inflation and the general government deficit on a declining path. However, in 1985, the year preceding Portugal’s accession to the EEC, inflation still ran at around 20% (14 percentage points above the Community average), the general government deficit exceeded 8% of GDP and GDP per capita was about 50% of the Community average, reflecting the country’s low productivity levels.3. From EEC accession to adoption of the euroAccession to the European Economic Community in January 1986 was a critical regime change for the Portuguese economy. It posed many difficult challenges but it also provided many key opportunities. Increased trade and financial integration, and later on the commitment to becoming a founding member of the monetary union, provided a critical “stick and carrot” for Portugal to follow a path based on the prevalence of market mechanisms and on the pursuit of macroeconomic stability. 1986-early 1992: from EEC Accession to ERM participationFrom EEC accession up to early 1992, economic policy was driven by the need to implement the Single Market programme and the acquis communautaire.The performance of the Portuguese economy improved significantly and a rapid catching-up process started (GDP per capita grew 5.8%, on average in the period 1986-1991). However, signs of an increasingly 
overheated economy were also becoming apparent and domestic production was limited by capacity constraints and a tight labour market. An increasingly unbalanced policy-mix exacerbated excess demand.Disinflation became a major goal of economic policy and the Portuguese authorities progressively adopted a monetary policy strategy based on exchange rate stability as an intermediate target to reach the final goal of price stability. The exchange rate policy became progressively less accommodative, aiming at breaking the vicious circle of inflation-devaluation without jeopardising the sustainability of external accounts.From 1986 onward, the escudo’s monthly depreciation rate was successively cut down and in October 1990 the crawling-peg regime was abandoned. In addition, the reference basket against which the escudo was measured was changed to a basket of five currencies of the ERM. The aim of the exchange rate regime shift was two-fold:•The authorities wanted to introduce some short-term unpredictability in the exchange rate of the escudo in order to discourage (short-term) capital inflows;•The new regime should prepare the country for future participation in the ERM (seen as a useful framework to pursue the disinflation process and to foster macroeconomic stability). Early 1992-1998: ERM membershipFrom the signature of the Maastricht Treaty in February 1992 onwards, ensuring compliance with the convergence criteria established for participation in the third stage of Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) became the immediate priority of economic policy in Portugal. One of the first steps in that direction was participation in the ERM.The escudo joined the ERM in April 1992, with a fluctuation band of ±6.0% [2] – then called the ‘wide band’. ERM membership underlined the Portuguese authorities’ commitment to the pursuit of a non-accommodative exchange rate policy, and was expected to have a favourable impact on inflation expectations. Membership was also necessary to ensure that the country would be a candidate for adopting the single currency from the start.Immediately after joining the ERM, the escudo became the strongest currency in the parity grid, and reached the ceiling against the weakest currency in the system, which at the time was the British pound. However, the first year of ERM participation was not an easy one and Banco de Portugal had to be very active to keep the escudo within the band.In the summer of 1992 the escudo was caught in the turmoil which affected the ERM and ultimately led to the widening of the fluctuation bands to ±15.0% in August 1993. Massive interventions had to be carried out, as well as other measures, in defence of the national currency. The escudo was subject to more than one realignment of the central parity and it depreciated significantly.It was clear that the ERM regime was not compatible with the degree of openness of the economies participating in the internal market and the existence of autonomous monetary policies. It was this inconsistency that led to the 1992-1993 currency crisis, with direct implications for intra-European trade flows. This has clearly shown in practice that the existence of an internal market without a single currency necessarily represents an unstable equilibrium. The need for a single currency became more evident than ever.After the enlargement of the ERM fluctuation margins there was increased stability in the run-up to the EMU. Despite deteriorating domestic conditions, the Portuguese authorities did not exploit the increased room for manoeuvre provided by the enlarged bands, so that official interest rates were adjusted in a manner consistent with the maintenance of exchange rate stability. During the period of ERM membership, inflation declined steadily and the differential against the European Union average was virtually eliminated.In fact, since the mid-1990s, the prospect of EMU participation fostered the rapid convergence of interest rates to the levels prevailing in Germany (the anchor country in the ERM). Prospective EMU Member States – especially those with worse track-records in terms of macroeconomic stability – initially benefited from a virtuous circle between nominal convergence and the prospect of EMU participation:•On the one hand, in the so-called “converging” countries, policy efforts towards fiscal consolidation coupled with lower inflation increased the likelihood of EMU participation (as these countries became closer to fulfilling the Maastricht criteria);•On the other hand, a higher probability of joining EMU facilitated exchange rate stability, interest rate convergence (declining risk premia) and the improvement of the budget balance (lower interest payments on public debt).
The magnitudes involved were impressive: from 1993 to 1998 nominal long-term interest rates in Portugal declined substantially, with the 10-year interest rate spread against the German bonds narrowing from around 5 p.p. to about 0.3 p.p.The sizeable interest rate cuts were interpreted by the Portuguese economic agents as largely irreversible, associated with a new macroeconomic regime characterised by price stability. Thus, the reduction of interest rates translated into a significant slowdown in the liquidity constraints experienced by households and corporations, providing a strong boost to domestic demand growth. In addition, participation in the euro area has admittedly brought about an expansionary effect on domestic demand through a more favourable economic outlook, which led economic agents to increase consumption and investment.After European integration, Portugal also experienced rapid real convergence, with the relative position of the Portuguese income per capita rising rapidly vis-à-vis average European levels. In 1998, GDP per capita had increased to around 70 per cent of the EU average.Table 1 - The Portuguese economy in 1978-1998: Some key figuresSources: Banco de Portugal, National Statistics Institute, Eurostat(1) Consumer Price Index, annual average rate of change(2) 1999=1004. Two decades with the euroThe introduction of the euroFollowing significant progress in nominal convergence and the alignment of national legislation with the EU Treaty and the Statute of the European System of Central Banks, Portugal was in a position to become one of the eleven founding members of the euro area. The EU Council decision of 2 May 1998 confirmed that Portugal fulfilled all the necessary conditions for the adoption of the single currency.The euro was introduced on 1 January 1999 in foreign exchange and financial currency operations and for the vast majority of retail operations. However, its physical introduction only took place on 1 January 2002 and at the end of February 2002euro banknotes and coins became the only legal tender in the euro area.In Portugal, the physical replacement of the escudo with euro banknotes and coins took place normally and gradually, following extensive preparatory work carried out by Banco de Portugal and other entities. In September 2001 euro banknotes and coins were distributed to credit institutions and, in December, to large companies and retailers. Finally, from 17 December, starter kits worth 10 euro were sold to the public at the counters of both Banco de Portugal and credit institutions, containing a mix of all euro coin denominations, so that Portuguese citizens could become familiar with the new currency.One additional feature was that Portugal introduced a legal requirement for the dual display of prices around the cash changeover (as was also the case in Austria and Greece). Dual display allowed for an easier comparison of prices in the two denominations, thereby reducing the information processing costs for consumers.The conversion of national currencies into euro gave rise to some fears over its effect on prices among the general public of the participating countries. Portugal was no exception.
It is clear that consumer prices were not immune to the conversion of national currencies into euro. Yet, it is impossible to make a precise assessment of its effect on inflation because several other factors simultaneously affected price developments in 2002. In the case of Portugal, for instance, there was a rise in the standard value added tax (VAT) rate from 17% to 19%, as from June.However, Banco de Portugal’s estimates suggest that in the first quarter of 2002 the overall impact of the conversion process on the year-on-year change in the Consumer Price Index was around 0.2 p.p. and around 0.5 p.p. in the case of services prices [3]. As in other countries, the analysis also confirmed signs of price increases caused by the changeover insome specific products, mostly regarding frequently bought goods and services that were usually paid in cash, hence leaving consumers with the feeling that inflation was high due to the introduction of the euro. As regards mandatory dual display of prices, research published by the ECB showed that it had a dampening effect on the evolution of some prices [4].The euro has provided businesses and households with an important set of tangible and visible benefits: lower transaction costs; more transparent and competitive markets and increased trade; greater certainty in saving and investment decisions; easier price comparison; simpler shopping and travel within Europe; easier access to other markets and new business opportunities.Naturally, the euro has also brought new requirements in regard to the behaviour of economic agents,namely because the exchange rate mechanism to compensate for differences in Member States ceased to be available.The overall success of the Portuguese experience in the convergence period hides important policy fragilities, particularly in the fiscal domain. In fact, a countercyclical fiscal policy would have helped to contain the risks associated with the expansion of domestic demand stemming from monetary easing and interest rate declines. And a macroprudential policy would have provided awareness of the build-up of systemic risk. However, macroprudential policy was simply not part of the standard toolbox and the mostly pro-cyclical fiscal policy that was followed contributed to rising imbalances in the economy in the early years of EMU, making the subsequent adjustment more painful. Let me say a few words on this.Before 2008 – the accumulation of macroeconomic imbalancesThe significant degree of monetary easing in the run-up to EMU provided a huge stimulus to domestic demand. As the “new world” of low interest rates and abundant financing seemed to offer a free lunch to the “converging” countries, several imbalances started to build-up in those countries, taking different shapes:•In countries such as Portugal or Greece, fiscal imbalances became a major problem – even if the size of the problem was substantially different. In both countries, savings arising from lower interest rates and boom-related windfall revenues were used to finance expansionary expenditure policies;•In countries such as Spain or Ireland, fiscal policies were more prudent. Still, imbalances built-up, mainly taking the form of a real estate bubble;•In Ireland, an oversized financial sector developed in tandem with the real estate bubble (a similar phenomenon also occurred in non-euro EU countries, the most prominent case being Iceland).In Portugal, from the mid-1990s to 2007, the very substantial easing of liquidity constraints – arising both from the interest rate decline and access to a huge wholesale market for funding – led to booming private sector credit and a fall in households’ savings rates. From 1995 to 2007, private sector debt almost doubled as a percentage of GDP (averaging 187.2% of GDP during this period), while households’ savings rates almost halved.The increase in indebtedness was mainly used to finance consumption and low-return investments, mostly in the non-tradable sector. As a result, imports expanded and large current account deficits materialised, without a corresponding increase in the economy’s growth potential. From 1995 to 2007, the current and capital account moved from near balance to an 8.6% of GDP deficit.The public sector also benefited from lower interest rates and easier access to credit. In addition, booming private expenditure pushed up tax revenue. All else being equal, this should have meant substantially improved overall and primary balances, as well as declining debt levels. Prudent fiscal management should have led to the boom in private spending being partly offset, even if only by letting automatic stabilisers play their role.When interest rate convergence was complete and the initial impact of EMU on growth disappeared, the underlying unsustainable fiscal policies swiftly became apparent. Also, structural bottlenecks arising from a lack of competition and an outsized public sector an excessive weight of the public sector in the economy, 
contributed to an overexpansion of the non-tradables sector, hampering competitiveness and aggravating external imbalances.It cannot be ignored that, as a regime change, EMU had a major impact on the setting of expectations, the transmission channels as well as the equilibrium values of key economic variables. This made it extremely difficult to assess developments in real time, causing very reasonable and competent people to disagree about the best explanation, and therefore to advocate different policy responses.In hindsight, it is clear that the pro-cyclical fiscal policy, a less demanding regulatory context, the complacency of international financial markets and the non-existence of macroprudential policies contributed decisively to the accumulation of significant macroeconomic imbalances in the Portuguese economy from the mid-1990s.After 2008 – the global crisis and the 2011 adjustment programmeThe macroeconomic imbalances made the Portuguese economy extremely vulnerable to the international financial crisis that started in 2008 and its contagion effects.  When the crisis hit, followed by a global recession, an expansionary fiscal policy was once again adopted, and this time it was particularly intense, despite the imbalances hitherto accumulated and the absence of fiscal space. In 2010, the budget deficit was above 11% of GDP and gross public debt was around 100% of GDP.At the same time, in the banking sector, the accumulation of non-performing loans resulting from the volume and quality of credit granted in the decade 2000-2010 and the effects of the financial crisis weakened banks' balance sheets increasing their vulnerability and the constraints faced by the Portuguese economy.At EU level, the sovereign debt crisis in the euro area brought to the forefront the failures in EMU economic governance, and exposed the particular vulnerability of euro area Member States to changes in markets’ sovereign risk perception. The high and rising level of external indebtedness (gross external debt represented 226.7% of GDP at the end of 2010), coupled with a weak performance of potential output, fuelled investors’ concerns about Portugal’s ability to pay back its debt. Domestic banks and the government found it increasingly difficult to obtain external financing: banks had to turn to the Eurosystem, whereas public debt was increasingly placed in domestic banks.This situation ultimately resulted in Portugal’s inability to fund itself in the international financial markets in the first half of 2011, after the 10-year yields had nearly doubled those of the previous year, reaching over 9%. Recourse to external official financing under a financial assistance programme became, once again, unavoidable. The Economic and Financial Assistance Programme was agreed in May 2011 between the Portuguese authorities, the EU and the IMF and expired on 30 June 2014.Remarkable progress has been achieved during and after the 2011-2014 adjustment programme:•The budget deficit significantly declined and public debt was put on a downward trend;•Private sector deleveraging is ongoing; and•The banking sector is more robust, with a stronger liquidity position, higher solvency ratios and improved asset quality.The Portuguese adjustment programme has widely been regarded as a success story. In my view, this success was due to three factors:•Programme ownership. Portugal was committed to the programme’s implementation, its urgency was understood and accepted by the general public and there was a constructive dialogue with social partners;•The speed and intensity of the response from the tradable sector, in particular exports, was key to the rapid rebalancing of the external accounts and mitigation of the impact of lower domestic demand on the non-tradable sector;•The preservation of confidence in the banking sector, as evidenced by the behaviour of deposits, was crucial to preventing the economy from collapsing with a credit crunch and avoiding the imposition of capital controls.However, notwithstanding the undisputed progress made, several vulnerabilities and important challenges still remain. Although the level of indebtedness in the Portuguese economy and asset quality on credit institutions’ balance sheets have evolved favourably, there is no room for complacency. It is imperative to ensure budgetary discipline and continue the deleveraging process of the private sector and the strengthening of the banking sector.
Reducing the high levels of indebtedness, in parallel with creating conditions that allow investment to increase (both in quantity and in quality), is essential for improving the Portuguese economy’s current situation. The experience of the past 40 years teaches us thatthe initial impact from an assistance programme will only be sustainable if there are structural changes that foster higher potential growth.A long-lasting improvement in the economic welfare of the Portuguese depends crucially on the maintenance of a sustainable macroeconomic framework that provides suitable incentives for economic agents and on following a reform agenda that supports long-term sustainable growth.Table 2 - The Portuguese economy in 1995-2018: Some key figuresSources: Banco de Portugal, National Statistics Institute, Eurostat(1) Non-financial private sector                                            (2) In the first column, average corresponds to the period 1999-2007                                              (3) Nominal.

Exchange rate regime: the euro and potential growthThe introduction of the euro has eliminated the uncertainty associated with exchange rate fluctuations. In fact, one of the biggest advantages of the single currency is that it neutralises the “external factor” thereby contributing to increased stability. Yet, at the same time, it eliminates the possibility of recourse to the exchange rate instrument to manage competitiveness problems even when they result from internal factors.In fact, prior to the introduction of the euro, whenever the economic side “failed”, the exchange rate instrument allowed (directly) competitiveness to be restored and (indirectly) a real depreciation of public and private debt through the inflation that resulted from currency devaluation. With the single currency and the single monetary policy it is no longer possible to use currency devaluation to offset productivity differentials or real appreciations resulting from inflation differences and to restore the competitiveness and employment of a given economy. It is also no longer possible to resort to financial repression through debt devaluation, with the consequent transfer of wealth from creditors to debtors, in particular to the public sector. Excessive leverage requires financial adjustment by debtors, so that creditors are not penalised.The euro also eliminates the anaesthetising effect of the exchange rate. In fact, with the loss of the exchange rate “crutch”, price and wage deviations have an impact on the unemployment rate and productivity deviations accelerate the perception of the structural weaknesses of the economy and the need for reform. Therefore, the single currency makes the need for adequate policies, sound public finances and financial discipline of private actors more visible. It requires institutions and policies that are fit for purpose in the new context.
This means that, although exchange rate stability or a single currency are important for generating favourable conditions for optimising economic growth, they are not the determining factors. Those factors are the quality of the policies and institutions and the way resources are allocated between the tradable and the non-tradable sectors of the economy. And they are not intrinsic to the exchange rate regime.In Portugal, the history of the past 25 years teaches us that imbalances were caused by the combination of excessive indebtedness and weak potential growth.It also teaches us that easy access to credit coupled with insufficient quality of institutions and policies have constrained potential growth.As I have already stressed above, the prospect of adopting the euro translated into increased access to capital from the mid-1990s. However, resulting capital inflows were misallocated, leading to macroeconomic imbalances. The banking system channelled foreign funds to domestic residents, leading to a strong increase in consumption and investment and a consequent deterioration in the current account,without a corresponding expansion of the economy’s growth potential. Indeed, the investment surge financed through the credit expansion was mainly channelled towards non-tradable sectors, hampering productivity and potential GDP growth. On average, in the period 1995-2007, Gross Fixed Capital Formation in the non-tradable sector represented more than 60% of total GFCF, amounting to 15.2% of GDP.In my opinion, the real challenge Portugal is currently confronted with is that of generating and maintaining high levels of employment and productivity to ensure a lasting trajectory of growth and convergence with its EU partners.Starting from a very low base, Portugal experienced a long period of real convergence, from 1960to the mid-1990s, with a clear upward trend in Portuguese GDP per capita as a percentage of the EU15. By contrast, evidence points to no progress in real convergence of the Portuguese economy over the last 25 years, associated with ongoing unfavourable developments in relative Total Factor Productivity in a context where the contribution of the capital stock – which supported real convergence in the previous period – declined significantly.The resumption of the convergence process of the Portuguese economy is a complex and demanding task, namely in view of the challenges posed by demographic trends and rapid technological change. A lasting trajectory of growth and convergence towards our European partners depends on our ability:•To promote efficient resource allocation, namely through sustained maximisation of investment returns, and reallocation towards the tradable sector;•To reach higher levels of productivity;•To generate and maintain high levels of employment; and•To ensure that the combination of capital and labour generates an output that is desired and valued by the market. 6. Lessons and challengesLet me now turn to some major lessons that I believe can be drawn from Portugal’s participation in the EMU, as well as some challenges for countries in a monetary union.First of all, we can speculate as to how it was possible that high current account deficits persisted for several years in Portugal and in a number of other euro area countries without financial markets questioning these countries’ ability to repay their increasing debts.In fact, for a number of years, the dominant view in academic and policy circles, as well as in financial markets, was what we might call the “benign view”. According to this view, current account imbalances were the expected result of deeper integration among countries with different levels of economic development and, in a monetary union, a current account deficit reflecting the financial balance of the private sector would be no cause for concern. Credit risk monitoring would ensure adequate risk-pricing, and there would be no aggregate (and thus policy-relevant) macroeconomic imbalance.However, the assumptions underlying the benign approach turned out to be highly unrealistic and misleading from a policy perspective. With the benefit of hindsight, it is clear that a more “prudent view” was warranted. Over-optimistic expectations about future growth prospects and short-sightedness, weak domestic institutions and real and financial frictions should have made a strong case for policy intervention aimed at mitigating the boom-bust pattern of monetary integration.
The buffers that would have resulted from lower public debt and stronger capital in the banking sector would have put the converging economies on a much sounder footing to face the financial storm. Also, a more ambitious and consistent approach to structural reform would have left these economies better equipped to face the challenges of globalisation and ageing.In a monetary union, the problem is not the potential lack of foreign exchange reserves to address balance of payments imbalances but the sustainability of debt of the various sectors of the economy. The question arises over the financial capacity of each sector to service and roll over debt, and to respond to new financing needs. The same reasoning applies to Member States themselves, within a framework where there is no bail-out mechanism.The biggest challenge for a country that enters a monetary union is the sustainability of policies. Policy authorities need to closely monitor economic developments, to read the signs and to stand ready to “sail against the wind”. This means that economic policies have to be more restrictive when there is a need to contain excessive credit growth and the indebtedness of the private sector is mounting. Policy-makers must not fall into the temptation of drifting along with the current because access to funding is easier and cheaper and the available volumes are higher. Above all, it is important that policy-makers are not dazzled by the initial advantages of the single currency. If accompanied by a complacent attitude, these advantages can become a trap and a risk to economic sustainability.7. Concluding remarksIn short, the balance of the Portuguese experience with the euro is very positive and has represented a key regime change. The euro promoted a move towards a regime characterised by structurally lower and less volatile interest and inflation rates and led to important structural changes in the Portuguese economy.For the EU as a whole, the creation of the single currency 20 years ago was a pivotal moment in the history of European integration. Since then, we have come a long way but there is still a long way to go. In recent years, in response to the difficulties arising from the financial crisis, there have been profound changes in the EMU rules and architecture aimed at making it more balanced and more resilient to shocks. However, EMU still has significant weaknesses and remains incomplete in some key areas, such as the Banking Union and the Capital Markets Union.The EMU results from a sharing of sovereignty between Member States. Its construction is based on permanent negotiation and approximation of different starting positions, safeguarding national cultures and identities while guaranteeing a sense of belonging and a “group identity”. This implies an institutional framework with a great capacity to understand and manage differences and to facilitate the interaction between the interest of the whole and the specific of the parts, in order to ensure that the former is greater than the sum of the latter.EMU also requires mutual trust, where responsibility and solidarity go hand in hand.It is therefore important that Member States continue to work together in a committed way to complete the journey that started in 1999 so that European citizens can fully profit from the benefits of their common currency.The prospect of Croatia entering ERM II and subsequently adopting the euro is undoubtedly a very welcome development in this collective endeavour.Thank you.[1] As prepared for delivery[2] The ECU central rate was set at about 1.4% below the market rate prevailing at the time.[3] Santos, D., R.

SpeechAn Economic UpdatePhilip Lowe GovernorAddress to the Armidale Business Chamber Armidale – 24 September 2019I would like to thank the Armidale Business Chamber for the invitation to speak this evening. I grewup in regional New South Wales – in Cootamundra and Wagga Wagga – so it is a treat for me tohave been invited to speak in another great regional city. Thank you.Tonight, I would like to provide you with an economic update. I will focus first on the global situationand then talk about the Australian economy. And finally, I will make some remarks about monetarypolicy.The main message on the global economy is that while it is still growing reasonably well, the risksare increasingly tilted to the downside. The main source of these downside risks are geopoliticaldevelopments in many parts of the world. These developments are creating considerable uncertaintyand this uncertainty is causing businesses to reconsider their spending plans. This is making theinternational environment more challenging for us.On the Australian economy, there are two main messages.The first is that after having been through a soft patch, a gentle turning point has been reached.While we are not expecting a return to strong economic growth in the near term, we are expectinggrowth to pick up. Against this backdrop, the main source of domestic uncertainty continues to bethe strength of household spending.The second message is a longer-term one. And that is the fundamental factors underpinning thelonger-term outlook for the Australian economy remain strong. One of the ongoing challenges weface as a country is to capitalise on those strong fundamentals.The Global Economy[*]
This first graph shows global economic growth and the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) forecastsfor the next few years (Graph 1). Looking at this graph, one might ask why the concern: globalgrowth has been stable and reasonable over recent times and the IMF is forecasting this to continueover the next couple of years. If this forecast were to come to pass, that would make for 12 years ofsolid growth.Graph 1Looking at labour markets, one might also ask why the concern. Unemployment rates in mostadvanced economies are the lowest they have been in many decades, and businesses are finding itmore difficult to fill jobs (Graph 2). These tighter labour markets are finally translating into strongerwages growth, with wages now increasing at close to the rates seen before the financial crisis insome countries. With inflation remaining low, this pick-up in wage growth is translating into realwage increases and strong growth in household spending.
Graph 2So why the concern?The answer is the increased downside risks generated by various geopolitical developments. Themost prominent of these are the trade and technology disputes between the United States andChina. Others include: the Brexit issue, developments in the Middle East, the problems in Hong Kongand the tensions between Japan and South Korea.The US–China disputes, in particular, are having a disruptive effect on international trade flows. Overthe past year there has been no growth at all in international trade, despite the global economygrowing at a reasonable rate (Graph 3). This weakness on the trade front is flowing through tofactory output, with growth in industrial production slowing considerably.
Graph 3More broadly, though, the geopolitical concerns are creating considerable uncertainty about thefuture. This can be seen in measures of economic policy uncertainty constructed from news stories inleading media around the world (Graph 4).
Graph 4In the face of this uncertainty, it is not surprising that many businesses are preferring to wait beforecommitting to significant investments; they are inclined to sit on their hands for a while and see howthings play out. This is evident in the surveys of business investment intentions, which have fallenconsiderably (Graph 5). The effect is also evident in June quarter GDP figures, with GDP declining inGermany, the United Kingdom and Singapore.
Graph 5A particular concern is that if this uncertainty continues, businesses might decide not only to deferinvestment, but to also defer hiring. Of course, it is also possible that some of these uncertainties willbe resolved. If this were to happen, the global economy could grow quite strongly as firms caught upon their capital spending in an environment of easy financial conditions.Notwithstanding this possibility, as the downside risks have come more clearly into focus, there hasbeen a marked shift in the outlook for monetary policy globally. Almost all major central banks areexpected to ease monetary policy over the year ahead, with the United States Federal Reserve andthe European Central Bank having already moved in this direction (Graph 6). Given that inflation islow – and forecast to remain low – investors are also expecting central banks to maintain veryaccommodative settings of monetary policy for years to come.
Graph 6This expectation has had a major effect on long-term bond yields around the world. In Europe andJapan, investors are paying governments to hold their money for them (Graph 7). The SwissGovernment, for example, can borrow for 30 years at a negative interest rate of 0.5 per cent. For theworld as a whole, around a quarter of the total stock of government bonds on issue has negativeyields. And where yields are in positive territory, they are at very low levels and in many cases at thelowest on record.
Graph 7All this is making for a challenging international environment.The Australian EconomyI would now like to move to the Australian economy.Over recent times, our economy has been going through a soft patch. Over the year to June, GDPgrew by just 1.4 per cent, which is the slowest year-ended growth for some years (Graph 8). We didnot expect this slowdown, so it has come as a bit of a surprise.Graph 8It is important, though, that we keep things in perspective. The economic expansion in Australia hasnow been running for 28 years. That is quite an achievement. Over such a long expansion, there aregoing to be ebbs and flows in growth. There are also going to be periods where growth is strongerthan expected – as it was in the first half of 2018 – and other periods, like now, where growth isweaker than expected.With the benefit of hindsight, there are a few factors that help explain the slowing in the Australianeconomy over the past year.
One is the international developments that I spoke about earlier. While Australia has been lessdirectly affected by the US–China trade disputes than have many other countries, there is an indirecteffect through slower global growth and increased global uncertainty.A second and more important factor is weak consumption growth.Over the past year, there has been no growth at all in consumption per person, which is an unusualoutcome at a time when employment is growing strongly (Graph 9). An important part of theexplanation here is that household disposable income has been increasing only slowly for anextended period, reflecting both subdued wage increases and strong growth in taxes paid.Graph 9The persistence of slow growth in household income has led many people to reassess how fast theirincomes will increase in the future. As they have done this, they have also reassessed their spending,particularly on discretionary items, which has been quite weak over recent times (Graph 10). Notsurprisingly, spending on household essentials has been much less affected.Graph 10Another part of the explanation for weak growth in household spending is the adjustment in thehousing market. As housing prices have fallen, there has been a marked decline in housing turnover,with the turnover rate having declined to the lowest level in more than 20 years (Graph 11). Withfewer of us moving homes, spending on new furniture and household appliances has been quite soft.So too has expenditure on moving costs and real estate fees. More broadly, the correction in thehousing market has also affected the economy through its impact on residential construction activity.Graph 11A third factor contributing to the slower growth has been the drought.Across the Murray-Darling Basin, including here in the Northern Tablelands, farmers have facedextremely dry conditions. Indeed, as indicated in this graph, in some areas conditions have been thedriest on record (Graph 12). Reflecting this, farm output in Australia has fallen for the past two yearsand there has been a sharp drop in farm income as farmers have had to cope with the increasedcosts for obtaining feed and water. These difficult conditions have contributed to the weakness inoverall household incomes and consumption, and the effects are particularly felt in regionalcommunities. The drought has also put upward pressure on food prices over the past year,particularly for bread, milk and meat. We are all hoping that the drought breaks soon.

This is especially so taking into account the labour market data, which continue to painta stronger picture of the economy than the GDP data.Over recent times, employment growth has been stronger than was expected. Over the past year,the number of people with a job increased by 2½ per cent (Graph 13). Reconciling this with GDPgrowth of just 1½ per cent remains a challenge, because, normally, output growth exceedsemployment growth, rather than falls short. We are seeking to understand what is going on here. Itis possible that it is just measurement noise, but we can't yet rule out something more structural.Graph 13The other striking feature of the labour market over recent times has been a large increase in laboursupply. In particular, there has been a material lift in the labour force participation by women and byolder Australians (Graph 14). As a result, the increase in labour supply has more than outstripped theincrease in labour demand. Reflecting this and despite the strong employment growth, theunemployment rate has moved higher since the start of the year to 5¼ per cent.Graph 14This increase in labour supply is a positive development, but it does mean that it is proving quitedifficult to generate a tight labour market with the flow-on consequence that wage increases remainsubdued. Over the past year, the Wage Price Index increased by just 2.3 per cent (Graph 15). This isa pick-up from the rates of recent years, but the lift in wages growth looks to have stalled recently.Another relevant factor here is the ongoing caps on wage increases in the public sector.Graph 15Low wages growth is one of the factors contributing to low inflation outcomes. Over the year toJune, inflation was 1.6 per cent, in both headline and underlying terms (Graph 16). Anothercontributing factor is the adjustment in the housing market, with rents increasing at the slowest ratein decades and declines being recorded in the price of building a new home in some cities(Graph 17). Another factor is various government initiatives to address cost-of-living pressures, withthese initiatives pushing down inflation in administered prices. The price rises for utilities are also
much lower than over recent years. Working in the other direction, the drought and the depreciationof the exchange rate have been pushing up retail prices over the past year.Graph 16Graph 17Looking forward, there are some signs that, after a soft patch, the economy has reached a gentleturning point. This is evident in the fact that GDP growth over the first half of this year was strongerthan it was over the second half of last year (Graph 8). We are expecting a further modest pick-up inthe quarters ahead.This outlook is supported by a number of developments, including lower interest rates, the recent taxcuts, the depreciation of the Australian dollar, ongoing spending on infrastructure, the stabilisation ofthe housing markets in some cities and a brighter outlook for the resources sector. It is reasonableto expect that, together, these factors will see growth in the Australian economy return to around itstrend rate next year, although there are some obvious risks to this outlook.One factor that should help is an expected pick-up in household disposable income. Manyhouseholds are currently receiving larger tax refunds due to the low and middle income tax offset.These payments will boost aggregate household income by 0.6 per cent this year. Past experiencesuggests that around half of these tax refunds will be spent over coming quarters. Householddisposable income is also being boosted by lower interest rates, although the effect is uneven acrossthe community, with lower rates reducing the income of those households who rely on interestincome. Household spending should also be supported by an increase in housing turnover. Workingin the other direction, though, is a further contraction in residential construction activity.Another positive element is likely to come from the resources sector. Mining investment is expectedto increase over the next year, after having declined for six years as the LNG investment boomwound down (Graph 18). Mining companies are increasing their investment not only to sustain theircurrent production levels but, in some cases, to expand capacity as well. There has also been a pick-up in exploration activity. To be clear, we are not predicting a return to boom-time conditions in theresources sector. But we are predicting better times for the sector ahead.Graph 18Business investment elsewhere in the economy is also expected to move higher. Earlier I discussedhow uncertainty globally is affecting the outlook for investment in many countries. Fortunately, wedon't see the same spike in the measure of policy uncertainty in Australia that I showed in the earliergraph for the world economy. There has, however, been some softening in measures of businessconditions – from well above average to around average.
The investment outlook is being supported by a solid pipeline of infrastructure projects. This ongoinginvestment in infrastructure is not only supporting demand in the economy at a time when this isneeded, but it is also adding to the supply capacity of the economy and directly improving people'slives, including through providing better services and reducing transport congestion.Together, it is reasonable to expect that these various factors will see annual growth pick up fromhere. Apart from the international uncertainties, the main source of uncertainty around this outlookcontinues to be the strength of household spending. It remains the case that a sustained pick-up inhousehold spending will require faster growth in household incomes than we have seen over recenttimes.As we grapple with these issues, it is important that we do not lose sight of the fact that theAustralian economy has strong fundamentals.Australia is fortunate in having enviable endowments of natural resources, both in terms of mineralsand agricultural land. We have a reputation as a highly reliable supplier and a producer of high-quality clean food. We also have close links with the rapidly growing countries of Asia. Three of thefour most populous countries in the world – China, India and Indonesia – are in our neighbourhood.And our ties with these countries are strengthened by the many people from there who live, workand study in Australia.Our demographics are also reasonably favourable. Our population is aging less quickly than that ofmany other advanced economies. The population is also growing relatively rapidly for an advancedeconomy – 1.7 per cent a year, compared with 0.6 per cent in the United States and decliningpopulations in some countries in north Asia and Europe. Immigration has been a strong contributorto this: almost half of us were born overseas or have at least one parent who was born overseas.While we have struggled to meet the infrastructure needs that come with this growing population, itdoes bring a dynamism that is not easily matched in countries with declining populations.We also have a highly talented, flexible and adaptive workforce. We have strong public institutions, awell-established macroeconomic framework, and the rule of law is respected. There is also ademonstrated record of responsible fiscal policy and low public debt. And, finally we benefit fromhaving both a flexible exchange rate and a flexible labour market. So, our fundamentals are strong.The challenge we face is to fully capitalise on these fundamentals. If we can do this then I amconfident that we can, once again, experience strong growth in real incomes in Australia.Monetary PolicyI would like to finish with some remarks about monetary policy.As you would be aware, the Reserve Bank Board lowered the cash rate in June and July to a new lowof 1 per cent. Financial markets are pricing in further reductions in the cash rate over the next year.Our decisions – and the expectations of investors about the future – reflect both international anddomestic factors.
On the international front, as I discussed earlier, interest rates around the world are low and theyare moving lower. There are many reasons for this, but the central reason is that the global appetiteto save is elevated relative to the global appetite to use those savings to invest in new productivecapital. When lots of people want to save and there is not much demand for those savings, saversearn low returns.We live in an interconnected world, which means that we cannot completely insulate ourselves fromlong-lasting shifts in global interest rates. Our floating exchange rate gives us a degree of monetaryindependence, but we can't ignore structural shifts in global interest rates. If we did seek to ignorethese shifts, our exchange rate would appreciate, which, in the current environment, would beunhelpful in terms of achieving both the inflation target and full employment.As I have spoken about on other occasions, the key to more normal interest rates globally isaddressing the factors that are leading to a depressed appetite to invest relative to the appetite tosave. Whether or not this will happen, time will tell. But as a small open economy, we have to takethe world and global interest rates as we find them.On the domestic front, there has been an accumulation of evidence over recent times that theeconomy can sustain lower rates of unemployment and underemployment than previously thoughtlikely. The flexibility of labour supply also means that strong rates of employment growth can besustained without inflation becoming a problem. These are both positive developments.Inflation has been below the 2–3 per cent medium-term target range for some time now for thereasons that I spoke about earlier. Looking ahead, inflation is expected to pick up, but to remainbelow the midpoint of the target range for some time to come.The decisions to ease monetary policy in June and July were taken to help make more assuredprogress towards full employment and the inflation target. Further monetary easing may well berequired. While we are at a gentle turning point and expect growth to pick up, the strength anddurability of this pick-up remains to be seen.Regardless of the short-term outlook for monetary policy, the point about the solution to low globalrates is relevant here in Australia too. We will all be better off if businesses have the confidence toexpand, invest, innovate and hire people. Given Australia's strong fundamentals, this is not out ofour reach, but it does require constant effort.At our Board meeting next week, we will again take stock of the evidence. It is nevertheless likelythat an extended period of low interest rates will be required in Australia to make progress inreducing unemployment and achieving more assured progress towards the inflation target. TheBoard is prepared to ease monetary policy further if needed to support sustainable growth in theeconomy, make further progress towards full employment, and achieve the inflation target over time.Thank you for listening. I look forward to answering your questions.Endnotes

Luis de Guindos: Measures to support monetary policytransmission through banksWelcome address by Mr Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the European Central Bank, to theMoney Market Contact Group, Frankfurt am Main, 24 September 2019.*   *   *In its most recent policy meeting, the ECB’s Governing Council decided on a comprehensiveeasing package because the downward revisions in the projected inflation path warranted avigorous policy response.The easing package comprised five measures: lowering the deposit facility rate, strengtheningthe forward guidance on the likely path of policy rates, restarting the net asset purchases withinthe asset purchase programme, changing the terms of the third series of targeted longer-termrefinancing operations (TLTRO III) and introducing a two-tier system for reserve remuneration.We believe that the measures announced last week complement each other and togetherconstitute an effective response to the environment that the ECB currently faces.These decisions were taken against the following background. First, as a result of continuedglobal uncertainties and their impact on confidence, our latest ECB staff macroeconomicprojections were revised down. We face a more protracted economic slowdown than previouslyanticipated and see persistent downside risks to the growth outlook. Second, inflation continuesto fall short of expectations. Headline inflation remains well below our medium-term aim, whilecore inflation has been hovering around 1% for an extended period of time. Market-basedindicators of future inflation outcomes have stagnated at historical lows and the profile forheadline inflation has been revised down, leading to a further delay in the convergence of inflationtowards our aim. The case for a monetary policy response was clear and a comprehensivepackage of measures was judged to be the most effective response.I will take this opportunity to delve a little deeper into two of the measures that may be especiallyrelevant for the banking sector. The first is the changes to some of the parameters of the thirdseries of targeted longer-term refinancing operations – TLTRO III – and the second is theimplementation of a two-tier system for the remuneration of excess reserves.Changes to the TLTRO III programmeYou may recall that TLTRO III was announced in March to preserve the very favourable banklending conditions in the euro area and to ensure the smooth transmission of our highlyaccommodative monetary policy stance. At the same time, indexing the TLTRO III rates to themain refinancing operations rate and the deposit facility rate implies that, should the ECB adjustthese key interest rates, the average funding conditions under the programme would becorrespondingly adjusted for banks, thus helping to align this programme with the broadermonetary policy stance. The Governing Council made clear that the modalities of TLTRO IIIwould take into account a thorough assessment of the bank-based transmission channel ofmonetary policy, as well as developments in the economic outlook.The recent deterioration in the economic outlook prompted us to ease several of the terms of thenew operations. The Governing Council decided to eliminate the 10 basis point spread over thekey policy rates entailed in the initial pricing of the operations. In addition, the maturity of theoperations was extended from two to three years, and an early repayment option after two yearswas introduced. The adjustments to the TLTRO III parameters signal that the Governing Councilcan act in an agile manner and fine-tune its monetary policy instruments, as needed, to ensurethat they are efficient, effective and proportionate to the risks to price stability. 1 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
We believe that these changes represent a significant easing of banks’ medium-term fundingconditions, which in turn should contribute to improving the lending conditions banks offer to thereal economy. The more accommodative pricing should strengthen support for bank funding, sothat banks continue to offer loans to firms and households on favourable terms. The extendedmaturity of TLTRO III will be better aligned with bank-based financing of investment projects,thereby further supporting banks’ financing to the real economy. Finally, in view of the lengthenedmaturity, the option to voluntarily repay the amounts borrowed before maturity at a quarterlyfrequency will provide greater flexibility for banks’ funding plans.The two-tier systemLet me now turn to the second measure. Banks in the euro area continue to benefit from thenegative interest rate policy through the larger intermediation volumes and lower credit risk forborrowers associated with more favourable macroeconomic developments. This has helpedsupport bank profitability across the euro area since the deposit facility rate turned negative in2014. In addition, banks have been able to generate higher non-interest income as thecompression of yields is reflected in higher asset valuations. Banks’ funding costs in wholesalemarkets have also decreased, mitigating the impact of lower rates on net interest income.However, the negative interest rate policy also entails costs for banks, and these are likely toincrease the longer negative rates are in place, the lower policy rates are set and the larger theamount of excess liquidity.The Governing Council therefore decided to introduce a two-tier system for reserve remunerationin order to ensure that the accommodative monetary policy stance continues to translate intofavourable lending conditions, which is particularly important given that the European economy islargely bank-based.Under the two-tier system, part of each bank’s holdings of excess liquidity will be exempt fromthe negative deposit facility rate. The size of the exempted part of a bank’s reserve accounts willinitially be six times its minimum reserve requirement. This strikes a balance between twooutcomes. It offsets the direct cost of negative interest rates on banks’ profitability, therebyhelping to sustain the pass-through of low policy rates to bank lending. And it also preserves thepositive contribution of negative rates to the accommodative stance of monetary policy and thecontinued sustained convergence of inflation to our aim.There are several reasons why the initial value chosen for the multiplier was six times a bank’sminimum reserve requirement.First, it provides banks with some relief from negative rates. Based on current holdings ofexcess liquidity, the current calibration will entail annual savings for banks of about €4 billion.Second, it leaves the volume of non-exempt excess liquidity which is still remunerated at thedeposit facility rate at a level which is sufficiently large to ensure that money market ratesremain anchored to the ECB deposit facility rate. Given that minimum reserves are currentlyclose to €130 billion, the exempt tier would amount to some €800 billion, implying that thenon-exempt amount of excess reserves still remunerated at the negative deposit facility ratewould be approximately €1 trillion, down from €1.8 trillion.Third, it dampens the risk of money market rates becoming subject to upward pressure dueto the potential redistribution of excess liquidity among market participants to fill exemptionallowances. For example, the system may induce banks that have an unused exempt tier toincrease the amount they borrow from banks that hold more excess liquidity than theirexempt tier. If such transactions were to occur at higher rates than before, then we may seeupward pressure on certain money market rates. At this stage, we see very little evidence ofthis being priced in by the market, but the ECB will continue to actively monitor conditions inthe money market. 2 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
ConclusionAllow me to conclude. On 12 September the Governing Council decided on one of the mostbroad-based packages of monetary stimulus measures to date. Of the five measures in theoverall package, the two that I have discussed today may be particularly relevant for banks.These are the modification of the terms of TLTRO III and the introduction of a two-tier system forreserve remuneration given banks’ important role in monetary policy transmission. Bothmeasures will serve to mitigate the risk that the possible side effects of the ECB’saccommodative monetary policy stance on bank-based intermediation could undermine thesustained convergence of inflation to our aim. We are aiming to preserve favourable bank lendingconditions in the euro area to further support the accommodative stance of monetary policy andensure it is smoothly transmitted to the real economy. 3 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
Lael Brainard: Financial stabilityTestimony by Ms Lael Brainard, Member of the Board of Governors of the Federal ReserveSystem, before the House Financial Services Subcommittee on Consumer Protection andFinancial Institutions, US House of Representatives, Washington DC, 25 September 2019.*   *   *Thank you, Chairman Meeks, Ranking Member Luetkemeyer, and members of thesubcommittee. I appreciate the opportunity to be here today to discuss financial stability.The Federal Reserve’s Role in Promoting Financial StabilitySafeguarding financial stability is integral to achieving the Federal Reserve’s objectives of fullemployment and price stability. We need only look back a decade to see the dramatic damagefrom financial vulnerabilities that increased unchecked: millions of Americans lost their livelihoodsand their homes, businesses failed, and the government had to provide extraordinary support.We learned from this experience that we must be especially vigilant to fortify the resilience of ourfinancial system in good times when vulnerabilities may be building.Following the financial crisis, the Congress assigned important responsibilities for safeguardingthe stability of the financial system to domestic regulators. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reformand Consumer Protection Act created the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) toidentify, coordinate and respond to emerging threats to the financial system. The FederalReserve was assigned responsibility for enhanced supervision of systemic firms, and we haveplaced great emphasis on strengthening our approach to promoting financial stability.Safeguarding financial stability is a shared responsibility, requiring cooperation across U.S.regulatory agencies, as well as with foreign regulators and central banks. Chair Powellrepresents the Federal Reserve in the FSOC, where we participate alongside other domesticregulators and the Treasury, and I am pleased to be joined today by Dino Falaschetti of the Officeof Financial Research. We also participate in a variety of international forums, including theFinancial Stability Board, which Vice Chair Randal Quarles chairs, and where I serve as theFederal Reserve representative.The Board instituted a new organizational framework to carry out our responsibilities on financialstability. We created the Division of Financial Stability to strengthen our cross-disciplinaryapproach to the analysis of potential risks to the financial system and to support macroprudentialsupervision of large financial institutions. I serve as chair of the Committee on Financial Stability,which was created to guide staff work and make recommendations to the Board. We develop afinancial stability assessment four times per year that is discussed by the Board and the FederalOpen Market Committee.We have also taken steps to ensure transparency and accountability. Last year, I was pleasedthat the Board accepted my recommendation to publish a public Financial Stability Report twicea year. The report provides an account of our assessment of vulnerabilities as well as asummary of market participants’ views on potential risks to the financial system. Through thispublic communication, we hope to gain feedback from the broader financial stability communityand the public on threats to the financial system.How the Federal Reserve Approaches Financial StabilityOur approach to financial stability recognizes that the financial system and the broader economyare intertwined. The buildup of financial imbalances in good economic times has the potential toamplify shocks in a downturn and push the economy away from full employment and pricestability. When financial vulnerabilities build, adverse developments can lead to disruptions in12 1 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
credit and other financial services, potentially amplifying declines in employment and economicactivity. Our goal is to promote a resilient financial system that is able to continue meeting thedemands of households and businesses for financial services when faced with adverse events.Accordingly, we have developed a systematic forward-looking approach to assessing financialvulnerabilities that could amplify negative shocks, transmitting damage more broadly. Thehistorical record here and abroad points to several key areas of vulnerability. Vulnerabilities canbuild when there is excessive or poorly underwritten borrowing across many households, suchthat incomes are not keeping up with debt payments. Similarly, elevated levels of corporate debtcan create problems not only for the borrowers, but also for lenders, when the business cycleturns, and debt servicing obligations or refinancing prove challenging, leading businesses to pullback on investment and employment. Vulnerabilities historically have often been associated withconditions where asset prices are higher than what economic fundamentals support, oftenbecause of elevated risk appetite, potentially leading to much larger-than-expected losses shoulda sharp correction occur. Separately, we track leverage in the financial system for signs thatbanks and other financial intermediaries potentially have inadequate buffers of capital to absorbadverse shocks, increasing the risk of their distress and possible spillovers to the financialsystem. We also monitor funding risk in the financial system. Where banks or nonbank financialintermediaries fund long-term lending through potentially flighty short-term borrowing, it may posethe risk of a loss of confidence, precipitating a withdrawal of short-term funding and strains oninstitutions as they try to meet withdrawals.To illustrate, I will provide my brief assessment in each of these areas. In contrast to the yearspreceding the crisis, when household borrowing was growing at a pace far above that of grossdomestic product (GDP), it has since come down and is now growing more slowly than theeconomy overall. Moreover, while much of the increase before the crisis reflected borrowing thatproved unsustainable, more recent borrowing has been concentrated among households withstrong credit profiles. That said, the increase in student debt in recent years deserves attention,although not primarily through the prism of financial stability.The regulated financial sector is more resilient, owing to far-reaching reforms as well asfavorable conditions. Insurers appear generally well capitalized, and broker-dealers, includingthose not affiliated with large bank holding companies, have reduced their leverage in recentyears. In contrast, there has been some evidence of rising use of leverage by hedge funds overthe past couple of years. Large banks increased both the size and quality of their capital buffersfollowing the crisis, although the risk-weighted capital ratio at the largest banks has moved downsomewhat as payouts have exceeded earnings over the past couple of years.Financial reform has reduced funding risks associated with banks and money market funds.Large banks subject to liquidity regulation are less reliant on unstable short-term wholesalefunding and have thicker liquidity buffers. Money market reforms have also reduced funding risks.A range of asset prices remain high relative to historical benchmarks, even with the recentfinancial market volatility. In particular, yields on high-yield corporate bonds relative to Treasurysecurities remain somewhat narrow on a historical basis despite recent increases. Similarly,although they have moved up in recent months, spreads on leveraged loans remain in the bottomhalf of their range since the financial crisis, which is notable given the evidence of weakeningprotections. Finally, capitalization rates on commercial real estate properties, which measureannual income relative to prices for recently transacted properties, have been low relative toTreasury yields. In addition to generating losses for investors, declines in valuations could makeit more challenging for firms to obtain or extend financing—especially among risky, indebtedfirms—which in turn could be amplified by the high levels of risky corporate debt.Finally, business borrowing has risen more rapidly than GDP for much of the current expansionand now sits near its historical peak. The run-up in corporate debt has brought the ratio of debt to 2 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
assets close to its highest level in two decades on an overall basis, and this is also true forspeculative-grade and unrated firms. And whereas previously, mostly high-earning firms withrelatively low leverage were taking on additional debt, analysis of detailed balance sheetinformation indicates that firms with high leverage, high interest expense ratios, and low earningsand cash holdings have been increasing their debt loads the most. Historically, high leverage hasbeen linked to elevated financial distress and retrenchment by businesses in economicdownturns.Regarding corporate bonds outstanding, recent years have witnessed little change in the relativeshares of investment-grade bonds and high-yield bonds. Credit quality has deteriorated within theinvestment-grade segment, where the share of bonds rated at the lowest investment-grade levelhas reached near-record levels. As of mid-2019, just over half of investment-grade corporatebonds outstanding were at the lowest end of the investment-grade segment. In comparison, theshare of high-yield bonds outstanding that are rated “deep junk” has stayed flat at about one-thirdover the past few years, well below the financial crisis peak of 50 percent.In an economic downturn, widespread downgrades of these low-rated investment-grade bondsto speculative-grade ratings could induce some investors to sell them rapidly—for instance,because lower-rated bonds have higher regulatory capital requirements or because bond fundshave limits on the share of non-investment-grade bonds they hold. This concern may be highernow than in the past, since total assets under management in bond mutual funds have morethan doubled in the past decade, and these funds now hold about one-tenth of the corporatebond market. The redemption behavior of investors in these funds during a market correction isunclear.Further down the credit quality ladder, there has been sizable growth in leveraged lending,accompanied by a notable deterioration in underwriting standards. Net issuance of leveragedloans to risky borrowers grew rapidly last year and boosted leveraged loans outstanding to a levelexceeding $1 trillion overall, although the pace of issuance has slowed more recently as theinterest rate environment has shifted. While leveraged loans have traditionally had importantinvestor protections, covenants for leveraged loans issued in the past few years have weakeneddramatically, and they often include features that increase opacity and risk. A substantial share ofthe leveraged loans are packaged in collateralized loan obligations (CLOs) whose issuanceincreased sharply in 2018 and has since moderated somewhat. Many large banks originateleveraged loans with an intent to distribute, often to CLOs. While the direct exposures of thebanking system in the form of loan portfolios and warehousing exposures can be monitored,there are also indirect exposures, including through bank investments in CLOs and credit lines,which bear vigilance. By contrast, nonbank exposures are harder for us to track. To date, thedefault rate on leveraged loans has been at the low end of its historical range, and corporatecredit conditions have been favorable, with low interest expenses and low expected default rates.However, if spreads rise sharply or economic conditions deteriorate significantly, we could seedowngrades, refinancing challenges, rising delinquencies and defaults, and losses to investors.Recognizing that financial imbalances played a key role in each of the past three U.S. downturns,policy should seek to moderate financial vulnerabilities when they are likely to materiallyexacerbate an economic downturn, leading to deeper declines in output and higher levels ofunemployment. Both economic theory and econometric evidence point to the risk that excessesin corporate debt markets could amplify adverse shocks and contribute to job losses. Over-indebted businesses may face payment strains when earnings fall unexpectedly, and they mayrespond by pulling back on employment and investment. The slowdown in activity lowers investordemand for risky assets, thereby raising spreads and depressing valuations. As business lossesaccumulate, and delinquencies and defaults rise, banks are less willing or able to lend. Thisdynamic feeds on itself, potentially amplifying downside risks into more serious financial stressesor a downturn. 3 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
Recognizing this feedback loop between financial imbalances and the macroeconomy, inaddition to strong through-the-cycle regulatory requirements, our toolkit includes acountercyclical capital buffer (CCyB). The CCyB is intended to require the nation’s largest banksto build capital when conditions are favorable to sustain resilience for times when there iselevated risk of above-normal losses, which often follows periods of rapid asset priceappreciation or credit growth. CCyB requirements are intended to lean against rising risks at atime when the degree of monetary tightening needed to achieve the same goal could beinconsistent supporting full employment and target inflation. And they build resilience, unlikemonetary policy. Second, when conditions are favorable, the covered banks could build themodest additional buffer simply by moderately reducing payouts. Third, the CCyB is a simple,predictable, and slow-moving tool that applies equally across all large banks. It does not singleout shortfalls in particular banks or result in volatility in individual banks’ stressed capitalrequirements. Finally, the additional capital can be released when conditions deteriorate toensure the ability of large banks to lend into a downturn.The criteria for implementing the CCyB described in the Board’s framework of September 2016are calibrated so that the CCyB will be above its minimum value of zero about one-third of thetime, when financial vulnerabilities are assessed to be in the upper one-third of their historicaldistribution. The Board votes once a year on the level of the CCyB. The Board voted to set theCCyB at zero earlier this year. Many other jurisdictions have raised their CCyB above zero.Going forward, we will continue to monitor financial vulnerabilities closely, recognizing thepotential for such vulnerabilities to amplify any negative developments. We plan to share ourassessment with you in our next Financial Stability Report later in the year and look forward tohearing from you about any issues that warrant further monitoring.Thank you and I look forward to your questions.Federal Reserve Board www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/default.htm.

    Conference of the Chair BdF/PSE, Paris School of Economics Current Challenges of Monetary Policy September 24, 2019  Speechi by François Villeroy de Galhau, Governor of the Banque de France            Press contact: Mark Deen (mark.deen@banque-france.fr). 
Page 1 sur 11  Ladies and Gentlemen,  It is a particular pleasure to welcome you on the occasion of the 10th anniversary of the Chair Banque de France/PSE. All anniversaries are worthy of celebration, but the continued partnership of Banque de France with the Paris School of Economics is a particular reason for cheer. Over the past ten years, it has been a testimony of how academic research and economic policy making can reinforce each other. In the past ten years, thanks to their interaction, much has been done to make our financial environment more capable of reining in financial excesses. Thanks to both, we have introduced many new unconventional tools to implement monetary policy. But these changes have also brought new questions and new uncertainties, on which more academic research is needed. Hence, I would like to elaborate on two present challenges: the conduct of monetary policy in our current economic environment, and the interaction between monetary policy and financial stability. ** 1. Monetary Policy in the Face of New Challenges  1.1. A New Environment Calling for New Responses These new uncertainties arise at a time when the global economic environment has itself become increasingly uncertain. In the short term, many of the uncertainties obstructing the economic outlook – and especially the manufacturing sector – are man-made – and even one-man made. Contingencies that not so long ago appeared as tail risks, such as the possibility of an escalation of trade tensions or a disorderly Brexit, have become looming threats. But uncertainty also pertains to long-term structural trends. Over the past decade, the world economy has steadily recovered from the global financial 
Page 2 sur 11  crisis. But it has not returned to its pre-crisis normal. Interest rates remain at historical lows, due to a historically low level of the natural rate of interest R*ii.  In the short run, this analysis – uncertainty as the first trigger of the present slowdown – should guide our ranking of policy answers. Monetary policy plays its role, but it should not – less than ever – be the only game in town. It should not even be the first game in town. The first response would be for government-driven uncertainties to be addressed directly by governments, by removing the self-induced threats to world growth. Failing that, a second answer is for fiscal policy to step in. Fiscal stimulus from countries with fiscal space would both stimulate aggregate demand, and, with targeted, quality investment, increase long-term growth.iii Wage increases in countries that have long relied on wage moderation could also help in bolstering aggregate demand and inflation. And pro-growth reforms would raise R*.  Monetary policy provides a third response. For the past ten years, there is little doubt that ECB monetary policy under Mario Draghi’s Presidency has made a decisive contribution not only to safeguarding the euro in 2012, but also to the significant recovery of the euro area since 2013. Over this period, more than 10 million jobs have been created. Our unconventional measures are estimated to add almost 2 percentage points of growth and of inflation between 2016 and 2020. Since I am talking to an audience of researchers I should of course emphasise that such numbers are subject to uncertainty.  However, the most recent monetary policy decisions of the Governing Council have given rise to many comments. My rule of conduct has been to not add mine in the heat of the moment. Two weeks later, let me only say that I supported many elements of the package, including the strengthening of the state-dependent forward guidance and the welcome introduction of a tiering system, similar to those in all other jurisdictions with negative interest rates. But I was not in favour of the resumption of net asset purchases at this time, because I thought that further purchases are unnecessary right now, given 
Page 3 sur 11  the very low levels of both long-term interest rates and term premia, which have continued to decrease significantly since we stopped net purchases last December. The main purpose of QE is to extract more duration risk from the bond market; indeed, term premia have already been successfully compressed – the term premium on a 10-year OIS is estimated to be significantly negative at around -60 to -100 bp. I also think that the significant strengthening of our forward guidance, the consequent prolongation of the reinvestment period for the very important stock of QE assets – 2600 billion euros –, and the DFR cut, were already a powerful and consistent combination. The forward guidance now states that we expect rates to remain at their present levels, or lower, until the inflation outlook robustly converges to a level sufficiently close to, but below, 2%, and this convergence has been consistently reflected in underlying inflation dynamics: our forward guidance is now strongly “state based”, reflecting our enhanced commitment to reach our objective. This is significant progress that has been overshadowed by the arguments over QE.  For me, it is not a question of a shifting balance between hawks and doves – I have never found ornithological categorisation to be of much help in designing monetary policy. It is a question of pragmatic and objective economic analysis, which takes market expectations as useful indicators but is not dependent on them. But whatever the debate in the Governing Council has been, let us now look forward and stress one simple message that has unanimous agreement: monetary policy has, once more, done its duty. It is now up to other policy makers to do theirs, starting with the fiscal authorities. As Mario Draghi pointed out yesterday in front of the European parliament, “We need a coherent economic strategy in the euro area that complements and enhances the effectiveness of monetary policy”. 1.2 Specific Challenges for Monetary Policy 
Page 4 sur 11  This is not however a call for self-congratulation: we have to do our homework on some renewed research questions, where we cannot live with our old metrics and our present lack of knowledge. For that, we need more than ever your research and our dialogue. First, the measurement of key structural determinants remains surrounded with uncertainty. I mentioned the uncertainty surrounding the trend in R*. But similar uncertainty pertains to the measurement of potential output and the natural level of unemployment U*iv. We should also intensively work on the economic effects of climate change as a long-term but significant shock, and its interaction with monetary policy. How to best measure inflation expectations is a second key issue. We know that expectations are key determinants of inflation, but it remains unclear what the most relevant measures of inflation expectations are. Expectations of professional forecasters (at 1,7 %) and market-based measures (at 1,3 %) have received most of the attention until now, but the expectations of firms as well as households – which can be significantly higher – matter at least as much for aggregate demand and price-setting. As Benoît Coeuré rightly stressed last July, more research is needed on what their expectations are, and how they form them.v  Third, there is still much we do not know about how firms and households form expectations on future interest rates, and on how these expectations affect their spending decisions. We know that standard DSGE models tend to assume too much foresight from private agents. How to incorporate more realistic behavior is a central issue, especially when forecasting the effects of our new instruments such as forward guidancevi. To be sure, some uncertainty over the response of the economy to our policies will always remain, especially when firms and households are themselves still learning how our new measures affect the economy, and how to live with very low or negative interest rates.vii 
Page 5 sur 11  A last topic deserves, I believe, particular attention: the possible side-effects of our monetary tools on financial stability, especially the effects of unconventional monetary policies.   2. Monetary Policy and Financial Stability 2.1 Prudential Policies and Monetary Policy are Complements not Substitutes To address concerns over financial stability, regulation and supervision, both microprudential and macroprudential, are of course available and essential. On financial regulation, ten years after the financial crisis, we must resist the temptation to unpick what has been done, and the complacency to believe that “this time is different”. Macroprudential policy is essential to foster financial stability. However, macroprudential policies have their limits. To start with, as of today, our toolkit is very much bank-centric. We are making some progress to extend macroprudential policy beyond the banking sector. But we should acknowledge that we are not there yet and that this is becoming a pressing issue as the non-banking sector is developing in reaction to the macrofinancial environment and changes in the regulation framework. In addition, as our macroprudential arsenal is still rather new and untested, uncertainty remains on the quantitative magnitude of the effects of our interventionsviii. Experience will teach us how to adapt and adjust our policies over time, but uncertainty will remain a feature of real-world policy-making. Finally, we should refrain from hubris: over time, we will design a more comprehensive macroprudential toolkit and learn to make the best use of it. But while macroprudential policies can certainly contribute a lot, some root causes of financial crises will remain out of their reach and macroprudential policies alone would fall short of achieving financial stability. 
Page 6 sur 11  If prudential policies have limitations, it is legitimate to ask whether monetary policy should take into account financial stability concerns or even assist prudential policies. To be sure, monetary policy has drawbacks as an instrument to foster financial stability. In particular, it cannot target specific risks. But as Jeremy Stein noted, the bluntness of the tool is also its strength: it affects all financial players.ix Let me take a step back. Central banks have an operational independence but they do not decide their own mandate. The mandate given to the Eurosystem is clear: our primary objective is price stability. However, our mandate states that we “shall contribute to the smooth conduct of policies pursued by the competent authorities relating to the prudential supervision of credit institutions and the stability of the financial system”x. Careful attention to the dynamics of the indebtedness of households, firms, and financial intermediaries would also be in line with the intellectual tradition of the Eurosystem. Since its inception, the ECB has always given special attention to broad financial aggregates in setting the course of monetary policy. It was emphasised by its monetary pillar and is now emphasised by its monetary analysis. Restricting attention to measures of liquid liabilities such as M3 has probably little justification today in view of the little direct relevance of monetary aggregates for price developments. But the relevance of broader and more varied credit aggregates is beyond question for both price and financial stability concerns. Together with asset prices, they could constitute the base of a revised credit and financial pillar.xi  2.2 The Separation Principle becomes less relevant with a multifaceted monetary policy The link between monetary policy and financial stability raises two questions. First, what are the quantitative effects of monetary policy instruments on financial stability? We have enough evidence by now that interest rate policies can have effects on indebtedness, risk-taking (through maturity transformation, 
Page 7 sur 11  search for yield, or other channels) and the profitability of financial actors. It would therefore be short-sighted to ignore the side effects of monetary policy on financial stability. Second, are these effects large enough to make it possible to preserve financial stability without compromising price stability? At this point, the precise terms of a possible trade-off are still being debated.xii The issues are complex: as Nuno Coimbra here at PSE emphasises in a paper with Hélène Rey, a decrease in interest rates can encourage risk-taking when interest rates are low, but discourage it when interest rates are high.xiii We need more work on this important issue. Let me just suggest two thoughts on this open issue.  a/ Incorporating Financial Stability Concerns with an Extended Monetary Toolkit First, the binary opposition between the traditional separation principle and “leaning against the wind’’ makes less sense when monetary policy has itself several instruments at its disposal. A median way, which we could call “coordinated” or “integrated” is possible. Indeed, that several instruments can allow to pursue several objectives is just what the old Tinbergen rule asserts. This is particularly relevant within monetary policy in our current context. Over the past years we have brought innovations to our operational framework, and we have considerably extended our toolkit with balance-sheet policies such as quantitative easing and (T)LTROs. Like our time-honed interest-rate policy, these balance-sheet policies were introduced with price-stability objectives in mind. But now that our extended toolkit has brought us new degrees of freedom, it is valuable to think of how this new flexibility could be used in the long-run to minimise financial stability risks without compromise to price stability. Let me illustrate it with the example of tiering. The tiering system we have decided upon will allow our interest rate policy to deliver price stability without trading it off against financial stability. Far from entering into conflict with price stability, tiering will actually also ensure that our policies have their intended 
Page 8 sur 11  effect on price stability, by alleviating the risk of a reduced pass-through of our policies to the financing cost of the private sector. And it may enhance the monetary policy stance by mitigating the side effects of keeping rates lower for longer. There is no reason to commit one particular monetary instrument to the financial stability objective. Instead, a parallel with public finance can prove useful. It is customary in public finance to see the problem of choosing tax rates as one of minimising the distortions created by various tax instruments, in order to raise a given amount of revenues. Similarly, it is possible to approach our monetary policy decisions as one of choosing the combination of instruments that minimise risks to financial stability, in order to deliver the policy stance called for by our price-stability mandate. Likewise, some of our new instruments could be more efficient to address financial stability concerns. For instance, under some dimensions, balance-sheet policies differ markedly from interest-rate policies. By providing valuable safe assets to banks – central bank reserves – a high level of central bank reserves can support their smooth functioning. Even more importantly, it can mitigate the risk that banks will try to supply the demand for safe assets by engineering them themselves. Privately issued safe assets are poor substitutes for public safe assets.xiv b/ Keeping the purchase of private assets to a minimum In any case – and this is my second remark – the purchase of private assets by the central bank should be kept to a minimum. Indeed, the asset-side of the balance-sheet – what assets the central bank buys with the reserves it issues – matters a lot. Buying an excessive amount of private assets such as corporate bonds could run the risk of distorting the signal that asset prices convey on the assets’ riskiness. The present compression of risk premia and credit spreads might already increase risks to financial stability. ** 
Page 9 sur 11  Conclusion I have restricted my remarks on financial stability to the policies that fall, at least in part, within the realm of a central bank. However, as I have emphasized earlier, monetary and prudential policies are not the only policies available. Due to the present economic environment, fiscal policies and structural reforms can and should be more and more part of the policy mix. But it also follows from the guiding principle that I have highlighted today: the more tools available, the easier it is to combine them to minimise the trade-offs between price and financial stabilities. Fiscal policy can help monetary policy in fostering financial stability in several ways. First, it can of course help by taking away some of the burden of policy accommodation. But fiscal policy can also directly assist monetary policy in fostering financial stability. It can help monetary policy to provide the safe assets necessary to a resilient financial system, if possible including in the form of a euro area-wide safe asset. On the tax side, it should reduce all excessive incentives towards real-estate investment, and foster a more neutral allocation of savings according to a sound reward of risk. Let me end with one question: what will monetary policy be like in ten years? We clearly can’t be certain of anything, but we can at least share a conviction: the more progress we have made together on these issues I mentioned, the better our monetary policy will be. Thank you for your attention and your cooperation.

Mario Draghi: Hearing at the Committee on Economic and MonetaryAffairs of the European ParliamentIntroductory statement by Mr Mario Draghi, President of the European Central Bank, before theHearing at the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament,Brussels, 23 February 2019.*   *   *IntroductionMadam Chair,Honourable members of the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee,Ladies and gentlemen,I would like to start by congratulating all of you on your election, and you, Madam Chair, on yourrecent appointment as Chair of this Committee.It is a pleasure to appear before this Committee in this new legislative term and before my termas ECB President comes to an end.The legitimacy of the ECB’s independence, as enshrined in the EU Treaties, crucially relies onour accountability. And the Treaties have conferred this Parliament with a central role in holdingthe ECB accountable.Hearings before this Committee play an essential role here. In my time as President, I have foundthem to be extremely beneficial.When I appeared before the ECON Committee for the first time, in December 2011, the euroarea was rife with financial instability; it was falling into a second recession, which eventually ledto sustained disinflation and, at times, heightened risks of outright deflation. The euro area hascome a long way since the crisis, in part thanks to the support provided by the ECB’s monetarypolicy. The unemployment rate in the euro area was 7.5% in July this year, the lowest level sinceJuly 2008.Over the past years, the ECB has repeatedly and clearly shown its readiness and determinationto fulfil the primary objective of achieving price stability, as laid down in the Treaties. Thisreadiness and determination has been critical in addressing the economic crisis and thedownside risks to our objective.It was with this same determination that, two weeks ago, the ECB’s Governing Council decidedto act in response to the continued shortfall of inflation with respect to its aim.I am happy to be able to discuss these decisions with you today. I will first review the maindevelopments in the euro area economy since my last appearance before this Committee. I willthen present the monetary policy decisions that were taken by the Governing Council in the lightof the economic outlook. As requested by this Committee, I will conclude by drawing somelessons from the past eight years that could be relevant when discussing the policy responses tothe challenges that lie ahead of us.The euro area economic outlookSince my last hearing before this Committee earlier in the year, euro area growth momentumhas slowed markedly, more than we had previously anticipated. Real GDP growth is now1 1 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
projected to be 1.1% in 2019, down by 0.6 percentage points from the December 2018 staffprojections, and 1.2% in 2020, down by 0.5 percentage points from the December projections.This slowdown is mainly due to the weakness of international trade in an environment ofpersistent uncertainties related to protectionist policies and geopolitical factors. These factorsare increasingly weighing on economic sentiment and, in particular, on the manufacturing sector,which is more trade-oriented and exposed to foreign influences.Of course, countries which have a relatively large manufacturing sector are more vulnerable toany turn in the global economic cycle. Germany, for example, accounts for 28% of euro areaGDP, but for as much as 39% of euro area manufacturing value added. Accordingly, Germany istoday one of the euro area members most affected by the slowdown.While the euro area services sector continues to be resilient, we should not be complacent aboutits capacity to remain robust to negative spillovers. The longer the weakness in manufacturingpersists, the greater the risks that other sectors of the economy will be affected by theslowdown.Looking ahead, recent data and forward-looking indicators – such as new export orders inmanufacturing – do not show convincing signs of a rebound in growth in the near future and thebalance of risks to the growth outlook remains tilted to the downside.In the context of this more protracted weakness of the euro area economy, both realised andprojected inflation have been persistently below levels that are in line with the ECB GoverningCouncil’s medium-term aim.Headline inflation remains well below 2%, while inflation excluding the more volatile food andenergy components has been hovering around 1% for an extended period of time. Underlyinginflation remains muted, as the weaker economic outlook may imply a delay in the pass-throughof wages to prices. In particular, firms are absorbing increases in labour costs in their profitmargins rather than passing them on to customers. Meanwhile, indicators of inflationexpectations stand at low levels. Although the likelihood of deflation remains limited, marketexpectations of inflation over the medium term are settling around values that are not consistentwith our inflation aim.Since my last hearing here, we have revised down the inflation outlook over the entire projectionhorizon, first in the March 2019 staff projections and then again in September, reflecting weakereconomic activity and lower energy prices. Inflation is currently expected to average 1.2% in2019, 1.0% in 2020 and 1.5% in 2021, which is well below the Governing Council’s medium-termaim of below, but close to, 2%.The ECB’s response to the current outlookSo when the Governing Council met two weeks ago, it was confronted with a more rapid andextended slowdown than previously anticipated, persistent and prominent downside risks to thegrowth outlook, and a further delay in the convergence of inflation towards our aim. A strongmonetary policy response was therefore essential.In pursuit of our mandate, we decided on a comprehensive package of measures to ensure thatinflation moves towards our aim in a sustained manner.We lowered the interest rate on the deposit facility from –0.40% to –0.50%. This rate provides ananchor for short-term market interest rates, which serve as the reference for many types ofloans and financial instruments. Lowering the deposit facility rate helps to further improve theborrowing conditions of households and businesses. Negative rates also encourage banks tolend to the real economy instead of holding onto liquidity, thus supporting the portfolio rebalancing 2 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
channel of the asset purchase programme (APP).The impact of the cut in the deposit facility rate is reinforced by our strengthened forwardguidance on the likely direction of our monetary policy in the future. Specifically, we clarified thatwe expect our policy rates to stay “at their present or lower levels until we have seen the inflationoutlook robustly converge to a level sufficiently close to, but below, 2% within our projectionhorizon, and such convergence has been consistently reflected in underlying inflation dynamics”.This enhanced guidance provides a clear signpost for rate expectations by linking our policy tomore stringent conditions for the inflation outlook.The Governing Council’s statement that we want to see inflation rising to a level that issufficiently close to, but below, 2% reasserts what we said after the July monetary policymeeting: that the values of realised and projected inflation seen in recent times are too low andinconsistent with the Governing Council’s medium-term inflation aim. While the new formulationof forward guidance reflects the characteristic forward-looking orientation of the ECB’s monetarypolicy framework, we have added two safeguards to ensure that policy rate normalisation onlybegins once inflation is sustainably on course to reach our medium-term aim. The phrase“robustly converge” means that the Governing Council wants to be sure that the process ofconvergence is sufficiently mature and realistic before starting to lift policy rates. The referenceto the inflation outlook being “consistently reflected in underlying inflation dynamics” means thatthe path of realised inflation should underpin our inflation outlook.Our enhanced guidance helps to reduce uncertainty about the expected path of interest rates inthe short to medium term and will ensure that financial conditions adjust in line with inflationdynamics. Moreover, by maintaining the easing bias on rates, we indicate that we still havespace to cut rates further, if needed.We also decided to restart net asset purchases at a monthly pace of €20 billion from Novemberonwards. These purchases are expected to run for as long as necessary to reinforce theaccommodative impact of our policy rates, and to end shortly before we start raising the keyECB interest rates. In addition, we reiterated our intention to continue reinvesting, in full, theprincipal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period oftime past the date when we start increasing interest rates, and in any case for as long asnecessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetaryaccommodation.The net purchases and longer reinvestment horizon reinforce the accommodative impact of ourother measures, thereby further easing the funding costs for businesses and households in theeuro area. In addition, these measures help keep down longer-term interest rates by mitigatingthe undue tightening that would otherwise mechanically arise from the reduction in the averagematurity of our portfolio. Finally, net purchases also signal our commitment to use all instrumentsin pursuit of our price stability objective, which can have a powerful effect on the formation ofinflation expectations.As a complement to the policy measures I just outlined, we also decided to change themodalities of the new series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III) that weannounced in June. Banks can now obtain this long-term funding at lower rates with a longermaturity. This will also help to ensure that our accommodative policies pass through entirely tothe funding costs of households and firms.Finally, we also announced a two-tier system for reserve remuneration, in which part of banks’excess reserves will be exempt from our negative rates. The two-tier system is designed tostrike a balance between two outcomes: it seeks to preserve the incentives for banks to passthrough the stimulus generated by the negative interest rate on their reserves, while mitigatingthe adverse effects that these negative rates might have on banks’ lending behaviour by affectingtheir profitability. The euro area needs financial intermediaries to remain engaged and active in 3 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
monetary transmission, and the new two-tier system will make sure that the ability of banks toextend loans to their customers at favourable terms remains unimpaired.The different elements of this comprehensive package will be mutually reinforcing in supportingfavourable financing conditions for businesses and households, which will sustain investmentand consumption. Greater business and household expenditure, in turn, will support inflationdynamics and make sure that they durably converge to our aim.Overall, in view of the outlook and uncertainties we are facing, monetary policy needs to remainhighly accommodative for a prolonged period of time. The measures we took at our last meetingunderscore our determination and readiness to provide the necessary monetary stimulus inpursuit of our price stability objective. We continue to stand ready to adjust all of our instrumentsif warranted by the inflation outlook.Looking back, looking forwards: achievements and future direction of Economic andMonetary UnionThe conventional and unconventional measures the ECB has taken over the past decade havebeen successful in addressing the deflationary risks, restoring the functioning of the monetarypolicy transmission mechanism and providing vital support to the euro area economy.But the ECB does not operate in a vacuum and other economic policies matter too. Allow me torecall my first appearance before this Committee in 2011. At that time, half of my introductoryremarks were about the functioning of Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) and the need forother European policymakers to act.So I will conclude my final statement to you by highlighting some lessons that have emergedfrom these eight years, which I hope can help in addressing the challenges ahead.When comparing the crisis response of the euro area with that of other advanced economies, itis evident that the latter were able to achieve a better macroeconomic policy mix at the time,thanks to more decisive actions in both the fiscal and financial domains.The Governing Council has reiterated that we are determined to ensure that inflation movestowards our aim in a sustained manner, and that we continue to stand ready to adjust all of ourinstruments. At the same time, a better policy mix, including fiscal policy, structural reforms andprudential measures, can help achieve this objective faster and with fewer side effects.We will continue to carefully monitor – as we always have done – the possible side effects ofaccommodative monetary conditions. It is crucial to remain vigilant and to use the availablemicro- and macroprudential policy tools as necessary. I will say more on this during the hearingin my capacity as Chair of the European Systemic Risk Board.The low yield environment needs to be understood in the context of the protracted decline in realyields we have witnessed since the 1980s. And this trend is not unique to the euro area. It largelyreflects more structural factors such as a slowdown in productivity growth, which can bereversed through an ambitious structural reforms agenda.In other words, we need a coherent economic strategy in the euro area that complements andenhances the effectiveness of monetary policy.This is why there was unanimous consensus in the Governing Council that fiscal policy mustmake a more decisive contribution. In view of the weakening economic outlook and the continuedprominence of downside risks, governments with fiscal space that are facing a slowdown shouldact in an effective and timely manner. Where fiscal sustainability is ensured, the potentialeffectiveness of countercyclical fiscal policy is reinforced in the current environment, given that 4 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
fiscal multipliers are higher in a low interest rate environment. At the same time, governments incountries with high public debt should pursue prudent policies and deliver on structural balancetargets.Another key difference compared with other advanced monetary unions like the United States isthe lack of a central fiscal instrument to act countercyclically at the federal level.I fully acknowledge the political difficulties in building such an instrument in the euro area. Similardifficulties also exist when discussing the completion of the banking union and the establishmentof a genuine capital markets union.At the same time, we should remain fully committed to the goal of achieving a genuine Economicand Monetary Union. Ignoring the need to fix the remaining institutional weaknesses of EMUwould seriously damage what has already been achieved through the commitment and hardwork of everyone involved. As I argued in this Committee eight years ago, we need to show “aclear trajectory for the future evolution” of EMU and thus frame the “expectations of both citizensand financial markets”.Allow me to take a longer-term perspective to draw the last lesson. While the euro area did nothave a fiscal policy response comparable with that of other advanced economies, the ECB’sresponse was fully comparable with that of the other major central banks.Thanks to its independence, the ECB has been able to adapt its policy response and reactionfunction. Preserving this key asset will allow the ECB to adapt to future circumstances andensure the effectiveness of its measures. This is all the more important considering that thedesirability and relevance of central bank independence are increasingly being challenged aroundthe world.As I argued in my introduction, the best way to preserve the ECB’s independence is to ensure acommensurate degree of central bank accountability. During the past eight years, ouraccountability practices have evolved and intensified in response to the quest for scrutiny thatemerged from the crisis. I have always appreciated the ability of this Parliament to react tocitizens’ demands, support, concerns and channel them in a constructive manner during ourdiscussions here. And I would like to personally thank you for this.I am confident that this Parliament – and this Committee in particular – will continue the goodwork it has done during my term as ECB President. This, in turn, will further strengthen theeffectiveness of the ECB’s actions and citizens’ trust in the EU project.Thank you for your attention. I am now at your disposal for questions.See Draghi, M.

    18.09.2019 Monetary policy and bank profitability in an environment of uncertainty 10th Conference on the Spanish Banking Sector, organised by the IVIE and the University of Valencia Pablo Hernández de Cos Governor  

  3/13 Ladies and gentlemen, good morning.  I should like to thank the Valencian Economic Research Institute for the invitation to speak at this conference on the Spanish banking sector, which this year marks its tenth anniversary. I am honoured and delighted to participate in this event and share some reflections with you regarding the current profitability of Spanish banks and the main challenges that will shape their future. As you know, this is a subject that is attracting a lot of attention in Europe, both on the part of analysts and supervisors and the industry itself, owing to the concern about banks’ low profitability.  Before I address this issue, allow me to start by describing the economic situation in the euro area and, in particular, the decisions taken by the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) last week. This is very relevant for the financial system, insofar as it is the context in which its activity will be carried out over the next few years.  1. The economic situation in the euro area and the monetary policy response  The international economic context has undoubtedly become more unfavourable over the past year, with a slowdown in growth and, in particular, in trade. The latest information shows that global activity slowed across the board in the second quarter and the highest frequency indicators point to persistence of this weakness over the coming months. Meanwhile, the decline in world trade appears to have steepened, against a background of heightened uncertainty regarding the trade policies of the United States and China and intensification of geopolitical risks. Although the decline in activity has been particularly strong in manufacturing, the slowdown in recent months in the global services output PMI, which remains in expansionary territory, is indicative of an increase in the risk of a greater slowdown in global activity.  Given its degree of openness and the existence of certain idiosyncratic factors, the euro area economy has been one of the most affected by these international trade developments. Specifically, there was a significant slowdown in the euro area from the beginning of 2018, mainly due to the sharp moderation in its exports. As a result, in 2018, GDP grew at an average rate of 1.8%, 0.7 percentage points less than in 2017, while year-on-year growth fell to around 1% in late 2018 and early 2019.   The latest information shows that euro area GDP growth in the second quarter, adversely affected by export weakness and sluggish investment, was only 0.2% quarter-on-quarter, down from 0.4% in the first quarter. By contrast, private consumption continued to grow, driven by the relative strength of the labour market. On the supply side, industrial activity contracted in this period, while services continued to behave more favourably. By country, the decline in activity in the German economy and the stagnation in Italy were notable.   Furthermore, the available indicators suggest that the weakness of economic activity in the euro area persisted in the third quarter of the year. Thus, the indicators relating to trade and industrial activity (industrial production, export orders, manufacturing confidence and industrial production expectations) continued to deteriorate. Also, certain survey indicators of activity and employment in services showed a downturn, which may indicate that the weakness is beginning to spread to these activities. The slowdown in employment, along 
 4/13  with the gradual decline in consumer confidence in the third quarter, points to more modest growth in private consumption, which until now has been the main driver of growth.  In this context, the ECB published its macroeconomic projections for the euro area as a whole last week. Projected GDP growth was revised downwards, especially for 2020. Specifically, growth is now projected to be 1.1% in 2019 and 1.2% in 2020, in both cases lower rates than were projected in June. In the medium term, a recovery in activity is expected, underpinned by favourable financial conditions and the slightly expansionary fiscal policy stance, assuming that the political and trade uncertainty gradually dissipates.   Notwithstanding this downward revision to the macroeconomic projections, the ECB’s Governing Council stressed that there remain important downside risks to the central scenario, arising mainly from the possibility of a no-deal Brexit and a possible escalation of trade tensions.   Inflation in the euro area remains at low levels. In the third quarter, inflation developments were marked by the downward dynamic of energy prices and the persistence of moderate rates in services and industrial goods. The annual rate of change in the harmonised index of consumer prices (HICP) held steady at 1% in August, for the second month running, while underlying inflation, which excludes energy and food prices, stood at 0.9%. In fact, since 2013, inflation in the euro area has stood on average at 0.9%, practically half the level observed during the first 10 years of EMU, of 2.1%.  In parallel, the indicators of long-term inflation expectations, based on financial market information, have fallen sharply since the end of last year and stand at very low levels, which broadly coincides with the signals obtained from surveys. These indicators are regularly used to monitor the degree to which inflation expectations are anchored to the ECB’s medium-term inflation target (below, but close to, 2%). Although most of the reduction in inflation expectations, according to market indicators, seems to stem from the fall in the inflation risk premium, the level of this premium is in negative territory, which would indicate that agents are hedging the risk of very low or even negative inflation rates.  This absence of inflationary pressures and the weakness of demand, along with expectations of falling oil prices and a deteriorating global environment, led to a further downward revision to the Eurosystem inflation projections. Inflation was projected to stand at 1.2% in 2019 and, following a notable downward revision of 0.4 percentage points, 1% in 2020. In 2021, inflation is expected to stand at 1.5%, clearly below the monetary policy target.  These developments have been accompanied by a reduction in long-term yields on sovereign debt markets, which have reached historic lows in most euro area countries and in the United States, as a consequence of the weakness of the macroeconomic environment and market expectations of the central bank response to this scenario of reduced economic momentum.   In short, the macroeconomic context is characterised in the euro area, first, by a downward revision to growth forecasts, which were already relatively weak, which remain subject to downside risks, owing to the persistence of trade tensions and other geopolitical 
  5/13 uncertainties, such as those relating to the final outcome of Brexit, and which in some countries of the area even point to a risk of imminent recession; and second, by medium-term inflation projections that have also been revised downwards and are well below the levels that could be considered compatible with the ECB’s price stability mandate.   The measures adopted by the Governing Council of the ECB at last week’s meeting should be understood against this background. In particular, and in keeping with previous communications, the Governing Council acted – with a package of expansionary measures – in response to inflation rates, both realised and projected for the coming years, which have remained persistently below the ECB’s aim, in line with its commitment to symmetry in relation to this aim. In this context, symmetry means that the ECB undertakes to act with the same determination whether inflation is persistently above or below 2%.1   In particular, the Governing Council of the ECB took the decision to decrease the interest rate on the deposit facility by 10 basis points to -0.50% and reinforced its forward guidance on interest rates by indicating that they will remain at their present or lower levels until it is seen that the inflation outlook robustly converges to a level sufficiently close to, but below, 2%. Such convergence should also be consistently reflected in the observed behaviour of underlying inflation.  The ECB also agreed to restart net purchases under its asset purchase programme (APP) at a monthly pace of €20 billion as from 1 November and without a defined time limit. In order to preserve favourable bank lending conditions, the modalities of the new series of quarterly targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III) were also changed, eliminating the 10 bp spread established on the interest rates applied to them and extending their maturity from two to three years. Finally, in order to support the bank-based transmission of monetary policy, a two-tier system for reserve remuneration was announced, such that part of banks’ holdings of excess liquidity will be exempt from the negative deposit facility rate.  These decisions aim to counter the worsening growth and inflation outlook by means of a package of measures that complement one another, easing financial conditions by a different route. Thus, the cut in the interest rate on the deposit facility will have a moderating effect on yields at the short end of the different yield curves, which extends to the interest rate term structure as a whole, thus reducing the cost of borrowing for households and for firms.   This effect is reinforced by the changes introduced in the forward guidance on interest rates, which closely links the potential normalisation of interest rates to a robust convergence of the inflation outlook to a level “sufficiently close to, but below, 2%”. Moreover, such convergence should have been reflected, as mentioned earlier, in actual inflation dynamics.   This forward guidance on interest rates and the resumption of net asset purchases seek to have an impact on the medium and longer-dated segments of the yield curve, mainly through interest rate expectations in the case of forward guidance, and term and risk premia in the case of asset purchases. The resumption of net purchases, without a defined time                                                                                               1See the Governor of the Banco de España’s closing address of the La Granda Courses on 31 August 2019, “The European economic policy response to a scenario of lower growth and inflation”. 
 6/13  limit, also has an important signalling effect with respect to the Governing Council’s commitment to meet its inflation aim, which is particularly relevant in the current context of inflation expectations at risk of becoming de-anchored.   In addition, the period of time over which the net asset purchases and the reinvestment of existing assets will continue is anchored to the normalisation of interest rates, thus enhancing the consistency and complementarity of the different measures and their dynamic adjustment to inflation. In a setting of heightened uncertainty, this automatic adjustment of the expectations about the future path of monetary policy in the face of potential changes in the macroeconomic environment is particularly desirable.  Lastly, the improved conditions of the new TLTRO-III programme seek to further ease the conditions of bank lending to the real economy.   Economic research, including that produced by the Banco de España in recent years, shows that these measures have been effective in the recent past, in terms of easing financial conditions and encouraging lending. Bearing this in mind, the new package of measures will boost economic activity in the euro area against a background of high uncertainty and will help to bring about the convergence of inflation to levels in line with the ECB's mandate.  As regards negative interest rates, although there is no conclusive evidence to date that they have adversely affected the supply of bank credit, we cannot rule out that maintaining rates at very low levels for an additional, potentially extended, period of time, could ultimately have some negative consequences for the bank-based transmission of monetary policy. In this regard, the mitigating measures adopted by the ECB, consisting of a tiered system for remunerating excess liquidity holdings, are intended to soften the negative impact on bank profitability of the new reduction in reserve remuneration, and thus ensure the expansionary effect on activity and inflation of any additional cuts to interest rates in the current setting.   2. Banking sector profitability  This is the economic environment that banks, economic agents and, in particular, financial institutions will face in coming years. If I may, I will now move on to analyse the developments in Spanish banking sector profitability and the determinants thereof.   Profitability is one of the main variables that characterise the financial position of banks and it provides the first line of defence against adverse shocks. Indeed, the volume of a bank’s profits determines the return its owners can earn on the capital invested. This, duly adjusted for the risks assumed, will affect the bank’s valuation. Moreover, profit levels determine the margin these agents have available to address shocks. Indeed, low profitability reduces the possibility of generating capital internally through retained earnings. Note that the capital of banks acts as a buffer that allows potential losses to be absorbed in adverse scenarios, so that these intermediaries can continue to offer financial services to households and firms, thus contributing to smoothing – rather than amplifying – negative shocks to the economy.  Also, a high level of capital entails a stronger link between the personal wealth of the owners and the economic performance of the banks, thus contributing to mitigate the risk profile 
  7/13 that the latter are prepared to assume and, therefore, the likelihood that they will overreach themselves and will subsequently require traumatic correction measures. All of this explains the concern of banking regulators that banks should hold sufficient capital.  The last financial crisis showed that banks’ capital levels were clearly insufficient to address the economic and financial shocks that arose. In response to the crisis, international financial regulators tightened capital requirements, setting higher minimum levels and requiring capital of higher quality, as well as introducing requirements for minimum liquidity levels.   As a result, the main international banking systems have gradually raised their solvency ratios in recent years. The Spanish banking system has gradually adapted to the new regulations and its capital ratios are currently in excess of regulatory requirements. However, in the case of ratios calculated in terms of risk-weighted assets, such as the CET1 ratio, average levels are comparatively low and have risen by less than in the main European banking systems. By contrast, in terms of the leverage ratio, that is, when banks’ assets are not risk-weighted, the relative position of the Spanish banking system is more favourable, standing somewhat above the European average and above that of the main European banking systems.   Spanish bank profitability since the start of the crisis  The profitability of the Spanish banking system contracted sharply during the last economic crisis and more severely than in other jurisdictions: in 2012 return on equity reached a negative level of -21% and return on assets a negative level of -1.2%, according to the consolidated statement information which reflect not only business in Spain but also international exposures. The main determinant of this performance was the increase in loan losses associated with the significant increase in non-performing loans, in particular in construction and the real estate sector to which banks were over-exposed.   Despite the drop in aggregate profit levels in the first half of this year, in recent years the profitability of the Spanish banking system has tended to recover, essentially underpinned by the decline in impairment losses which reflects the improvement in the quality of the credit portfolio. The reduction in non-productive assets – non-performing loans and foreclosed assets – has played a fundamental part. Specifically, the ratio of non-performing loans to the resident private sector in Spain has fallen from 14% in December 2013 to 5.3% in June 2019, and the volume of foreclosed assets has decreased from almost €78 billion in December 2013 to €40 billion in June 2019. This has been achieved by sales of large non-performing and foreclosed asset portfolios, partly as a consequence of regulatory and supervisory pressure.    These latest developments have occurred in a favourable macro-financial setting characterised by growing economic activity, falling unemployment and lower interest rates. This has boosted borrowers’ ability to repay their loans, driven up asset values and has also been compatible with substantial deleveraging in the non-financial private sector and with a major consolidation process in the banking sector.   
 8/13  Spanish banking system earnings are highly cyclical, essentially on account of business in Spain. Banks that are more exposed to business abroad were comparatively less hard hit by the crisis, as they were able to offset the losses on their Spanish business with earnings from their activities in other economies that were less adversely affected by cyclical patterns. Naturally, these international exposures also entail other risks. For example, banks with exposure to the United Kingdom could be affected by the possible negative impact of Brexit and the effects it may have on the UK economy. In addition, the problems facing certain emerging market economies, such as Turkey or Argentina, may affect banks that have exposure to those countries. However, despite these risks, international diversification of the banking business offers important advantages overall and especially, as was apparent in the last crisis, when it is focused on retail banking and is organised on a decentralised basis.  Despite the recent recovery observed in Spanish banking system profitability, the present levels are below the pre-crisis levels and below the cost of capital estimates available. This situation is not exclusive to Spain, but is in fact quite widespread within the euro area. Indeed, the average profitability of Spanish banks is currently somewhat higher than that of the main European banking systems and the euro area average.  The breakdown of the return on assets shows that the main reason why Spanish banks’ profit levels are higher than the euro area average is that their net interest income is higher. This reflects the larger relative share of Spanish banking business in less mature markets, such as the Latin American economies, where margins are higher. Conversely, Spanish banks have higher impairment related expenses and provisions than their euro area peers.  Average return on equity among Spanish banks is also higher than for banks of other European countries such as Switzerland or the United Kingdom or for Japanese banks. But it is lower than average return on equity observed in other more profitable banking systems, such as the United States, Sweden, Norway, Canada and Australia.   In any event, there is a high level of dispersion in profitability between banks, both in Spain and in the rest of Europe. This shows that profitability problems do not affect the sector evenly, given the range of banking business models, both between countries and within each jurisdiction, and also the combination of multiple explanatory factors.  To facilitate a better understanding of the factors underpinning the Spanish banking system’s low profitability levels compared with the pre-crisis levels, I will now concentrate on business in Spain. This is because changes in profitability in the consolidated statements are influenced by the growing share of international exposure observed in recent years and this makes it more difficult to interpret earnings as they are affected by significant changes in composition. Also, there are only a small number of banks that have significant international exposure, which means that changes drawing on consolidated statements may not be very representative of the majority of the banking sector.   The profitability data drawing on individual statements of business in Spain are also highly cyclical, even more so than those drawing on consolidated statements. This reflects the greater severity of the crisis in Spain compared with the situation in other economies to 
  9/13 which Spanish banks held exposures. There are also signs of a marked recovery in recent years, despite which, in 2018 both ROE and ROA were still below their pre-crisis levels.  The breakdown of the return on assets shows that the main determinant of the current low level of profitability of business in Spain compared with the pre-crisis period is a narrowing of net interest income in terms of assets, or net interest margin. This narrowing was concentrated in the period 2009 to 2013, when the margin fell from 1.4% to 0.9%; since then this indicator has steadied at around 1% of total assets.   There are several factors that may explain the decline in net interest margin observed in this period. First, it is the result of the increase in the relative share of non-productive assets, that is, assets that do not earn interest, such as non-performing loans or foreclosed assets.   In addition, this period saw a severe contraction in banks’ credit portfolios, a reflection of the sharp correction in the high indebtedness accumulated by Spanish households and firms in the pre-crisis years, and of the loss of share of the banking system in the financing of the economy. Banks cushioned the balance sheet effect of this contraction in their credit portfolios by increasing their exposure to other assets, especially through government debt purchases. As these debt securities provide lower returns than lending to households and firms, in the long run this portfolio rebalancing resulted in a fall in the average return on assets. However, when the sovereign debt crisis came to an end, the increase in value of these debt securities provided a positive, albeit short-lived, boost to profitability.   On our estimates, the overall effect of these changes in asset composition – associated with the increase in non-performing loans and the decrease in the relative share of credit on balance sheets – would explain some 70% of the decline in net interest margin in the Spanish banking system between 2007 and 2018.  The fall in market interest rates has also played its part in narrowing the net interest margin, since the cost of liabilities, and especially of deposits, which are the main source of funding for Spanish banks, tend to be less sensitive to changes in market returns than the remuneration of assets. This effect heightens when interest rates move close to cero, since this level has served as a lower bound for the cost of deposits. The reason for this downward stickiness in the cost of deposits is that negative interest rates in these instruments could reduce the supply of funds, especially in the case of households, as they would prefer to hold cash, which has zero but not negative remuneration, rather than deposits.   An analysis of the average loan-deposit gap in the case of outstanding balances shows that there is in effect a historically positive relationship between this variable and the level of market interest rates. Nevertheless, the fact that since 12-month EURIBOR turned negative in February 2016 the loan-deposit gap has not narrowed and in fact has widened is quite striking. There are two reasons for this. The first is that average remuneration of loans has been sustained in recent years by the decline in non-performing loans, which has reduced the proportion of loans not earning interest. The second reason is that in February 2016 there was still some margin for decline in the cost of deposits, which averaged 0.35% for outstanding balances and 0.20% for new business. As a result, since that date deposit rates on new business have fallen by a similar amount as average remuneration of loans. Now, 
 10/13  however, as the cost of deposits has come very close to zero, it would be more difficult to pass any further decreases in remuneration of assets through to the cost of deposits.  It is often argued that banks’ net interest income is being adversely affected not only by the low level of interest rates but also by the flattening of the yield curve observed in recent years. This effect depends, first, on the extent to which there are positive differences between the maturity of the assets and the liabilities of banks. In general, these financial intermediaries receive short-term funding and provide long-term financing; this is known as maturity transformation. However, in order for the flattening of the yield curve to have a negative impact on net interest income, in addition to there being maturity transformation, banks need to be granting fixed-rate loans. If they are lending at variable interest rates, the remuneration will usually be linked to short-term yields, thus contributing to holding the loan-deposit gap steady.  In the case of Spain, although banks operate with maturity transformation, the bulk of their long-term lending is variable rate. In consequence, the flattening of the yield curve in recent years should have had less impact on Spanish banks’ net interest income than on the net interest income of banks in other European jurisdictions such as Germany or France where fixed-rate loans predominate.   In any event, in order to assess the overall effect of interest rates on the profitability of banks, it is necessary to take into account that interest rates not only impact the net interest margin but they also impact other items in the income statement.   In particular, lower interest rate levels help to lessen losses in the credit portfolio due to their favourable effect on borrowers’ repayment capacity associated with both the lower cost of credit, and higher income and lower unemployment tied to the macroeconomic impact of lower interest rates. These effects may be particularly important in countries like Spain where the banking system started out with a high level of non-performing loans and where short-term or variable rate lending was prevalent, since this results in movements in market returns passing through rapidly to the costs of outstanding debt2. Thus, part of the fall in the non-performing loans ratio in recent years can be explained by this effect.  Furthermore, declines in interest rates contribute to increasing the prices of financial and real assets. This effect is immediate for fixed-income securities, particularly long-term ones since prices are more sensitive to changes in yields. Valuations of equities and real assets, such as housing, are also boosted by the fall in interest rates due to the effect on the discount factor, although the price of these other assets is influenced by other conditioning factors such as macroeconomic expectations. All the above entails capital gains for banks exposed to these financial and real assets, at the same time as it increases the value of loan collateral. This also favours an improvement in the credit quality of loans and, therefore, smaller losses in the credit portfolio.  It is true, in any event, that these capital gains dry up once interest rates stop falling and remain at low levels. Furthermore, there is also evidence that, since the ECB’s deposit                                                                                               2 See, Banco de España (2018): Annual Report 2017, Chapter 2, “The challenges facing the Spanish banking sector” and Banco de España (2017): Annual Report 2016, Chapter 1, Overview, Box 1.3. 
  11/13 facility rate has stood below zero, negative surprises in short-term interest rates have been accompanied by declines in European banks’ stock prices.3  Given the endogenous nature of the monetary policy response to projected economic developments, this change in banks’ stock prices due to monetary surprises may reflect, on one hand, the negative impact of less favourable projections for the future macroeconomic setting and, on the other, the market view on the direct negative effect of additional interest rate cuts on the future profitability of banks against the backdrop of protracted negative rates.4  In recent years, Spanish banks have partially cushioned the fall in net interest income by generating other income and, in particular, by increasing fee and commission income. Noteworthy among these fees is the relative increase in fees for selling products such as investment funds, against a backdrop of growing demand for these assets, bolstered by households seeking more profitable investments than deposits given their low returns. These developments have resulted in the ratio of gross income to assets, which includes fees in addition to net interest income, having fallen to a lesser extent than the net interest margin.  Banks have also made huge efforts to reduce their operating expenses through branch closures and job cuts, but to date these expenses have declined more moderately than gross income. This was reflected in a continued increase in the ratio between these two magnitudes, that is, the efficiency ratio, until 2017, which underlines the deterioration in their efficiency during this period. This trend seemed to come to a halt in 2018 when this ratio improved slightly. In terms of assets, in 2018 operating expenses were at similar levels to their pre-crisis ones. However, in a setting where the share of credit in assets is currently significantly lower than it was then, these expenses should also be smaller given that the costs associated with the management of non-credit assets are lower.  The information in the consolidated statements also shows that the most recent levels of the efficiency ratio are above pre-crisis ones, therefore indicating a situation of lower efficiency. However, despite this deterioration, the ratios of the Spanish banking system in this area continue to be more favourable than those of the main European banking systems and also than those of banks in the United States and Japan, although they are worse than those of the Scandinavian countries.   Main challenges affecting the future profitability of Spanish banks  Next, I shall briefly mention the main challenges facing Spanish banks which affect their future profitability outlook. These challenges are not confined to the Spanish banking system but are largely shared with other jurisdictions.  One of the major challenges which banks must face is linked to technological change. New technologies represent both threats and opportunities for banks. On one hand, they promote the emergence of new competitors, such as fintechs and big techs. The latter pose                                                                                               3 See Ampudia and Van den Heuvel (2018). 4 Recent literature on monetary surprises distinguishes between purely monetary surprises and other surprises which disclose private information about the future state of the economy. See, for example, Jaroncinski and Karadi (2018). 
 12/13  a more obvious disruption, given their larger size and advantages in terms of the availability of information, a key asset in the digital and financial worlds. Some of these companies have already begun to offer specific financial services which were traditionally provided by banks or have announced that they intend to do so shortly.  Yet on the other hand, adopting technological innovation may also mean efficiency improvements for banks, although it is true that in the short term adapting to the new way of providing financial services and managing their assets will entail hefty costs for established banks.  For society as a whole, the use of new technologies in finance may mean significant advantages in terms of cost savings and financial inclusion. As regulators, we have to promote the adoption of innovation while continuing to treat all participants symmetrically so that regulations governing the same activities are comparable, irrespective of the type of company providing the services.  As I mentioned earlier, the decrease in non-productive assets has been one of the main factors which has contributed to the return to profitability of the Spanish banking system in recent years. Nevertheless, although it has decreased significantly, the share of these assets in banks’ balance sheets continues to be historically high and, consequently, banks should take advantage of this point in the cycle to make further progress in this area.  Another important challenge for Spanish banks relates to the need for them to achieve reputational improvements. After the economic crisis, litigation increased notably, resulting in sizeable costs for banks which have a negative effect on their profitability. This increase in legal costs is not confined to the Spanish banking system but has also been observed in other jurisdictions. In addition to having an impact on profitability through higher legal costs, this situation has been accompanied by a reputational deterioration which, if not reversed, may lead to a loss of business in the medium term. This is particularly significant in a setting such as the present one with the emergence of new competitors described above. Consequently, it is essential for the sector to recover customers’ trust as soon as possible, this being a key asset in the financial business.  Also, Spanish banks have to complete their adaptation to the new international regulatory and supervisory framework. As indicated, although their capital ratios are above the minimum requirements in the area of solvency, the Spanish banking system still remains below other European countries in the case of the highest quality ratio (CET1). Strengthening capital would not only lead to greater resilience to adverse shocks but it would also bring down issuance costs.5 In addition, higher solvency would help facilitate compliance with MREL requirements (Minimum Requirement for own Funds and Eligible Liabilities) that Spanish banks will have to gradually meet over the coming years. It will be a considerable challenge for smaller banks to comply with these requirements since they do not usually obtain funding by regularly tapping the capital markets.  Lastly, another significant challenge is that associated with climate change and the transition towards a more sustainable economy which, although it affects all economic agents, has a particular impact on the financial sector. Banks face two types of risks in this                                                                                               5 See Financial Stability Report, Spring 2019, Banco de España. 
  13/13 area: “physical risks” linked to the direct effect of climate change on their asset values and “transition” risks connected with the process of technological and regulatory transition to a more sustainable economy. Identifying, quantifying and mitigating these risks will require considerable effort over coming years, although the notable development of green sustainable financial markets in Spain in recent years should be underlined.  Conclusions  I shall now conclude my speech by emphasising two main ideas regarding the role of economic policies in the current situation of economic uncertainty and the importance of addressing the challenges facing the banking sector.   During my speech I have endeavoured to show that monetary policy has and continues to be effective in supporting economic activity and, consequently, inflation. However, it is necessary to underline that this cannot be the only lever of stimulus. Accordingly, it is imperative for national and European authorities to undertake structural reforms which improve the efficiency of the main product and factor markets and increase the euro area’s growth potential.  Likewise, given the worsening of growth projections, fiscal policy needs to provide greater stimulus to economic growth where there is scope for it to do so. It is even more important that European political authorities assess the suitability of deploying euro-area wide budgetary instruments for macroeconomic stabilisation, which would contribute to mitigating one of the main limitations in the original design of our common currency.  All these (monetary, fiscal and structural) policies may be especially effective is they are adopted jointly, thus harnessing the positive complementarities that exist between them.  As I discussed at the beginning of my speech, profitability has a direct and indirect effect on the Spanish banking sector’s resilience to adverse shocks and, therefore, on the extent to which these intermediaries can contribute to amplifying or smoothing the impact of these shocks on the economy. Consequently, it is essential for Spanish banks to address the challenges which will mark their profitability in future, such as technological change, the reduction of non-productive assets, the strengthening of capital and the improvement of their reputation.  Thank you for your attention.  
I am honored to be with you today, to inaugurate the opening of the new Raiffeisen Bank head office. Your investment in this facility is a clear indicator of your commitment to continue operating successfully in Kosovo's banking and non-banking systems, in the future as well.   Raiffeisen Bank has played a very important role in creating a safe and sound financial system that has contributed to Kosovo's economic growth. We are very honored with your presence and the success you have shown so far and we hope you will continue with this success in the future. Raiffeisen Bank has greatly contributed to the development of fair competition, continuous improvement of products and development of new products, by increasing access to finance, contributing to the development of trade relations with other countries, helping to attract more foreign investors and, as well, in improving the reputation of Kosovo in general. We are thankful for this. Raiffeisen Bank has also helped in the development of human capital, and continues to use the potential of our youth. Among other things, Raiffeisen Bank remains an example of a good employer, for which, we are all proud of.  The CBK as a financial system supervisor will continue to work on maintaining a safe and sound financial system and will continuously improve the economic environment, in which the financial industry operates.   The financial sector is a sector with great dynamic development and rapid changes in the economic environment that surrounds it. The financial systems of different countries are constantly integrating and this requires increased cooperation between these countries. The CBK remains committed to cooperating, with the aim of overcoming challenges in the future and integrating Kosovo's financial system into the systems of developed economies.    
Banks in Kosovo, as in all other countries, have a special status in the economy. This status is associated with different regulatory requirements and greater requirements for social responsibility, and I am pleased to say that banks in Kosovo successfully meet these requirements. Today in Kosovo our savings are safe and advancements in technology allow us to access them faster.  Banks are an example of success in Kosovo, so I urge them to promote their success even further, in order to attract and increase foreign investments in other sectors as well. This would affect the economic development that is most needed for financial stability, as well as the further advancement of the banking sector in which Raiffeisen Bank plays a very important role. At the end, I  would like to thank you for your contribution to the economic development of Kosovo and wish you success in the future.

International Capital Flows in the Post-crisis World How the Revised OECD Codes Can Improve Transparency, Accountability, Credibility, and Trust Session : “Next Vulnerabilities: Capital Flows and the Migration of Risks to New Corners of the Financial System” September 11, 2019 – OECD Conference Centre, Paris, France  “Capital Flows and the Migration of Risks: The Recent Chilean Experience” Remarks by Mario Marcel, Governor of the Central Bank of Chile  1. Issues for discussion  a. Which new sources of vulnerabilities are building up a decade after the 2008 crisis?  - Risks associated with the growing importance of non-bank lenders. In some EMEs, this may result in credit lending going informal due to a relatively higher cost in credit provision due to regulation. - Risks that can emerge from a less developed financial infrastructures outside the regulatory perimeter. - Risks attributed to disruptive FinTech activities, such as the development of crypto-assets markets, as well as cybersecurity issues. - Risks and challenges associated with the changing nature of banks’ business model. In particular, those coming from the internationalization of banks’ activities.   b. How to better consider a cost-benefit framework for financial regulation, such as currency-based measures (CBM)? - While the banking regulation and supervision arising from the 80s-banking crisis was restrictive in several ways, it was supported by sound monetary and fiscal policies. - In addition, the development of pension funds, mutual funds, and insurance companies, provided support for banks’ funding needs, and help to develop the FX derivative market that has allowed both, banks and corporations to deal with currency exposure without the need of imposing currency-based measures as we have observed in other emerging economies (this includes regulations imposing a different treatment between domestic and FX-denominated operations by banks, such as reserve requirements on FX denominated banks’ deposits).   - Because of this, over the past decades, and despite global financial turmoil and crises, the size of the Chilean-banking system has increased steadily to reach levels similar to developed economies.  c. Which policy actions could ensure the stability of unregulated corners of the financial system without affecting negatively global financial integration?  - Coordination between regulators and supervisors. - A legal framework that help to avoid fragmentation and the existence of blind spots. - Policy actions towards high quality data on a comprehensive registry of household credit and debt. - Prospective analysis of emerging risks in the traditional banking system that take into account indirect exposures to the non-banking system. - Adapt and/or develop methodologies and models to assess the spillover effect of non-bank lenders in times of stress, as well as considering them in traditional stress test assessments.                                                               Some context on OECD support to the use of CBM:  A recent OECD document (De Crescenzio et al., 2015) emphasizes that mainly countries facing the “original sin” use CBM. Chile is one of them. This issue is important because measures of the “original sin” come from Panizza’s work, who will be part of the panel (Eichengreen et al., 2002; Hausmann and Panizza, 2003).  Based on the previous point, it is worth clarifying what kind of CBM are in place in Chile. In addition, does the fact that in Chile almost all-international bond issuing is in foreign currency represents a constraint/vulnerability for the local financial system?

Background  In Chile, the current approach to deal with potential vulnerabilities associated to volatile capital flows can be seen as orthodox, as we rely heavily on the importance of a flexible exchange rate regime and capital account openness, in conjunction with a consistent monetary and fiscal policy framework, and a sound banking regulation and supervision. However, it is important to remind to the public that we have come a long way.  In fact, nearly 40 years ago, Chile faced one of the world’s costlier financial crises precisely because the lack of several of these elements.  In particular, FX exposures at a heavily leveraged and unsupervised banking sector contributed to the spread of the banking crisis after the fixed exchange rate regime collapsed in the early 1980s.   As a result of this experience, banking regulation and supervision was substantially upgraded. In 1986, the General Banking Law introduced limitations on currency mismatch, constraints on related party lending, and restrictions for banks to receive goods instead of liquid resources; all of them, elements that were common practice before the 1982 crisis.  Paradoxically, what could be considered harsher regulation did not hamper financial deepening. Instead, it fostered solvency and credibility of the banking system and allowed its healthy development in the ensuing decades. At the core of this development was the creation of a funded pension system, and subsequent capital market reforms, together with capital market openness, which dramatically changed the size, composition, depth, and strength of the financial sector in Chile. Now, during the transition toward fully implementing the current policy framework, Chile experienced a period of capital control that have been highly reviewed in the literature. The unremunerated reserve requirement (URR) implemented in Chile during the 1990s helped to change the composition of capital flows toward longer terms but was less effective in terms of reducing the aggregate level of capital flowing into the country.  After removing the URR completely by the end of the 90s and allowing the exchange rate to fluctuate freely, the banking and corporate sector learned to operate in a completely different environment, characterized by an extensive used of the derivative market.  In In particular, corporations have learned to operate in a flexible FX environment by using both, natural and market-based FX risk hedging instruments. This development has been supported by the development of the derivatives market, in which Pension Funds have been key counterparts as well. Banking regulation, in turn, have result in limited currency mismatches at the bank level, which have made the introduction of new regulation to deal with FX risk unnecessary, as we have observed in many emerging market economies after the Global Financial Crisis (GFC).  While may be true that other emerging economies have been increasingly active in the implementation of CBM in their banking systems, in Chile, we have followed a different approach to deal with FX risk at the banking level. This approach has been mainly characterized by limiting banks’ direct FX-currency exposure (limited currency mismatches) as part of our overall capital requirements for market risk purposes. Also, by acknowledging the potential indirect FX risk through the credit provisioning requirements.  In fact, in Chile, the main regulatory changes introduced has been the recent modification of the General Banking Law (GBL), which constitutes a major step forward for the local banking industry, in that it will contribute to reducing the gap with international regulatory standards established under Basel III. The new regulatory 
Central Bank of Chile September 2019  Page 3 of 12  framework raises important challenges for the industry in terms of compliance with the new, more demanding solvency requirements, especially for entities with a smaller capital cushion.       Let me add one more thing regarding the use of CBM by several EMEs, which have targeted the banking system, rather than the general resident-non-resident relationship, as is usually done by capital controls. The Figure below, for example, based on De Crescenzio et al. (2015), shows that EMEs countries exposed to the original sin (unable to borrow internationally in local currency) appear as tightening CBMs on banks’ liabilities during the 2013-2015 period.

Recent evidence on the evolution of capital controls shows that Chile has taken more liberalization actions than tightening actions on both inflows and outflows (Pasricha et al., 2018). The following Figure shows the cumulated weighted net inflow easing actions and weighted net outflow easing measures in Chile and in a group of EMEs (excluding Chile).   Pasricha (2017) shows that policymakers use capital inflows tightening for macroprudential concerns, while use capital outflows easing for competitive purposes. In Chile, the dynamic of outflows easing reflect mainly that Pension Funds’ limits on investing overseas have loosen. Nonetheless, Chile is among those EMEs that are less active when it comes to capital control actions over the past decades. The challenge, however, still remains in terms of addressing the actual level of capital account openness rather than it’s tighten/loosen evolution.

Central Bank of Chile September 2019  Page 5 of 12    Besides the Chilean approach to deal with FX risk at the banking level and the recent trend that has deepened financial liberalization, the possibility to activate capital controls under extreme circumstances is still part of our constitutional law.  In Chile, we are under the process of simplifying our FX regulation, as well as improving our Financial Market Infrastructures (FMIs), including the FX dimension to them. Thus, the Central Bank of Chile is currently working to allow the clearing of USD denominated large-value payments through its Real Time Gross Settlement payment system. Also, it is developing a Trade Repository for OTC derivatives, and it is about to issue the regulation for FX clearinghouses. Finally, the onboarding of the Chilean Peso into the Continuous Linked Settlement (CLS) System is a priority for the Central Bank of Chile. These measures may contribute to increasing the likelihood of issuance of local currency bonds overseas.  Now, let me address some of the concern raised regarding new vulnerabilities, in particular at the non-banking sector. A reasonable concern is to what extent the low level of FX-risk at the banking sector in Chile have pushed for higher FX-risk in the non-banking sector? Our assessment is that the rising vulnerabilities observed in the non-banking sector can be associated to the stronger bank regulation, but it does not correspond to the evolution of FX risk.  In fact, the evolution of the non-banking sector reflects mainly issues of information asymmetries and the fact that some of these institutions can take advantage of payroll direct charges to enhance their consumer credit business.   While non-bank lenders (NBL) provide commercial loans, their main business is to lend to households in the form of consumer and mortgage loans. In the consumer portfolio, NBLs include retailers, family compensation funds (CCAF), savings and loan associations (S&Ls), factoring and leasing companies (F&Ls), and car dealerships. The mortgage portfolio includes endorsable mortgage loans (“mutuos hipotecarios”) issued by banks and mutual societies included among the assets held by life insurance companies (LICs). Finally, factoring and leasing companies mainly provide trade credit to businesses. Therefore most, if not all, of the lending activities of this sector is done in local currency.  Having said that, we monitor this sector carefully, since the household debt issued by NBLs has increased a share of total consumer debt. Nonbank loans had a real annual growth rate of 11.5% in the fourth quarter of 2018. The contribution of debt with retailers was 4.5%; car dealership, 3.9%; CCAFs and F&Ls,1.2%; and S&Ls, CENTRAL BANK OF CHILEHigh-level Policy Seminar on Integration or Fragmentation?

Nonbank consumer loans together were equivalent to about 58% of total bank consumer loans. This rate has been stable since 2012, although the composition has changed. Specifically, the share of retailers has been steadily increasing since mid-2013, while the share of companies oriented toward car financing has expanded more recently. As of December 2018, retailers accounted for 24.3%; car dealership, 12.1%; CCAFs, 12.1%; S&Ls, 6.6%; and F&Ls, 2.8%.     The steady growth of the nonbank portfolio is a potential source of vulnerability, given that most of these lenders are outside the consolidated debt perimeter. In terms of arrears in the nonbank consumer portfolio, retailers recorded a slight improvement relative to end-2018, to 3.8%. In contrast, for the CCAFs, delinquency has increased steadily since 2013—when they began to use accounting criteria more similar to the banks—and it is currently more than double the rates for the rest of the nonbank consumer lenders.   Moreover, the banking sector has significant exposure to the NBLs, through commercial loans to these institutions. In particular, loans to this segment have increased among medium-sized banks in recent years. Thus, the exposure—to NBL debt—of the large and medium-sized banks, as of February 2019, represented 12.7 and 27.2% of their regulatory capital, respectively. The profitability of the NBLs, measured through ROA, has been relatively stable, standing at 4.6% at year-end 2018 for retailers; 3.8% for S&Ls; and 2.6% for factoring, leasing, and car dealership (FL&A) together. In the case of the CCAFs, ROA has increased in the last two years. The leverage ratio, in turn, is highest for the FL&A group, and it increased for the retailers in 2018.

The evidence shows that Chile’s banking strength have not undermine its financial development under different perspectives. The Chilean financial system has evolved significantly in recent decades, and its contribution has been key in the economic development of the country and the construction of a more prosperous, healthy and modern economy.   Today, the Chilean financial sector is one of the most developed in the emerging world. In five decades, it has gone from being almost exclusively made up of traditional banks, to include several other market participants, such as Pension Funds, General Fund Administrators and Insurance Companies, among others. The Chilean financial system relatively outperforms with respect to other comparable countries in dimensions such as market capitalization, number of branches per inhabitant, and participation in domestic credit. On the other hand, the banking system in particular is positioned among the strongest in the reference group of emerging countries according to comparable international assessments.

As the Chilean economy is not immune to external shocks, the ability to cushion them through FX and countercyclical policy response has improved significantly.     Regarding the risk at the public sector, in normal times the fiscal space is determined by the fiscal rule and public indebtedness. Fiscal policy in Chile is based on a structural (cyclically-adjusted) balance rule adopted in 2000, but after seven years of strict compliance of a 1% surplus target, a tacit escape clause was called at the time CENTRAL BANK OF CHILEHigh-level Policy Seminar on Integration or Fragmentation?

Despite fast economic normalization afterwards, the actual structural balance never returned to pre-crisis levels and even softened targets were frequently not met in the ensuing 10 years. It is currently conducted based on an explicit commitment of the fiscal authority to attain a previously defined target. However, during times of crisis and periods of emergency Chile’s experience suggests that the space of fiscal policy is limited. In fact, the fiscal impulse of 2009 generated a fiscal deterioration that is still under consolidation.  Nonetheless, in the current juncture, the Chilean economy appears to be prepared to face external shocks, but with some gaps to be filled in the fiscal front.  For these reasons, several measures are being taken to achieve fiscal consolidation. Among others: (i) a gradual path to reduce structural deficit by 0.2% of GDP per year, to 2022, (ii) first step above target: structural deficit reduced 0.5% of GDP, (iii) a Debt/GDP ratio currently at 24% should level off in the next two years, (iv) Fiscal Council given independent status, (v) preferential regime for defense spending in course of reform, and (vi) fiscal sustainability a central concern in discussion of tax and pension reforms. Not all emerging economies are equally prepared to react, and Chile is relatively well positioned when compared to other emerging economies.  In order to deal with the undesired effects of volatile capital inflows, several EMEs have implemented different policies to deal with the appreciation/depreciation cycle and credit booms (e.g reserve requirements, FX intervention, capital controls). There is substantial evidence that capital flows to EMEs are volatile and that in part depend on “push” factors that are unrelated to the marginal productivity of the host economy. Volatile (boom-bust-cycle) capital inflows are a significant concern for policymakers. The surge of capital flows is usually associated with booms in asset prices, appreciation, credit booms, and increasing current account deficits. While the sudden stop is associated with asset prices adjustment and financial distress.   In Chile, free floating and FX volatility has helped reduce incentives for arbitrage and carry trade. Besides, the exchange rate flexibility facilitates asset price adjustment. Providing the right incentives for resident investors (pension funds and the government) to counteract the non-residents behavior, smoothing net capital flows! Nonetheless, sectorial mismatches in banks, non-banks, and households, still need to be monitored. In Chile, as mentioned above, these mismatches are limited due to FX hedging and regulation.  The CBC was an early adopter of an inflation-targeting regime, shortly after its independence granted in 1989. A fully floating FX regime was adopted in September 1999 and capital controls where abolished in a necessary step to complete a coherent framework to effectively control inflation. Since then, the Central Bank has kept its commitment of no intervention in the FX market, except when required by extraordinary circumstances.  
Central Bank of Chile September 2019  Page 10 of 12    All these elements allow monetary policy to operate as a first defense mechanism against external shocks in normal times. Besides monetary policy, the CBC has a financial stability mandate. Such mandate should be pursued by a combination of regulation, information, and macroprudential management. In particular, monetary policy tools should be used primarily to achieve the price stability mandate, and only as a last resort to deal with financial instability. The free-floating FX regime is perfectly consistent with achieving both mandates (price and financial stability), as (i) the inflation targeting regime is highly credible, and (ii) the corporate sector is well hedged against exchange rate volatility.    The ability to overcome the fear of floating was helped with the buildup of capacities for companies and financial intermediaries to manage the risks associated to a more volatile FX. Consequently, derivatives markets were deepened as well as institutional investors provided a natural base for financial market deepening and CENTRAL BANK OF CHILEHigh-level Policy Seminar on Integration or Fragmentation?

The Chilean financial market has transited from being largely dominated by traditional banking to being composed by several other market participants, including Pension Funds, General Fund Administrators and Insurance Companies; among others. Assets under management of these non-bank investors went from less than 1% of GDP in 1984, to 65% in 2000, and to almost 100% of GDP in 2018. Currently, around 85% of total domestic corporate bonds and around 65% of sovereign bonds are held by institutional investors, as a result of which reliance on banking credit of these corporations has gone from 91% of financial debt in 1986 to around 25% in the recent years.    This framework has basically remained in place for almost two decades and its effectiveness has improved as markets, agents and institutions have adapted to it. The learning and effectiveness of the framework can be understood not only with the expectations anchored to the target, but also in the low volatility of interest rates in exchange for a (covered) higher FX volatility.

Norman T L Chan: Hong Kong as a risk management hubWelcoming remarks and keynote speech by Mr Norman T L Chan, Chief Executive of the HongKong Monetary Authority, at the Treasury Markets Summit 2019, Hong Kong, 16 September2019.*   *   *Ladies and gentlemen,1. About 15 years ago, a senior banker suggested to me that, in order to further promote HongKong’s position as an international financial centre (IFC), we should turn Hong Kong into a“risk management hub” in Asia. However, he did not elaborate further at the time on exactlywhat he meant and how this could be achieved. To be honest, it was not clear to me thenwhat this risk management hub idea was all about.2. Now looking back, I realise that, even without us consciously pursuing the idea as a policyobjective, Hong Kong has already made major accomplishment as the “risk managementhub” in Asia. Let me explain.Prerequisites for a Risk Management Hub3. Clearly an important pre-condition for a risk management hub is to have money or capitalflowing through Hong Kong. In this context, it is important to distinguish genuine financialflows from those that are not.  Many of you may recall that, in the 1990s and prior to theAsian Financial Crisis, many Japanese (regional) banks used Hong Kong to conduct the so-called euro yen businesses, through which the banks would book in Hong Kong their yenloans to borrowers in Japan, presumably to benefit from more favorable tax treatment. While this kind of booking businesses may inflate the size of Hong Kong’s banking system interms of total assets, it does not, as we have learnt from the experience of the euro yenbooking in the 1990s, bring about much real benefits to Hong Kong in terms of job creationor enhancement of the credit underwriting skills of the bank practitioners.  The lendinginstitutions did not perform any meaningful risk management functions in booking these euroyen businesses.  As we all know, the euro yen business in Hong Kong, driven by taxreasons, faded away right after the Asian Financial Crisis.4. That is why the HKMA has made it clear in the past 10 years that we do not welcome banksmoving “pure” booking business to Hong Kong. Our position is that, in booking any loans orother assets in Hong Kong, the banks must demonstrate that they have the necessarycapability and control process to prudently manage the risks of these assets, both atorigination and on an ongoing basis.  Then there is still the basic question: how do we attractfinancial flows to Hong Kong instead of to other financial centres?  There is a bit of chickenand egg problem here.  Unless restrained by capital controls, money is highly agile and risksensitive and will migrate to centres that offer the greatest efficiency and safety.  In otherwords, money tends to move through centres that provide a high standard of riskmanagement.  By handling more financial flows, a centre will be able to further improve andinnovate on its risk management capability.  The process is interactive and there would be aclustering effect once a centre has established the leading position in risk management andclient servicing.5. Here I should mention several important developments in the last decade that are highlyrelevant and instrumental to Hong Kong’s rise to become the risk management hub in Asia.Internationalisation of Renminbi (RMB)6. From 2009 onwards, Hong Kong has rapidly developed into the biggest offshore hub forRMB businesses in the world. Hong Kong is the source of around 50% of the global offshore 1 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
RMB liquidity.  On average, Hong Kong’s RMB Real Time Gross Settlement system clearsand settles over RMB1 trillion a day.  Moreover, over 70% of the global RMB SWIFTsettlement goes through Hong Kong.  All these figures suggest that Hong Kong is alreadythe largest centre for RMB loans, Dim Sum bond issuance and RMB-related products andfinancial derivatives.  The availability of a wide range of banking products, investment andhedging instruments in Hong Kong has made us the undoubted leader in risk managementin the offshore RMB market.Stock Connect7. The launch of the Hong Kong-Shanghai Stock Connect in 2014, followed by the Hong Kong-Shenzhen Stock Connect in 2016, has opened up the most important part of the Mainlandcapital market to the world’s investors through Hong Kong. The northbound Stock Connecthas presented a huge opportunity for Hong Kong to develop risk management capability forunderstanding of the risks and the pricing of such risks for offshore investors interested inthe A share markets.  Apart from helping to channel foreign investments into the Mainlandmarket, the Stock Connect has also contributed to the inclusion of bigger weights of Ashares in the global stock market indices such as the MSCI.Asian Equity Derivatives Hub8. Another recent trend that is relevant is that several international financial firms have decidedor are planning to relocate their Asian equities derivatives booking hubs from Europe to Asia.This is very logical as the underlying securities and clients are based in Asia.  The HKMAwelcomes these moves and stands ready to facilitate such moves, on the condition that thebooking business must be accompanied by the necessary risk management functions. Again, this will enhance Hong Kong’s position as the risk management hub for Asian equitiesand derivatives, particularly Mainland related stocks.Bond Connect9. By the same token, the launch of the northbound Bond Connect in 2017 has opened anotherwindow of opportunity for Hong Kong to enhance its risk management functions for offshoreinvestors wishing to invest in the Mainland bond market. It is still early days yet, but I amconfident that Bond Connect offers attraction to those investors who prefer using a nomineeholding structure through the Central Moneymarkets Unit of the HKMA.  Other value-addservices for these bond investors would likely be launched in the months ahead.Mainland-Related Lending10. The bread and butter of banks are of course their lending businesses. There is no point incollecting deposits from customers if the bank cannot find useful and hopefully profitableoutlet for these funds.  With the rapid development of the Mainland economy and thedeepening of the Reform and Opening Programme, Hong Kong has become the mostimportant financial intermediation hub for investments into and out of Mainland.  The HKMAhas been collecting statistics under the category of “Mainland-related lending” by banks inHong Kong.  This category includes lending to Hong Kong and foreign corporates investingin the Mainland and to Mainland corporates, mostly large state–owned enterprises.  As HongKong is becoming an important source of funds for foreign direct investments into theMainland and overseas direct investments from the Mainland to overseas markets, the sizeof Mainland-related lending has grown from a very small amount in 2009 to HK$4.6 trillionnow, which accounts for around 45% of the total bank loans in Hong Kong.  This is a verysignificant component of our banking system and is of critical importance to the profitabilityas well as soundness of our banks.  So clearly it is crucial that, in growing this lendingbusiness, banks must maintain a high standard of risk management in underwriting these 2 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
loans.  The credit risk capability, both at the point of origination in terms of know-your-customer (KYC) and customer due diligence and for ongoing monitoring, must be enhancedto cater for the rapid growth of this new line of business.  Naturally the HKMA has accordedhigh priority in our ongoing supervision of banks to ensure that the underwriting standardsare upheld all the time.  I am pleased to report that the non-performing loan (NPL) ratio,which is a key indicator to assess the credit quality of the Mainland-related lending, hasremained at a healthy level of around 0.7%, which is just slightly above the overall NPL ratioof 0.56% for all bank loans.Wealth Management 11. Given the rapid growth and accumulation of wealth in Hong Kong and the Mainland, there isa strong demand for wealth management services. The asset-under-management of privatebanking in Hong Kong now amounts to roughly US$1 trillion.  Again, risk management is thekey to the sustainable development of the private banking industry.  There are two keyaspects of risk management in the private wealth business.  First, the banks must conductproper KYC processes, especially on the source of funds and ongoing monitoring ofsuspicious fund flows for anti-money laundering / counter-terrorist financing purposes. Second, the private banks must understand the risk appetite/tolerance level of their clientson the one hand and conduct proper product due diligence before marketing them to clients. If Hong Kong wishes to remain the preferred centre for private wealth management, wemust strive to strike the right balance between the need to accord appropriate investorprotection and allow the banks to provide user-friendly and efficient services to clients.  Tosucceed in this endeavour, the regulators must work in close collaboration with the industryto continue adapting the rules and practices to cater for the evolving demands of thecustomers and the rapidly changing financial markets.  There is no magic quick fix available,and I hope that the stakeholders would agree to adopt a truly risk-based approach.  What itmeans is that the regulators should articulate the risks or problems that they seek toaddress while the industry should consider how proper risk management could be achievedwithout over-interpreting the regulations or imposing rigid processes that drive awaycustomers. Soft Power12. At the end of the day, any premier IFC must possess superior soft power if it wishes tosustain such position. Soft power is the sum of a wide range of tangible marketinfrastructure and intangible strengths.  While there must be a robust but market-friendlyregulatory regime, we need to have a high degree of professionalism amongst the industrypractitioners.  Fully cognizant of this principle, the HKMA has in the last decade or solaunched many soft power enhancement schemes for the banking industry.  One of theenhancement initiatives was the setup of the Treasury Markets Association (TMA) in 2005through the merger of the Treasury Markets Forum and ACI-The Financial MarketsAssociation of Hong Kong.  I floated this idea in 2004 and received full support from theindustry practitioners.  The TMA was set up with the clear mission to enhance theprofessionalism of industry practitioners and the competitiveness of the treasury markets inHong Kong.  In addition to offering high-quality training programmes, the TMA has recentlyjoined the Global Foreign Exchange Committee as Hong Kong’s representative and playedan active role in developing the FX Global Code on good practices in the FX market.13. In pursuing soft power enhancement, the HKMA has worked closely with the TMA and alsothe Hong Kong Institute of Bankers in launching modules of the Enhanced CompetenceFramework (ECF). We will launch another two more ECF modules on operational riskmanagement and compliance shortly.  You are of course aware of the launch of theAcademy of Finance by the HKMA in June this year.  The Academy has two core missions:financial leadership development and monetary and financial research, including applied 3 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
research.  The Academy is a new venture and we will work closely with all the stakeholders,including the TMA, to upgrade the soft power of Hong Kong as the premier financial centre inAsia. 14. Ladies and gentlemen, international competition between financial centres is very fierce andwill likely to be even more so going forward. Business can and will flow quickly away fromHong Kong if we somehow fail to upgrade the standards of our financial services.  Inconclusion, let me say that to become “an international risk management hub” issynonymous to becoming “an international financial centre”.  No IFC can exist or compete ifit is not also a risk management hub in delivering the various forms of financialintermediation, including the money, banking, capital, asset management and insurancemarkets.  I don’t really think there is such creature as a “pure” risk management hub asopposed to an IFC.  In other words, it is hard to contemplate how a place can turn into a riskmanagement hub if money and capital do not flow through it. 15. Finally, let me share with you a couple of takeaways on what I have said today on how HongKong can enhance its competitive position and leadership in risk management:       (a)Financial institutions must not put their own interests above those of their clients. Theprofessionalism and integrity of the financial institutions and the practitioners are crucialin earning the confidence and trust of their customers. Without such trust, theprospects of Hong Kong as an IFC are doomed. (b)Financial firms should avoid getting carried away in boom times. Motivated by big andgrowing profits and bonuses, many financial firms are minded to undertake very rapidexpansion without building the necessary risk management capability. Excessive risktaking or overly aggressive expansion usually lead to rather unhappy endings, as thefinancial history is littered with so many such failure cases. (c)As for the regulators, they should stay true to the risk-based approach with the rightsense of proportionality and should adopt an open mind on how the risk can beaddressed. The regulators should stand ready to discuss with the industry to see ifthere can be alternative ways of dealing with the risks identified. The industry is alwayscloser to the markets and the clients they serve and should therefore have a bettersense of how to get things done in a way that would cause less disruption orinconvenience. (d)The regulators must not fall into the trap of complacency, and should constantly stay onalert and maintain a sense of unease even in good or peaceful times. Banking andfinancial crises can never be avoided all together, but we can at least build sufficientbuffers to lower their chance of occurrence or when they happen, the damage can bereduced or contained. (e)The industry should stand ready to challenge the regulators if the severity of the risk isoverstated or there are better alternatives than what has been put on the table. On theother hand, the industry must avoid over-interpreting or gold plating the regulators’requirements in such a way that is safe from the compliance point of view but wouldcreate bad customer experience without enhancing the underlying risk managementoutcomes.16. All in all, the financial industry should seek to collaborate with the regulators, more aspartners than as adversaries, in developing risk management framework and practices thatare most suited for Hong Kong’s circumstances and needs.  There is no one-size-fits-allsolution for risk management and Hong Kong must find its own path to success by learningfrom the best practices elsewhere and by striving to upgrade on a continuous basis.  Finally,may I wish all of you a fruitful and productive time in today’s Treasury Markets Summit! Thank you. 4 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
Natasha Ahmetaj: Launching of the new Albanian banknote serieAddress by Ms Natasha Ahmetaj, Second Deputy Governor of the Bank of Albania, at thelaunching of the new Albanian banknote serie, Pristina, 12 September 2019.*   *   *Distinguished guests,Ladies and Gentlemen,Today, we have invited you all to the premises of the Bank of Albania – also known as the “home-place of money”, both figuratively and in the physical sense (as we are standing above the oldtreasury room) -  to celebrate the two dimensions of the currency: a means of exchange and anauthentic work of art.At the very beginning, our process of banknote production started with a design contest. Thisprocess is still in place today. Designs had to meet three criteria:be a genuine and unpublished work;have a national character;employ a set of techniques that serves security needs, namely, the use of fine andcomplicated lines which are extremely difficult to replicate.These three criteria are applicable to our banknotes. From the very beginning, banknotes havebeen designed not only as a means of exchange, but also as a part of national identity. That iswhy, in examining banknotes, numismatists are able to discern different eras, the extent of anation’s freedom, or even aspects of social interdependence. Often, especially in dictatorialsystems, banknote design manifests a government’s influence on markets. A lack of theseinfluences is a dimension of social freedom.Time has proven that nothing has changed the educational and national mission of the banknote.It continues to realise its purposes, as it stands tall against other types of currency.Over the years, in accordance with international standards, taking into account average incomelevels in Albania, new denominations have been added. The series of denominations allows foran adequate banknote structure for the public and fends off its illicit use. Recently, a newbanknote has been added – 10 000 lekë, which is in the production process and is expected tobe put in circulation in 2020.The current series dates back to 1996 and its theme evokes the history of our nation, through therepresentation of prominent personalities who have left a legacy in our national memory.The Bank of Albania decided to retain this theme in the new series, which is practically anevolution and upgrade of the existing series. This option was preferred over a new theme not onlybecause familiarity with the existing theme is considered as important for public trust, but alsobecause it preserves an emotional bond with the content of the images.That is why in the new series we still see the engraved portraits of Naim Frashëri, Ismail Qemali,Pjetër Bogdani, King Gent, and Scanderbeg, concluding with Asdreni, the author of our NationalAnthem, on the 10 000 Lekë banknote.On each denomination, the portrait on the obverse blends harmoniously into the design on thereverse. The portraits account for most of the banknote design area and are engraved in raisedprint.  In 200 and 500 Lekë banknotes, the portraits of Naim Frashëri and Ismail Qemali havebeen notably improved. 1 / 2BIS central bankers' speeches
The designs on both the obverse and the reverse of the banknotes have been reconfigured andenriched with new or improved security features. The dominant colours have been preserved,but they have been given a fresh look, with more vivid and balanced colours for the eye. Thedesign composition of each banknote is in harmony with the rest of the series.The overarching goal was to create a series of banknotes that are modern and easy to use, stillin balance with tradition. The personalisation, versus unification, of some of the security featuresfor each denomination is a new approach. The reduced dimensions make the banknotes moreuser friendly.Special attention has been paid to features for the visually-impaired. The nominal value on eachside of the banknote is easier to read, the dimension of each denomination are different, and theraised print that may be felt on the edges of banknotes has been kept to help identify  differentbanknotes. For the first time in Albania, the new series introduces polymer banknotes. This plastic material,which is more durable than cotton paper, was selected to be used for the 200 Lekë banknote,taking into account the higher frequency of changing hands and a lower paper quality evidencedin this denomination over the years. Polymer banknotes are more resistant to dirt and moisture,as well as more secure and difficult to counterfeit, as they allow for the insertion of a number ofadvanced security features, among others, the transparent window.Importantly, the existing banknotes of all denominations will continue to be circulated along withthe new banknotes. They will continue to be legal tender and serve as means of payment.Dear ladies and gentlemen,Banknotes may seem familiar to many of us, as our intuition may suggest, but studies show that,even in advanced countries, only a few people are capable of distinguishing the images featuredon each banknote.In order to strengthen the emotional relationship between the public and banknotes – part of ournational identity – in the following days, the Bank of Albania will engage in an intensive campaignto introduce the new series of banknotes.The campaign, which starts today, will focus on helping the public become familiar with the newdesign. Detailed information will be provided on the security features used in each of thedenominations and on ways to identify them. Promotion will be made for how to keep and carefor banknotes with a view to increasing their lifespan.  Last but not least, information will providedfor how to read the messages that are artfully transmitted through the banknotes design, to boostour national awareness.In conclusion, I am grateful for the excellent work that has been done on the new series and lookforward to its success. Only the public can measure the degree of success and our goal is toprovide the public with elements and emotions related to our national identity, through a worthybanknote series, created by renowned brands in the banknote production industry such as G&D,De La Rue and Oberthur, whose logos have been present on our currency since it was firstissued. 2 / 2BIS central bankers' speeches
Elvira Nabiullina: Review of recent inflation developments in Russiaand economic outlookStatement by Ms Elvira Nabiullina, Governor of the Bank of Russia, in the follow-up to the Boardof Directors meeting, Moscow, 6 September 2019.*   *   *Today, the Board of Directors has decided to reduce the key rate to 7% p.a.If economic conditions are in line with our forecast, we will look into further key rate reduction atone of the upcoming meetings.Let me dwell on the main factors behind the decision.First. Annual inflation has already approached 4%. Our estimates suggest that as of theyear-end it will fall within the range of 4.0-4.5%. Meanwhile, inflation is forecast to stand at3.5-4.0% in the opening months of next year. This is largely associated with the fact that the VATrate increase will be factored out from the calculation of annual inflation. This may be consideredas a purely technical factor. Sustainable trends point to inflation of about 4%.Second. Inflation expectations of households and businesses remain elevated.Therefore, we stay focused on their dynamics.Right now, I will not highlight the figures we released last week. However, I would like to note thatpreviously we abstained from posting the results of surveys on household inflation expectationsduring ‘the week of silence’. We have discussed this issue and from now on we will publishthese data as soon as they are released. It is essential that the market promptly receives theinformation which the Board of Directors consults when making its decision. The Bank of Russiawill continue to publish its analytical commentary that summarises and estimates expectations ofhouseholds, businesses and analysts, after ‘the week of silence’.Third. Monetary conditions are continuing to loosen. We expect that both previous andtoday’s key rate decisions will underpin this trend.Market expectations for interest rates shifted downwards on the back of the signals in the follow-up to the Board meetings in June and July. This was also driven by the shifting expectations formonetary policies of the US Fed and the ECB as the economic growth outlook for the US andeuro area deteriorated.The decline in interest rates comes with an easing of non-price lending conditions in terms ofmaturities and volumes. The easing of both price and non-price monetary conditions contributesto expansion in lending. According to our estimates, corporate lending will rise by 7-10% whileretail lending will increase by 15–20% this year.Fourth. Economic activity undershot the Bank of Russia’s expectations in the secondand early third quarter. This results from internal and external factors. This made usrevise our 2019 GDP growth forecast from 1.0-1.5% to 0.8-1.3%.An important external factor is a slowdown in growth of the global economy, which has provenmore tangible than expected due to, among other things, the growing contradictions ininternational trade. A weakening in domestic demand already reduced export quantities in the firsthalf of the year, and we forecast that they will contract for a wide range of goods as of the year-end.The deterioration in the global growth outlook also affects investment plans. Though, certainly, 1 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
business sentiment depends not only on external factors but also on the business environmentas a whole. In the first half of the year, growth in fixed capital investment slowed considerably,which is associated with, among other things, a rather sizeable drop in public investment.According to our estimates, even with a revival in national project expenditures in the second halfof the year factored in, total growth of gross fixed capital formation will come in at no higher than1% as of the year-end.Consumer demand continues to make a positive contribution to GDP growth. This year, theexpansion of lending continues to offer strong support to consumption growth. Loans, however,cannot be the main driver of growth in demand. Consumption growth will remain slack ashousehold incomes stagnate. This year, we expect it to come in at 1-1.5% range.We have also updated our medium-term baseline forecast. Now, we expect the dynamics ofdomestic and external demand to be more moderate in 2020–2021. The most notable revisionhas been made for export growth rates. This reflects the deteriorated world economic outlookamid rising trade tensions.As a result, we may only expect GDP growth to accelerate to 2-3% by the end of 2022, ratherthan in 2021. A higher economic growth rate should primarily be driven by the shift to a moreextensive implementation of national projects and other governmental measures aimed atremoving structural constraints. This will promote an increase in investment demand and aquicker rise in labour productivity, household income and, accordingly, consumption.Lending will sustainably expand over the entire forecast horizon supporting economic growth.Corporate lending will annually increase at a pace of 6-10%, and household lending will grow by10–15% each year. Mortgage loans will account for the bulk of household lending growth.Meanwhile, macroprudential measures will gradually reduce the growth pace of consumerlending.We have updated the balance of payments to factor in the world economy dynamics, prices foroil and other Russian exports. We assume a gradual decline in oil prices to 50 US dollars perbarrel in 2021 (as compared to 55 US dollars considered earlier). If external demand weakens,prices for other Russian exports will drop, too. In such conditions, the current account balancewill shrink from 83 billion US dollars (5% of GDP) this year to 28 billion US dollars (which is about2% of GDP) in 2022.Given the actual dynamics observed since the beginning of the year, we have also slightlylowered the 2019 forecast for the private sector’s financial account balance from 50 to 40 billionUS dollars. Later on, it is expected to gradually reduce to 20 billion US dollars by the end of 2022.I would like to emphasise once again that the fiscal rule mechanism smooths out the impact of adecrease in the current account balance on the domestic economic environment. However, itonly pertains to oil price fluctuations.I would like to stress that we have slightly changed our approach to publishing forecastscenarios. The key rate decision relies on our baseline macroeconomic forecast and theanalysis of uncertainties and risks for the baseline forecast. This is the reason why we willcontinue to publish the baseline scenario four times a year in our press releases and MonetaryPolicy Report following core meetings.We will release our supplementary scenarios – the high oil price scenario and the risk scenariothat assumes that prices will plunge – in the same manner as the baseline scenario but once ayear, in the Monetary Policy Guidelines. It is determined by the essence of these scenarios thatremains almost unchanged across the meetings. The 2020–2022 Guidelines will be published onMonday.Winding up, I would like to comment on monetary policy prospects. 2 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
After the five years of the evolution from tight to moderately tight and then to neutral monetarypolicy, we have finally entered the key rate range we consider as a probable neutral interval.Given today’s decision, the key rate is at the top of this range equalling from 6% to 7% in nominalterms, or from 2% to 3% in real terms, which is the same, with inflation expected to reach 4%.In this regard, it is of note that the neutral key rate estimate is not ‘a point’, but a range of values.It depends on various domestic and global drivers, as well as the monetary policy transmissionmechanism, and may alter, being affected by them. It will therefore take time to ‘feel’ thethresholds of this ‘neutral range’ and make sure that they are in line with our current estimates. Ifnecessary, we will adjust these estimates.A sustainable inflation rate close to the 4% target will be the key criterion suggesting that we areright in our estimates of this range. 3 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
Shaktikanta Das: Dimensions of India’s external sector resilienceSpeech by Mr Shaktikanta Das, Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, at the Bloomberg IndiaEconomic Forum 2019, Mumbai, 19 September 2019.*   *   *The international environment is clouded with very challenging conditions. Global growth isslowing down and central banks across the world are bracing up to counter it by easingmonetary policy; but there is no recession as yet. Trade wars have pushed world trade intocontraction and threaten to morph into tech and currency wars, with no evidence of anysignificant gains accruing to anyone. Meanwhile, global commodity prices have weakened, withcollateral benefits to net commodity importers and terms of trade losses for commodityexporters. The developments emanating from drone strikes on Saudi oil facilities are, however,still playing out. Sporadic flights to safety are driving capital flows out of emerging markets intoadvanced economy assets; but the universe of negative yielding bonds is growingdisconcertingly large, posing a potential threat to financial stability.Strengths and Weaknesses2. In this hostile environment, India’s external sector has exhibited resilience and viability. Thecurrent account deficit has averaged 1.4 per cent of GDP over the last 5 years and remainscomfortably financed in spite of global spillovers imparting risk-on-risk-off volatility to portfolioflows. The level of foreign exchange reserves was at US$ 429 billion on September 13, 2019,sufficient to cover close to 10 months of imports or 21 months of debt of residual maturity up to 1year. The Indian economy remains a preferred habitat for foreign direct investment (FDI) and isamong the top 10 destinations for greenfield projects (Source: FDI Report, Financial Times,2018). Net foreign direct investment at US$ 18.3 billion in April-July 2019 was higher than US$11.4 billion in the corresponding period of 2018–19.3. Significant progress has been made in external debt management since the external paymentdifficulties encountered in 1990 which triggered wide-ranging structural adjustments and reforms.The level of external debt at 19.7 per cent of GDP and the debt service ratio (principalrepayments and interest payments as a ratio of current earnings) at 6.4 per cent of GDP areamong the lowest in emerging market peers. This places India among the least externallyindebted countries of the world, by the World Bank’s classification. In terms of a broadermeasure of external liabilities – the net international investment position (NIIP) which includesboth debt and equity liabilities, net of foreign assets – India’s exposure declined to 15.9 per centof GDP at end-March 2019 from a peak level of 18.3 per cent at end-March 2015. Foreignexchange reserves covered 76 per cent of external debt and 94.6 per cent of the NIIP at end-March 2019, up from 68.2 per cent and 89.3 per cent, respectively, at end-March 2014. Short-term debt by residual maturity declined to 57 per cent of foreign exchange reserves at end-March2019 from a peak level of 59 per cent at end-March 2013. Short-term debt by original maturityconstitutes barely 20 per cent of total external debt.4. These healthy developments are underpinned by the innate strength of India’s underlyingfundamentals. The degree of openness of the economy, measured by the ratio of exports andimports of goods and services to GDP, has risen from 20 per cent in the first half of the 1990s to44 per cent in the latest five-year period from 2014–19. The share of India’s merchandise exportsin world exports has gone up from 0.5 per cent in 1990 to 1.7 per cent in 2018.5. In line with the expanding share of services in domestic output, India’s services exports havegrown rapidly over the past two decades. In fact, India’s services exports have shown a higherdegree of resilience to global shocks than merchandise exports. At US$ 81.9 billion, net servicesexports financed 45 per cent of India’s trade deficit in 2018–19. In the area of traded services, 1 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
India remains a world leader in software exports and information technology (IT) enabledservices, accounting for around 12 per cent of world software exports. India’s IT sector, whichearned US$ 78 billion through net exports in 2018–19, is leapfrogging into new technologiesincluding artificial intelligence, machine learning and robotics. The Indian diaspora is among thelargest in the world and reflecting this, India currently receives the highest amount inwardremittances in the world from Indians working abroad. Alongside, accretions to non-residentdeposits have provided stable and reliable support to the balance of payments over the years.Financial openness, measured by the ratio of gross capital inflows and outflows to GDP, hasincreased three-fold from 15 per cent in the first half of the 1990s to 45 per cent during 2014–19.6. Notwithstanding these achievements, there are several areas of concern as well whichoccupy centre-stage in the conduct of external sector management. First, merchandise exportshave lost momentum under the weight of the slump in world trade. In spite of export volumegrowth averaging 4.2 per cent during 2013–18 (UNCTAD, 2019), India’s export growth in USdollar terms has weakened – as in a host of emerging and advanced economies – to 2.2 percent over the same period, as falling unit value realisations have taken their toll. The slowdown inglobal demand has affected our exports of petroleum products as well – they constitute 14 percent of total merchandise exports. Second, the deceleration in domestic demand has pulledimports, especially non-oil non-gold imports, into contraction and this has reduced the inflow ofintermediates, capital goods and technology that is vital for modernising our infrastructure andindustry. Third, portfolio flows, which on average account for about 23 per cent of externalfinancing in a normal year, have turned highly volatile, with net outflows of US$ 0.6 billion in 2018–19. During 2019–20 so far (up to September 13), portfolio equity outflows were of the order ofUS$ 1.4 billion but lower than US$ 2.9 billion in the corresponding period a year ago. Net inflowsinto the debt market of US$ 4.1 billion have, however, provided relief. Moreover, these portfoliocapital movements have turned out to be conduits of global spillovers, impacting domestic equity,debt and forex markets, and asset prices. Nonetheless, the underlying resilience of India’sexternal sector, anchored by the positive features I set out earlier, have cushioned these shocksand insulated the domestic economy.Managing the External Sector7. Against this backdrop, I would like to turn to several recent initiatives undertaken by theReserve Bank of India and the Government of India to fortify India’s external position and improvethe capacity of the economy to deal with the headwinds that confront us in these testing times.Exports8. Exports hold the key to a sustainable balance of payments position. In the final analysis,liabilities in the form of debt and even equities cannot entirely substitute for foreign exchangeearnings from exports of goods and services that create import purchasing power and liabilityservicing capacity. Over the years, the policy endeavour has been to secure a widediversification in India’s export profile in terms of both products and destinations. In particular,product diversification has enabled India to broaden its export basket relative to BRICS peers andreduce its vulnerability to trade shocks. Apart from diversification, India is now exporting sunriseproducts like electronics, chemicals and drugs and pharmaceuticals for which demand isexpanding at the global level. In the smart phone segment of electronic goods, India hastransformed itself from being a net importer to an exporter with the impetus from the phasedmanufacturing programme.9. Looking ahead, several initiatives have been put in place and others are being launched on anongoing basis to enable export industries to regain productivity and cutting edge competitiveness.They include upgradation of export facilities, integration of Indian farmers and their products withglobal value chains, and trade facilitation measures. More recently, efforts are going intoreimbursement of taxes and duties, including electronic refund of input tax credits in GST. An 2 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
action plan for 12 ‘champion’ services sectors, including IT, tourism and hospitality, and medicalservices has been developed since February 2018. The Reserve Bank and the Government areactively engaged in the promotion of e-commerce platforms that will boost the exports of bothmerchandise and services. All these steps seek to create a more conducive climate for exports.Capital Flows10. With regard to capital flows, India has adopted an approach marked by progressiveliberalisation but calibrated to the realities of the domestic situation, including the evolution offinancial markets. A diverse range of instruments for managing exchange rate risk for anexpanding investor base has come into play. India’s hierarchical policy approach – preferringequity flows over debt flows, and preferring FDI flows over portfolio flows within equity flows andlong-term debt flows over short-term flows within total debt flows – has influenced thecomposition of capital flows.11. Turning to equity flows, FDI policy has been progressively liberalised across various sectorsin recent years to make India an attractive investment destination. Sectors that have beenopened up in recent years include defence, construction development, trading, pharmaceuticals,power exchanges, insurance, pensions, financial services, asset reconstruction, broadcastingand civil aviation. 100 per cent FDI has also been allowed in insurance intermediaries. In August2019, FDI norms in single-brand retail trade have been further liberalised. FDI up to 100 per centhas been permitted under the automatic route in contract manufacturing and coal mining.12. With regard to foreign portfolio investment (FPI), several measures have been undertaken tocreate an investor-friendly regime and to put in place a more predictable policy environment. FPIlimits are now being revised on a half yearly basis under the medium-term framework. FPI hasbeen allowed in municipal bonds within the limits set for State Development Loans (SDLs).Greater operational flexibility has been granted to FPIs under a Voluntary Retention Route (VRR)which facilitates investment in G-secs, SDLs, treasury bills and corporate bonds while allowinginvestors to dynamically manage their currency and interest rate risks. The initial response to theVRR scheme has been encouraging. The Union Budget 2019–20 proposed to ease KYC normsfor FPIs and also merge the NRI portfolio route with the FPI route for seamless investment instock markets. Outward direct and portfolio investment have also been progressively liberalisedto give Indian entities a global scan and presence.13. External borrowing norms have also been simplified under two tracks: foreign currencydenominated ECBs; and rupee denominated ECBs. The list of eligible borrowers has beenexpanded to include all entities eligible to receive FDI, registered entities engaged in microfinanceactivities, registered societies/trusts/cooperatives and non-government organisations. A rule-based dynamic limit for outstanding stock of ECBs at 6.5 per cent of GDP is in place. Rupeedenominated bonds or Masala bonds under the ECB route offer an opportunity to domestic firmsto borrow from international markets without the need for hedging exchange rate risk. ECBs up toUS$ 750 million or equivalent per financial year are permitted under the automatic route.Recently, end-use restrictions relating to external commercial borrowings have also been relaxedfor specific eligible borrowers for their working capital requirements, general corporate purposesand repayment of rupee loans. The mandatory hedging requirement had earlier been reducedfrom 100 per cent to 70 per cent for ECBs with minimum average maturity period between 3 and5 years in the infrastructure space. Net disbursement of ECBs rose to US$ 7.7 billion in April-July2019, as against net repayments of US$ 0.8 billion in the corresponding period of 2018–19.Exchange Rate14. Before concluding, it is only fair to say a few words about the exchange rate of the rupee.Over the last couple of years, the exchange rate has seen large two-way movements withconsiderable volatility imparted mainly by global spillovers. During 2019–20 so far, the rupee has1 3 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
traded in a narrow range, with modest appreciation in Q1 giving way to some depreciation inAugust and the first half of September, accentuated by drone attacks on Saudi oil facilities onSeptember 14, 2019. In its External Sector Report of July 2019, the International Monetary Fund(IMF) has employed a suite of models to assess the alignment of currencies with theirfundamentals. For the rupee, the IMF estimates the REER gap to be zero, implying that thecurrency is fairly valued and broadly in line with fundamentals. India’s exchange rate regime isflexible and market-driven, with the exchange rate being determined by the forces of demand andsupply. The RBI has no target or band for the level of the exchange rate. Interventions areintended to manage undue volatility. This is reflected in the two-sided interventions conductedduring the past two years – net purchases in 2017–18, followed by net sales in 2018–19. In fact,it is in recognition of this flexibility that the US Department of the Treasury has removed Indiafrom its watch list relating to currency manipulation.Conclusion15. Overall, the outlook for India’s external sector is one of cautious optimism, albeit with somedownside risks accentuated at this juncture. Among them, deepening of the global slowdown andescalation of trade and geopolitical tensions appear to be the most significant. Volatileinternational crude prices also continue to pose potential risks to the viability of the currentaccount balance through trade and remittances channels. Yet, there are underlying strengthsthat can be built upon to buffer the external sector from these risks. The search for new exportmarkets and new niches must go on so as to reap the benefits of changing dynamics of globalvalue chains. Indian IT companies need to accelerate market diversification and invest in newskills and technologies to hone their comparative advantage. Remittances and non-residentdeposits are likely to remain shock-absorbers over the medium term and need to be assiduouslycultivated, including by ease of remitting/depositing and reducing transaction costs.16. Ultimately, the strength of the external sector derives from domestic macro-fundamentals.Investors and markets need to be credibly assured of our ability to maintain macroeconomic andfinancial stability through continued focus on these areas. At the same time, we need topersevere with structural reforms in various sectors of the economy to unlock productivity andcompetitiveness gains. The overarching objective should be to keep the current account deficitwithin sustainable limits and financed by a prudent mix of debt and equity flows. As I statedearlier, the global environment is challenging, but it offers opportunities as well. By the IMF’sassessment, India will account for a sixth of global growth in 2020. Trade wars are presentingnew business relocation avenues that seem to be favourable to India from the point of view of theeconomies of scale and scope. Indian entrepreneurship, the rupee and our people areprogressively but inexorably internationalising. Since 2018, India’s working age population hasgrown larger than the dependent population, and this demographic advantage is expected to lasttill 2055. In this milieu, prudent external sector management with a close and continuous vigil onareas of external vulnerability assumes critical importance and will continue to receive RBI’sclose attention.Thank you.

1Bundesbank, Frankfurt–26 September 2019Speechin the presence of Jens Weidmannby François Villeroy de GalhauGovernor of the Banque de France«Household Expectations»
2Ladies and Gentlemen,It is a greatpleasure for me to open -with my colleague Jens Weidmann -thisjoint Bundesbank-Banque de France conference on households’expectations. I would like to thank warmly the Bundesbank: this French-German cooperation testifies that our two institutions can promote and contribute to good research on a very topical policy issue. Over the past year, the decline of market inflation expectations has been pronounced while households’ expectations have been increasingquite steadily. This divergence is achallenge for our assessment on inflation expectations. All the interestingpapers presented in the next couple of dayswill illustrate how much we can learn oninflationexpectationswhen observing them outside financial markets. I.Inflation expectations: a key issue for monetary policyI.1. Policy relevance for Central BanksStable inflation expectations at a level close to our target are -of course-key for our monetary policy: they provide a strong nominal anchor helpingus to stabilize inflation when facing large demand or supply shocks. Since the 1990s, management of inflation expectations through central bankcommunication has become a standard tool formonetary policy.Alot of evidence suggeststhat this policy has contributed to anchor inflation expectations and to reduce their volatility, whilefacingstrong inflationary ordeflationary shocks. The Great Financial Crisis is a good example: at that time, solid and well-anchored inflation expectations in the euro area contributedto counteract the strong deflationary forces affecting our economies. However, since then, market-based measures of inflation expectations in the euro area have been decreasingand this decline has been even more pronounced since the beginning of 2019. This fall in market expectationshas raised some questions among central bank watcherson potential risks of de-anchoring of inflation expectationsand more generally on our ability to deliver our mandate of price stability. I.2.The need for better information on households expectationsLet me stress that market-based inflation expectationsare not the onlyavailablemeasuresto assess future risks ofinflation. Professional forecasters or consensus forecast provide a significantly higher figure than the 5Y/5Y ILS, at around 1,7% rather than 1,2% to 1,3%, although all of them point out to a decrease ofinflation expectations over time (Figure 1).Market-based measures havealsosome technical limitations:first, related to the liquidity of 
3financial markets, and second because they are affected by the evolution ofthe risk premium over time. Moreover, while financial market expectations provide information onfuture financing conditions,the evolution of prices and wages dependsmore deeply and directly on what household and firms expect regardingfuture growth and inflation. Consequently, existing surveys among firms and households can provide very useful and valuable information on expectations. Better monitoringthe general public's inflation expectationsis not an easy task since inflation expectationsof firms or consumers are not directlyobservable. For the moment, reliable data on consumersor firms’inflation expectations are quite scarce in the euro area whereas in other jurisdictions expectation surveys have been developed quite extensively–famous and recent examples include the New York Fed Survey,the Tankan survey in Japanor the different surveys developed by the Bank of England. Inthis respect, the new Bundesbank household survey contributes to fill thegap and it isalsoan excellent example of the recent efforts made by central banks to collect newand better information on expectationsof economic agents.II.Communication of central banks should also target householdsFor the moment, our mostreliable information on the general public’s inflation expectations in the euro area comes from the consumer survey conducted by the European Commission. When comparing the different sources of inflation expectations with consumer survey expectations, we can see that they deliver a very different message on the level of inflation expectations, compared tofinancial markets. European households perceive an inflation rate close to 10% whereas their inflation expectations are closer to 5%.One implication of such a result is that we need to improve a lot our communication to a more general audience. Another conclusion we can draw is that, if households are not well aware of the level of inflation,they perceivequite wellthe overall evolutionof inflation overtime(Figure2).As already pointed out by Benoît Coeuré1, while households are not professional forecasters, their inflation expectations usually correlate very well with the ones anticipated by professional forecasters for the same forecast horizon (one year) (Figure3).However, we can see over the recent period,adivergence between consumer expectations and financial markets indicators. 1B.

4Since it could strongly affect the future path of inflation, such a pattern raises several important questions: will this divergencepersist over time or is it very temporary? What are the sources of the divergence in inflation expectations between financial markets and households?III.Firms’ inflation expectations are also of primary interest for Central BanksWhile this conference is mostly about households’ expectations, I would like to stress that monitoring firms’ inflation expectation is also of primary interest from a monetary policy perspective. Compared to households, information on inflation expectations within firmsis even scarcer. This scarcity of information is in sharp contrastwith the relevance of such information for the conduct of monetary policy:at the end, firms are the price setters in the economy and also take part inthe wage setting process. Besides, there is evidence that their expectations affect their economic decisions likeemployment or investment. One of the most comprehensive evidence has been produced for New Zealand’sfirms, showing that inflation expectations among business leaders are not so different from household expectations. In Europe, Banca d’Italia has also developed a very rich and informative firms’expectationssurvey since 1999. The Bundesbank has also conducted a very interesting survey asking trade-unions and employers what was the relevant inflation underlying the last collective wage agreement. Comparative information on such issues across the Euro area would be very useful. I am convinced that more analysison firms’expectations would produce very valuable and relevant information for our monetary policy.ConclusionLet me nowconclude by saying that we need to better measure consumer and firm inflation expectations. This lack of information prevents our communication policies from beingfully efficient. One important questionfor monetary policyis what kind ofcommunication tools can be used to better communicate with the generalpublic and influence their inflation expectations.This conference is a unique opportunity to benefit from the analyses of the most distinguished experts on the various exciting issues that are related to household expectations. I wish you very fruitful discussions. Thank you for your attention.

For release on delivery 11:45 a.m. EDT (8:45 a.m. local time) September 26, 2019         The Federal Reserve’s Review of Its Monetary Policy Strategy,  Tools, and Communication Practices    Remarks by  Richard H. Clarida  Vice Chair  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System  at  “A Hot Economy:  Sustainability and Trade-Offs,” a Fed Listens event sponsored by  the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco  San Francisco, California        September 26, 2019  
 I am delighted to be in San Francisco today to participate in this Fed Listens conference, “A Hot Economy:  Sustainability and Trade-Offs,” which is one of a series of events associated with the Federal Reserve’s 2019 review of our monetary policy strategy, tools, and communication practices.1 Motivation for the Review Although I will have more to say about the review in a moment, let me state at the outset that we believe our existing framework, which has been in place since 2012, has served us well and has enabled us to achieve and sustain our statutorily assigned goals of maximum employment and price stability.  However, we also believe now is a good time to step back and assess whether, and in what possible ways, we can refine our strategy, tools, and communication practices to achieve and maintain our goals as consistently and robustly as possible.2 With the U.S. economy operating at or close to maximum employment and price stability, now is an especially opportune time to conduct this review.  The unemployment rate is near a 50-year low, and inflation is running close to our 2 percent objective.  With this review, we hope to ensure that we are well positioned to continue to meet our statutory goals in coming years. The U.S. and foreign economies have changed in some important ways since the Global Financial Crisis.  Perhaps most significantly, neutral interest rates appear to have                                                  1 These remarks represent my own views, which do not necessarily represent those of the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee. 2 Fuhrer and others (2018) explore the desirability of comprehensive reviews of the monetary policy framework.  They argue that such reviews may help the Fed more effectively identify and implement needed changes to its framework. 
 - 2 - fallen in the United States.3  A fall in neutral rates increases the likelihood that a central bank’s policy rate will hit its effective lower bound (ELB) in future economic downturns.  That development, in turn, could make it more difficult during downturns for monetary policy to support spending and employment and to keep inflation from falling too far below the 2 percent objective.4 Another key development in recent decades is that price inflation appears less responsive to resource slack.  That is, the short-run price Phillips curve—if not the wage Phillips curve—appears to have flattened, implying a change in the dynamic relationship between inflation and employment.5  A flatter Phillips curve permits the Federal Reserve to support employment more aggressively during downturns—as was the case during and after the Great Recession—because a sustained inflation breakout is less likely when the Phillips curve is flatter.6  However, a flatter Phillips curve also increases the cost, in terms of lost economic output, of reversing unwelcome increases in longer-run inflation expectations.  Thus, a flatter Phillips curve makes it all the more important that inflation expectations remain anchored at levels consistent with our 2 percent inflation objective.7                                                   3 For evidence of a fall in neutral rates of interest in the United States and abroad, see, among several contributions, King and Low (2014); Holston, Laubach, and Williams (2017); Rachel and Smith (2017); and Brand, Bielecki, and Penalver (2018). 4 For assessments of the risks that U.S. monetary policy will be constrained by the ELB and its implications for economic activity and inflation, see Kiley and Roberts (2017), Erceg and others (2018), Swanson (2018), and Chung and others (2019). 5 For evidence of a flattening of the slope of the Phillips curve in the United States and abroad, see, among others, Simon, Matheson, and Sandri (2013); Blanchard, Cerutti, and Summers (2015); and Bank for International Settlements (2017). 6 One potential contributor to the flattening of the Phillips curve is a change in the conduct of monetary policy since the 1980s toward greater stabilization of inflation and economic activity; for evidence of such a change, see Clarida, Galí, and Gertler (2000); Boivin and Giannoni (2006); and Boivin, Kiley, and Mishkin (2010).  As discussed in Roberts (2006) and Bullard (2018), greater stabilization on the part of a central bank can lead to the estimation of flatter Phillips curves in reduced-form regressions.  Similarly, the adoption of an explicit inflation objective, along with greater certainty regarding the conduct of monetary policy, can help anchor longer-term inflation expectations and stabilize actual inflation in response to shocks. 7 See Yellen (2015) for a discussion of inflation dynamics and monetary policy; see Erceg and others (2018) for a quantitative exploration of the monetary policy implications of a flat Phillips curve in an 
 - 3 - And let me emphasize that, based on the evidence I have reviewed, I judge that U.S. inflation expectations today do reside in a range I consider consistent with our price-stability mandate. A Robust U.S. Labor Market For some time now, price stability in the United States has coincided with a historically low unemployment rate.  This low unemployment rate, 3.7 percent in August, has been interpreted by many as suggesting that the labor market is currently operating beyond full employment.  However, we cannot directly observe the level of the unemployment rate that is consistent with full employment and price stability, u*, but must infer it from data via models.  I myself believe that the range of plausible estimates of u* extends to 4 percent and below and includes the current unemployment rate of 3.7 percent.  As the unemployment rate has declined in recent years, labor force participation for people in their prime working years has increased significantly, with the August participation rate at a cycle high of 82.6 percent.8  Increased prime-age participation has provided employers with additional labor resources and has been one factor, along with a pickup in labor productivity, restraining inflationary pressures.  Whether participation will continue to increase in a tight labor market remains to be seen.                                                   uncertain economic environment.  Since the mid-1980s, movements in both realized inflation and measures of longer-term inflation expectations have been somewhat muted, complicating the task of extracting the precise role of inflation expectations as a determinant of realized inflation.  Faust and Wright (2013) review the literature on inflation forecasting and present evidence in support of the conclusion that measures of inflation expectations help predict the trend in inflation.  Cecchetti and others (2017) showed that while the level of realized inflation and four-quarter-ahead inflation expectations are positively correlated, changes in these variables have been largely uncorrelated since the mid-1980s.  These authors suggest that, in a low and stable inflation environment, policymakers should pay attention to a wide array of other indicators in determining the implications of movements in realized inflation and measures of inflation expectations. 8 The box “The Labor Force Participation Rate for Prime-Age Individuals” in the Board’s July 2018 Monetary Policy Report contains a discussion of recent developments in labor force participation rates for prime-age individuals; see Board of Governors (2018b, pp. 8–10). 
 - 4 - But I note that prime-age participation still remains below levels seen in previous business cycle expansions. Also, although the labor market is robust, there is no evidence that rising wages are putting upward pressure on price inflation.  Wages today are increasing broadly in line with productivity growth and underlying inflation.  Also of note, and receiving less attention than it deserves, is the material increase in labor’s share of national income that has occurred in recent years as the labor market has tightened.  As I have written before, there is a cyclical regularity in U.S. data that labor’s share tends to rise as expansions endure and the labor market tightens.9  In recent cycles—and thus far in this cycle—this rise in labor’s share has not put upward pressure on price inflation.  The strong job gains of recent years also have delivered benefits to groups that have historically been disadvantaged in the labor market.  For example, African Americans and Hispanics have experienced persistently higher unemployment rates than whites for many decades.10  However, those unemployment rate gaps have narrowed as the labor market has strengthened, and, as President Daly’s research shows, there is some indication these groups especially benefit when the unemployment rate remains very low.11  Likewise, the gaps between unemployment rates for less-educated workers and their more-educated counterparts appear to narrow as the labor market strengthens.12                                                   9 See Clarida (2016). 10 See Cajner and others (2017) for a careful examination of how labor market differentials by race and ethnicity have evolved over time. 11 See Aaronson and others (2019) for evidence on the relative behavior of unemployment rates by race and ethnicity in a strong labor market.  The authors find similar patterns for labor force participation rates and for employment-to-population ratios. 12 Disparities in labor market outcomes are also evident between urban and rural areas of the United States.  However, these gaps have not narrowed as the labor market has strengthened.  The box “Employment Disparities between Rural and Urban Areas” in the Board’s February 2019 Monetary Policy Report examines these disparities in more detail; see Board of Governors (2019, pp. 10–12).  See also Weingarden (2017). 
 - 5 - Wage increases in the past couple of years have been strongest for less-educated workers and for those at the lower end of the wage distribution.13 Scope of the Review The Federal Reserve Act assigns to the Fed the responsibility to conduct monetary policy “so as to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.”14  Our review this year takes this statutory mandate as given and also takes as given that inflation at a rate of 2 percent is most consistent over the longer run with the congressional mandate. Our existing monetary policy strategy is laid out in the Committee’s Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy.15  First adopted in January 2012, the statement indicates that the Committee seeks to mitigate deviations of inflation from 2 percent and deviations of employment from assessments of its maximum level.  In doing so, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) recognizes that these assessments of maximum employment are necessarily uncertain and subject to revision. As a practical matter, our current strategy shares many elements with the policy framework known as “flexible inflation targeting.”16  However, the Fed’s mandate is much more explicit about the role of employment than that of most flexible inflation-                                                 13 Wage gains for workers with different wage levels and with different levels of education can be calculated using data from the Current Population Survey from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.  The Economic Policy Institute (2019) provides convenient tabulations of these data. 14 Even though the act lists three distinct goals, the Federal Reserve’s mandate for monetary policy is commonly known as the “dual mandate.”  The reason is that an economy in which people who want to work either have a job or are likely to find one fairly quickly and in which the price level (meaning a broad measure of the price of goods and services purchased by consumers) is stable creates the conditions needed for interest rates to settle at moderate levels.  For a discussion, see Mishkin (2007).  Quoted text from the Federal Reserve Act is in 12 U.S.C. § 225a (2000), https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/section2a.htm. 15 The statement is available on the Board’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC_LongerRunGoals.pdf. 16 For a discussion of this terminology and references, see English, López-Salido, and Tetlow (2015) and Clinton and others (2015). 
 - 6 - targeting central banks, and our statement reflects this by stating that when the two sides of the mandate are in conflict, neither one takes precedence over the other. The review of our current framework is wide ranging, and we are not prejudging where it will take us, but events of the past decade highlight three broad questions that we will seek to answer with our review. Three Questions The first question is, “Can the Federal Reserve best meet its statutory objectives with its existing monetary policy strategy, or should it consider strategies that aim to reverse past misses of the inflation objective?” Under our current approach as well as the approaches of many central banks around the world, persistent inflation shortfalls of the target are treated as “bygones.”  Central banks are generally believed to have effective tools for preventing persistent inflation overshoots, but the ELB on interest rates makes persistent undershoots more of a challenge.  Persistent inflation shortfalls carry the risk that longer-term inflation expectations become anchored below the stated inflation goal.17 In part because of that concern, some economists have advocated “makeup” strategies under which policymakers seek to undo past inflation deviations from target. These strategies include targeting average inflation and price-level targeting, in which policymakers seek to stabilize the price level around a constant growth path.18  Other                                                  17 These risks could be exacerbated if households and businesses expect monetary policy to be insufficiently accommodative because of proximity to the ELB.  For related discussions, see Reifschneider and Williams (2000); Adam and Billi (2007); Nakov (2008); and Hills, Nakata, and Schmidt (2016). 18 Eggertsson and Woodford (2003) provide an early discussion of how optimal monetary policy at the ELB entails a commitment to reflate the price level during the subsequent economic expansion.  Nessén and Vestin (2005) discuss the relationship between average inflation targeting and price-level targeting.  There is a dearth of empirical evidence on strategies seeking to make up for inflation deviations.  Central banks that pursue an inflation goal generally seek to achieve a specific rate of inflation by some time horizon—
 - 7 - makeup strategies seek to reverse shortfalls in policy accommodation at the ELB by keeping the policy rate lower for longer than otherwise would be the case.19  In many models that incorporate the ELB, these makeup strategies lead to better average performance on both legs of the dual mandate.20 The success of makeup strategies relies on households and firms believing in advance that the makeup will, in fact, be delivered when the time comes—for example, that a persistent inflation shortfall will be met by future inflation above 2 percent.  As is well known from the research literature, makeup strategies, in general, are not time consistent because when the time comes to push inflation above 2 percent, conditions at that time will not justify that action.  Thus, one of the most important questions we will seek to answer in our review is whether the Fed could, in practice, attain the benefits of makeup strategies that are possible in theoretical models. The next question the review will consider is, “Are existing monetary policy tools adequate to achieve and maintain maximum employment and price stability, or should                                                  typically a couple of years ahead or over the “medium run”—without regard to past inflation deviations.  One exception is the Reserve Bank of Australia, whose inflation goal is specified as a range of  “2–3 per cent, on average, over the medium term” and thus might embed some notion of history dependence.  However, Ruge-Murcia (2014) argues that the drift in the price level in Australia is comparable with the drifts observed in economies with purely forward-looking specification of the inflation goal.  The only known historical example of price-level targeting occurred in Sweden from 1931 to 1933 when the country abandoned the gold standard and attempted instead to maintain its price level.  The temporary adoption of price-level targeting is credited with helping Sweden avoid deflation, an outcome that contrasted with that in countries that stayed on the gold standard.  See Berg and Jonung (1999).     See Bernanke (2017) for a discussion of a temporary price-level targeting strategy.  See Hebden and López-Salido (2018) for a quantitative assessment of that and other strategies.  See also Kiley and Roberts (2017) for a strategy in which policymakers aim for inflation higher than 2 percent during economic expansions to compensate for below-target realizations of inflation during economic downturns. 19 See Reifschneider and Williams (2000) for a strategy in which a central bank following a Taylor rule makes up for shortfalls in policy accommodation during ELB episodes by subsequently keeping the policy rate lower than otherwise.  The box “Complexities of Monetary Policy Rules” in the Board’s July 2018 Monetary Policy Report contains an application of such a modified rule; see Board of Governors (2018b, pp. 37–41). 20 See English, López-Salido, and Tetlow (2015) for applications of flexible price-level targeting and nominal income-targeting strategies to a quantitative model of the U.S. economy. 
 - 8 - the toolkit be expanded?  And, if so, how?”  The FOMC’s primary monetary policy tool is its target range for the federal funds rate.  In December 2008, the FOMC cut that target to just above zero in response to financial turmoil and deteriorating economic conditions.  Because the U.S. economy required additional support after the ELB was reached, the FOMC deployed two additional tools in the years following the crisis:  balance sheet policies and forward guidance about the likely path of the federal funds rate.21 In addition to assessing the efficacy of these existing tools, the review will examine additional tools for easing policy when the ELB is binding.  During the crisis and its aftermath, the Federal Reserve considered but ultimately found some of the tools deployed by other central banks wanting in the U.S. context.  But the review will reassess the case for these and other tools in light of more recent experience with using these tools in other countries. The third question the review will consider is, “How can the FOMC’s communication of its policy framework and implementation be improved?”  Our communication practices have evolved considerably since 1994, when the Federal Reserve released the first statement after an FOMC meeting.  Over the past decade or so, the FOMC has enhanced its communication both to promote public understanding of its policy goals, strategy, and actions and to foster democratic accountability.  These enhancements include the Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy; postmeeting press conferences; various statements about the principles and                                                  21 As an illustration of the shortfall in policy support created by a binding ELB during the Global Financial Crisis, the simple policy rules considered in a January 2017 speech by then-Chair Janet Yellen prescribed setting the federal funds rate between negative 1-1/2 and negative 9 percent; see Yellen (2017).  In addition to using these two additional monetary policy tools, the Federal Reserve implemented a number of other measures to stabilize the financial system, increase household and business confidence, and more generally support the economic recovery.  These supplementary measures included the setting up of several credit facilities and the introduction of stress tests for systemically important financial institutions. 
 - 9 - strategy guiding the Committee’s normalization of monetary policy; and quarterly summaries of individual FOMC participants’ economic projections, assessments about the appropriate path of the federal funds rate, and judgments of the uncertainty and balance of risks around their projections.22 As part of the review, we will assess the Committee’s current and past communications and additional forms of communication that could be helpful.  For example, there might be ways to improve communication about the coordination of policy tools or the interplay between monetary policy and financial stability. Activities and Timeline for the Review Let me turn now to our review process itself.23  At our Fed Listens events, we are hearing from a broad range of interested individuals and groups, including business and labor leaders, community development professionals, and academics.  At a research conference at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago in early June, we heard from prominent academic economists as well as national and community leaders.  One panel discussion provided a valuable perspective on the labor market that could not otherwise be gleaned from the aggregate statistics we often consult.  Another panel discussion offered insights into how the monetary levers we pull and push affect communities, credit                                                  22 Starting in 1979, the Federal Reserve published a summary of individual economic projections from various Board members, FOMC members, or FOMC participants in the semiannual Monetary Policy Report.  With the introduction of the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) in 2007, the FOMC increased the frequency of the releases of policymaker projections, expanded the set of economic variables included, and extended the forecast horizon.  Because the SEP includes individual contributions of projections and assessments from all FOMC participants, it captures a broader range of views than those of FOMC members.  For a discussion and data, see Bernanke (2007) and Romer (2010). 23 Information about the review and the events associated with it are available on the Board’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/review-of-monetary-policy-strategy-tools-and-communications.htm.  
 - 10 - availability, and small businesses.  In addition to the Chicago conference, all 12 Reserve Banks and the Board of Governors have hosted or will soon host Fed Listens events. This summer, the FOMC began to assess what we have learned at the Fed Listens events and to receive briefings from System staff on topics relevant to the review.24  At our July meeting, FOMC participants agreed that our current framework for monetary policy has served the Committee and the U.S. economy well over the past decade.  FOMC participants noted that the Committee’s experience with forward guidance and asset purchases has improved its understanding of how these tools operate.  As a result, the Committee could proceed more confidently in using these tools in the future if economic circumstances warranted.  However, overall, we judged that forward guidance and balance sheet tools, while helpful, did not eliminate the risk of returning to the ELB.  If forward guidance or balance sheet actions prove to be insufficient in future episodes, ELB constraints could impede the attainment of the Federal Reserve’s dual-mandate objectives over time.  At our July meeting, we also noted that the Committee’s Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy has been helpful in articulating and clarifying the Federal Reserve’s approach to monetary policy and agreed that any changes we might make to our strategy would likely call for some modification of this consensus statement. We have much still to discuss at upcoming meetings.  I expect we will consider various topics, such as alternative policy strategies, options for enhanced use of existing monetary policy tools, possible additions to the policy toolkit, potential changes to communication practices, and the relationship between monetary policy and financial                                                  24 See Board of Governors (2019b). 
 - 11 - stability.  We will share our findings with the public when we have completed our review, likely during the first half of next year. Concluding Thoughts The economy is constantly evolving, bringing with it new policy challenges.  So it makes sense for us to remain open minded as we assess current practices and consider ideas that could potentially enhance our ability to deliver on the goals the Congress has assigned us.  For this reason, my colleagues and I do not want to preempt or to predict our ultimate findings.  What I can say is that any refinements or more material changes to our framework that we might make will be aimed solely at enhancing our ability to achieve and sustain our dual-mandate objectives in the world we live in today. Thank you very much for your time and attention.  I look forward to the excellent program President Daly and her team have put together.

Insurance Ireland - PwC CEO Survey Report Breakfast Brie(cid:216)ng - Deputy Governor Ed Sibley 27 September 2019 Speech Address at the Insurance Ireland - PwC CEO Survey Report Breakfast Brie(cid:216)ngIntroductory remarksGood morning ladies and gentlemen. I am pleased to be here this morning, and would like to thank Insurance Ireland and PwC for inviting me to speak to you all today.[1]The Insurance Ireland / PwC CEO Survey, published today, contains some interesting insights, including the resilience of CEO optimism about the future, some of the challenges the industry faces and the potential disruption from innovation.  In my last speech[2] on insurance, I focused primarily on the current functioning of the insurance market in Ireland, so today I will take my lead from the survey and focus my remarks on the future and on areas that I believe warrant your attention over the short and longer term.Speci(cid:216)cally, I will:urge you to continue to prepare for the plausible scenario of UK leaving the European Union without a deal;highlight that the insurance industry is arguably the most exposed (cid:216)nancial services sector to the risks, challenges and opportunities of innovation, climate change and demographic developments, and needs to be taking action now to meet these challenges successfully;update you on the Central Bank of Ireland’s (the ‘Central Bank’) increased focus on recovery and resolution planning; andoutline the work that we are doing to drive the insurance industry to address its disappointing lack of progress in improving diversity at senior levels.BrexitThe economic, political and societal risks to Ireland arising from the UK leaving the EU without a deal (a ‘hard’ Brexit) are well documented and so I will not repeat them here, beyond stating they are clearly material to the Irish (cid:216)nancial services sector, over both the short-term (cliff-edge) and the longer term.Based on the work we have undertaken in the Central Bank, the work of the Oireachtas, the actions taken by the European Commission and the work in individual (cid:216)rms, I am satis(cid:216)ed that the Irish (cid:216)nancial system as a whole is suf(cid:216)ciently resilient to withstand a hard Brexit. That is not to say that it will be unscathed, as it and consumers of (cid:216)nancial services clearly will be negatively affected. Frictions will inevitably arise. However, the system as a whole should not amplify the shock and will continue to be able to serve the economy, consumers and investors afterwards.Nonetheless, it is also true to say that not all regulated (cid:216)nancial services (cid:216)rms are adequately prepared. There is no excuse for this, even accepting that there remains considerable uncertainty as to what will happen at the end of October and thereafter.  So, I continue to urge you to make sure your (cid:216)rms are prepared – to make sure that Brexit fatigue and uncertainty does not lead to risks not being suf(cid:216)ciently mitigated.  It is critical that regulated (cid:216)rms have considered all the impacts that Brexit could have on their businesses and that they have developed and fully tested their contingency plans in respect of these. You owe all your stakeholders, including most importantly your customers, a duty of care to ensure that you are prepared.I noted with interest the questions and responses in the survey on regulatory competition and the attractiveness of Ireland as a destination for UK (cid:216)rms seeking alternative EU locations. There are many reasons that Ireland is an attractive location for internationally active (cid:216)nancial services (cid:216)rms.Regulatory arbitrage is not one of them. Numerous international studies[3] and our own experience in Ireland[4] demonstrate the folly of seeking for it to be so.The Central Bank continues to be successful in seeking to operate to and in(cid:217)uence the European norms of regulation and supervision. We have discharged our gatekeeping function effectively, pragmatically and transparently and in line with these European standards. We have robustly challenged (cid:216)rms to make sure that they have suf(cid:216)cient (cid:216)nancial and human resources, are well governed and have business models that are likely to be sustainable through the economic cycle. As a result of Brexit, more than 100 (cid:216)rms have been newly authorised or approved to signi(cid:216)cantly expand their operations having met our expectations.
Our approach not only delivers on our mandate of safeguarding (cid:216)nancial stability and protecting consumers and investors. It also helps to ensure that there is substance in these (cid:216)rms and that consumers across Europe can have the same levels of con(cid:216)dence in the products and services sold from Ireland, as those originated elsewhere – that they are regulated and supervised to the same standard. The long term success of the Irish (cid:216)nancial system depends on its reputation, on the trust and con(cid:216)dence in both the (cid:216)rms and the regulatory environment. This has long been the case. It is even more important now in the context of Brexit.ChangeWe live in an era of continued change and uncertainty. The insurance industry will be signi(cid:216)cantly affected by two of the de(cid:216)ning developments of this era – technology change and climate breakdown. These developments present both signi(cid:216)cant risks and opportunities for the sector and individual (cid:216)rms and there are likely to be winners and losers. Taking each in turn:Technology changeThe survey results highlight the importance and opportunities of innovation. It shows that the majority of respondents are planning for greater use of automation and the increasing importance of data analytics. Technology changes will affect both how insurance is offered, and what is insured.Investment in talent and technology is therefore critical to ensure your (cid:216)rms are able to anticipate and keep pace with these changes. History is littered with failed (cid:216)rms and, in some cases, industries that did not.But you also need to ensure that your foundations are solid. Too many of your (cid:216)rms are not getting the fundamentals right[5], with ineffective IT risk management practices, weaknesses in IT security, a lack of effective oversight of IT, and weaknesses in the management of outsourcing[6]. You run the risk that the investment in the new is being built on the sand of a lack of resilience in the old. Our continuing expectation is that the Boards and Senior Management of regulated (cid:216)rms fully recognise their responsibilities in relation to IT and cybersecurity governance and risk management and place these among their top priorities.Moreover, the increasing use of technology and data analytics to understand and in(cid:217)uence customer behaviour raises important ethical and cultural questions regarding the use of this data and the signi(cid:216)cant asymmetry of information between (cid:216)rms and their customers. The survey highlights that only 22% of respondents believe that the industry has suf(cid:216)ciently responded to changing consumer habits. I am concerned that even fewer of you and your boards have adequately considered the ethics of how data and technology are increasingly being used in your key interactions with your customers, and are ensuring that this is being done in consumer centric way, consistent with your stated values and branding.Climate changeThe insurance industry is materially exposed to climate change. Physical risks will impact liabilities (including the costs of claims) and assets; and transition risks could be extremely costly on the investment side. Since the 1980s the number of registered weather-related loss events has tripled, and in(cid:217)ation-adjusted insurance losses from these events have increased (cid:216)ve-fold in the same period.[7]In addition, transition to a low carbon economy also presents risks, particularly if disinvestment from carbon intensive activities occurs in a disorderly manner. According to analysis by EIOPA, roughly 13% or €1.4trn ($1.6trn) of European insurers' €10.6trn of assets are exposed to climate transition risk[8] - i.e. the change in asset values that might occur in the shift to a low-carbon economy.“The providers of capital – banks, insurers, asset managers and those who supervise them – all need to improve their understanding and management of climate-related (cid:216)nancial risks…. Firms that align their business models to the transition to a net zero world will be rewarded handsomely. Those that fail to adapt will cease to exist.”[9]Moreover, as my colleague Sharon Donnery recently highlighted[10], with climate change, the past is unlikely to be a good guide to the future – catastrophes are getting harder to predict in terms of frequency and impact but it is clear that both frequency and impact are increasing materially. The dynamics of climate change present a major challenge to modelling future impacts[11], but it is clear that the worst possible year is getting worse every year.There is also a very real risk of a collective withdrawal of insurers from covering risks that they consider uninsurable. The International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) shows that the insurance ‘protection gap’ for weather related losses is already signi(cid:216)cant, with roughly 70 per cent of losses uninsured in 2018[12]. As outlined in a recent Economist article, the worst case is that “swathes of the global economy become uninsurable”[13]. In some jurisdictions, such as the UK, this has prompted the state and insurance (cid:216)rms to work together to supply affordable insurance for homes that are at high risk of (cid:217)ooding.It is clear that, as The Network for Greening the Financial System[14] has highlighted, climate related risks are a source of (cid:216)nancial risk, particularly to the insurance sector. This is why the Central Bank has joined the NGFS and is committed to its aims, including assessing climate related (cid:216)nancial risks in the (cid:216)nancial system and integrating them into prudential supervision.As well as risk, there is an opportunity for the insurance industry to play a positive and proactive role in shaping the wider response to the climate change risks. After all, insurance, at its core, is about quantifying the (cid:216)nancial impact of uncertain future events: just as the (cid:216)rst underwriters in Lloyd’s coffee house understood the impact that storms would have on the loss of ships in the 18th century[15] so today’s underwriters, actuaries and risk managers must understand the impact of our changing climate, albeit with much more sophisticated data and models to meet these challenges.
The Central Bank expects Irish insurance undertakings to give full consideration to assessing climate related risks and to adopt a longer-term perspective. Risk management frameworks, and (cid:216)rms’ ORSAs[16] in particular, should re(cid:217)ect these considerations, including taking a prudent approach to the high degree of modelling uncertainty. We expect to see evidence of robust analysis, prudence and challenge, including from the board, and timely and effective action. In this context, I do recognise that some insurers have begun to consider the implications of the investment and underwriting[17] decisions for sustainability[18]. Many more of you need to do likewise, and more besides.Recovery Planning and ResolutionTurning now to a key regulatory development that will require you to take action.Insurance matters. Failures of insurance (cid:216)rms can cause considerable stress and (cid:216)nancial loss for policyholders and claimants and (cid:216)nancial stability risks. But the Central Bank does not have a zero failure regulatory regime. It is important that (cid:216)rms can take risks otherwise they could not sustainably serve the needs of the economy or they customers, and it is inevitable that some will get into trouble as risks crystallise and a few will fail. In this context, the Central Bank aims for (cid:216)rms to be able to recover if they get into dif(cid:216)culty and for them to resolvable in a manageable way if they cannot recover, minimising losses to policyholders and claimants and without recourse to state support. However, internationally and domestically, the insurance sector is not suf(cid:216)ciently advanced in being able to mitigate the risks of these failures, both in relation to the regulatory framework and to (cid:216)rms’ preparedness for crises.Recovery PlanningPre-emptive recovery planning is necessary to facilitate increased awareness and preparedness within (cid:216)rms. Adequate preparation and planning in the form of pre-emptive recovery planning will reduce both the probability of insurers failing and the impact of such failures.  Recovery planning is, therefore, an important part of the overall risk management process of insurers and should be considered a governance arrangement within the meaning of the 2015 Regulations[19].While some (cid:216)rms articulate potential management actions in capital plans linked to their ORSA processes, these capital plans and related management actions are poorly developed and in the main they re(cid:217)ect limited thinking around the practicalities of recovering from a severe stress event. Recovery plans should be pre-emptive and cover a wider range of scenarios (liquidity, solvency and operational) than those currently dealt with in ORSAs or required under Solvency II for SCR or MCR breaches[20]. To be comprehensive, recovery plans need to address potentially less probable, but more severe stresses, they should contain full detail of “triggers” for implementation, escalation processes and recovery options to be taken in different crisis-scenarios and they should identify also potential (cid:216)nancial or operational impediments to recovery.The Bank expects (cid:216)rms to consider recovery planning as a key part of the strategy setting and capital planning and take action now to enhance their ability to recover should they get into dif(cid:216)culty. With this in mind, the Bank plans to go to public consultation next year on proposals to introduce formal recovery planning requirements for insurers under Section 48[21] of the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013.Resolution PlanningThe current powers available to the Central Bank to deal with insurer failures have signi(cid:216)cant limitations. All three powers (administration, examinership and liquidation) are predominantly Court-controlled. Once the Central Bank has successfully petitioned the Court, it no longer has direct control over the process. The availability of other resolution tools, such as the ability to appoint a special manager, or the development of a new write-down and/or conversion (bail-in) power for the Central Bank could potentially better mitigate the impact of failure and cost to the public / policyholders, particularly for large, systemically important insurers.To this end, we will continue to engage domestically and at a European level to seek to develop an effective regime for resolving insurers. The need for a harmonized, Solvency II-linked approach to resolution is now widely recognised across Europe. The calls for such an approach have become pronounced as proposals for home-state managed insurance compensation schemes[22] gain ground in the EU.  However, progress is slow and uncertain, hence the need to consider action at a domestic level, particularly in the context of the potential for considerable contingent liabilities for the Irish compensation scheme. The Central Bank will therefore continue to develop its own approach to resolving insurance (cid:216)rms and we will consider using the Central Bank’s existing powers to seek to remove impediments to resolvability as necessary and in a proportionate way.  This work will dovetail with the work we expect insurance (cid:216)rms to be undertaking on recovery planning.Diversity & inclusionThe Central Bank is committed to driving improvements in the levels of diversity of senior managers in (cid:216)nancial services (cid:216)rm.  This is based on the compelling evidence, including our own experience, that higher levels of diversity of experience, thought, background and attributes at senior levels and an inclusive environment in (cid:216)rms can meaningful contribute to:reducing the likelihood of groupthink in and across (cid:216)rms;reducing overcon(cid:216)dence and improving decision-making;enhancing risk management; andincreasing the level of internal challenge in (cid:216)rms and reducing excessive resistance to external challenge.
Moreover, addressing the lack of diversity at a leadership level across the (cid:216)nancial services system will contribute to cultural change and evidence to your customers that this necessary change is meaningfully taking place.In March 2019, the Central Bank published its third annual report on the levels of diversity of the most senior appointments in the Irish (cid:216)nancial services sector[23]. On both an absolute and comparative basis, there remains a concerning lack of gender diversity at senior levels in the insurance sector. In insurance, 22% of applications for approval for these most senior roles were for women, compared to 23% in 2017.  In other words, the insurance industry went backwards in 2018. Applications for board positions in the banking sector increased to 36% in 2018, with insurance stuck at 20%.The analysis continues to show a pronounced gender imbalance at board level and in revenue generating roles. In the insurance sector, in revenue generating roles, the male to female ratio is currently 6:1 at directorship level (15% female representation). For risk management/ control roles, the male to female ratio is 4:1 (20% female representation).I recognise that meaningfully addressing such an entrenched issue cannot be achieved overnight. But that is not to say that the Central Bank is accepting of the lack of progress. So, as well as following up on the actions being taken in the banking sector following our Behaviour and Culture review last year[24] we are continuing to enhance our supervisory framework and approach to the supervision of behaviour and culture, including diversity and inclusion.To this end, the Central Bank is currently undertaking a review of the insurance sector, which we have prioritised due to the lack of progress and the associated risks in the sector. During this review, we:As well as expecting individual (cid:216)rms to address any speci(cid:216)c issues we identify, we will publish the overall outcome and themes arising from this review early in 2020.  And, we will learn ourselves from completing the work and so continue to enhance our own approach to the supervision of behaviour and culture.ConclusionI will conclude here. Clearly, there is much for CEOs, Chairs and the Boards of insurance (cid:216)rms to focus on. Most importantly, you need to continue to improve the running of your businesses and not to lose sight of the fundamentals of effective governance, effective risk management, the adequacy of your resources, and the sustainability of your business models.These are the foundation of your future success, as you face into the considerable challenges ahead.To (cid:216)nish on a positive note, some might say that insurance is looking quite exciting and dynamic. Perhaps you could better use this excitement to attract, develop and promote more diverse leadership teams.Thank you for your attention.[1] With thanks to Brian Balmforth, Brendan Nagle & Antoinette McDermott for their assistance in drafting these remarks.[2] Sibley, Ed: Speech, Insurance Ireland Annual Industry Lunch - (2019).[3] Dagher, Jihad: IMF Working Paper No. 18/8  Regulatory Cycles: Revisiting the Political Economy of Financial Crises [4] Central Bank Reform Act 2010 amended the Central Bank Act 1942.

Adrian Orr: Opportunity or risk? Our choiceSpeech by Mr Adrian Orr, Governor of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, to the NZX IssuerForum, Auckland, 26 September 2019.*   *   *Tēnā koutou katoa,Welcome everyone and thank you for inviting me to come and speak to you today at the NZXIssuer Forum.I want to talk about some of the near-unprecedented challenges facing monetary policy, and howlonger-term thinking can assist in our efforts to meet these challenges. The fact that we arecelebrating the 150th anniversary of the NZX this year is a great prompt for longer-term thinking.First, the here and now. Yesterday’s Official Cash Rate announcement follows the MonetaryPolicy Committee’s August decision to reduce the OCR by 50 basis points to 1.0 percent, thelowest rate since the OCR was introduced in March 1999.When we made our August announcement we were rightly challenged by some commentatorsas to whether we knew something more than the conventional economic indicators have beenshowing? Our answer remains – no we don’t. We operate in a transparent manner with primarilypublic data, but it is our job to be forward-looking.In making our decision, we assessed that the impact on the New Zealand economy from slowingglobal economic growth and persistently low inflation necessitated further monetary stimulus –so as to maintain our inflation and employment objectives. We also judged that it would be betterto move early and large, rather than risk doing too little too late. A more tentative easing ofmonetary policy risked inflation expectations remaining stubbornly below our inflation target,making our work that much more difficult in the future.We are pleased with the outcome of our decision to date. Interest rates have declined across theboard, as retail banks have passed lower lending rates to many businesses and consumers. TheNew Zealand dollar exchange rate also eased, and the cumulative impact of the easier monetaryconditions is now working through the economy. Lower interest rates alter peoples’ investmentdecisions, especially with the confidence that interests rates will stay low for a long time ahead.In forming our policy position we spend significant effort monitoring domestic and internationaleconomic trends. Over recent weeks, for example, we have visited and listened to a wide groupof New Zealand business people. What we heard is that demand for New Zealand’s goods andservices remains sound. However, there is a multitude of business concerns and challenges.A common concern was that business capacity remains stretched, with some firms struggling tofill vacant roles or even find accommodation for their workers in the same region. Likewise therewas a strong need to invest to expand capacity and productivity, but access to resources – land,capability, and equipment – was difficult. These are signs of an economy with ongoingmomentum.However, there was also discussion of rising economic headwinds from slowing global growth,and continued challenges to domestic business margins or profits. Many factors were sighted forthe margin squeeze – global competition, low global inflation, and rising input costs as labour andcapital resources become more scare. There were also plenty of stories of economic policyuncertainty, as global expectations rise with regard to environmental security, trade access, andclimate change action. For a small trading nation, these issues impact confidence andinvestment. 1 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
Overall, we heard about an economy that is maintaining momentum, but demanding more policycertainty and business confidence, so that firms will invest for the long-term. These are qualitybusiness challenges.We also spend a lot of effort assessing global economic developments. And this is where we aremost challenged, but not alone. Global interest rates are now at a secular low level, in part forpositive reasons and, in part, providing reason for concern.The low level of interest rates globally over recent years primarily reflects low and stable inflationrates – a deliberate and desired outcome of monetary policy. This should be celebrated and notforgotten. We must not fall into the ‘vaccination trap’, where, for example, people observe thatoutbreaks of diseases are less frequent, and hence conclude there is less reason for continuedvaccination.Monetary policy has and remains effective when it comes to determining aggregate consumerprice inflation.Recently, in this restored low inflation environment, central banks across the world have faced anew challenge – inflation that is too low, and running consistently below inflation targets. This hasprompted the need to reduce policy rates so as to stimulate spending and demand. However,given the low interest rate starting levels, some major central banks have had to implementnegative interest rates and/or directly buy assets (increasing their balance sheets) so as to freeup cash for the economy.Understanding why inflationary pressures have eased so much is important as it helps us tocalibrate our policy actions. As is often the case, there appear to be many reasons which wemust balance.The low inflation pressures are in part due to the slowdown in global economic growth, a regularcyclical event that central banks are well practiced in responding to. But there are also structuralfactors dampening inflation pressure and/or altering the impact of lower interest rates oninvestment and spending.Some examples of structural changes include the changing nature of how we produce goodsand services, with more reliance on global technology which is often delivered by a handful ofglobal suppliers at single global prices. We are also producing more services, rather thanphysical goods as a proportion of total output, reducing our relative reliance on capital equipmentand reducing our sensitivity to the cost of investment. Production locations are also mobile, andlabour is highly mobile internationally, making wage bargaining harder even if there are domesticlabour shortages. And, populations are ageing, as people live longer, leading to differentpreferences to save rather than consume.By definition, these structural factors are slow moving, meaning they will anchor the historicallylow interest rates for some time to come. Meanwhile, central banks will continue to vary policyrates in response to cyclical factors, but rates will vary from a lower average, and possibly withina lower range than in the past.In New Zealand, for example, we believe the neutral interest rate – the OCR that is neithercontractionary nor expansionary for the economy – has drifted lower in recent decades. This isfrom a mid-point estimate of around 5 percent in the early 2000s, to around 3 percent today, withplenty of uncertainty around these mid-points.The obvious challenge for many central banks, including us, is that the decline in the neutral ratemeans we have less room to manoeuvre our policy interest rates without concern for the zeroper cent lower bound. What happens if we hit zero? Should the OCR go negative, and/or shouldwe embark on direct asset purchase programme, and what other monetary policy strategies 2 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
could be implemented?We are currently thinking hard about these questions, because it makes sense to do so as aprecaution – it’s best to put the roof on when the sun is shining. Our current view is that we areunlikely to need ‘unconventional’ monetary policy tools. But we would be remiss not to beprepared.We are in a good position to learn what to do, and not to do, from other central banks globally. Ofcourse, one size does not fit all. New Zealand is a small, open, economy with a floating exchangerate, and a concentrated banking system. Hence, we need to tailor our own precautionarysolutions, and understand intended and unintended consequences of different monetary policytools.We are certainly aware that the current low interest rates impact sectors of the economydifferently. However, the dominant force to stimulate activity, employment and inflation across theeconomy as a whole is to bring forward spending and investment.In terms of distributional impacts, low interest rates support employment opportunities andbolster asset prices and reduce the return on bank deposits. The opposite is true when interestrates are high and the net impact on household balance sheets will depend on the mix of assetsthey hold. Our role as a central bank is to contribute to overall economic prosperity by deliveringan environment where inflation is low and stable.Of course, there will be scenarios where monetary policy – whether conventional orunconventional – reaches its limits, and can no longer generate sufficient additional demand, orcan only do so with undesirable or untenable side effects.This is why many central bankers globally have said ‘monetary policy needs friends’. The friendsof central banks are government fiscal policy (taxes and public spending and investment) growthsupportive structural policies, and the business confidence and capability to invest in productivity-enhancing infrastructure.The good news for New Zealand, unlike many other OECD economies, is that our government’sbooks are in good shape and there is already a strong fiscal impulse underway from publicspending and investment. We have the trifecta of sound government finances, clearinfrastructure demands, and low hurdle rates for investing.The same can be said for corporate balance sheets in New Zealand, with relatively low levels ofdebt, and a strong demand for goods and services, our businesses are well placed to perform.So what is holding businesses and government back from further increasing investment andexpenditure?New Zealand’s economic ‘problem definition’ appears well advanced, and the good news is thesolutions sit largely with us as New Zealanders.We have the macroeconomic stabilisers in place – well-established monetary policy practicesand sound long-term fiscal parameters. However, there remains a loud call from all quarters ofthe country for leaders to better signal investment intent, and ensure we have the policy andgoodwill to facilitate access to capital and resources to execute.This call for investment-intent is to all collectively-owned (e.g., Iwi), Crown-owned (i.e., centraland local government), and co-operatively owned (e.g., traditional primary sector) sectors. It isnot just to traditional businesses, or any one party.Easily said, harder to do without a clear desire to work together over an agreed horizon.The Reserve Bank is working on a few long-term projects itself to ensure that our financial 3 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
system is more resilient to economic slowdowns. Our Annual Report will be made public onMonday, outlining a wide range of investment activities.Most importantly, we are acting to ensure New Zealand remains less susceptible to short-term,sometimes only fair-weather, funding that creates pockets of excess debt and exacerbateseconomic cycles.We acknowledge that our actions at time may look confusing to the casual central bankobserver.On the one had we have set low interest rates to deliberately encourage investment andspending, which may be funded with higher debt. This is how monetary policy works.On the other hand we are saying we are concerned about some pockets of debt – especially insome highly leveraged households (residential mortgages), and in some pockets of dairy farming(rural lending).So how can we achieve more investment and more resilience at the same time? The good newsis we have more than one tool at the central bank, and these tools work over different horizonsand achieve different purposes.For example, by now you should all be aware of the Reserve Bank’s Capital Review proposal.Our proposals would see significant increases in shareholder capital in banks. With bankshaving more of their own ‘skin in the game’, the owners will sharpen their long-term customerfocus, and it will reduce the chance of a bank failure and the cost on society as a whole should abank fail. These outcomes are highly desirable for the long-term economic health of NewZealand, and should promote deeper and more liquid local equity and debt markets.We finalise our decisions in early-December this year. Whatever our final decisions, we will beinsisting on transition to higher capital at a sensible pace. But we will be talking more and betterquality capital.How have some lenders (banks) responded to date? Many of the large banks have spent thepast 10 or so years lending aggressively to households and the dairy sector during the goodtimes. They have also spent the last 12 months or so revisiting this wisdom, and have beenraising their lending margins and/or making credit much harder to access for some customers –especially rural customers.Such bank activity is pro-cyclical, fair weather, behaviour that leads to misallocated capital,industry booms and busts, and larger economic hardship on broad society – not the bankshareholders themselves. Over the last 12 months or so – as we have been working with allstakeholders on our capital proposals – we have reduced the OCR by more than the banks’estimated costs of the higher capital requirements. Yet, for some sectors of the economy, suchas agriculture, their borrowing costs have risen. This can only happen if banks are significantlyraising their margins.This is not a sign of long-term thinking when it comes to bank borrowing and lending, and it is nota sign of a highly competitive banking services in core sectors of the New Zealand economy. Weare monitoring this behaviour, to assess the degree of any ‘front-loading’ of our capital proposals,and I encourage all customers to question their banks on issues of competition.I have covered a lot of ground. Why are interest rates so low? Why is this a global issue? Whatdoes it mean for New Zealand business and the Reserve Bank? What else can we do to takeadvantage of these low interest rates? And how can we better bolster the financial system to bemore long-term in its capital allocation?In summary, we are not alone in the low interest rate environment, this is a global phenomenon. 4 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
However, what we do have is more policy and business opportunities than most OECDeconomies and this is something that we need to take advantage of. We will need to be long-term in our planning and investing, and now is a good time to get ahead – given the trifecta ofsound balance sheets in business and government, infrastructure gaps, and low hurdle rates toinvest.Meitaki, thank you 5 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
Mario Draghi: Macroprudential policy in EuropeWelcome remarks by Mr Mario Draghi, President of the European Central Bank and Chair of theEuropean Systemic Risk Board, at the fourth annual conference of the ESRB, Frankfurt amMain, 26 September 2019.*   *   *It is my pleasure to welcome you to the fourth annual conference of the European Systemic RiskBoard (ESRB). Since this is the last time I will open this conference as Chair of the ESRB, Iwanted to reflect on the development of macroprudential policy over the course of the past eightyears. In that time it has evolved from an idea that mostly existed on paper into policyinstruments that have been widely implemented. Europe is now better placed to prevent ormitigate risks to financial stability than it was in the run-up to the global financial crisis.Yet there is still unfinished business: analytical tools to assess systemic risk need to beenhanced; macroprudential instruments to prevent or mitigate systemic risk need to keep pacewith the evolution of the financial system; and the policy framework needs to be furtherdeveloped.Establishing macroprudential policy in EuropeAt the start of my term in 2011, Europe was still dealing with the aftermath of the global financialcrisis. Other financial stability risks – notably those associated with the sovereign debt crisis –were also crystallising. The costs to society from the crisis were substantial. By 2013,unemployment had risen by 10 million and EU GDP was some 13% below its pre-crisis trend.The build-up of excessive leverage in the financial system was a key element leading up to thefinancial crisis, and policymakers were unable to adequately address systemic risk. While manycentral banks communicated on financial stability issues prior to the crisis, very few countrieshad established national macroprudential authorities with a specific mandate and preciseinstruments for policy action.Some of the tools that we would today call macroprudential instruments were used by centralbanks in Europe during the post-war period, albeit usually for the purpose of demandmanagement. But most were no longer used or were dismantled by financial deregulationduring the 1980s and 1990s. And without means of enforcement, warnings published in financialstability reports prior to the crisis often went unheeded.It was only after the crisis that there was widespread recognition of the importance of the macrodimension of financial stability. An internet search on the word “macroprudential” yields 5,000hits for the eight-year period from 2000 to 2007. By contrast, the past eight years yield 120,000hits.Despite that recognition, macroprudential policy in Europe was far from operational in 2011.Indeed, when the European rules establishing a common legal basis for macroprudentialinstruments for banking came into effect in January 2014, ten Member States still had notimplemented them in primary national legislation.Even where national authorities had been created, there was uncertainty over the right way toassess risks, which instruments to use and how to calibrate interventions. Moreover, there was areal risk of inaction bias since the costs of macroprudential policy are visible and are feltimmediately, but the benefits accrue over time and are difficult to quantify.Given this somewhat tentative start for macroprudential policy in Europe, substantial progress12345 1 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
has been made over the past eight years. Macroprudential authorities now exist in all but oneMember State. The gaps in our framework and knowledge have slowly been filled throughresearch and experience. The ESRB has played an integral part in this process.The framework has also helped to counter the risk of inaction bias. National macroprudentialauthorities have mandates and legal tools to act. At the European level, the ESRB also holds amandate to monitor risks and vulnerabilities and has a number of legal instruments at itsdisposal. It can, for example, issue warnings if it has identified a significant risk to financialstability, as well as recommendations setting out remedial steps to be taken on an act-or-explainbasis.National authorities have certainly demonstrated their willingness to use the tools at theirdisposal. Most EU countries currently have at least one measure in place to address risks in theresidential property sector and half have measures to tackle risks in commercial real estate. 12Member States have decided to impose a positive rate on the countercyclical buffer.The ESRB has likewise taken action. In 2016, it issued warnings to eight countries, drawingattention to medium-term vulnerabilities in the residential real estate sectors. In six of thesecountries, the ESRB judges that the vulnerabilities have not been sufficiently addressed and onMonday published recommendations setting out remedial action to be taken. Five furthercountries were issued with warnings.Areas for further progress in macroprudential policyYet the overall framework for macroprudential policy in Europe remains incomplete. We needprogress in three key areas to counter systemic risk more effectively: better analytical tools, newinstruments that counter the development of risk outside the banking sector and a clearerframework to govern policy actions.The past decade has seen a sustained improvement in the tools available to assess risks tofinancial stability. Better data and better modelling techniques have revealed important insights.Developing the analytical toolkit to adequately monitor interconnectedness and contagionrequires granular datasets, and the ability to map and link data across entities and markets. Thesub-prime crisis in the US banking sector spread to European banks through their directexposures, but it also spread to insurers through the use of credit default swaps.Only a holistic view of the system will allow potential contagion channels to be identified andmodelled. And that requires investing in new technologies for data analytics and enhancing thecapacity for authorities to link and share data and technical knowledge.The second area of improvement for the macroprudential framework in Europe involves keepingpace with developments in the financial system. That requires broadening the range ofmacroprudential instruments beyond those currently available, which focus almost exclusively onthe banking sector.For the insurance sector, the contours of such instruments are taking shape. They includesolvency instruments such as symmetric capital requirements for cyclical risks; liquidityinstruments for insurers with a vulnerable liquidity profile; and instruments to target bank-likeactivities to ensure macroprudential policy is consistent across sectors.The third area for improvement in macroprudential policy involves establishing a clearerconceptual framework to govern policy discussions and interventions. Such a framework wouldfacilitate communication with market participants and the general public, as well as help mitigateany risk of inaction bias.67891011 2 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
For monetary policy the framework is well known and the reaction function of central banks isnormally well understood by markets.By contrast, the framework that governs macroprudential policy interventions is much lessdeveloped, due in no small part to our limited experience of using these tools. The objective offinancial stability is broader than the objective of price stability, so is less easily defined by asingle numerical measure.Developing the policy framework is challenging and will take time. The ESRB approach uses theconcept of residual risk, which is the difference between the level of risk and the currentresilience of the financial system. In setting up the framework, policymakers need to establishthe level of residual risk that they consider acceptable.Regular macroprudential policy decisions would then follow a two-stage process. Policymakersassess the level of residual risk in the system, and if that diverges from the acceptable level, theythen assess the policy tightening or loosening required to realign it.ConclusionLet me conclude.Over the past eight years, the implementation of macroprudential policy in Europe hassubstantially improved, and the ESRB has played a valuable role in facilitating that process.The ESRB’s success derives from its broad membership. Systemic risk takes different formsover time, so discussions incorporating a wide range of viewpoints and experience are vital ifpolicymakers are to successfully safeguard the stability of the financial system.See, for example, European Commission Staff Working Document, Coping with the international financial crisisat the national level in a European context, p.11, which shows that even in 2015 the contribution of the state tofinancial sector repair represented more than 10% of total public debt in many countries.ESRB (2014), ESRB Flagship report on macroprudential policy in the banking sector.Kelber, A. and Monnet, É.

Nor Shamsiah Mohd Yunus: Keynote address - RegionalConference on Climate ChangeKeynote address by Ms Nor Shamsiah Mohd Yunus, Governor of the Central Bank of Malaysia(Bank Negara Malaysia), at the Regional Conference on Climate Change, Kuala Lumpur, 25September 2019.*   *   *It is my pleasure to welcome you to today’s Regional Conference on Climate Change. The recentshroud of haze in Malaysia and neighbouring countries is a timely reminder of the environmentalchallenges confronting our generation and the generations to follow. With the passing of time,these challenges have become more pressing, and their consequences more dire. Yet, ourresponse – at the industry, national and global level – is only just beginning to catch up to theenormous task we face. As described by the former UN Secretary-General, “we are the lastgeneration that can take steps to avoid the worst impacts of climate change”.Climate change does not just threaten polar bears in the Arctic. It also threatens our socio-economic prosperity here in Southeast Asia. It poses risks to the fiscal position of governments,the viability of businesses and the living standards of individuals. As such, the effects of climatechange are not merely an ecological problem for scientists and conservationists to worry about.It presents a major economic issue with direct implications on financial stability. It is for thisreason that Bank Negara Malaysia, along with many other central banks around the globe, aregiving serious attention to climate risk. In my remarks today, I will outline:Why climate change matters for the economy and for financial institutions, and;How we can and must work towards building climate resilience.Why climate change matters for the economy and financial institutionsThe financial sector is an important enabler of economic growth. The ability of financialinstitutions and authorities to identify and manage risks that can impair financial intermediationhas direct consequences on the performance of the financial sector and the economy. Theserisks impact those we invest in, lend to, promise to cover and strive to create wealth with.Climate change impacts all of them, in increasingly significant and lasting ways.As we have seen in recent years, climate change is causing greater volatility in weatherpatterns. Globally, overall economic losses arising from natural disasters have been on anincreasing trend for the past 40 years. In 2018, such losses amounted to USD160 billion – halfthe size of Malaysia’s economy, and among the costliest disaster year on record. Last year, Asiawas the continent most affected by geophysical events, where typhoons, earthquakes, landslidesand flash floods accounted for 43% of all events worldwide and for 74% of fatalities. Whilestorms and droughts have long been familiar to this region, they have become more intense,more prolonged and more frequent. This translates into greater economic loss for governments,businesses and households – which in turn, can make its way into the financial system.Evidence of these effects can clearly be seen from recent events:The Thai floods in 2011 cost USD45 billion in damages and affected 240,000 smallbusinesses. Carmakers in Malaysia, Japan and the US had to slow down production due tothe interrupted supply of parts from Thai factories. Prolonged supply chain disruptions,which  took  months  to  recover,  had  direct  financial  and  economic implications – Thaiexports fell, its budget deficit widened and the economy shrank by around 2%. The total costto the Thai economy was much higher if we account for the cost of repairs, rebuilding andmitigation measures to prevent a repeat of the disaster. 1 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
Closer to home, the floods that hit Kelantan and Terengganu in 2014 were among Malaysia’sworst ever. More than 200,000 people were affected and displaced. Businesses andfinancial institutions had to temporarily shut their operations. Economic activities andfinancial intermediation were disrupted. The Government spent over RM2 billion to rebuildbasic infrastructure, such as roads and schools. The average cost to individual householdswas estimated to be more than two years of income for their breadwinners. In 2017,massive floods in Penang and Kedah saw similar effects. Banks also bore the costs ofmoratoriums on loan repayments that were provided to those affected by such disasters. Asclimate-related events intensify, these costs will escalate.As a result of the severe and prolonged El Niño drought in 2016, the agriculture sector inMalaysia shrank by 5.2%. Last year, adverse weather (and production constraints) dentedyields yet again, causing the sector to contract by up to 2.5% in the second quarter. This isnot an isolated problem for the agriculture industry. These shocks can also jeopardisedomestic food production and cause prices to inflate. For instance, the irregular weather andprolonged haze conditions in 2015 caused the prices of fresh vegetables to rise by 7.7%.Climate change can also affect the economy structurally and gradually. We know that theearth is warming.The global average temperature has been increasing by 0.1 degrees Celsius each yearsince 1950. What we may not realise is that our cities are becoming hotter even morequickly. Some cities, despite efforts to maintain green lungs, are heating up twice as fast –as the relentless construction of high-rise steel, glass and concrete buildings work intandem with asphalt roads to trap heat in the city.Global warming is not just a problem on dry land. Warmer oceans affect the food chain formarine life and aggravate the already declining supply of fishery resources. This in turnaffects the fishing industry and the livelihood of fishermen.Warming oceans also mean melting ice caps, raising sea levels. One in three people inSoutheast Asia live in low-elevation coastal zones. Alarmingly, since 1993, the Straits ofMalacca has risen by the width of an iPhone 5. If this rise doubles, we may see 15 metres ofshoreline erosion, which will displace many coastal populations and businesses.Additionally, coastal erosion will directly impact tourism in places such as Kota Kinabalu andmanufacturing in industrial zones such as Kota Bharu, Kuala Terengganu and Mersing. Ifthis trend continues, our mangroves would completely sink by 2040 and industrial zones willbe affected by 2060. Our ports, the lifeblood of international trade linkages, will also struggleto cope with rising sea levels. A recent study estimates that pre-emptively adapting PortKlang and Tanjung Pelepas for climatic conditions expected in 2070 will cost nearly RM3billion. Naturally, this cost would be far greater if not planned for in advance.The effects of climate change are real. They are already upon us; and make no mistake, they willintensify. For this reason, financial institutions can no longer be passive about climate changeand its effects. There is a clear economic case for building resilience to climate change: itdirectly affects our balance sheets, and can pose a broader risk to financial stability fromsignificant and prolonged climate-related events.So far, I have explained the direct, physical risk posed by climate change to the economy andfinancial industry. However, it is not only the climate that is changing. The changing behaviours ofeconomic agents also give rise to significant transitioning risks. As the world becomesincreasingly concerned with reducing the global carbon footprint, governments, businesses andconsumers are pushing for a transition to a more sustainable, greener economy. As thishappens, some sectors of the economy may face declining demand, big shifts in asset values orhigher costs of doing business. For instance, governments’ actions to enforce the Paris 2 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
Agreement could see the vast majority of the world’s proven fossil fuel reserves left in theground. This has implications on the value of investments in energy companies, particularlythose dealing with oil, gas and coal.For many emerging market economies, the transition towards sustainability also invites policyconflicts. For example, national goals for reducing fossil fuel use may entail significant trade-offswith growth and poverty reduction objectives, at least in the short- to medium-term. Thesechallenges are further intensified by broader environmental, social and governance (ESG)considerations. Achieving sustainable growth and development amidst capacity and fundingconstraints can present significant challenges for political leadership, economic priorities andsocial outcomes. Under these circumstances, the higher cost of transition is likely to mean that alonger time is needed for the transition towards more sustainable growth policies, while keepingin mind that this may be at the expense of heightened physical risks as a result of delayed action.This remains a difficult balance that requires careful and well-informed assessments, policycoordination, planning and communication.A very real example, close to home, is palm oil. As we all know, many in the global communityhave expressed concerns about the environmental impact of the palm oil industry, whichaccounts for 7% of Malaysia’s gross exports. Regardless of whether these concerns arejustified, the fact remains that the industry is faced with significant transition risks. Thegovernment and industry’s response to these risks will ultimately determine the resultingeconomic impact on firms in the industry, their counterparties and the economy more broadly.Inevitably, some adjustments will need to be made. Already, the industry is working towards theend-2019 deadline for certification of Malaysian Sustainable Palm Oil (MSPO) compliance. Butthe stark reality is that these adjustments will not come easily, especially for smallholders. In thisregard, I would like to applaud the effort made by several banks to educate and assist borrowersin the palm oil industry in their journey to obtain MSPO certification. Such efforts are crucial toensure that the transition is orderly and can be sustained.How we can work towards building climate resilienceHaving established – I hope – a clear case for action, let me now address how we can worktowards building climate resilience together. The Bank has identified several key priorities.First, we have to develop the tools and capacity for identifying climate risks relevant to financialbusiness. Climate change science is complex and multivariate. Getting to grips with issues suchas weather patterns, groundwater management and sustainable palm oil go well beyond theremit of traditional cash flow projections, credit loss modelling or interest rate yield curves. Wewill need to know what issues to pay attention to, how those issues affect your business and finda common language to discuss them in a meaningful way. To this end, the Bank and SecuritiesCommission Malaysia, are collaborating with the World Bank to develop a principles-basedtaxonomy to enable financial institutions in Malaysia to classify green assets consistently. Thisframework aims to support informed decisions and analysis of exposures to climate risk in fundraising, lending and investment activities. The Bank expects to issue the first draft of thetaxonomy by the end of this year for industry feedback prior to its adoption.Second, we need to develop a more complete understanding of the impact of climate-related risks to the Malaysian financial system and economy. In this regard, the Bank is activelyinvolved in working together with the Central Banks and Supervisors Network of Greening theFinancial System (NGFS) to develop an analytical framework to assess such risks. This entailssizing the impact of climate change on our financial system and economy, both in the centralcase and tail-end scenarios. This exercise also aims to estimate the relevant time frames inwhich these risks may materialise. To do so, we would need to better understand thetransmission channels of climate-related risks, taking into consideration potential second-roundeffects and feedback loops. Ultimately, this exercise would provide valuable insights on how to 3 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
best integrate climate-related risks into the Bank’s macroeconomic and financial surveillanceactivities and feed into wider policy responses to climate change.Third, we will need to address the appropriate treatment of climate risks within the prudentialand supervisory frameworks for financial institutions. As a start, the Bank will require financialinstitutions to report their exposures to climate risks once work on the green taxonomy has beenfinalised. Information gathered through this process will be used by the Bank to considerchanges to prudential standards to better reflect risks from climate-related exposures.Concurrently, the Bank also intends to align, where relevant, the reporting requirements forclimate-related risks with the Value-Based Impact Assessment Framework (VBIAF), which willbe finalised by October this year, as well as its corresponding VBIAF Sectoral Guide, which iscurrently being developed. In addition, the Bank will increase its engagements with individualfinancial institutions to better understand how they consider climate risks in their riskmanagement approaches and practices.Fourth, we need to strengthen the use of disclosures more broadly, to provide greatertransparency on how climate risk considerations are integrated into business decisions. Suchdisclosures, by both financial institutions and non-financial firms, will help drive action towardsmore effective risk mitigation and better adaptation to climate change. To this end, the Bank willwork with the industry to implement the recommendations of the FSB Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) in Malaysia.Fifth, the financial industry will need to step forward and facilitate an orderly transition forhouseholds, businesses and governments to adapt to the physical and transition risks ofclimate change. This involves different players in the financial ecosystem – including banks,insurers and takaful operators, venture capital and private equity firms – to ideate and innovatesolutions that would help the economy face the imminent climate-related risks. There is anurgent and critical need to develop sustainable financial solutions, including funding andinvestment structures with appropriate incentives and support mechanisms, to catalyse greaterclimate resilience for firms and households.Building climate resilience is no small feat. There is much work to be done with a window toaccomplish this work that is rapidly closing. Clear policy at the national level will be critical toenable the financial industry to size up the physical and transition risks, and implement strategiesto manage these risks. Sector-specific approaches will also need to converge to limit risks of adisorderly transition. This is a shared responsibility that requires us to come together to supportjoint and coordinated responses to a clear and present threat to growth and financial stability. Tothis end, I am pleased to announce that the Bank and the Securities Commission Malaysia areestablishing a Joint Committee on Climate Change with industry representation to pursuecollaborative actions for building climate resilience in the Malaysian financial sector. The keymandates of the Joint Committee are to:Build capacity through the sharing of knowledge, expertise and best practices in assessingand managing climate-related risk;Identify issues, challenges and priorities facing the financial sector in managing the transitiontowards a low carbon economy; andFacilitate collaboration between stakeholders in advancing coordinated solutions to addressarising challenges and issues.Beyond resilienceAs we intensify our efforts to increase climate resilience, let us not forget that climate actionbegins with each of us. For the Bank, this has meant making changes to our own internaloperations to reduce our carbon footprint. For several years now, we have been watering ourgrounds using rainwater harvested by our roofing systems. We have also actively reduced our 4 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
carbon footprint in our currency management operations. We print fewer brand new notes anduse durable polymer banknotes to prolong their lifespan in circulation. We also employ co-processing, where shredded old notes are converted into productive energy – this has saved 440tons of CO2 emissions since 2016. The Bank has also embarked on a digitalisation strategy thatwill significantly reduce internal usage of paper. We have also progressively moved toincorporate wider sustainability considerations in our investment decisions.Within the financial sector, the leadership shown by the Islamic finance industry in adoptingvalue-based intermediation is a positive step towards sharpening the focus of finance on creatinga positive impact to the economy, people and the environment. Several financial institutions arealso allocating more capital towards innovation that promotes sustainability – such as inrenewable energy sources, and sustainable agro-production and manufacturing. Others areproviding incentives to encourage “greener” consumption that is less damaging to theenvironment. This includes preferential rates for hybrid vehicles and financing projects with aGreen Building Index certification which serve to encourage manufacturers and developers tobuild more sustainable solutions.Climate change will have irreversible consequences for us all. The effects to the planet, andglobal efforts to transition towards greater sustainability, will certainly have implications for theeconomy and for financial stability which cannot be ignored. Our window of opportunity to act isnarrowing very quickly. In the period ahead, it is crucial that the financial industry faces thesechanges in a deliberate, informed manner. We must respond strategically, and pre-emptively;and we must act now. We can no longer afford to just react once the worst has alreadyhappened. The stakes are simply too high.On our part, the Bank is committed to ensuring that the financial system remains resilient in theface of these risks. To this end, I have set out a broad outline for achieving climate resilience.The task ahead will call for strong leadership in working with authorities, businesses andhouseholds to address what may be one of the greatest threats to our generation.Discussions at this conference aim to help us meet this challenge with greater confidence andconviction on what must be done – individually and collectively. On that note, I look forward to theengaging sessions ahead. Thank you. 5 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
1  Regulatory and Supervisory Expectations on Compliance Function in Banks (Shri M.K.Jain, Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of India - Tuesday, August 20, 2019 - at Financial institution Benchmarking and Calibration (FIBAC) 2019 – the Annual Global Banking Conference organised by IBA and FICCI, Mumbai) Shri Sunil Mehta, Chairman – IBA, Chairmen and Chief Executive Officers of banks, other dignitaries and participants, Good Evening to all. This conference brings in the best minds from the Indian banking fraternity, the technology, knowledge and other service providers together to deliberate the latest developments and future agenda for  banks in India. It is indeed a great pleasure to be amongst you here today. The banking landscape of India is changing rapidly. With the evolution of technology, the entire industry has undergone a massive transformation that has changed the way  financial procedures are carried out, and the way financial institutions operate. The collaboration between finance and technology has led to a radical change in several aspects of banking. Financial technology is said to be a disruptive force that in the future is expected to reshape the financial sector, business models and banking structures. This paradigm change has posed significant challenges to the banks as well as the regulators. One of the important challenges is ‘compliance’; a very important aspect for sustainable success story for any banking and financial system. I am going to share my thoughts on this aspect today. Compliance is defined as the act of following laws, rules, regulations, and various codes of conducts including the voluntary ones. Although most of these arise from external requirements, following the organization’s own internal rules, policies, and procedures, acting in accordance with ethical practices is equally important. A strong compliance culture should also ensure adherence to fair practice codes, manage conflicts of interests, and treat customers fairly, with the larger objective of delivering efficient customer service. Thus, compliance shall go beyond what is legally binding and embrace broader standards of integrity and ethical conduct. Benefits of good compliance culture It is very important for banks to demonstrate a good compliance culture to maintain their reputation and win the trust of customers, investors and regulators. Such culture is important for banks to avoid poor conduct and loss of trust.  A good compliance culture can benefit banks in several ways1; which includes: i) low organizational and individual risk; ii) low reputational risk; iii) less hesitance and more confidence among employees while performing their jobs; iv) Helps attract and retain talent and ensure employee engagement. v) improved transparency which enables better decisions; vi) enhanced relationship with regulators and other stakeholders and vii) enhanced valuation among investors;  In a stress tests survey conducted by banks, it was observed that compliance can have some business benefits. Over a third of bankers who have undergone the stress testing program indicated that top benefits of complying with stress testing principles are better informed capital planning decisions, and maintaining2 a forward-looking view of the organization’s risks.                                                             1 https://www.pm360online.com/silver-linings-10-business-benefits-of-your-compliance-program/ 2 https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomgroenfeldt/2014/08/19/compliance-efforts-can-bring-business-benefits-for-banks/#2b5b69f6772c  
2  We, therefore, need to embrace compliance if we want customer satisfaction which eventually leads to better return on equity. Costs of poor compliance culture Compliance risk is the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, material financial loss, or loss to reputation a bank may suffer as a result of its failure to comply with laws, regulations, rules, related self-regulatory organization standards, and codes of conduct applicable to its banking activities. On the other hand, an effective process would identify compliance risks in each business line, product and process, and devise ways to mitigate such risks.  The processes and requirements should be properly documented with a list of do’s and don’ts accompanying the same. The instances of failure to adhere to proper conduct should be converted into case studies and disseminated among the staff for education and entrenchment of desired attitudes.   Banks should eschew the tendency to treat compliance merely as cost and should recognise that proper conduct saves the bank from possible reputational loss and penalties – thus, generates hidden earnings which most banks do not quantify, and hence do not realise. A poor compliance culture may lead to heavy costs to the banks. Globally, from the beginning of the financial crisis and  until 2020, penalties and fines on banks is are expected to top USD400 bn. Quinlan and Associates, a Hong Kong-based financial services consultancy estimated that  bad behaviour had erased $850 billion in profits for the top 50 global banks since the 2008 financial crisis in the form of write-downs, trading losses, fines and higher compliance costs3. From June 2018 to July 2019, the Reserve Bank has imposed monetary penalties on 76 occasions amounting to ` 122.9 crore on various commercial banks operating in India.  However, fear of fines and penalties will not be enough to keep up with the evolving nature of regulations. But a financial management system with built-in control makes compliance an everyday practice that enables the organisation to operate at greater efficiency. In addition, sound governance creates conducive environment for the values of compliance, integrity, trust, and respect for the law; to thrive in the organisation’s culture. As a result, a bank can empower its entire organization to operate with responsibility while maintaining the flexibility necessary to stay ahead of ever-evolving regulations and business challenges.  Compliance culture – Indian scenario Reserve Bank of India had introduced a system of “Compliance Officer” in banks way back in August 1992, based on recommendations by the Committee on Frauds and Malpractices in Banks (Ghosh Committee). The role of compliance officers came into sharper focus since 1995 when the General Manager in charge of Audit and Inspection was made responsible for the compliance functions, with a requirement for periodic reporting or certification on compliance functions directly to the CMD. However, it was gradually recognized that the circumference of compliance functions in banks needed to be not only enlarged, but also clearly defined, especially in a scenario where successive Annual Financial Inspection Reports prepared by the banking supervisor highlighted a host of compliance deficiencies. RBI’s recognition for the need and importance of compliance functions received a further impetus after Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) issued the High Level Paper on Compliance Risk and Compliance Function in Banks in April 2005. These principles formed the basis for our                                                             3https://in.reuters.com/article/banks-regulator-fines/u-s-eu-fines-on-banks-misconduct-to-top-400-billion-by-2020-report-idINKCN1C210D 
3  work on issuing rigors for compliance functions in banks, in the year 2007. Subsequent to the financial crisis, the focus on compliance has gone up significantly, especially in the area of conduct, KYC/AML, suitability and appropriateness of banking products offered to a specific customer.   In this context, and acknowledging the benefits offered by a good compliance culture and costs of poor conduct, the compliance culture of Indian banks needs to be strengthened. During the course of the supervisory process, the Reserve Bank has observed various lacunae in the compliance culture of Indian banks. Some of the weaknesses and irregularities observed have been recurring in spite of the averments made by bank managements having carried out remediation. My expectation from the banks is that they make serious efforts towards overall improvement of their compliance function.  It will not be an exaggeration to say that some of the big losses suffered by banks on account of frauds could have been avoided if a good compliance culture was ingrained in respective banks. As defined earlier, compliance also includes adherence to internal policies and procedures of banks. In most cases of frauds, a common thread is non-adherence to internal policies and procedures by employees concerned. Increasing incidences of frauds in recent years, the quantum of amounts involved and also the complexities of modalities adopted highlight the importance of a strong compliance culture in the banks. Compliance Risk relating to Cybersecurity On a specific note, in technology driven banking, compliance with cybersecurity guidelines is gaining importance.  Generally, cyber resilience frameworks aim to address three broad issues – confidentiality breach (confidential data being stolen), availability breach (systems are intact, but services are made unavailable), and integrity breach (corruption of data or systems affecting the integrity of information and processing methods). Compliance risk relating to these breaches are gaining significance and needs to be addressed on a priority. Minimum supervisory expectation on compliance culture Compliance starts at the top. It may be recalled that, in February 2019, I had drawn attention of the CEOs of select banks, wherein the board of directors along with the senior management were urged to set the tone at the top and usher in a strong compliance culture in banks. Compliance should be an integral part of the culture of the organisation; it should not just be the responsibility of staff working in compliance function. It should be a shared responsibility of each staff member of the bank, and business unit of a bank should be equally responsible for any non-compliance.  A bank should hold itself to high standards when carrying out business, and at all times strive to observe the spirit as well as the letter of the law. Failure to consider the impact of its actions on its shareholders, customers, employees and the markets may result in significant adverse publicity and reputational damage, even if no law has been broken. Strong compliance culture is a pre-requisite for an effective compliance function.  If we may further delve into it, a robust compliance culture has the following essential elements-  Tone from the top- Whether the value statements of Board members, senior management are in sync with value demonstration in actions. The Board’s oversight over compliance function should not be limited to framing policies, and its periodic 
4  review. A bank’s compliance policy will not be effective unless the Board of Directors promotes values of honesty and integrity throughout the organisation. The Board should also formulate and maintain a quality assurance and improvement program that covers all aspects of the compliance function. Accountability – The bank’s senior management is responsible for effective adherence to the compliance policy of the bank by the management and staff; and to for ensuring that compliance risk is minimised. Culture of owning the responsibility individually and collectively by board; clear demarcation of accountability of senior management, functional head and operational head; role of business unit as first line of defence and role of internal audit as third level of defence in facilitating robust compliance culture are all important. Communication: Clarity and transparency should be promoted by making a distinction between general standards for all staff members and rules that only apply to specific groups of staff. An effective compliance culture requires continuous communication of expectations on risk and compliance and practices across the bank; compliance awareness channels for existing and new Board members, senior management and employees; process for containing conduct risk and whistle-blower mechanism. Incentive Structure: An adequate incentive structure should be in-built in the bank’s decision making systems and processes to achieve the desired compliance culture. Ex Ante and Forward Looking: Compliance is distinct from other assurance functions viz., risk management and internal audit.  The focus of the compliance function should be preventive compliance.  By definition, preventive compliance would assess the activities of the bank before hand and prevent non-compliant activities/transactions from being carried out. Compliance should be an ex ante activity and forward looking.  Compliance Organsiation, Authority and Resources: A bank should organise its compliance function and set priorities for managing its compliance risk in a way that is consistent with its own risk management strategy and structures. For instance, some banks may wish to organise their compliance function within their operational risk function, as there is a close relationship between compliance risk and certain aspects of operational risk. Others may prefer to have separate compliance and operational risk functions, but establish mechanisms requiring close cooperation between the two functions on compliance matters. Regardless of how the compliance function is organised within a bank, it should have sufficient authority, stature, independence, resources and access to the Board. Its responsibilities should be clearly specified, and its activities should be subject to periodic and independent review by the internal audit. Management should respect the independence of the compliance function and not interfere with their fulfilment.  Nevertheless, even at the cost of repetition, I would like to stress that compliance is a shared responsibility of each and every staff of the bank.  Importance of Corporate Governance While feedback mechanisms are important in a bank to permeate a strong compliance culture, enabling environment in a bank that fosters such culture embedded with strong internal control has to emanate from the directions of the Board.  Aspects  with benefits to the bank not apparent has to be enforced through a top down approach.   
5  Corporate governance determines the allocation of authority and responsibilities by which the business and affairs of a bank are carried out by its board and senior management, including how they: align corporate culture, corporate activities and behaviour with the expectation that the bank will operate in a safe and sound manner, with integrity and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. In this context, it may be noted that Board should adopt policies in accordance to each bank’s size, complexity, risk appetites, business model and philosophy.  Board approved policies should factor in entity specific vagaries.  Also, mere adoption of policies does not solve anything.  An effective implementation of Board approved policies is essential to percolate down the philosophy embedded in policy throughout the firm.  A strong compliance culture has a significant role to play in this context. Conclusion Lot of improvement is needed in compliance culture across banks. As a supervisor of banks, the Reserve Bank has keen interest in sound corporate governance and compliance culture, as it is an essential element in the safe and sound functioning of a bank and if not followed effectively may adversely affect the bank’s risk profile. Well governed banks contribute to an efficient and cost-effective supervisory process, as there is less need for supervisory intervention. Such sound culture would help in building organisations that are strong, resilient, disciplined and enjoy the benefits of sustained growth and customer confidence. It will also pre-empt several supervisory actions, and attendant reputational risk, that would follow in case transgressions are detected. Role of compliance has been gaining wider attention across the globe and it has been acknowledged by the central banks and bankers alike that compliance warrants considerable attention. Regulators, supervisors and international standard setters have become increasingly cognizant of the fact that merely enacting rules and regulations is a futile exercise unless these are complied with, both in letter and spirit, by the regulated entities. Sound corporate governance and compliance culture will permit the supervisor to place more reliance on the bank’s internal processes. In this regard, supervisory experience underscores the importance of having appropriate levels of authority, responsibility, accountability, and checks and balances within each bank, including those of the board of directors, senior management and the assurance functions by way of risk, compliance and internal audit. I am hopeful that deliberations over the past two days on emerging trends in banking, changes in global regulatory landscape, the new bankruptcy regime in India and technological innovations affecting the way banks do business would prepare banks to not only cope up with the emerging challenges, but also help banks to use the opportunity provided by the new paradigm to further the agenda of inclusive and compliance oriented banking in the country.

 Japan's Economy and Monetary Policy Speech at a Meeting with Business Leaders in Osaka Bank of Japan September 24, 2019 Haruhiko Kuroda Governor of the Bank of Japan (English translation based on the Japanese original) 
1  Introduction It is my great pleasure to have the opportunity today to exchange views with a distinguished gathering of business leaders in the Kansai region. I would like to take this opportunity to express my sincerest gratitude for your cooperation with the various activities of the Bank of Japan's branches in Osaka, Kobe, and Kyoto.  At the Monetary Policy Meeting (MPM) held last week, the Bank, regarding the price developments in Japan, judged that it was becoming necessary to pay closer attention to the possibility that the momentum toward achieving the price stability target of 2 percent will be lost. The Bank also made clear in its policy statement that, while taking this situation into account, it will reexamine economic and price developments at the next MPM, when it compiles the Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices (Outlook Report). Today, I would like to talk about the Bank's view regarding the economic and price developments on which its judgment was based and then explain the basic thinking behind the conduct of monetary policy.  I. Economic Developments at Home and Abroad Let me start by talking about developments in overseas economies. Overseas economies have been growing moderately on the whole, but the pace has continued to decelerate since the start of the year (Chart 1). According to the World Economic Outlook (WEO) Update released by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in July, growth is forecast at 3.2 percent in 2019 on a year-on-year basis, marking a decline from the previous year's figure of 3.6 percent. Growth in the world trade volume has been decelerating clearly, mainly against the background of the increasing and prolonged U.S.-China trade friction and adjustments in IT-related goods. The diffusion indexes (DIs) for business sentiment of manufacturing firms on a global basis have remained below 50 since May, which is the borderline between improvement and deterioration of business conditions perceived by firms. Looking at developments in major regions, the U.S. economy has continued to expand moderately, supported primarily by an increase in private consumption. On the other hand, the Chinese and European economies have continued to be somewhat weak. Specifically, the manufacturing sector in China has remained weak, mainly due to the effects of additional tariffs imposed by the United States and the authorities' measures to push forward with 
2  deleveraging. As for Europe, production has declined since the second half of last year, mainly in Germany, partly reflecting the tightening of gas emission regulations on automobiles within the European Union (EU), and weaker exports to China also have been exerting downward pressure on the European economy.  Looking at Japan's economy, exports -- mainly those of capital goods related to business fixed investment to China as well as the NIEs and the ASEAN economies -- have been relatively weak since the turn of the year, affected by the slowdown in overseas economies (Chart 2). In addition, weakness in exports and related production is leading manufacturing firms to have cautious sentiment. On this point, since the Kansai region, in particular, has a strong economic relationship with the Asian economies, such as China, you may feel such developments.  That said, domestic demand has remained firm. Thus far, the effects of the slowdown in overseas economies do not seem to be exerting on domestic demand (Chart 3). Business fixed investment has continued on an increasing trend, with corporate profits staying at high levels on the whole. According to the Financial Statements Statistics of Corporations by Industry, Quarterly (FSSC), the ratio of current profits to sales for all industries and enterprises has remained at a historically high level. In this situation, business fixed investment on a GDP basis has maintained its uptrend, being positive for the April-June quarter on a quarter-on-quarter basis. Turning to the household sector, private consumption has increased moderately, albeit with fluctuations. This is mainly attributable to the continued improvement in the employment and income situation (Chart 4). The active job openings-to-applicants ratio has been at a high level that exceeds the peak marked during the bubble period, and the unemployment rate has been in the range of 2.0-2.5 percent, remaining at around a low level that was observed during the bubble period. While labor market conditions have remained tight, employee income has been increasing. Japan's economy thus has been on a moderate expanding trend, with a virtuous cycle from income to spending continuing to operate in both the corporate and household sectors, although exports have shown some weakness.  
3  With regard to the outlook, Japan's economy is likely to continue on a moderate expanding trend, despite being affected by the slowdown in overseas economies for the time being. The keys to this outlook are the following: (1) the timing of a pick-up in overseas economies and (2) whether the firmness in domestic demand will be sustained until that happens.  I now would like to talk about the sustainability of domestic demand. Private consumption is expected to continue increasing moderately as the employment and income situation continues to improve. Although the impact of the scheduled consumption tax hike warrants attention, it is likely to be marginal compared to that of the previous tax hike in 2014, mainly because an increase in household burden will be smaller and various measures to smooth out demand prior to and after the tax hike will be implemented. In addition, government spending is expected to underpin the economic activity going forward, mainly on the back of an increase in public investment accompanied by policy measures for national resilience and of spending on hosting the Olympic and Paralympic Games. The sustainability of domestic demand depends on business fixed investment. Business fixed investment has been steady despite the slowdown in overseas economies, and this likely is attributable to an increase in investment that is relatively less susceptible to changes in overseas demand and the business cycle, including that aimed at improving efficiency and saving labor in order to deal with labor shortage, that in research and development (R&D) for growth areas, and that related to urban redevelopment projects. In fact, in the Kansai region, an increase is seen in a wide range of medium- to long-term strategic investment, such as R&D investment in life science, which is the theme of the World Expo to be held in Osaka, Kansai, and investment related to the digitalization of automobiles and use of 5G network. Also, the redevelopment projects in Osaka are getting underway in such areas as Kita (or "the North") and Minami (or "the South"). With regard to the outlook, business fixed investment is expected to increase moderately on the back of high levels of corporate profits and highly stimulative financial conditions. Thus, it can be said that the sustainability of domestic demand in Japan is substantially high. However, business and household sentiment could be affected, depending on developments in overseas economies and financial markets. In particular, if the slowdown in overseas economies lasts longer 
4  than expected, it is necessary to pay attention to the possibility that firms' investment stance will become cautious, mainly in the manufacturing sector.  Next, I would like to explain the other key point, which is the outlook for overseas economies. Although it is likely that slowdowns will continue to be observed for the time being, the growth rates are projected to rise somewhat thereafter, partly backed by the materialization of the effects of fiscal and monetary policies in each economy and the progress in global adjustments in IT-related goods. Thus, overseas economies are expected to grow moderately on the whole. As for now, overseas economies are projected to pick up in the second half of 2019 and into 2020, which is in line with the projections made by such as the IMF. On this point, adjustments in IT-related goods seem to be moving out of the phase of continued deterioration, but there is no clear sign that the global economy will turn to a pick-up. Under these circumstances, downside risks concerning overseas economies seem to be increasing (Chart 5). Since both the United States and China have been increasing incrementally the number of goods subject to additional tariffs, the trade friction between these economies appears to be increasing and becoming more prolonged. They are exhibiting a stance of continuing with the negotiations, but future developments continue to warrant attention. In addition to the trade friction, uncertainties concerning overseas economies include various factors such as the consequences of the negotiations on the United Kingdom's exit from the EU, the effects of stimulus measures in China, and geopolitical risks in the Middle East. Uncertainties surrounding developments in emerging economies also are of concern. Thus, in a situation where downside risks concerning overseas economies seem to be increasing, it is necessary to bear in mind the possibility that the pick-up will lag behind by longer than expected. The Bank judges that it is becoming necessary to closely examine whether overseas economies will pick up while the aforementioned firmness in domestic demand is being maintained.  II. Price Developments in Japan Let me move on to price developments. The year-on-year rate of change in the consumer price index (CPI) has been at around 0.5 percent (Chart 6). It has been relatively weak compared to the economic expansion and tight labor market conditions. While there are various reasons for this, it seems to be affected largely by the fact that the mindset and 
5  behavior based on the assumption that wages and prices will not increase easily have been deeply entrenched in Japan, due to the experience of prolonged low growth and deflation. Thus, it is taking time for firms' cautious wage- and price-setting stance, as well as households' cautiousness toward price rises, to change.  However, the basic mechanism has continued to operate in which a positive output gap -- a rise in the level of economic activity -- results in moderate increases in wages and prices. Let me elaborate on this point. As I mentioned earlier, in a situation where the economy has been expanding moderately and labor market conditions have remained tight, wages of employees have continued to rise and base pay increases have been achieved for a sixth consecutive year. On the other hand, firms have faced upward pressure such as of personnel expenses and distribution costs on prices resulting from an increase in economic activity. In this situation, moves to raise selling prices have been spreading gradually among firms (Chart 7). Regarding the output prices DI in the Tankan (Short-Term Economic Survey of Enterprises in Japan), the situation has continued for seven consecutive quarters in which the proportion of enterprises answering that the output prices have risen has exceeded the proportion of those answering that such prices have fallen. This already has lasted for a longer period than that observed during the bubble period. Firms' stance steadily has shifted toward further raising prices. In addition, looking at annual price changes across all CPI items, the share of price-increasing items minus the share of price-decreasing items recently has been increasing moderately. Of course, the reason why firms can raise selling prices is that households' tolerance of price rises has been increasing, albeit moderately, on the back of improvement in the employment and income situation. Such improvement has been achieved especially because the economy has been expanding moderately and the positive output gap has been maintained.  As for the outlook, it is likely that Japan's economy will continue on an expanding trend and the output gap will remain positive. With the level of economic activity remaining high, firms' stance is expected to gradually shift toward further raising wages and prices and medium- to long-term inflation expectations of firms and households, which have been more or less unchanged recently, are projected to rise gradually. Under these circumstances, 
6  the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is likely to increase gradually toward 2 percent, although this will take time.   Regarding this baseline scenario of the outlook for prices, however, risks are skewed to the downside. In particular, recently, slowdowns in overseas economies have continued to be observed and their downside risks seem to be increasing. Thus, it is necessary to pay closer attention to the risk that the economic slowdown stemming from overseas economies will spread to prices. I will elaborate on this point later when I talk about the Bank's thinking behind the conduct of monetary policy.   III. The Bank's Conduct of Monetary Policy Now, I would like to talk about the Bank's conduct of monetary policy.  The Bank has been pursuing powerful monetary easing under the framework of "Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) with Yield Curve Control," aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent (Chart 8). The main transmission mechanism of monetary easing that the Bank assumes is to lower real interest rates, which are calculated by subtracting inflation expectations from nominal interest rates. Real interest rates currently are well below the natural rate of interest, which is neutral to economic conditions, and are stimulating a wide range of economic activities. In this situation, the inflation mechanism driven by the positive output gap has been operating, as I mentioned earlier. In order to achieve the price stability target, the Bank considers it important to ensure that the inflation mechanism continues to operate and thereby maintain the momentum toward achieving the target.  This stance of monetary policy conduct by the Bank basically has not changed from a year ago, when I spoke at this meeting last time. On the other hand, monetary policy conduct of major central banks abroad has changed significantly from last year's moves toward normalization. This month, the European Central Bank (ECB) decided to lower one of its policy rates and restart its asset purchases, and the Federal Reserve also decided to lower its policy rate, following the rate cut in July. Factors that lie behind these decisions are the prolonged slowdown in the global economy and heightening uncertainties, which Japan is 
7  also facing. At the press conference after the decision to take monetary easing measures, President Draghi of the ECB underlined that, in an environment of prolonged uncertainties related to, for example, geopolitical factors and the rising threat of protectionism, international trade had been weakening and downside risks surrounding the euro area economy were significant.  The Bank of Japan has the same policy stance, in that preventing and insuring against risks are taken into consideration when conducting monetary policy. In doing so, what is essential for the Bank is assessment of the momentum toward achieving the price stability target of 2 percent. If there is a greater possibility that such momentum will be lost, the Bank will not hesitate to take additional easing measures. While various factors are considered when examining the momentum toward achieving the price stability target, the following two points are particularly important. First is whether the positive output gap, or the high level of economic activity, will be maintained, and whether firms' stance will shift toward further raising wages and prices under such situation. Second is developments in medium- to long-term inflation expectations of firms and households. Based on these points, the Bank deems that the momentum toward achieving the price stability target has been maintained so far. With the output gap remaining positive, moves to raise selling prices reflecting cost increases have been observed recently in a wide range of firms. As for the outlook, inflation expectations are projected to rise as many of the factors that have been delaying inflation will be resolved gradually and moves to raise prices will spread widely. Under these circumstances, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is likely to increase gradually toward 2 percent. Thus, the Bank judges it appropriate to continue with the current monetary policy.  However, given that slowdowns in overseas economies have continued to be observed and their downside risks seem to be increasing, it is becoming necessary to pay closer attention to the possibility that the momentum toward achieving the price stability target will be lost. Developments in the output gap warrant particular attention. If downside risks to overseas economies materialize, there is a possibility that the growth rate of Japan's economy will decelerate substantially through, for example, the prolonged weak exports and firms' investment stance becoming cautious. If this happens, the momentum toward achieving the 
8  price stability target could be affected through shrinkage of the output gap. Attention also should be paid to the fact that the impact of the so-called adaptive formation mechanism is large in Japan, in which the actual inflation rate affects inflation expectations. Although crude oil prices temporarily rose somewhat due to increased geopolitical risks, they have declined to some extent from a somewhat longer-term perspective, mainly against the background of the slowdown in overseas economies. If crude oil prices decline further and the actual inflation rate decreases clearly, inflation expectations also may be affected.  Considering that it is becoming necessary to pay closer attention to the possibility that the momentum toward achieving the price stability target will be lost, the Bank will thoroughly reexamine economic and price developments at the next MPM, when it releases the Outlook Report. It will examine economic and price developments from a broad perspective at the next MPM, based on observations that will be available by the time of the meeting, such as various economic indicators, the reports at the meeting of general managers of the Bank's branches, and developments in financial markets. Recently, the situation has been changing rapidly, with investors' risk aversion abating somewhat due to expectations for progress in U.S.-China trade negotiations. Let me also add that the Bank does not have any preconception at this point regarding the outcome of its examination.  Before closing my speech, I would like to elaborate on the Bank's basic thinking on the current conduct of monetary policy. There are three points.  First, the Bank's conduct of monetary policy will continue to be based on the current framework of "QQE with Yield Curve Control," which is highly sustainable and enables the Bank to make flexible adjustments according to developments in economic activity and prices as well as financial conditions. Possible measures for monetary easing include cutting the short-term policy interest rate, lowering the target level of 10-year Japanese government bond (JGB) yields, expanding asset purchases, and accelerating the expansion of the monetary base. Combinations or applications of these various measures would also be an option. The Bank will take appropriate measures depending on the situation, but in any event, the policy effects will be exerted basically through real interest rates and risk premia of asset prices. 
9  Second, the Bank considers that the conclusion reached in the Comprehensive Assessment released in September 2016, in which it assessed the policy effects and their transmission mechanism since the introduction of QQE, is still valid even in the present situation. For example, there is no change in our recognition regarding the impact on economic activity and prices of the term structure of interest rates, in that short- and medium-term interest rates have a larger impact than longer-term rates. On the other hand, the Bank continues to take the view that an excessive decline in super-long-term interest rates could lower the rates of return such as on insurance and pension products, and this may exert a negative impact on economic activity through a deterioration in people's sentiment.  And third, it is important to consider appropriate monetary policy measures while thoroughly weighing their benefits and costs. As I mentioned earlier, "QQE with Yield Curve Control" has been exerting its effects firmly by stimulating a broad range of economic activities through the decline in real interest rates. That said, if the low interest rate environment is prolonged further, it will become necessary to pay closer attention to the costs of policy measures, including the impact on the functioning of financial intermediation and market functioning. Thus, the Bank recognizes that there remains an important challenge to consider what is required to further enhance the sustainability of policy measures.   The Bank will continue to pursue policy conduct in an appropriate manner without preconception, taking account of developments in economic activity and prices as well as financial conditions, while carefully examining various risks. It also will continue to make its utmost efforts as a central bank and strongly support firms' activity in Japan.  Thank you very much for your attention.

Abdul Rasheed Ghaffour: Unlocking full potential of Islamic financethrough sustainabilityWelcoming remarks by Mr Abdul Rasheed Ghaffour, Deputy Governor of the Central Bank ofMalaysia (Bank Negara Malaysia), at the RFI Roundtable on Responsible Finance "Unlocking FullPotential of Islamic Finance through Sustainability", Kuala Lumpur, 23 September 2019.*   *   *It is my great pleasure to welcome all of you to the RFI Roundtable on Responsible Finance. Iwould like to thank the RFI foundation and Dubai Islamic Economy Development Centre (DIEDC)for organising such gathering of policymakers and captains of the financial services industry. The chosen theme “Unlocking full potential of Islamic finance through sustainability” is indeedvery apt and timely.  We are now in an environment where global aspirations are at risk –indebtedness is high, inequality has widened, effects of climate change continue toaccelerate.  Doing nothing is not a responsible option! Despite the growing focus insustainable finance, I am certain many within this room would agree that this transition in thefinancial system, more so the Islamic financial system, is happening not at the desired pace,scale and intensity.  For the next five to ten minutes, allow me to highlight the catalytic role thatIslamic finance can play in advancing sustainability agenda.Shariah embeds inherent features that make it natural for Islamic financial institutions to playsuch role. The three main features:i. First, impact-driven. Intended outcome of Shariah emphasises on minimisation if notprevention of negative impact and maximising positive value creation to wider stakeholdersnamely people and planet. The dos and don’ts of Shariah aim to enhance people’s well-being by preserving five stipulated key outcomes of Shariah (maqasid) namely the wealth,faith, lives, posterity (lineage) and intellect. In the context of financial intermediation,preserving wealth entails beyond its literal meaning – to include encouragement to generate,accumulate and distribute the wealth in a just and fair manner.ii. Secondly, real economy. Islamic financial intermediation activities must be backed by realeconomic activities, thus aligning innovation with the needs of productive activities.Requirement to support the real economy thereby avoids element of speculation.iii. Thirdly, partnership. Another distinct aspect of Islamic finance is the application of risk-sharing in financial transactions. This strengthens the incentives for both financial institutionsand business clients or investors to screen and monitor transactions for commercial viabilityand risks.The growing momentum in global trend towards sustainability agenda does not only sharpen thefocus on formulating necessary solutions to key global challenges such as poverty, food securityand inequalities.  Most importantly, it creates a sense of urgency for financial institutions toembrace long-term value creation mindset. Increasingly, stakeholders are setting higherexpectations on financial institutions to manage the threats of climate and environmental-relatedrisks that are real, with irreversible consequences. Failure to respond appropriately and in atimely manner may have adverse implications on the economy and direct financialconsequences on financial institutions. A case in point is the reputational risk a financialinstitution that provides financing to companies involved in environmental destruction activitiescould face, which may eventually affect the institution’s financial sustainability.Malaysia’s experience and approachA question in mind is therefore whether Islamic finance has fully optimised on these valuepropositions. Allow me to share this in the context of the Malaysian Islamic financial industry. 1234 1 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
After three decades of development, the Islamic finance industry has progressed to become anintegral component of the Malaysian financial system.  Most notably, Islamic finance has playeda catalytic role in financial inclusion – enabling access to formal financial services for the differentsegments of the society. In charting its strategic direction, in 2017, a few Islamic financialinstitutions began to explore value-based intermediation or VBI as a new operational model. TheVBI encapsulates the vision to focus on being more impact-driven, reinforcing the overarchingintent of Shariah to promote good and prevent harm. Islamic finance, moving forward, strives tobe relevant to all as a financial intermediation that creates positive and sustainable values forbroader stakeholders – consistent with the long-term value creation for shareholders and alignedwith the national targets of sustainable development goals (SDGs).To date, 12 Islamic banking institutions have committed to integrate environmental and socialconsiderations in their offerings, practices and cultures. In facilitating the industry in this journey,Bank Negara Malaysia collaborates with the industry to create an enabling environment forsmooth and orderly transition.  These include the issuance of several guidance documents suchas VBI implementation guide, VBI Scorecard and Value-based Impact Assessment Framework(VBIAF). More recently, the Bank and the VBI community of practitioners (COP) have embarkedon efforts to develop sector-specific guide on value-based impact assessment alongsidesectoral experts.  As a start, the focus is on renewable energy, efficient energy and primarycommodity (palm oil).As the industry began to operationalise the VBI, the market has observed efforts to infuse keyelements of VBI in the offerings and practices. These include the launch of the first workingcapital financing for women entrepreneurs this year. This collateral-free facility embeds financialliteracy sessions and focus group discussions to help entrepreneurs in managing and growingtheir businesses more efficiently. Other examples include the launch of an Islamic Index-basedinvestment scheme embedding with environmental, social and governance (ESG) principles, aswell as a financing programme via matching fund platform between financial institution and publiccontributions, which aims to empower communities through entrepreneurship.The takaful industry is also taking steps to implement VBI.  The industry has formed a VBITakaful Task Force to formulate the strategic roadmap for the takaful industry. Several takafuloperators, on their own, have also undertaken a comprehensive review of business strategies.This review has begun to shape changes in the corporate value intent and strategic direction ofthese takaful operators to be more aligned with VBI. Additionally, some of these takaful operatorsare beginning to formulate more value-based protection solutions.Role of technology in optimising potential of Islamic financeOne final point before I conclude – technology makes the impossible possible. Recentfinancial technology advancements enable Islamic finance industry players to deliver practical yetvalue-adding solutions. For instance, application of blockchain to address challenges inmanaging endowment fund (waqf). Fintech is rapidly changing the facets of the global financialindustry, reshaping expectations of consumers and businesses on financial services. There areuntapped opportunities of fintech to develop financial solutions that can help drive Islamic financeto deliver even greater, wider and deeper positive impact – particularly in realising its promise inrisk-sharing and providing support for genuine and productive economic activities. Technologycan also widen access to and increase outreach of social finance instruments throughdigitisation of collection and disbursement of the proceeds. Fintech startups such asLaunchGood and SkolaFund are already making their name in social impact initiatives, which is apromising start.ConclusionFinancial institutions need to look beyond short-term profitability. It is imperative for financial56 7 2 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
intermediaries to be seen fulfilling the needs of the economy, society and environment at large.Moving forward, ‘change of mindset’ is eminent. While considering profit, financial institutionsshould not forgo the element of being socially and environmentally responsible. I believe settingthe ‘Tone from the top’ is key in this process.The organisation of today’s roundtable forum is indeed very apt. It serves as a networking effortwhile creating opportunities to exchange views, explore mutually beneficial opportunities, andmost importantly, implement positive changes in the financial systems. It is not too far-fetched toenvisage the generation of breakthrough thinking for future collaboration that is solution-driven;practical; and innovative. Collective effort is also key to success and the industry should aim towork closely with other key stakeholders. These include government agencies, civil societies andthe public to increase awareness and encourage more active participation in supporting furtherdevelopment and offerings of sustainable financial solutions in the market. Strong technicalknow-how in dealing with the changing dynamics of the financial landscape and the arising risksis also essential for industry players to navigate itself in this journey.To end, I wish to reiterate that “sustainability is indeed a journey, and one that is bestnavigated collectively”. Sustainable development can be best served by re-connecting financeand element of value creation that is reinforced by bringing benefit to society, environment andprosperity. On that note, I wish all of you a beneficial and productive session today.Around 30 least developed and other vulnerable countries are exposed to debt distress – limiting their ability toinvest in the sustainable development goals (SDGs).Countries home to most people in the world and global growth in real wages is only 1.8% – the lowest since2008 (Source: United Nation (2019).

Ravi Menon: Introducing Zhou XiaochuanOpening remarks by Mr Ravi Menon, Managing Director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore,at MAS Lecture 2019 by Zhou Xiaochuan, Singarpre, 19 September 2019.*   *   *Dr Zhou Xiaochuan, President, China Society for Finance and Banking, and former Governor,People’s Bank of ChinaMr Tharman Shanmugaratnam, Senior Minister and Chairman, MASMr Goh Chok Tong, Emeritus Senior Minister and Senior Advisor to MASDistinguished guests, friends and colleagues, good morning.Welcome to the tenth MAS Lecture.Since its launch in 2000, the MAS Lecture has featured leading members of the internationalfinancial community to share their perspectives on the economic and financial issues of the day.I have been trying to get Dr Zhou to speak at the MAS Lecture almost since the time I becameMD MAS eight years ago.On at least a couple of occasions, Dr Zhou actually agreed to deliver the Lecture,only to be prevented from doing so by pressing issues back home in China.And now, the stars have finally aligned to bring Dr Zhou to Singapore and to deliverthe MAS Lecture.Perhaps, there is a deeper significance as to why the stars conspired to make Dr Zhou deliverthe MAS Lecture in 2019 and not earlier.This year marks the 10th anniversary of China’s bold move to graduallyinternationalise the RMB.It was in 2009 that the People’s Bank of China launched a cross-border RMB tradesettlement pilot scheme.Who better to deliver this year’s MAS Lecture than the chief architect and primemover behind that far-sighted policy: Dr Zhou XiaochuanDr Zhou needs little introduction.  We secured his agreement to deliver the MAS Lecture just three weeks ago.  Theletters of invitation went out two weeks. The fact that more than 500 of you are gathered here at short notice is testament toDr Zhou’s reputation as a visionary leader who shaped China’s financial reformagenda. Still, it would be remiss of me if I did not briefly highlight the key milestones in Dr Zhou’sdistinguished career in public service spanning more than 30 years.He held leadership roles in the Bank of China and the China Construction Bank. He served as Administrator of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE)and Chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC).And of course – what he is most well known for – he served as Governor of thePeople’s Bank of China (PBoC) from 2002 to 2018, the longest-serving Governor of 1 / 2BIS central bankers' speeches
the PBoC.Dr Zhou became one of the most respected central bankers on the internationalcircuit.In February this year, Dr Zhou was awarded the Lifetime Central Banking Award byLondon-based publication Central Banking, a most fitting recognition of hiscontributions to the Chinese economy and financial sector.From a bilateral perspective, during Dr Zhou’s tenure, the PBoC and MAS forged close ties anddeepened financial and regulatory cooperation.We collaborated successfully in several areas over the years, particularly inpromoting the greater use of RMB in the region.PBoC’s decision in 2013, under Dr Zhou’s leadership, to appoint the Industrial andCommercial Bank of China as Singapore’s RMB clearing bank was a significantmilestone and spurred the growth of Singapore as a key RMB offshore centre.In 2016, MAS announced that RMB assets would be included as part of our OfficialForeign Reserves, three years ahead of the inclusion of Chinese bonds in key globalbond indices.At the personal level, I have had the pleasure and privilege to interact with Xiaochuan at manyinternational and bilateral meetings.I have always found his views insightful.At our bi-monthly meetings of central bank governors in Basel at the Bank forInternational Settlements, I would sometimes ask Xiaochuan some ratherinconvenient questions – about risks related to shadow banking or industrial over-capacity in China.Xiaochuan would always answer these questions, as well as those from othergovernors, with a disarming candour and clarity, never avoiding the hard issues.This not only helped to build trust among his counterparts in the internationalcommunity but also endeared Xiaochuan to many of us as someone we could counton for insights into the complexities of the Chinese economy and financial system.Today, Dr Zhou will speak on “The Rise of Technology in Finance – Opportunities andChallenges for Central Banking”. Many of us are familiar with Dr Zhou’s views on financial and economic reforms. But not many of us know that that when it comes to technology, Dr Zhou was aheadof the curve amongst his peers.In 2014, before the words “fintech” and “digital currencies” became popular, Dr Zhouset up a Digital Currency Research Institute within the PBoC to explore how newtechnologies like the blockchain and digital tokens could improve and strengthenChina’s financial system.Today, China is a leading fintech player and there is even speculation that PBoCmay become the first central bank in the world to issue its own digital currency – atopic that Dr Zhou will probably touch on, and if he does not, one of you I am surewill ask him about!And now, ladies and gentlemen, please join me in welcoming Dr Zhou Xiaochuan to deliver thetenth MAS Lecture. 2 / 2BIS central bankers' speeches

     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches 2  2   It is a great pleasure to be speaking today at the ‘UK payments infrastructure – renewing for growth’ event at Sibos.  This year’s event is exciting for two reasons.  First, it’s National Inclusion week here in the U.K.1  And, it’s a great coincidence that SIBOS has fallen during this week: at the heart of its agenda are discussions around how change and diversification in payments could lead to a more inclusive financial system.  Second, this is the first Sibos conference to be held in London – and it is certainly an exciting time for so many global payments experts and innovators to be here.    London has a long history at the heart of the global financial system.  It continues to build on this expertise and is one of the leading fintech hubs in the world.  It is home to an incredible pool of the world’s best and brightest talent, with 44,000 people already working in fintech, more than in Silicon Valley or New York.2  Investment into the UK’s fintech sector continues to grow and reached a record level of $2.9bn in the first half of 2019, which was nearly 85% of the 2018 total.3  And we can see that the UK fintech sector is maturing, evidenced by the size of increased investments.  Payments are vital to any real economy and in total nearly 40 billion payments were made in the UK in 2018.4  They are also at the heart of the financial system. This makes London the perfect location for a payments conference, which is focused on “thriving in a hyper-connected world”.  Payments are innovating, fast.  From the infrastructure and the messages that support each transaction, to new players entering the market and consumers seeking new ways to pay for goods and services.   Future of Finance, Future of Payments  While the core mission for the Bank of England is maintaining monetary and financial stability, we also seek to enable innovation and empower competition in the financial system.  To support our forward looking and dynamic approach we recently commissioned and responded to the Future of Finance report.5  It considered how financial services might evolve over the next decade, and what this could mean for each of us: for users, the system and the Bank itself.  The report highlighted that a new economy and new demographics demand a new financial system.  This system must be resilient, fair and dynamic.  We have prioritised five areas of work: we are enhancing the payments system for the digital age; we will champion a platform to boost access to finance for small businesses; we will support the transition to a carbon-neutral economy; we will develop a world-class regtech and data strategy; and we will facilitate firms’ use of technology.                                                        1 https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2019/victoria-cleland-national-inclusion-week-launch-event-at-house-of-lords 2 https://files.londonandpartners.com/business/resources/london-fintech-scene-2017.pdf 3 https://www.innovatefinance.com/news/uk-fintech-investment-flying-high-in-h1-2019/ 4 https://www.ukfinance.org.uk/system/files/Summary-UK-Payment-Markets-2018.pdf 5 https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/report/2019/future-of-finance 
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches 3  3   Today, I will focus on how the Bank will support a more resilient, innovative and competitive payments system for UK households and businesses: we have a vision that payments will become cheaper, instantaneous and more seamless, including across borders.  At the heart of this is the UK’s Real-Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) service which settles around £650bn of payments each working day, close to a third of the UK’s annual GDP.  Not much business can be done without it, and most consumers are ultimately reliant on it.  I will tell you shortly about our leading-edge work to renew this service, but this is not all we are doing.  We are also pursuing a number of even more far-reaching strands which together have the potential to transform the current payments landscape.  I want to share a few of these with you today.  First, cross border payment is for many a long standing frustration - often badged as slow; inefficient and expensive for both financial institutions and end users.  In 2018 we published a summary of our joint collaboration with the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Bank of Canada to explore opportunities to make cross-border payments more efficient.  But we want to take this further and play a leading role in supporting effective change in this area.  We have started new work to understand what the frictions are and how we can work with our central banking colleagues globally to push forward this agenda, to deliver prompt settlement in different currencies and empower private innovations in cross-border finance.   Second, we will continue to champion the Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) as a globally recognised and unique identifier for all businesses.  The global LEI system contributes to many financial stability objectives such as improved risk management in firms, better assessment of micro and macro prudential risks, facilitation of orderly resolution, and enables higher quality and accuracy of financial data overall.  In addition to financial stability benefits, LEIs provide valuable data and support anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism efforts.  They could, if linked to portable credit files, improve access to the domestic and global financial system, support greater choice and competition for business finance.  The LEI could also act as the unique identifier for a digital ID, which could help the two-step verification process required for a more secure system.  For all these reasons, the Bank is supporting the specific recommendation on the use of LEI in payment messages made by the Financial Stability Board in its May 2019 report on LEI implementation.6 In this context, we welcome the report issued by the PMPG on adoption of LEI in payments messages and its recommendations that firms should adapt their business processes to ensure that LEIs are captured whenever a new counterparty or customer record is set up.7  And importantly we are integrating the LEI in the ISO 20022 messages used in CHAPS (the Bank-operated High-Value Payment System).  Third, we will consult in 2020 on the appropriate level of access for payments service providers to the Bank’s infrastructure and balance sheet, including necessary safeguards.  This is important to ensure that the right balance is struck between access, maintaining financial and monetary stability and protecting public money                                                       6 https://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/P280519-2.pdf 7 file:///C:/Users/331016/Downloads/pmpg_lei_paper.pdf 
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches 4  4   from undue risks.  We will reach out to key firms and the users of payments services in the next couple of months, to understand the needs of market participants and the barriers that still exist to competition and innovation.  This dialogue – along with detailed analysis of the potential benefits and impacts for monetary and financial stability - will feed into a consultation paper in 2020.  We look forward to learning from the industry and will welcome your engagement in this process.  RTGS Renewal  Crucially, to deliver these priorities, and to facilitate innovation, we need strong, resilient foundations.  That is why the Bank is undertaking an ambitious and exciting Programme to renew RTGS. For those not familiar with RTGS, it is a critical piece of national infrastructure and the backbone of UK payments.    Our vision is to develop an RTGS service which is fit for the future, increasing resilience and access, and offering wider interoperability, improved user functionality and strengthened end-to-end risk management of the UK’s High-Value Payment System. This is a challenging but necessary Programme which is a key priority not just for the Bank but for the UK payments industry as a whole.  The way payments are made has changed dramatically in recent years, reflecting changes in the demands of households and companies, changes in technology, and an evolving regulatory landscape.  We need to respond to this and, in collaboration with the industry, develop the next generation of RTGS that delivers a world-leading payments service.  Innovation can only thrive when firms and end users are confident they are operating in a safe and secure environment.  So at the heart of the Programme is the desire to make the new service materially stronger and more resilient to an increasingly complex and sophisticated environment.  Our current system has, and meets, targets of 99.95% availability.  This must continue regardless of the shocks, whether traditional BCP or cyber.  We are building a system that will be flexible to protect against the threats we understand today and the ones we will need to withstand in the future.   The renewed service will provide a platform for private sector innovation and one which can respond to and shape a fast changing environment.  We will harness leading edge technology to deliver this, coupled with changes to our policies to support growth and resilience.  Key features will include:    The renewed service will have a flexible and modular architecture, making it easier to change components of the service or add new components.  This will enable us to respond quickly to market changes and continued innovation in payment technologies both from new fintechs and established players.  Ultimately, we want to future-proof RTGS to interface with firms and technology that may not exist today.    The renewed service will not be built on a Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) but firms who use DLT will be able to connect to the service. We have completed a Proof of Concept to understand 
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches 5  5   whether our renewed service could be capable of supporting settlement in systems operating on innovative payment technologies. The punchline was that it could.  We continue to engage with fintech firms to maintain our understanding of technology developments.   While we currently plan to start operating the new service with the existing hours for CHAPS, the new service will have near 24x7 capability, and so when there is clear demand we expect, in consultation with industry, to extend operating hours.  This flexibility means we can respond quickly to changing demands and an increasingly globalised economy.   We will also provide Application Programming Interface (API) access to users to enable read and write of payments data.  The Bank has committed to providing an exposed API to allow external participants to develop sophisticated and automated real-time tools for accessing RTGS transactional and liquidity data.  We plan to announce in a few months our initial thoughts on the approach and implementation.     And with a visionary new system, we want more participants to be able to benefit from it.  In 2018 we expanded direct access to non-bank payment service providers, making it possible for a broader set of firms to compete with banks.    Five non-bank payment service providers currently hold accounts in RTGS and many more firms are exploring the possibility of joining.  In addition, the renewed RTGS service will further reduce barriers to entry for new players – for example on-boarding will be quicker and testing will be streamlined making joining speedy and efficient.  For CHAPS, we expect to be able to meet demand from dozens of new participants a year, rather than a handful as currently.   There are two clear benefits from expanding access.  First, increasing the number and diversity of firms that can directly access central bank money helps to reduce financial stability risk from events such as market wide shocks or a single firm failure.  Second, it promotes competition and innovation in payments. Firms that have direct access to payment systems can benefit from faster transaction times and reduced individual transaction costs.  By extending these benefits to a wider range of firms, the Bank hopes to encourage a greater diversity of players in the payments market, thereby encouraging innovation and competition through development of new business models, new products and services and ultimately cheaper and more efficient payments.    This is an ambitious Programme - and rightly so.  The Bank is on track against published milestones. Having defined the Programme scope, with input from the payments industry, we are now running a competitive procurement process under the Official Journal of the European Union to appoint a Technology Delivery Partner.  They will work with the Bank on the design and build of the core settlement engine.  We plan to enter the contract with the Technology Delivery Partner in May 2020.   
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches 6  6   We then move to delivery, with the first technology changes in the first half of 2022. In light of other international migration plans, the Bank is revisiting its approach to the introductory phase of ISO 20022 implementation in 2022 – in particular on how we can support early adopters of enhanced ISO 20022 data.  We are conducting industry engagement to inform our decision and would welcome input from interested parties. And the most significant moment is when we replace the core RTGS service, planned for 2023.  Additional functionality will be delivered in 2024, to further drive innovation and change.  For example we will introduce read/write APIs and are exploring the ability to synchronise the settlement of a payment in sterling central bank money to be coordinated with the transfer of one or more assets.  The Programme is expected to close in 2025.  It will be an exciting few years!  ISO 20022  One way in which RTGS Renewal can promote resilience and efficiency is through greater interoperability across payment systems.  Could, for example, CHAPS be used as a contingency mechanism in the event of a retail payment system outage?  Key to this is the introduction of a new payment messaging standard for UK payments, ISO 20022: the emerging global standard.    Following a consultation in 2018,8 the Bank and Pay.UK will introduce a Common Credit Message across CHAPS, Bacs and FPS which will bring greater message harmonisation for the UK’s main interbank payment systems. The Bank is also engaging with other High Value Payment System operators to ensure the standard is compatible with the emerging international consensus.  This is an exciting and important initiative which will bring significant and long term benefits for a wide range of firms.     A recent key milestones towards implementing ISO 20022 in the UK was the publication of the CHAPS ISO 20022 draft messages schemas and market guidance for making CHAPS payments.  Draft messages and market guidance have been provided for the expected implementation phase of the ISO 20022 migration and we are seeking comments, via the Bank’s website,9 until 3 October 2019.  And I would encourage all firms with an interest to review and comment to inform the final schema specification.    Final specifications for the  implementation phase of the ISO 20022 migration will be available by the end of 2019 – allowing firms to kick start their planning and preparations for ISO 20022 implementation in CHAPS.    RTGS Renewal – engagement with the payments industry  We have from the very start of the Programme – even before it could be described as a Programme - been working with industry to design and prepare for this change.  This input is vital so we can shape and deliver                                                       8 https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/payments/rtgs-renewal-programme/iso-20022/iso-20022-consultation-paper.pdf?la=en&hash=BC6A2A1018A7AC4AEF13FEB47F5D7C8C86571799 9 https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/payment-and-settlement/rtgs-renewal-programme/consultation-on-a-new-messaging-standard-for-uk-payments-iso20022

We have a number of strategic and working level channels that allow us to seek input and advice from across the payments industry.  These include the RTGS Renewal External Advisory Body, the Standards Advisory Panel and the CHAPS Strategic Advisory Forum.10  Membership spans current CHAPS direct and indirect participants (and not just the traditional large banks) and trade bodies, UK authorities, software vendors and corporate end users.    We also work closely with some of the organisations sharing the stage with me today, aiming to get the best result and to minimise the burden on industry.   We work extensively with Pay.UK who are working to deliver change across the retail payment schemes through their New Payments Architecture Programme.  Together, we are tackling issues such as whether we could build a shared Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for UK payments.  And of course payments globally continue to change apace, so we thrive on our engagement with other central banks on key topics such as standards harmonisation, where our close collaboration is a crucial part of how we can collectively transform the payments landscape.  Working together provides the opportunity to learn, share insights and collaborate on common challenges.    Conclusion   Just as payment systems are at the heart of the economy, industry engagement must remain at the heart of the Programme.  User input enables us to create the platform and capability that industry needs to innovate:  the building blocks to transform the payments landscape.  But as we mobilise delivery at the Bank, we need industry to mobilise too.  We are on track against our plan and we need firms to develop theirs – so the payments industry is ready to transition safely to the new service and maximise the opportunities for innovation and transformation promised.    We are developing a strategy to work closely with Direct Participants to provide information, monitor key milestone completion, undertake testing and seek assurance that they are each ready to implement changes.    Together, we can build and promote a resilient and thriving financial system, and so I look forward to continuing to engage with many of you here – be you users, end users, suppliers, innovators, peers - to help shape and deliver a resilient and innovative payment ecosystem.                                                             10 https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/payment-and-settlement 
John C Williams: LIBOR - the clock is tickingRemarks by Mr John C Williams, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Federal ReserveBank of New York, at the 2019 US Treasury Market Conference, Federal Reserve Bank of NewYork, New York City, 23 September 2019.*   *   *As prepared for deliveryGood morning everyone and welcome to the New York Fed. It’s a pleasure to be speaking at thefifth annual U.S. Treasury Market Conference.This conference is particularly valuable because it brings together market participants and fivepublic sector bodies—the New York Fed, the Board of Governors, the Treasury, the SEC, andthe CFTC—to discuss the U.S. Treasury market.The Treasury market is arguably the most important market in the world, and today is a uniqueopportunity to discuss some of the big topics in front of us.  Increasing transparency, preparingfor future risks, and taking advantage of innovation in this market are vital areas of discussion.This morning, I’ll begin with some observations on recent volatility in money markets and theFed’s approach to support stability in this critical part of the financial system as we carry out theFOMC’s monetary policy decisions.I’ll then pivot to a different but related topic: the transition away from LIBOR. I think I can get awaywith it because this conference’s five sponsoring agencies, which first came together followingthe “flash rally” in 2014, also all play a vital role in facilitating the industry’s move to more robustreference rates. Crucially, they are ex officio members of the Alternative Reference RatesCommittee (ARRC), the private sector group convened to guide the transition away from LIBOR.And of course the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), the ARRC’s selectedreplacement for U.S. dollar LIBOR, reflects transactions that finance U.S. Treasury securities.Before I go any further, I need to give the standard Fed disclaimer that the views I express todayare mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open Market Committee orothers in the Federal Reserve System.Market ConditionsI’ll start with recent developments in money markets. Conditions in funding markets becamehighly volatile early last week, with secured lending rates moving higher on Monday and risingsharply on Tuesday. We had expected a number of factors—including quarterly corporate taxpayments and the settlement of Treasury auctions—to put upward pressure on funding rates.However, the size of the reaction in repo rates, the spillover to unsecured markets such asfederal funds, and the emergence of strains in market functioning were outside of recentexperience. For example, in April and June of this year, sizable payment flows led to relativelymuted movements in secured lending rates and small movements in unsecured rates.As had been done ahead of prior dates with anticipated significant funding pressures, on Friday,September 13, the Markets team at the New York Fed, and others in the Federal ReserveSystem put in place a plan for increased monitoring of money markets. This included morefrequent reporting on transactions, data, and information from market participants on Monday.    Although conditions remained calm on that Friday, the simultaneous increase and wideningdispersion in repo rates and, importantly, federal funds rates on Monday indicated that marketswere not effectively distributing liquidity across the system.  The New York Fed’s Markets team 1 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
built a timeline and implementation plan in case the Open Market Desk at the New York Fed(Desk) would need to operate on Tuesday. Early Tuesday morning, it became clear that thissituation had persisted and had the potential to become more acute.In response to these developments, and in keeping with the FOMC’s standing directive to theDesk to conduct open market operations as necessary to keep the federal funds rate within thetarget range, on Tuesday morning the Desk announced and conducted a repo operation.Although such operations were common before the financial crisis, this was the first non-testrepo operation in many years. This was followed by repo operations each day since.These actions had the desired effect of reducing strains in markets, narrowing the dispersion ofrates, and lowering secured and unsecured rates to more normal levels relative to otherbenchmarks. The experience of the past week drew attention to the possibility of the development of strains infunding markets around the upcoming end of the quarter.  This past Friday we announced a planof continued daily overnight repo operations through October 10, accompanied by three two-week term repo operations that span the month end. The goal of these actions is the same asfor recent open market operations: foster conditions in money markets to keep the federal fundsrate within the target range.This episode reminds us all of the importance of having well- functioning markets and the vitalrole that the Federal Reserve plays in supplying liquidity to the system when markets are understress. We were prepared for such an event, acted quickly and appropriately, and our actionswere successful. Friday’s announcement on open market operations to address potentialquarter-end funding pressures on interest rates followed this same approach: quickly diagnosethe problem, develop the right action plan, and execute that plan.At the same time, it is equally important that we examine these recent market dynamics and theirimplications for the liquidity needs in relation to the overall amount of reserves held at the FederalReserve. We will continue to monitor and analyze developments closely. As Federal ReserveChair Powell stated in his most recent press conference, the FOMC will assess the implicationsfor the appropriate level of reserves and time to resume organic growth of the Federal Reserve’sbalance sheet consistent with the successful execution of the FOMC’s ample reservesframework.That’s enough on recent events for now. I’ll turn to another very important issue, reference ratereform.LIBOR Won’t Last ForeverSome say only two things in life are guaranteed: death and taxes. But I say there are actuallythree: death, taxes, and the end of LIBOR.Everyone in the financial services industry needs to be aware that the date when the existence ofLIBOR can no longer be guaranteed is fast approaching.I titled remarks I gave on this subject earlier in the year “901 Days” to remind everyone just howlittle time both the public sector and market participants have to prepare for a world withoutLIBOR.We are now 831 days away from that world, and while some institutions are making goodprogress, others are sticking their metaphorical heads in the sand, hoping the issue will go away.Even more concerning are those wearing rose-tinted glasses, getting nostalgic about LIBOR andhoping for an extension to the deadline or a reincarnation of the rate. I cannot emphasize enough123 2 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
that the clock is ticking and everyone needs to get their firms ready for January 1, 2022.A look at the numbers, and recent history, reveals the need for urgency. There are $200 trillion offinancial contracts referencing U.S. dollar LIBOR. But the volume of actual transactions thatterm LIBOR is based on is very small. When individual banks make LIBOR submissions they arelargely based on judgment, not real transactions. This makes the rate vulnerable to manipulation,and banks are increasingly reluctant to provide submissions, adding yet further risk around usingthe rate.The U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has reached an agreement with banks to keepsubmitting rates until the end of 2021, but beyond that date the existence of LIBOR is notguaranteed.  The FCA has made it clear that it expects at least some banks to leave the LIBORpanels soon after 2021, making LIBOR even less representative than it is now, and that it wouldneed to judge whether LIBOR was still representative at that stage.Headway Is Being MadeWhile the clock is inevitably ticking, progress is being made.  In 2017, the ARRC selected SOFR as its preferred alternative to U.S. dollar LIBOR.Since April 2018, the New York Fed has produced SOFR every business day. It’s based on animportant underlying market with much higher volumes than LIBOR, and is compliant with thePrinciples for Financial Benchmarks set forth by the International Organization of SecuritiesCommissions (IOSCO).The International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) has led really important work on thedevelopment of contingencies for some derivatives products for the scenario where LIBORceases to exist.A key question is what will happen if the FCA finds LIBOR to no longer be representative. Twolarge central counterparties have already indicated that they would expect to move the LIBORtrades they clear to SOFR if this occurred. The Financial Stability Board’s Official SectorSteering Group (OSSG) has indicated its support for ISDA to include such a trigger to avoidfragmentation between cleared and uncleared derivatives.Derivatives contracts account for 95 percent of the exposure to U.S. dollar LIBOR, so universalchanges to these contracts would be a significant leap forward. If the market signs up to theISDA protocol when it’s published, it will be a considerable milestone and will go a long waytoward reducing risks to firms, markets, and the financial system.   In addition, the ARRC has released four sets of recommended fallback language for differenttypes of cash products and has published potential paths forward for adjustable-rate mortgages(ARMs). While mortgages are a small part of the overall exposure, it’s vitally important thatconsumers understand what the changes being made mean in real terms.Last week, the Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC, the OCC, and other agencies released aproposal on adjusting margin requirements for covered swap entities that, among other things,are meant to remove unintended hurdles to signing the ISDA protocol and moving away fromLIBOR.  The Financial Accounting Standards Board has similarly released an exposure draftwith proposals to smooth the transition from an accounting perspective.  Finally, earlier thisyear, the SEC staff issued a statement highlighting risks and disclosures for market participantsto evaluate proactively as they transition away from LIBOR.The Challenges Ahead4567891011121314 3 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
Progress has been made, but there’s still much to do.SOFR is sometimes criticized for the lack of a term rate, but my message is don’t wait for a termrate to get your house in order. Don’t use that as an excuse to halt the vital work of understandingwhere your exposure to LIBOR lies and how to prepare your business. The OSSG has produceda document explaining how market participants can use overnight risk-free rates, as opposed towaiting for term rates. In addition, the New York Fed is preparing average SOFR rates and aSOFR index, with the goal of publishing them daily by the middle of next year.    Contracts that reference U.S. dollar LIBOR continue to be written, which only serves to increasethe level of systemic risk. In rare cases where for some reason LIBOR must be referenced,robust fallback language that accounts for a future without LIBOR needs to be included. I alsostrongly encourage market participants to address legacy LIBOR-linked contracts. There’s noone-size-fits-all approach for closing out or converting existing LIBOR positions so marketparticipants need to get ahead of this issue.We know this is difficult and complex work. At the New York Fed, we’re working to identify wherewe have potential exposure to LIBOR and other non-IOSCO-compliant reference rates. We haveteams examining monetary policy operations, foreign reserve management activities, and tradingagreements with counterparties.We want to hear your voice so we can incorporate your feedback and facilitate the developmentof the tools you need to ensure an orderly transition.  Engage with the official sector about howLIBOR affects your firm and your challenges in this transition. And note that just last week, theARRC published a checklist designed to support market participants with the adoption ofSOFR.Implementation will be complex: financial contracts need to be scrutinized, operations need to beevaluated, and technology needs to be updated. The work involves numerous jurisdictions andmultiple asset classes, and will require changes from how business is conducted to howsystems are built. These things take time, and time is running out.ConclusionThe LIBOR transition is a serious issue the industry needs to address.

  Central Bank of Kuwait - Public     يزكرملا تيوكلا كنب- ماع THE BATTLE FOR RELEVANCE*    Assalam-o-Alaikum and a very good morning to you all.  It gives me great pleasure to welcome you today to this international banking conference. I would like to start by expressing my deepest gratitude to His Highness the Amir Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah for his patronage of this conference. It is the guidance and wise leadership of His Highness that has enabled us to build one of the region’s safest and most robust financial systems, which has played a vital role in the development of our economy.  I would like to thank all the honorable governors of central banks, heads of regulatory authorities, heads of financial institutions and other distinguished guests for joining us today. And I am grateful to all the distinguished speakers who are participating in this event, our local banks who have partnered with us to support this conference and my dedicated colleagues at the Central Bank of Kuwait (CBK) for their efforts in organizing this conference.  The banking industry has enjoyed exceptional growth over the past half century, and despite some shortcomings, it has played a critical role in supporting economic growth around the world. During normal times, one would expect banks to continue operating as they have in the past, with perhaps a greater focus on product innovation or operational efficiency.  But we are not living in normal times. Today, the global banking industry is at a major inflection point, facing several internal and external challenges that are coming                                                            * Keynote speech delivered by H.E. Dr. Mohammad Y. Al-Hashel, Governor, Central Bank of Kuwait at CBK International Banking Conference: Shaping the Future, September 23rd 2019, Four Seasons Hotel, Kuwait City – Kuwait. 
- 2 -   Central Bank of Kuwait - Public     يزكرملا تيوكلا كنب- ماع together to create a perfect storm. Certainly, the industry will not be able to weather this storm by holding on to the same course it has pursued for decades.   Rather it must reinvent itself for the future. That is why CBK is organizing this event under the theme of ‘Shaping the Future’. We believe that all stakeholders in the banking industry need to take a proactive role in shaping the way banks operate in the future, rather than continuing along the well-trodden path, no matter how well that path had previously served them.  Taking this opportunity, I would like to share a few thoughts on our vision for the evolution of the banking industry. I will begin with a brief overview of the major challenges that the industry faces today. Second, I will reflect on the key areas that banks will need to focus on in order to stay relevant. Finally, I will touch upon the role that enabling stakeholders need to play to support the banking industry through its transformative journey.   1-Challenging Operating Environment  So, let me start with a brief discussion on the key challenges that the banking industry faces today.  Three challenges are particularly worth highlighting: the state of the global economy; the revolution in financial technology; and the rapidly evolving needs and expectations of customers.  i. Global Economy  First, let us look at the global economy where headwinds are intensifying. The IMF has twice lowered its global growth projections for 2019 to 3.2%, with developed economies expected to grow at a much slower rate of 1.9%1.  A key driver of this slowdown is the economic uncertainty brought about by rising trade tensions and protectionist policies. If trade tensions continue, the IMF may 
- 3 -   Central Bank of Kuwait - Public     يزكرملا تيوكلا كنب- ماع further revise down its economic growth projections. The Bank of England estimates that a 10% increase in tariffs between the US and its trading partners could lead to a reduction of 2.5% in US GDP, and 1% in global GDP excluding the US.2  In its recent publication, the Institute of International Finance (IIF) also highlighted economic policy uncertainty as a key risk to business sentiment. The IIF estimates that economic policy uncertainty in both the US and China is at a record high, and its impact is being felt in terms of reduced investments and lower consumption.3  We have already seen the impact of trade disputes and attendant economic uncertainty on markets across the globe. Prominent indices such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite, FTSE 100 and the Nikkei 225 have declined by an average of around 7% in mid-August, from highs in July.  Another factor linked to the economic outlook is the role of monetary policy. Economic growth in the last decade has mainly been driven by the use of unconventional monetary policies. While these policies have supported economic recovery following the global financial crisis, by ensuring a low interest rate environment, they have led to other unintended consequences like fueling debt levels across the globe. Thanks to low interest rates, global debt has ballooned to over $246 trillion, nearly 320% of global GDP.4  While household debt has seen a gradual increase (3% growth per annum), the real growth in debt lies with governments, financial institutions and corporates. In particular, government debt has doubled since 2008, from $32 trillion to $67 trillion, especially with governments in developed economies having borrowed heavily over the past few years. Among OECD countries, Japan, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Belgium, France, Spain and the UK now all have government debt that exceeds their GDPs.5  This extended period of historically low interest rates has also enabled corporates from around the world to take advantage of cheap debt. Global corporate debt has also nearly doubled over the past decade, from $37 trillion to $73 trillion, even 
- 4 -   Central Bank of Kuwait - Public     يزكرملا تيوكلا كنب- ماع surpassing the increase in government debt. But contrary to government debt, two-thirds of the growth in corporate debt has come from developing countries. This poses a serious risk to these economies, especially where the debt is in foreign currencies.  We have also seen the quality of borrowers deteriorate. Bonds rated BBB- and below now account for half of global corporate bonds, compared to just a quarter in 2007, before the financial crisis.  Global debt over the past 20 years has grown on average by 6% annually. If these rates continue, and global GDP grows by 3.5% per annum as projected, we could see global debt over the next 20 years reaching $780 trillion, or 500% of GDP. This is clearly unsustainable, and requires urgent action by both governments and financial institutions.  More critically, the low interest rate environment has curtailed banks’ profits in some of the advanced markets, jeopardizing their longer-term viability.  And record high debt levels are likely to pose increasing risk of defaults once monetary policy tightening takes course, potentially hurting the quality of banking assets. Collectively, these trends have serious implications for financial stability in general.  Beyond banking, there is increasing risk of policy inaction amid weakening global governance, as evident from trade disputes. During the global financial crisis of 2008, advanced countries joined hands to fend off depression through a well-coordinated and robust policy response. In the face of a similar threat to global economy today, as highlighted by the increasing risk of a looming US recession in the next 12 months, expectations of a unified and powerful international policy response remain low, amid all the bickering over trade issues and growing nationalism. Such developments have further elevated the risks to global economy, particularly in the backdrop of rising geo-political tensions.   
- 5 -   Central Bank of Kuwait - Public     يزكرملا تيوكلا كنب- ماع ii. Technology  The second challenge we need to consider is the impact of technology on the banking industry. The latest digital technologies are transforming the economic landscape and are disrupting many traditional industries along the way. Banking is no exception, where financial technology is fast-evolving and being adopted at a breathtaking pace.  Cutting edge technologies such as digital payments, mobile banking, data analytics, artificial intelligence, and blockchain are changing the way banks operate and interact with customers.  FinTech firms are beginning to eliminate the role of many traditional intermediaries in the financial services industry. According to McKinsey, five major banking business segments are particularly at risk: consumer finance; mortgages; SMEs; payments; and wealth management. McKinsey estimates that this could put up to 40% of bank revenues at risk by 2025.6  Part of the reason is that FinTech firms can provide access to financial services in a more efficient and cost-effective manner. For example, some FinTech lenders have up to a 400-basis-point cost advantage over banks because they have no physical distribution costs. Another example is the execution of payments; transactions that used to take 3 to 5 days to process can now be completed in 3 to 5 seconds, and for less than one-tenth of the original cost.  Although banks have generally been slow to innovate, they have sought to stay ahead of the game by partnering with or acquiring FinTech firms. According to a recent PwC report, over 54% of banks surveyed have already established partnerships with FinTech firms, and 82% expect to increase such partnerships in the next 3 to 5 years.7  
- 6 -   Central Bank of Kuwait - Public     يزكرملا تيوكلا كنب- ماع While banks can potentially manage the onslaught by the FinTech firms, the real challenge will be posed by the Big Techs. What would happen when the likes of Facebook, Amazon, Whatsapp, and Alibaba start competing with banks to provide financial services? These technology giants come with large and captive user bases, low online acquisition costs, and a better understanding of their customers through their utilization of big data. Moreover, they don’t face the same regulations and associated costs that banks do.  Tech firms have had their eyes on the banking industry for quite some time. Over 20 years ago, Bill Gates compared banks to dinosaurs that could be bypassed and argued that “we need banking, but we don't need banks anymore.” That was an early warning for the industry. Today, we see technology firms actively entering the banking space, most recently with the introduction of the Apple Card from Apple or the planned launch of Libra, a crypto-currency from Facebook.  Banks could find themselves sidelined by the Big Techs if they fail to actively adopt and fully utilize the available technologies. To prevent this from happening, banks will need to go back to basics and revisit the core utility of their institutions rather than becoming constrained by existing processes and legacy systems.  iii. Consumer Expectations  Thirdly, the industry needs to meet the challenge of rapidly shifting customer needs and expectations. Today, we live in a world where digitally empowered consumers expect ‘on-demand services’ that allow them to access products and services wherever and whenever they desire.  This is particularly true of the growing number of millennials who will soon become the largest customer segment for the banking industry. Even in Kuwait, approximately 58% of the population consists of millennials and younger. Their behavior and characteristics can be very different to those of previous generations.8 
- 7 -   Central Bank of Kuwait - Public     يزكرملا تيوكلا كنب- ماع 9 10 11.  Around 57% of millennials say they would change their banks for a better digital platform.  But it is not just millennials who are using digital platforms to access banking services. In 2018, 72% of all bank contacts from customers were digital, and 82% of consumers first go online if they are looking to buy a new product or service. In short, banks will need to either go digital or risk being sidelined.  Failure to meet changing consumer expectations can have serious implications for banks. The recent history of the mobile phone industry is a case in point.  In 1997, 60% of the mobile phone market belonged to the specialist mobile phone producers like Nokia, Motorola and Sony Ericsson. Today, that same market share has been captured by Samsung, Apple and Huawei. Not only are the current market leaders three entirely different firms but they are essentially electronics and computer companies, unlike the past firms that specialized in manufacturing mobile phones.12  The incumbent mobile phone companies of the 90s failed to recognize the evolving needs of their customers. Ultimately, their complacency saw them being pushed to the fringes of a market they once dominated.  Something similar could happen to the banking industry. Unless it pays attention to and serves the changing needs of its customers, it might be sidelined by telecom companies or technology firms as primary providers of financial services.  Take the example of Ant Financial, WeChat Pay and M-pesa, which are firms that were launched by technology and telecom companies. All three have enjoyed tremendous growth to become the largest providers of financial services in their respective markets. By leveraging technology and adopting a customer-centric approach, they have surpassed the largest banks in their markets.  
- 8 -   Central Bank of Kuwait - Public     يزكرملا تيوكلا كنب- ماع In the process, they have not only attracted existing customers but also promoted financial inclusion by serving millions of otherwise unbanked customers. In the last seven years, financial inclusion in China has increased from 64% to 80%, and from 42% to 82% in Kenya, in large part due to the emergence of these now FinTech providers.13  Any of the three major challenges described – the difficult economic environment, growing role of technology or the changing customer expectations – would by itself have been a lot for the industry to address. But taken together they are leading to a perfect storm that the industry can no longer afford to ignore.   2- Shaping the Future  For the banking industry to continue growing and serving its core utility, it must transform itself. But for a well-established industry that has served us for centuries, where should this journey of transformation begin?  To me, it seems that banks must conquer a number of battles if they are to survive. The most crucial of these battles are:  i. the battle for customer loyalty,  ii. the battle for value,  iii. the battle for efficiency,  iv. the battle for resilience, and  v. the battle for talent.  Let me discuss each of these in turn.      
- 9 -   Central Bank of Kuwait - Public     يزكرملا تيوكلا كنب- ماع i. Battle for Customer Loyalty  The first of these battles is for customer loyalty. Banks must decide whether they aim to be central to their customers’ needs or they are content to be merely balance sheet providers, where someone else owns the relationship with the customer. In the second scenario, banks would have no brand affinity or loyalty from their customers and would be easily replaceable.  As things stand, the banking industry is surely struggling on this front. Today, no bank is placed among the top twenty global brands in terms of value. Even banks which were there a decade ago have since slipped off the list.  Banks must work hard to ensure that they remain the first choice for their customers, and that means taking a much broader view of their relationship with customers. Banks need to consider how they can help solve their customers’ problems and improve their lives, while being cognizant of their broader social purpose to promote inclusive, sustainable prosperity.  After all, banks can no longer take customer loyalty as a given. A recent banking consumer study conducted by Accenture found that 40% of customers expressed decreased dependence on their bank as their primary financial services provider and 42% said they had used non-bank providers for financial services in the past year.  A good example of non-banking providers displacing traditional banks is Kakao Bank in South Korea. Kakao Bank was launched in 2017 as a digital bank by Korean Internet company Kakao, which also owns the popular free mobile messaging service KakaoTalk. The bank proved incredibly successful, leveraging its brand affinity and customer loyalty to acquire over 300,000 customers within their first 24 hours, one million within five days, and reaching six million customers within a year. 14  Thus, within a year of opening, Kakao Bank had a third of the number of customers of Shinhan Bank, the largest bank in South Korea. This was despite the fact that 
- 10 -   Central Bank of Kuwait - Public     يزكرملا تيوكلا كنب- ماع financial inclusion in South Korea was already at 95% at the time. You can imagine how long will it take for Kakao Bank to become the largest bank in the country.  This example demonstrates that banks cannot take customer loyalty for granted. They need to ensure that customers engage with them not because they have to, but because they want to. And the only way to ensure that is by not only understanding customers, but also becoming central to their evolving needs.  ii. Battle for Value  To win the battle for customer loyalty, banks must provide value, which is the second battle. Winning this battle requires banks to adopt a more proactive approach when positioning themselves with respects to their customers. It is not enough to be on the sidelines as, say, a purely auto financing or mortgage provider. Banks need to position themselves at the center of the ecosystem, providing their customers with the best products, services and advice as and when customers require.  According to the Accenture study, 48% of customers said they wanted relevant advice and product information from their banks as they go about their daily lives. They also want banks to play a supporting role in the purchasing process for products such as a house or new car, and even related services such as insurance.  Banks need to focus on providing long-term value for customers, rather than viewing them as a short-term opportunity for sales. We have already seen the harmful impact of this ‘short-term’ outlook that led to the subprime-mortgage crisis, as banks sold mortgages to customers who couldn’t afford them. Banks’ profits surged in the short term, but everyone suffered in the end; not only customers and the broader economy but also the banks.  Banks therefore need to revisit their value propositions towards their customers in order to ensure that they are truly providing the products and services their customers need while keeping the interest of their customers and the society in 
- 11 -   Central Bank of Kuwait - Public     يزكرملا تيوكلا كنب- ماع mind. It will be helpful for the industry to reflect upon its ultimate objectives – to ensure inclusive prosperity and put the welfare of society on a sustainable footing.  iii. Battle for Efficiency   To win over customers and provide value, banks must operate in an efficient and intelligent manner, with their limited resources optimally deployed.  The battle for efficiency is the third of the battles that banks need to win. A critical front in this battle is the leveraging of technology and data. Banks need to use available data to improve their predictive analysis, not just for operational efficiency and planning, but also for insights into customer behavior and preferences.  What is particularly surprising to me is that banks, though custodians of vast quantities of customer and transactions data, are not utilizing it effectively. Banks will need to change the way they segment customers, not by their income levels or types of accounts, but potentially by their life cycle, growth potential, and behavior patterns.  Data analysis can provide a bank with actionable insights into multiple factors that impact its business, allowing it to improve its strategic and operational decision-making.  Moreover, banks will need to overhaul their operations, accelerate end-to-end digitization, modernize their technology infrastructure, and transition towards digital channels. McKinsey estimates that banks worldwide could save more than $400 billion a year in direct costs by shifting traditional customers to digital platforms, reducing the service cost by 80 to 90%.  By winning the battle for efficiency, banks will not only be able to better engage with customers and achieve higher satisfaction rates, but also curtail operational cost.    
- 12 -   Central Bank of Kuwait - Public     يزكرملا تيوكلا كنب- ماع iv. Battle for Resilience  Winning the battles for customer loyalty, value and efficiency will help banks to grow and remain relevant. But that growth should not compromise banks’ soundness or sustainability.  This bring us to the fourth battle: the battle for resilience. Once again, this is an area where technology, data management and analytics can help banks enhance their risk management functions and strengthen their resilience.  Banks need to ensure that they have robust capital and liquidity levels, as reflected in a traditional stability matrix, to absorb shocks and effectively manage their risks. But they can further enhance their risk identification and management by analyzing economic, market and customer data in real time. Institutions will no longer have to wait for analysts to review the market at monthly or quarterly intervals and then map this back to the customers, assets or the bank’s off-balance sheet exposure.  Through artificial intelligence, machine learning and predictive analysis, banks can remain up-to-date on risks and exposures in real time, from detecting individual cases of fraud to overall balance sheet exposure across products and business functions. As the market moves and news breaks, tools based on data analytics can immediately update executives on the potential impact of these events on their business.  v. Battle for Talent  None of the battles can be won without the right people. People are at the core of everything we do, and they are the ones who will bring everything together.  This brings us to the fifth battle: the battle for talent. As the banking industry goes through a radical transition, banks will need to widen their talent pools and attract 
- 13 -   Central Bank of Kuwait - Public     يزكرملا تيوكلا كنب- ماع a broader range of skills, in line with their shifting business models and changing customers’ preferences.  Staff at banks of the future will no longer be limited to mostly finance professionals. Instead, the role of data scientists, visual designers, digital marketing and media experts, software developers and customer experience professionals will become more significant. Banks might even need to recruit psychologists, philosophy majors and other professionals with diversified skills that can bring in new perspectives.  These people will be very different from traditional bank recruits, with different expectations for their roles, work environments and contributions. And banks will be in direct competition with technology firms, leading corporates and start-ups to hire them.  Banks will need to overhaul their entire process around acquiring, managing, deploying and retaining talent. Like technology companies, they will need to invest in their talent pools to leverage their expertise and creativity. They will also need to transform their corporate culture into one which promotes agility, collaboration and responsible risk-taking when it comes to delivery of solutions.  The banking industry needs to succeed on all of these battle fronts: customer loyalty, value, efficiency, resilience and talent. Failure to win on any front could have dire consequences, regardless of a bank’s size or market share.  We can take lessons from companies in other industries that have ignored these lessons and suffered as a result. A prime example is Kodak, which was the dominant name in the photography market for over a century. At its peak, Kodak’s share of the photographic film market was over 80% in the U.S. and around 50% globally.  Kodak was making significant profits from the sale and development of camera films and expected this trend to continue. While the arrival of digital cameras was changing industry dynamics, Kodak didn’t want to risk cannibalizing their own 
- 14 -   Central Bank of Kuwait - Public     يزكرملا تيوكلا كنب- ماع camera film business and failed to see the potential of new technology and the risk from new competitors. Instead, it chose to stay in its comfort zone, conducting business as usual, failing to understand the evolving needs of their customers. That led to its ultimate demise, as Kodak filed for bankruptcy protection in 2012.  Contrast this with Apple’s launch of the iPad. Despite the iPad’s potential to cannibalize its own computer business, Apple went ahead in order to serve the needs of its customers.  It was not afraid to embrace change, even at the cost of its traditional business and products, and the iPad proved to be one of Apple’s most successful products.  Equally critical is to timely identify and act upon valuable opportunities amid shifting market preferences. Microsoft missed such an opportunity to dominate the mobile operating system. The void that Microsoft could have filled was soon captured by the Android operating system.  Bill Gates termed it as his “greatest mistake ever” which cost Microsoft $400 billion.  So, by focusing on the five key battles – customer loyalty, value, efficiency, resilience and talent – the banking industry can transform itself for the future and avoid the fate of Kodak.  3-The Role of Enabling Stakeholders  We have seen the importance of customers, technology and data for the future of banking. But it is important to recognize that this is not a journey that banks can take alone. Rather, they need the support of key stakeholders; otherwise they will only succeed in making minor, superficial changes rather than achieving a genuine transformation. The role of two key stakeholders is worth highlighting; educational institutions and regulators.  i. Educational Institutions  
- 15 -   Central Bank of Kuwait - Public     يزكرملا تيوكلا كنب- ماع Let us consider first the critical role of educational institutions. They need to ensure that they are preparing graduates for future jobs in the banking industry, jobs that not only require traditional studies of finance, economics and business, but also encompass new skills around financial and technological innovation.  It is increasingly evident that jobs in the future will be fundamentally different from jobs today. According to a recent report by the World Economic Forum (WEF) on the future of jobs, 75 million jobs may be displaced by 2022, while 133 million new roles may emerge.15  Are we preparing our graduates for such a shift in the labor market? This is an equally pertinent question for the banking industry. According to the WEF study, 56% of bank employees will need to be re-skilled. Talent and resources in a number of functions will need to shift towards analytics, with fewer resources likely to be involved in manual work. New staff will need to be data scientists with expertise in AI, machine learning, etc. And business staff will be required to have the ability to translate such data insights into business actions.  The WEF has reported that the largest barrier to embracing technology in banks, identified by 74% of financial institutions surveyed, was a lack of skill sets in the local labor market. If this is the case today, what will happen in the future? This is why the banking industry needs to build strong partnerships with educational institutions, to ensure that they are preparing the graduates the industry will require for its transformation.  ii. Regulators  The other key stakeholder in the banking industry’s transformative journey is the regulator. Regulatory authorities need to strike a balance between protecting consumers, establishing standards for sound regulatory and supervisory practices, safeguarding financial and monetary stability, and at the same time facilitating growth and innovation in the industry. 
- 16 -   Central Bank of Kuwait - Public     يزكرملا تيوكلا كنب- ماع  But as the industry goes through its transformation, we the regulators must also consider how we should operate in the future. We need to take a proactive and dynamic approach to promote innovation, and act as a catalyst for the industry. We need to promote collaboration and share our experiences with each other to develop frameworks that will fit the needs of our societies. And we need to focus on capacity building to ensure that our staff can meet the future challenges of the industry.  We at the CBK firmly believe in innovation, collaboration and capacity building; principles that are the driving force behind many of our recent initiatives to fulfil our role as an enabler and catalyst for the industry.  In terms of innovation, the CBK is playing its part to support the banking industry. Last year, we launched our FinTech Regulatory Sandbox. Globally, 36 innovation labs and 48 regulatory sandboxes have already been introduced by different regulators. Regulators are using these tools to create a safe space for experimentation in innovative products and services, thus ensuring the safety and soundness of the financial system but without stifling innovation.16  We at the CBK are also preparing the infrastructure for future aspirations that would enable a truly digital economy. We are developing a state-of-the-art infrastructure project, the Kuwait National Payment System. This will be made up of eight systems that enable real time payments in a safe, secure, reliable and efficient manner and are ready for FinTech deployment.  Internally, we are re-engineering all processes in regulations to enhance data gathering and analysis, and fully digitizing processes in all supervisory functions. This will be a pre-requisite for our future implementation of artificial intelligence and SupTech.  
- 17 -   Central Bank of Kuwait - Public     يزكرملا تيوكلا كنب- ماع In addition, we are working on other initiatives such as the Open Banking Framework, which will provide clients with comprehensive information on their financial standing across multiple banks. We are also in the process of rolling out our E-KYC framework, which will allow anyone to open an account electronically, easily and efficiently. In 2014, Kuwait issued the Electronic Transaction Law, which provides the legal foundation for electronic payments and made digital signatures legally binding.  In terms of collaboration, the CBK has undertaken a number of initiatives to increase cross-border cooperation with other regulators in the region. For example, we are working with more than 20 countries on developing the Arab Payment System, in addition to the GCC Real Time Gross Settlement System.  In addition, the CBK is spearheading a GCC-wide cybersecurity framework to allow for seamless security information-sharing across the region, in order to safeguard GCC banking institutions and mitigate cyber threats.  Within Kuwait, we also engage closely with different government institutions such as the Capital Markets Authority, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry and the Communication and Information Technology Regulatory Authority.  And finally, the CBK is focused on continuous capacity building to ensure the development and sustainability of our team and to provide technical support to the industry. Through the Kuwait Institute of Banking Studies (KIBS), we are supporting sophisticated programs tailored for specific areas of focus to equip our teams as well as the banking industry with the latest tools and know-how. KIBS is playing a critical role in promoting capacity building in Kuwait, having provided training to over 4,700 banking staff in the last year alone.  I am delighted to announce the launch of the “Kafaa” initiative, in collaboration with the Kuwait Institute of Banking Studies and Kuwaiti banks. Kafaa provides advanced 
- 18 -   Central Bank of Kuwait - Public     يزكرملا تيوكلا كنب- ماع programs to financial sector employees including post graduate studies, cyber-security, risk management, Shariah audit, etc.  In addition, we are proud that Kuwait hosts and sponsors the IMF’s Middle East Centre for Economic and Finance (CEF), that provides training for candidates from across the Arab world. Last year, 1,477 candidates benefited from programs run by the Centre, at a total cost of $9.1 million.  With the support of enabling institutions such as educators and regulators, the banking industry can transform itself for the future and play its rightful role in supporting inclusive, sustainable prosperity.    Conclusion  I think it is quite clear that the banking industry can no longer afford to continue conducting business as usual and ignore the issues that I have highlighted.  The banking industry must take stock of the external challenges it faces today, including a very difficult economic environment, the impact of evolving technologies and the shift in customer expectations. It must focus on winning customer loyalty, providing value, operating efficiently and resiliently, and attracting the right talent. In addition, the enabling institutions such as educators and regulators need to provide the necessary support if the industry is to succeed in this transformative journey.  The industry is clearly at a crossroads and needs to make proactive decisions now to remain relevant in the future. There are two paths that the industry can take.  If the banking industry continues to operate the way it has in the past, ignoring the many challenges that it faces today, it would lose its dominant position. Competition 
- 19 -   Central Bank of Kuwait - Public     يزكرملا تيوكلا كنب- ماع will increase from different institutions such as telecom operators, technology companies and FinTech firms, and customers will flock to these solutions, as we have already seen in some markets. Banks, as a result, will be pushed to the fringes of the industry, if not removed altogether.  But if the industry manages to evolve, then the picture could be different. By winning the battles for customer loyalty, value, efficiency, resilience and talent, banks can remain the dominant players in this space. The bank of the future will be completely unrecognizable from that of today. It will be closer to its customers, digitally enabled, and ahead of the curve when it comes to anticipating customer needs. It will be more efficient, more resilient and better able to address the economic and social challenges of the future.   In the end, only collectively, we as the key stakeholders in this industry can take the difficult yet necessary steps required to shape the future of the banking industry.

     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches 2  2   UN Climate Summit, General Assembly, Monday 23 September Secretary General, your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentleman. A new, sustainable financial system is being built. It is funding the initiatives and innovations of the private sector, it has the potential to amplify the effectiveness of the climate policies of your governments and it could accelerate the transition to a low carbon economy. But the task is large, the window of opportunity is short, and the risks are existential. And like virtually everything else in the response to climate change, the development of this new sustainable finance is not moving fast enough for the world to reach net zero. To bring climate risks and resilience into the heart of financial decision making, climate disclosure must become comprehensive; climate risk management must be transformed, and sustainable investing must go mainstream.   Here’s how. First, on disclosure.  Catalysed by the G20 and created by the private sector, the Task Force on  Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) is a comprehensive, practical and flexible framework for corporate disclosure of climate-related risks and opportunities.1   The demand for TCFD disclosure is now enormous.  Current supporters control balance sheets totalling $120 trillion and include the world’s top banks, asset managers, pension funds, insurers, credit rating agencies, accounting firms and shareholder advisory services.2 The supply of disclosure is responding, with four fifths of over 1100 top G20 companies now disclosing climate-related financial risks in line with some of the TCFD recommendations, and three quarters of users of the information seeing a marked improvement in the quality of climate disclosures.3 The next step is to make these disclosures mandatory.  The UK and EU have already signalled their intents.4   It’s time for every country to get involved because the world won’t get to net zero if the financial sector doesn’t know how our companies are responding.  In order to watch we must be able to see.                                                        1  Recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (June 2017) available at: https://www.fsb-tcfd.org/wpcontent/uploads/2017/06/FINAL-2017-TCFD-Report-11052018.pdf.  2  Full list of current TCFD supporters available at: https://www.fsb-tcfd.org/tcfdsupporters/.  3  Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures: Status Report (June 2019) available at: https://www.fsb-tcfd.org/wpcontent/uploads/2019/06/2019-TCFD-Status-Report-FINAL-053119.pdf.  4  The UK has already announced in its Green Finance Strategy published in July 2019 that it expects all listed companies and large asset owners to report climate risks by 2022. A joint taskforce with UK regulators is considering the most appropriate path to mandatory disclosure. Details available at:  https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/green-finance-strategy. 
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches 3  3   Over the next two years, the current process of disclosure by the users of capital, reaction by the suppliers of capital, and adjustment of these standards will be critical to ensure that the TCFD standards are as comparable, efficient and as decision-useful as possible.   Second, risk management.  The providers of capital – banks, insurers, asset managers and those who supervise them – all need to improve their understanding and management of climate-related financial risks. Changes in climate policies, new technologies and growing physical risks will prompt reassessments of the values of virtually every financial asset.  Firms that align their business models to the transition to a net zero world will be rewarded handsomely. Those that fail to adapt will cease to exist.  The longer meaningful adjustment is delayed, the greater the disruption will be. To develop the essential climate risk management skills and techniques, the Bank of England has just set out its supervisory expectations for the governance, management and disclosure of these risks by the banks and insurers in the world’s leading international financial centre.5 And the Bank will be the first regulator to stress test its financial system against different climate pathways, including the catastrophic business as usual scenario and the ideal—but still challenging—transition to net zero by 2050 consistent with the UK’s legislated objective.6 This test will mainstream cutting-edge risk management techniques, and it will make the heart of the global financial system more responsive to changes to both the climate and to government climate policies. As with climate disclosure, this new risk management needs to go global. That is one reason why the Bank is developing its stress testing approach in consultation with industry, the credit rating agencies and the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) – a group of 29 central banks and supervisors representing half of global emissions.   Finally, returns.  Financial markets increasingly recognise that sustainable investment is the new horizon that can bring enormous opportunities ranging from transforming energy to reinventing protein. For sustainable investment to go truly mainstream, it needs to do more than exclude incorrigibly brown industries and finance new, deep green technologies.  Sustainable investing must catalyse and support all companies that are working to transition from brown to green.                                                       5 Available at: https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/prudential-regulation/supervisorystatement/2019/ss319.pdf?la=en&hash=7BA9824BAC5FB313F42C00889D4E3A6104881C44. 6 The Bank of England set out in its July 2019 FSR its intention to test the UK financial system’s resilience to the physical and transition risks of climate change.  It will gather views on the design of the exercise and, as a first step, will publish a discussion paper in autumn 2019.

At present, one of the biggest hurdles to doing so is the inconsistent measurement of ESG.  We need a common taxonomy to help financial markets rigorously identify environmental outperformance and to direct investment accordingly.  The EU’s Green Taxonomy and the Green Bond Standard are good starts, but they are binary (dark green or brown).  Mainstreaming sustainable investing will require a richer taxonomy – 50 shades of green. One promising option, highlighted in this week’s initiative of UN’s Climate Financial Leaders, is the development of transition indices composed of corporations in high-carbon sectors that have adopted low-carbon strategies.8   Such approaches are essential for our citizens to make sure their money is invested in line with their values.  To conclude, a financial market in the transition to a 1.5 degree world is being built, but we need to move much faster.  Now it’s time for a step change to bring the reporting, risk management and return optimisation of sustainable finance into everyday mainstream, financial decision making. Ultimately, the speed with which the new sustainable financial system develops will be decided by the ambitions of your climate policies.  If more countries, like the UK, turn their Paris commitments into legislated objectives and concrete actions, the financial system will amplify the impact of their efforts by pulling forward sustainable investments and shutting down unsustainable activities.9 It is within our grasp to create a virtuous cycle of innovation and investment for the net zero world that our citizens are demanding and that future generations deserve. Let’s seize it                                                        7  Nagy, Z, Kassam, A, and Lee, L-E,. (June 2015). Can ESG add alpha?

The COP 21 Agreement is catalysing national policies to limit the global rise in temperatures to two degrees. 20 countries, which account for 17% of global GDP, have already committed to or legislated for a net-zero emissions goal, with the UK becoming the first in the G7 to do so.  
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches 5  5   Insurance, Risk Financing and Development event, 22 September 2019 I would like to speak briefly about the role of insurance in smoothing the transition to a 1.5 degree world. This sector brings three things: expertise, money and perspective and those are all crucial in helping society adjust to the reality of that transition. My message is, whether it’s reducing the protection gap, financing resilient infrastructure or improving reporting, risk management and return optimisation across the financial sector, your contributions could be decisive.  The insurance industry has a unique contribution of large capital (over $30 trillion), deep risk management expertise and long-term perspective.  Insurers are well aware that the physical risks of climate change are being felt across the globe with a plague of extreme weather events.  The human costs are immeasurable. The financial losses however can be measured and they are significant. Insured losses in 2018 were $80 billion, double the inflation-adjusted average for the past 30 years.10  But protection gaps in low and middle income countries mean that even greater costs are being borne by the uninsured.  In 2017, the record $140 billion of insured losses were eclipsed by an additional $200 billion of uninsured ones.11  In some of the countries most exposed to climate change - Bangladesh, India, Vietnam, Philippines, Indonesia, Egypt and Nigeria -  insurance penetration is under 1%.12 The potential economic benefits of closing the insurance gap are striking. Lloyd’s of London estimates that a 1% rise in insurance penetration can translate to a 13% reduction in uninsured losses and over 20% reduction in disaster recover burden on taxpayers.  Substantial macroeconomic benefits include increased investment, higher output (potentially up to 2% of GDP) and greater climate resilience.13 Despite this prize, progress is proving stubbornly slow – over the past 30 years the gap has narrowed by only from 78% to 70% globally, underscoring the importance of the IDF’s work.14 The role of insurance for adaptation and resilience So what should be done?                                                       10 Munich Re (2019), The natural disasters of 2018 in figures, See: https://www.munichre.com/topics-online/en/climate-change-and-natural-disasters/natural-disasters/the-natural-disasters-of-2018-in-figures.html.  11 Swiss Re institute (2018).

On the liability side, the focus must be reducing the protection gap and supporting the resilience of households and companies to growing climate risks. Better understanding of past losses can obviously help. Projects like the open-source Oasis Loss Modelling Framework of the IDF are leveraging the expertise of the private sector, the public sector and academia to improve the data available for risk analysis in low and middle income countries.15 New products, such as insurance-linked securities based on parametric triggers, are vital to help reduce macro protection gaps and increase resilience. These are generally cheaper to structure and administer and more efficient to blend with commercial finance if required.  Of course, increasingly climate-related tail risks could prove uneconomic for private sector insurers to cover.  That is where development agencies and Multilateral Development Banks can step in.  Disaster reinsurance could be one of the most effective uses of development financing. On the asset side, infrastructure investments will be essential.  To transition to net zero, all countries need to step up their investments in sustainable energy.  The reality of climate change also means that all countries, but particularly developing and emerging economies, will need to invest in new climate-resilient infrastructure in order to adapt to the new realities of a hotter and more volatile climate.  There are various estimates – they are all enormous - ranging between US$70-90 trillion over the next decade, three quarters of which are in emerging and developing economies.16  It’s imperative to act now to create practical tools and frameworks to support climate-resilient infrastructure investments – ranging from broader use of catastrophe bonds to greater risk pooling for the most vulnerable countries.  Climate-resilient infrastructure assets are well suited to life insurers that need reliable returns over long-term investment horizons. This is even more compelling in a low-for-long interest rate world.  However, as the IDF has flagged at present only 2.5% of insurance assets managed are allocated to infrastructure17. So the world needs much more investment in infrastructure, and greater risk sharing of climate risks. Insurers have a unique ability to meet both needs.                                                        15 See https://oasislmf.org/.  16  Global Commission on the Economy and Climate (2016), The Sustainable Infrastructure Imperative.

     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches 7  7   In this context, the impact of regulation on the provision and cost of infrastructure finance must be carefully considered. As World Bank studies have shown, there is evidence that infrastructure debt can be lower risk as it has more predictable and stable long-term cash flows and has low correlation to other assets.  The historical default experience of infrastructure debt suggests a ‘hump-shaped’ credit risk profile, which converges to investment grade quality within a few years after financing has closed. However, such robustness is not reflected in the standardised approaches for credit risk in most regulatory frameworks.  The World Bank study suggests that capital charges could decline significantly for a differentiated regulatory treatment of infrastructure debt as a separate asset class.  Now, the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) is reviewing the data sources and gaps and considering the risk case for a differentiated capital treatment for infrastructure under the global Insurance Capital Standard – ICS 2.0. We also need to develop the conditions to make infrastructure assets more readily investable and more easily tradable.  Under the Argentine G20 presidency last year, with support from the World Bank and OECD, the G20 designed a roadmap to make infrastructure a more coherent asset class.  The foundation is greater standardisation through greater commonality in terms, conditions and financial frameworks.  This allows the assets to become easier to invest in, easier to insure, and project risks to be better managed. Data on the input and impact of infrastructure projects can also be improved. For instance, data on project phases would allow comparisons across construction phases of infrastructure versus non-infrastructure assets.  Information on the types of concessions and licenses offered in different regions are important as they determine the kinds of revenue arrangements for infrastructure projects, which ultimately influence cash flow stability – critical information for investors. The IAIS is developing a workplan to examine these data gaps in the coming year. Reporting, risk management and return Turning to mainstream investing. Changes in climate policies, technologies and physical risks in the transition to a net zero world will prompt reassessments of the value of virtually every asset. The financial system will reward companies that adjust and punish those who don’t. Insurers can be highly influential in bringing the realities of climate change into mainstream financial decision-making. To do so, we need a step change in three areas: reporting, risk management and return.    
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches 8  8   Reporting Better corporate disclosure of climate-related financial risks is essential and the next few years will be decisive.  On the demand side, current supporters of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) are responsible for assets totalling $120 trillion and include the world’s globally systemic banks, top 10 global asset managers, leading pension funds and insurers.  Not surprisingly, supply is responding. Users of capital are providing increasingly sophisticated decision-useful information.  Four-fifths of the top 1,100 G20 companies surveyed in a recent TCFD report are now disclosing climate-related financial risks in line with the recommendations.  Now is the time to get involved. The IAIS and UN Sustainable Insurance Forum are monitoring developments in disclosures closely: with a systematic survey of TCFD adoption by insurance firms and they will be publishing a paper on this early next year, including recommendations for any changes. The Climate Change Research Initiative (CCRI) will do the same. The next step is to make these disclosures mandatory.  The UK and EU have already signalled their intents.   But it’s time for every country to get involved because the world won’t get to net zero if the financial sector doesn’t know how our companies are responding. To watch we must be able to see.  Over the next two years, the current process of disclosure by the users of capital, reaction by the suppliers of capital, and adjustment of these standards will be critical to ensure that the TCFD standards are as comparable, efficient and as decision-useful as possible.   Risk management With better information, the frontier will be to upgrade risk management and optimise returns. As the supervisor of the world’s fourth largest insurance industry, the Bank of England knows that general insurers and reinsurers are on the front line of managing the physical risks from climate change.  Insurers have responded by developing their modelling and forecasting capabilities, improving exposure management, and adapting coverage and pricing.  In the process, insurers have learned that yesterday’s tail risk is closer to today’s central scenario.  And leading insurers also understand that the breadth, magnitude, and foreseeable nature of climate risks—mean the biggest challenge will be to assess the resilience of firms’ strategies to transition risks.  That’s why, the Bank of England just set out our supervisory expectations for banks and insurers regarding their governance, risk management, strategic resilience and disclosure of climate-related financial risks. 
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches 9  9   And in June the Bank announced that we will be the first supervisor to stress test our financial system for resilience against different climate transition pathways: ranging from early and orderly to late and disruptive. The test will motivate banks, insurers and asset managers to address data gaps and to develop cutting-edge risk management approaches consistent with a range of possible climate pathways.  The Bank will develop the approach in consultation with industry, including best practice insurers, and other informed stakeholders including experts from the Network for Greening the Financial System and the PRA’s Climate Financial Risk Forum. Return There is increasing evidence that sustainable investment can generate excess returns, particularly for investors, like insurers, with longer term horizons.  One of the biggest hurdles to channelling mainstream finance to sustainable investment is the inconsistent definition and measurement of environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria.  An agreed taxonomy would allow markets to understand better where there is real outperformance and direct investments accordingly.  The EU’s Green Taxonomy and the Green Bond Standard are good starts but they are binary (dark green or brown) and don’t account for progress from brown to green – progress that could make a significant contribution to our climate goals.  One possible solution, as recommended by the UN’s Climate Financial Leaders Initiative, could be the development of transition indices which track companies in high-carbon sectors that adopt low-carbon strategies.  Such approaches are essential for our citizens to make sure their money is being invested in line with their values.  Conclusion Ultimately, the speed with which the new sustainable finance develops will be decided by the coherence and credibility of countries’ climate policies. Finance will complement - and potentially amplify these initiatives– but it will never substitute for climate policy action.  The policy frameworks with the greatest impact will be: time consistent; transparent; target-based; and committed, through treaties, nationally determined contributions (NDCs), domestic legislation and consensus.  The 20 countries – including the UK – that have plans to legislate for net zero show what can be done. 
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches 10  10   If countries build their track records, their credibility will grow, and the market will allocate capital to deliver the necessary innovation and growth and pull forward the adjustment to a low carbon future.  The more prolific the reporting, the more robust the risk management and the more widespread the return optimisation, the more rapidly the insurance sector can build resilience while promoting the transition that our citizens demand.  
Central Bank of Chile September 2019  Page 1 of 20  “From Weakness to Strength: The Journey of the Chilean Financial System and its Next Steps” ChileDay – September 10 and 11th, 2019 – London, England Mario Marcel Governor of the Central Bank of Chile  The Chilean financial system has changed notably in the past four decades. While in the early 1980s it was at the center of one of the worse economic and social crises in history, now it is a major source of strength, providing resilience to the economy in the face of external shocks. So, how did this happen? What is the source of such resilience? What new challenges lie ahead? That is the purpose of this presentation.  In a nutshell, we can argue that the regulatory changes that followed the crisis set a new framework that, far from preventing financial development facilitated it in a way consistent with economic development. Some key reforms –most notably pension reform—facilitated the emergence of new actors, making the financial sector more diverse, deep and forward-looking.  Many pieces of evidence and tests in our semi-annual Financial Stability Report, have demonstrated over recent years that the Chilean financial sector is currently well equipped to face external shocks, providing key support to the flexible exchange rate regime by reducing the exposure of the business and financial sector to FX fluctuations. Similarly, the development of long-term capital markets secure local currency financing to investment projects and to the government itself.  The relationship between the financial sector and FX markets will indeed be an important part of this presentation as a connection between financial and macro stability. This is an important pillar for a small open economy like Chile, where the capital account was opened almost 20 years ago. This is, at the same time, an area where we can make additional progress, and I will share with you some of our immediate plans that combine well with the agenda that Minister Larrain has just presented.    
Central Bank of Chile September 2019  Page 2 of 20    Some 50 years ago, banks where almost the only source of financing for firms and households. The Chilean economy was closed to international trade and capital flows, interest rates were regulated, credit was restricted, and banking activity was largely controlled by the State.   In the second half of the 1970s, the banking sector was privatized and liberalized. However, this was not accompanied with adequate regulation and supervision; and a relatively small financial system built major vulnerabilities. When macro policy missteps and external shocks hit in 1982, the banking sector was not just a weak link: it amplified these shocks leading the country into the deepest economic and financial crisis in a generation.      Financial crises are abrupt, costly and protracted affairs, and the Chilean financial crisis of the early eighties was no exception. This crisis is often placed among the top 25 most severe financial crises in modern history. 
Central Bank of Chile September 2019  Page 3 of 20  In 1981, annual output growth went from positive 9% in the first quarter, to 0% in the fourth quarter, and to minus 14% in 1982. That same year, unemployment reached a record of 25%, and businesses all over the country were seriously hampered, ultimately affecting their solvency. Banking profitability went quickly to negative territory and the delinquency rate quadrupled to 15% of the total portfolio, putting several banks at risk.   Several factors contributed to the deterioration of the macroeconomic environment in 1982. External interest rates rose, the availability of external credit decreased, and terms of trade worsened in the wake of the escalation of oil prices. This put enormous pressure on the Chilean peso—which had been under a fixed exchange rate scheme since 1979. This regime broke down dramatically and spread to almost all business sectors, given large FX exposures, and heavily leveraged financial conglomerates.     
Central Bank of Chile September 2019  Page 4 of 20  All these factors interacted with one another to become an outright banking crisis. Nevertheless, whatever the causes of the crisis, unsustainable debt was mostly explained by internal vulnerabilities: inappropriate regulation, weak supervision, and lack of attention to excessive credit growth, leveraged on a fixed exchange rate scheme.    The lessons learned from this crisis highlighted the fact that banking regulation and supervision needed to be substantially upgraded. In 1986, the General Banking Law introduced limitations on currency mismatch, constraints on related party lending, and restrictions for banks to be paid in kind instead of liquid resources. All of these elements were common practice before the 1982 crisis.   Paradoxically, what could be considered harsher regulation did not hamper financial deepening. Instead, it fostered a systematic buildup of solvency and credibility of the banking system and allowed its healthy development in the ensuing decades. Yet the 1986 Banking Law was hardly the only piece of the financial architecture that changed significantly. Notably, the creation of a funded pension system, and subsequent capital market reforms, together with capital market openness, dramatically changed the size, composition, depth, and strength of the financial sector in Chile.   
Central Bank of Chile September 2019  Page 5 of 20    By funneling household savings into capital markets, Pension Funds were especially important in the early development of a deep debt market; and their contribution to market-making benefited from a stable macroeconomic environment with controlled inflation, extensive use of the UF (a currency unit indexed to inflation), and the restructuring of Central Bank’s debt into longer maturities. A deeper and more liquid debt market also facilitated the pricing of debt issued by private companies in local markets.   Over time, pension funds were allowed to invest abroad. This fostered profitability and diversification of pension funds, prevented distorting prices in the domestic financial sector, and created a two-way street for capital flows managed by domestic agents. As foreign assets of pension funds needed to be protected from FX risk, a hedging market also developed. This fit well with changes on the macroeconomic side. In the late 1990s Chile adopted a flexible exchange rate regime and liberalized capital flows.   
Central Bank of Chile September 2019  Page 6 of 20  All of these reforms led to developing the Chilean financial system in a sound way. Currently placing Chile near the median of a group of countries in terms of private indebtedness.      How does the Chilean financial market currently combine with the exchange rate regime? Under the flexible exchange regime adopted in 1999 and taking into account all the reforms mentioned above, it is not surprising that Chile has a relatively volatile currency. However, in terms of GDP growth we appear more stable than our peers.   
Central Bank of Chile September 2019  Page 7 of 20    This is due, in part, to the fact that households, the government and small businesses are not exposed to exchange rate risk, either because they do not borrow in foreign currency or because they hold a natural hedge. Paradoxically, given the openness of the capital account and free exchange rate, Chile is not a dollarized country at all. Banks and regulators, on the other hand learned well the lessons of the 1980s crises and FX exposure is central to risk assessment and prevention.     Larger companies, on the other hand, can draw on the openness of the economy and the prestige of local regulations to take advantage of the overseas bond market while avoiding undertaking FX risk.  Corporations have learned to operate in a flexible FX environment by using both, natural and market-based FX risk hedging instruments. This, in turn, has also been supported by the development of the derivatives market, in which Pension Funds have been key counterparts as well.   
Central Bank of Chile September 2019  Page 8 of 20    Total external debt in dollars has been stable over the last few years, at around US$120 billion. A substantial part of this reflects the growing internationalization of the Chilean corporate sector. A large share of that total is associated with foreign direct investment (FDI) on local subsidiaries of multinational corporations. To the extent that FDI represents a commitment between related companies, the enforceability of debt repayment and the associated financial conditions respond to different factors than in the case of debt with other institutions, which mitigates risk in the event of an increase in financing costs. Among firms that report to the FMC, two-thirds of external debt is concentrated among companies that use the U.S. dollar as their accounting currency, this share has been stable over the last decade.    Learning from previous episodes, the risks associated with external debt remain low, given the characteristics of the debt and an appropriate use of hedging by the firms. Among firms that report in pesos, the debt is mostly concentrated in those with a limited individual currency mismatch: firms with a mismatch 
Central Bank of Chile September 2019  Page 9 of 20  of over 10% of their assets hold just 3% of external debt, and represent about 10% of the total number of companies that use the Chilean peso as accounting currency.    Local institutional investors’ participation in the local sovereign debt market, especially in the longer segments of the yield curve, is much higher in Chile than in most emerging economies, at 80 to 90%. Thus, the buy-and-hold strategy of these investors reduces the volatility of both local sovereign rates and domestic funding costs.    By now, the Chilean financial sector is one of the most developed in the emerging world. It has transited from being largely dominated by traditional banking to being composed by several other market participants, including Pension Funds, General Fund Administrators and Insurance Companies; among others. Assets under management of these non-bank investors went from less than 1% of GDP in 1984, to 
Central Bank of Chile September 2019  Page 10 of 20  65% in 2000, and to almost 100% of GDP in 2018. This development has translated into improved access to alternative sources of funding by Chilean firms. Currently, around 85% of total corporate bonds are held by institutional investors, thus reliance on banking credit of these corporations has gone from 91% of financial debt in 1986 to around 25% in recent years.    Financial development has been important not only for firms but also for the country as a whole. A deeper and far-reaching financial system contributes to building financial and economic inclusion, and financial stability against external shocks. In this respect, the Chilean financial system shows better performance than other Latin American and Emerging economies, in dimensions like market capitalization, number of branches per inhabitant, use of derivatives, and participation in domestic credit to the private sector, to name a few.    Nonetheless, increased development and complexity of financial markets also means that risks may be higher, and that a stronger and more sophisticated regulatory framework is required.    
Central Bank of Chile September 2019  Page 11 of 20    The Chilean financial crisis of the early eighties led not only to a radical bank regulation revision, but also to learning valuable lessons for the future. A deeper and properly regulated financial system contributes to financial stability, inclusion and increased welfare. Even though significant progress has been made in this regard, there are still challenges ahead that must be faced to further strengthen our financial system.  Let me now address some of these regulatory challenges the CBC has been working on.    
Central Bank of Chile September 2019  Page 12 of 20   In order to have a deeper FX market and enhance resilience of the financial sector a number of measures are being taken by the Central Bank of Chile (CBC). The internationalization of the Chilean peso can enhance financial stability, by alleviating liquidity concerns during stress episodes and reducing counterparty risks, among other effects. All of these changes must be accompanied with more robust and developed financial infrastructures. Also, the wider cross-border usage of the Chilean peso improves our position as a financial center.    Regarding concrete measures towards accomplishing these goals, the CBC is reviewing its FX regulation, in order to modernize and simplify it. In addition, a larger and more developed FX market should benefit from having access to more robust financial market infrastructures.  
Central Bank of Chile September 2019  Page 13 of 20   In order to do so, the CBC issued regulation and is implementing a Trade Repository for OTC derivatives, relying on its current faculties and in coordination with the Financial Market Commission.   Additionally, the CBC is working on an initiative that will allow its Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) payment system to settle US dollars large-value interbank transactions. These measures add to the future inclusion of the Chilean Peso as the first CLS-eligible currency in South America. This is a priority for the CBC, therefore we are working closely with the CLS Bank to materialize this in the next three years.  We believe these policy actions, as well as those announced by the Minister of Finance in order to promote Chile as a Regional Financial Center, should greatly contribute to a more resilient financial sector, wider cross-border use of the Chilean Peso and a greater participation of non-residents in our FX market.      The Strategic Planning 2018-2022 of the CBC includes a thorough review of its FX regulation.   Current FX regulations require most FX transactions to be executed through the “Formal Exchange Market” —which is comprised by banks and some stockbrokers— and to be reported to the CBC. These two elements have remained largely unchanged since the capital account was opened 20 years ago.   Back then, re-imposing capital controls could not be ruled out, and that rationale underlies the somewhat cumbersome structure of the FX regulation. Currently, while capital controls are still part of the regulatory toolbox, re-imposing them could only be considered during an exceptional situation.  Therefore, the CBC has decided to streamline its FX regulations and reduce the burden of compliance to the private sector, whenever possible, without affecting the quality of the statistical information or the capacity to act in an extreme scenario.  The first part of this process, eliminating some of the existing reporting requirements, is about to be put out for public consultation.    
Central Bank of Chile September 2019  Page 14 of 20     Modernizing FX transactions goes beyond a review of existing reporting requirements and the structure of the regulation. It also considers the review of long-standing policy definitions. One of those definitions is the restrictive regulation in terms of the currency denomination of FX transactions.  The Central Bank’s Law establishes that FX transactions cannot be denominated in CLP unless authorized by the Central Bank. This faculty has been used only exceptionally, as it was seen as a tool to prevent the circumvention of capital controls.  Consequently, for instance, residents cannot grant CLP denominated credits to non-residents (but they can do so in foreign currency). While this provision does not prevent transactions to occur, it adds transaction costs that may be preventing a wider cross-border use of the Chilean Peso.   The CBC has implemented a free-floating exchange rate regime, in which the possibility of capital controls is extremely exceptional and even if applied this measure might not be effective to prevent circumvention. Therefore the CBC is considering the extension of present transactions that are authorized to be denominated in Chilean Pesos (bonds issued in Chile by non-residents, and transaction of foreign securities), as well as the related conditions to that authorization. Such as providing information to the CBC.   This change of policy will be put out for public consultation by the end of this year. 
Central Bank of Chile September 2019  Page 15 of 20    The Central Bank is developing a new regulatory framework that will allow the real time gross settlement (RTGS) of interbank payments in U.S. dollars, through the incorporation of this currency in the RTGS system managed and operated by the CBC.   The financial system’s large-value payments in national currency are currently settled in the RTGS system, where payments are final and irrevocable in accordance with international practices. In contrast, foreign currency payments are settled through correspondent banks, a process that is not exempt from credit, operational, and liquidity risk. The requirements of the new regulatory framework were defined taking into account international experience and risk considerations, after which the draft regulations will be published for public consultation within the next weeks.   Dollar settlement at the CBC will improve the competitiveness of local infrastructures and promote the development of the financial market. Moreover, the implementation of this initiative will align local FMIs with international standards, which recommend settlement in RTGS systems due to their contribution to the risk management of participants, the functioning of the economy, and the preservation of financial stability.  
Central Bank of Chile September 2019  Page 16 of 20    Another initiative that it is currently under development is the incorporation of the Chilean Peso to the Continuous Linked Settlement System (CLS). This financial market infrastructure is currently the international standard for the settlement of cross-currency payments because reduces the risk of settlement, also known as Hersttat Risk, to barely zero. Currently, 18 currencies are allowed to settle through CLS. The CBC along with CLS and the banking sector are working to make the CLP the 19th currency of this system.   In addition to acting in accordance with its financial stability mandate and contributing to the development of the Chilean financial sector, the promotion of this initiative further support the internationalization of the CLP.    
Central Bank of Chile September 2019  Page 17 of 20  The reduction of settlement risk of the FX transactions through a PvP settlement in CLS is just one of the benefits of the system. Moreover, CLS reduce the liquidity needs of its participants through the use of multilateral netting, and enhance confidence, particularly in times of financial stress.  From a more general perspective, a satisfactory CLS due diligence process along with a broad international participation trading in the CLP, will be a strong signal of the development and competitiveness of the Chilean financial markets.     The process for the Chilean peso to become the first South American currency on CLS has started. Last July, we received the visit of CLS executives who had conversations with market participants and fruitful discussions at the CBC. After that visit, CLS and the CBC started the due diligence process. During this phase, the actions from the public and private sectors are essential.   Nevertheless, a successful process should not be over before the end of 2021.  The CBC is willing to take all the necessary measures to include the CLP into CLS, such as extending the opening hours of its RTGS system.  
Central Bank of Chile September 2019  Page 18 of 20    Related to Financial Markets Infrastructures, I would like to mention that last June the CBC issued a new regulation framework which will implement the first Trade Repository (TR) of the country. This TR, called Integrated System of Derivatives Information (SIID, in Spanish), will be owned and operated by the central and, after a transition process, will be in full operation by 2021.  The SIID will collect, store and disseminate information of OTC derivatives trades, following the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (PFMIs) and international standards for reporting.  This infrastructure should promote transparency and market conduct, improve decision-making of market participants, and contribute to the supervision processes of the Financial Market Commission.  It is important to note that the Minister of Finance has just announced that a bill to regulate Trade Repositories will be sent to Congress. The SIID is perfectly compatible with the existence of private-owned trade repositories.  
Central Bank of Chile September 2019  Page 19 of 20    According to the latest BIS Triennial Review of foreign exchange and OTC derivatives, the Chilean Peso represents 0.2% of the global FX turnover. We strongly believe that this share should increase in the future.  The different developments that are underway should contribute to financial stability and increase the cross-border use of the CLP, as well as the participation of non-residents in the domestic market.  Therefore, authorities and market participants should be prepared to be part of a bigger and more internationally integrated FX market.    Let me conclude by remarking that this journey for the Chilean financial system, through a deep financial crisis, has led to just new bank regulation but also to valuable lessons learnt for the future. A deeper and properly regulated financial system contributes to financial stability, inclusion and increased welfare.  
Central Bank of Chile September 2019  Page 20 of 20  Preventing stress episodes is a task that requires constant monitoring and early detection of potential sources of vulnerabilities and risk.  The enactment of a new Banking General Act and internationalization of the Chilean peso, among other measures, open up a new phase for modern regulation. Even though significant progress has been made in this regard, there are still challenges ahead that must be faced to further strengthen our financial system.    *** 
1 Opening Remarks Veerathai Santiprabhob, Governor of the Bank of Thailand  ASEAN Banking Cybersecurity Conference 2019 Crystal Hall, 3rd Floor, The Athenee Hotel, Bangkok, Thailand 6 September, 2019   TBA Board of Directors, TBA members, Members of ASEAN banking community, Distinguished guests, Ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted to be here with you this morning, and I would like to thank TB-CERT for inviting me to speak at this event. Technology and the internet have undeniably become integrated into our daily lives. Customers’ behaviors continue to evolve and adapt to the technological progresses. In response, new technologies are developed to serve and accommodate customers’ ever-evolving needs. A prime example is the invention of smartphone over a decade ago, which has completely transformed our ways of lives and increased people’s connectivity to unprecedented levels. The banking industry, too, is undergoing massive digitalization, from the user-facing tools like mobile banking apps to back-end infrastructure and essentially everything in between. These developments are the key drivers behind the convenience and productivity that we all enjoy today. But, inherent to any invention, these technological revolutions come with their own form of risk: cyber risks. The more “digital” banks become, the more channels for potential points of attacks from cyber criminals, who are constantly evolving to exploit new loopholes. Even when these loopholes are identified and patches are issued, delayed updates could also pose potential risk. We have repeatedly witnessed that the various—and many times severe—cyber-related incidents often revolve around financial institutions. Some infamous examples include the Bangladesh Bank incident, the hacking of ATMs in Taiwan and various other countries, Target’s credit card data breach which resulted in data of 
2 over 70 million credit cards stolen, Equifax’s data leakage in which the company was fined 700 million USD, and more recently the case of Capital One Bank in which over 100 million customers’ data were leaked. Thailand is also not immune to these cyber threats. A state bank’s ATMs were hacked, customers’ data from 2 large banks were leaked on the Dark Web, and the WannaCry ransomware outbreak. In addition to attacks on financial institutions, customers’ behavior and lack of cyber threat awareness also pose significant cyber risks as well. Social media scams through LINE or Facebook Messenger in which attackers pretend to be the victim’s acquaintance, asking for a favor to transfer money; or users’ submitting their bank account information to questionable, illegal gambling website from which their data eventually got leaked a few weeks prior are some examples of cyber-attacks that hinge on the user’s inexperience or lack of awareness of online threats. As such, I don’t think it is an over exaggeration to say that cyber threats have kept many bank executives and regulators awake at night given the nature of these threats that can occur anytime and anywhere without warning, and the significant damage they could cause. In addressing these threats, it is important to operate under the assumption that it is not a matter of “if” but rather “when” these threats will occur, and focusing solely on “protection” and “detection” is no longer sufficient. In other words, cybersecurity alone is not enough, but we also need to proactively think about cyber resilience: how do we not only prepare, but also withstand and recover from disruptions. In the short time I have today, I’d like to highlight three key drivers for effective cyber resilience. First, cyber resilience is not only the responsibility of a company’s IT department, but rather an important, organization-wide agenda. The board of directors and senior management must understand and endeavor to prioritize cyber risk management frameworks into the organization’s operation. This includes making sure that cyber resilience policies put in place are applied effectively, setting a clear organizational structure that includes the roles and responsibilities of staff across all levels, establishing a risk management process according to international practices, and ensuring that employees are always vigilant on cyber security issues. The Bank of Thailand, for example, requires financial institutions to have at least one member with IT knowledge or IT-related experiences to be on the board of directors. We also organize regular capacity-building courses for board members and high-level executives from Thai financial institutions to provide them with the knowledge and 
3 understanding of how to address cyber threats. In addition to tone from the top, staff members at the operational level must also be more vigilant of the cyber risks involved in their day-to-day tasks. Second, while in the past much efforts had been put on reinforcing protection and detection systems, we must now shift our focus towards improving response and recovery. Readiness in addressing cyber-attacks—preparing a response plan or a playbook—remains a common gap among financial institutions. Frequent cyber exercises are also crucial, as vulnerability of response plans are often discovered during these exercises which allow organizations to continually improve their response processes. Regular practice is the best practice. Not only should these exercises be done by individual firms, but also at an industry level. The financial sector, for example, has started these exercises within the banking sector and will soon expand to other parts of the financial sector. As time goes by, our society becomes more interconnected, and eventually these cyber resilience exercises need to be done at the inter-industry level. For instance, the banking sector needs to have joint exercise with telecommunication companies for scenarios involving mobile banking attacks, or with the utilities sector for power outage scenarios. Third, collaboration and information sharing are crucial in strengthening the overall cyber resilience. Cyber threats are becoming much more complex that an individual organization’s defensive technology may not be able to catch up. Close cooperation and sharing of cyber threat information will help organizations better monitor the development of cyber threats, recognize unfamiliar threats, and develop more comprehensive plans for dealing with such issues. Cooperation is also more than just information sharing: whether it is cooperation in terms of supervision, development of standards, cyber exercises, or capability building. These kinds of cooperation that would eventually create a “Cybersecurity Ecosystem” requires efforts from all sides, including governments, regulatory agencies, the private sector, and the education sector. It is very welcoming that today there are already a number of information sharing platforms available at the national, regional, and international levels. Thailand’s finance, banking, capital markets, and insurance industries have established a Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) for their respective industry. The teams share cybersecurity information on a daily basis. At the regional level, ASEAN has established the Cybersecurity Resilience and Information Sharing Platform (CRISP). The Central Banks, Regulators, and Supervisors (CERES) forum serves as a 
4 platform for the international community. These collaborations on multiple levels present opportunities for countries to learn from one another. More recently, under our capacity as the 2019 ASEAN Chairman, Thailand has collaborated with the Bank for International Settlement (BIS) to organize the ASEAN Financial Regulators’ Program on Cyber Resilience, a series of training programs, the last of which concluded just yesterday. We envision that these Cyber Range collaborations will continue to be held for ASEAN members going forward. Although the financial sector has made significant progress in terms of cyber resilience, the never-ending development of cyber threats means that we too must continue to improve our defenses. In this regard, there remains many issues which the Bank of Thailand, along with other central banks in the region, intend to drive forward, such as overseeing more comprehensive cyber resilience policies and promoting the development of human resources. In response to cyber-attacks that may target vulnerable customers, it is crucial that we strive to increase consumer technology literacy to nudge them towards safer cyber behaviors and ensure a sufficient level of Cyber Hygiene. Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Thai Bankers’ Association and TB-CERT for organizing “ASEAN Banking Cybersecurity Conference 2019” which has brought our ASEAN members together today. This is an opportunity not only to gain knowledge from expertise in different areas, but also to enhance connectivity and collaboration among professionals which is vital to improve our Cyber Resilience going forward. I wish all of you a fruitful conference and an enjoyable stay in Bangkok. Thank you. 
Gent Sejko: Launching of the new Albanian banknote serieAddress by Mr Gent Sejko, Governor of the Bank of Albania, at the launching of the new Albanianbanknote serie, Tirana, 12 September 2019.*   *   *Honourable Minister Denaj and Minister Shalësi,Your Excellencies,Distinguished guests,Ladies and gentlemen,It is a great pleasure to have you with us in this very important day for the Bank of Albania and ournational currency.In the history of the modern Albanian state, the establishment and modernisation of its monetaryand financial systems has a substantial place. The Albanian currency is a symbol that has beenpresent throughout the development of the country, bearing distinctive features of each era in thehistory of Albania.It is not a coincidence that one of the key objectives in the creation of a national bank was,among others, the issue of the Albanian currency, immediately after the sublime act of theDeclaration of Independence that laid the foundations on which the Albanian state was created. In1926, one year on from its founding, in 1925, the National Bank of Albania presented and put incirculation, for the first time, a complete series of Albanian banknotes and coins.Subsequent developments in the centralisation and later modernisation of the Albanian statedictated the need for continuous improvements of banknotes in terms of both content anddesign.  It has always represented, however, the economic, social and political developmentphases of Albania. Through the themes and art embodied in its design, the national currencyremains a faithful herald of the development, culture and history of a country. Thanks to theseattributes, the currency is in itself a significant element of the national identity.The theme of the current series of Albanian banknotes, created more than 20 years ago, featuresimportant historical periods of the Albanian nation, and prominent personalities of Albania.These themes, embodied in each banknote through the portraits of some of the most illustriousnational figures, evoke notable episodes in the history of Albania in its endeavours for freedomand prosperity. The themes lead us on a journey through historical eras, starting from Antiquity,moving through the Middle Ages, the National Awakening, the Independence of Albania, andconcluding with the symbols of the national flag and anthem on the latest and largestdenomination, the 10.000 lek banknote. These symbols have been chosen as representative andunifying elements for every Albanian.While the new series that we are presenting today retains the same themes of the alreadyexisting series, its design is reconfigured and restyled, through the application of moderntechnologies in banknote production. Thanks to cutting-edge technology, the Albanian banknoteis now more secure. Its security features – a key priority of the Bank of Albania – are enhanced.In addition, innovative printing techniques and materials have been used to increase durabilityand the banknotes’ dimensions have been optimised. The design now boasts a fresher look.The new series of Albanian banknotes combines maximum security, modern design, artisticcommunication of the historical message, and a longer lifespan. It consists of six denominations:200, 500, 1000, 2000, 5000 and 10000 lek. While the first two denominations – 200 and 5000 lek, 1 / 2BIS central bankers' speeches
issued in 2017 – are ready to be put in circulation in September 2019, the other banknotes of theseries will be put in circulation gradually over the coming years and will be legal tender alongsidethe existing denominations.The presentation of the new series demonstrates the continued commitment of the Bank ofAlbania to further enhance the quality and security of banknotes in circulation. Both theseattributes guarantee the absolute integrity of our banknotes and represent with dignity the Bank ofAlbania and the Albanian state itself.In this context, today’s ceremony marks the culmination of a voluminous work started four yearsago. In addition to Bank staff, many renowned academics, historians, Albanologists,numismatists and experts from the most experienced companies in the field of banknoteproduction have actively and intensively provided their invaluable contribution. The combinationand cooperation of specialists from various fields of expertise, coupled with the latesttechnological innovations in banknote printing, enabled the refinement and presentation of a newseries of banknotes which are simple to use, boast a contemporary design and strike a balancebetween innovation and current tradition.Dear ladies and gentlemen,Safe and efficient fulfilment of the economy’s need for money, in terms of value and structure,and guaranteeing the confidence of the public in our currency, which is one of our mainresponsibilities, have been at the core of our efforts in preparing this new series.Therefore, I am very honoured to unveil today, for the first time, for the eyes of the public, thisnew series of banknotes. As the Governor of the Bank of Albania, through this symbolic signing, Iopen the doors for the first two banknotes of the new series to start their journey and circulate inthe Albanian economy.In the hope that the new banknotes will be welcomed by the public, let me now present to youtheir design. I would also like to call on the public to handle banknotes with due care, in order topreserve their durability, quality and integrity. From 30 September 2019, the banknotes of the newseries 200 lek and 5000 lek will be legal tender in the Republic of Albania and will be used asmeans of payment, alongside the existing banknotes. 2 / 2BIS central bankers' speeches
SPEECH  Page 1 of 6 LOW FOR LONG – CAUSES AND CONSEQUENCES CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY Thank you for inviting med to speak here today. (Graph 2 – Interest rate structure, Government bonds). The term "historically low" has been used many times to describe interest rates in recent years. In Denmark, the key monetary policy rate has been negative since 2012 except for a few months. At the latest auction, yields on government bonds and T-bills fell into negative territory for all matur-ities. Recently there have even been cases where new homeowners have received payments when taking out mortgage credit loans – that is, financing costs including fees have been negative.  A robust economy and sound economic policy is part of the explanation. This has turned Denmark into an attractive destination for international investors in periods of high market uncertainty. This is not the whole story though. The declining trend in interest rates is a global phenomenon and structural in nature. Interest rates in Denmark mirror interest rate developments abroad. This is a consequence of free international capital flows and the fixed exchange rate policy.  (Graph 3 – Actual and natural real interest rates). Nominal rates are low, partly due to the fact that inflation is low. However, real interest rates are also low. The estimation of the natural real interest rate - called r* (r star) - is currently a hot topic. r* is the real interest rate level that brings actual economic activity in line with potential economic activity. r* is not directly observable and can only be estimated with some uncertainty. However, it is relatively well established in the literature, that r* has followed a declining trend over the past couple of decades. Our estimate of r* in Denmark shows a decline since the mid-1990s by approximately 4 percent-age points. This suggests that r* became negative during the financial crisis. It has remained sub-stantially below the pre-crisis level ever since. Although estimates of r* is surrounded by a high degree of uncertainty, it is our assessment that r* will likely remain low in the coming years and 19 September 2019
  Page 2 of 6 perhaps decline even further. This assessment builds on some of the structural drivers of the de-cline in r*.   (Graph 4 – Global savings glut)  There are several reasons for the decline and these are global in nature. One of the most im-portant reasons is the decline in global structural growth due to only moderate productivity growth.  Add to this the fact that we are faced with a global savings glut. A continuous decline in the real interest rate has been necessary to make the investment opportunities at hand profitable. A large share of savings is concentrated among the richest people in the US, China and Japan. In the last decade, households in countries like China have increased their demand for financial assets. This has happened as the economy has grown, the population has aged, and demand for financial self-insurance has increased.  Moreover, demographic changes have also played an important role for American and European households. In a world with rising life expectancy, households tend to increase demand for sav-ings as they face prospects of a longer life.  In our recent study on r*, we showed that savings in emerging market economies - predominantly China - and the ongoing demographic transition in the euro area have been important drivers of the large drop in r* in Denmark. Since the demographic transition is far from over yet, there is no reason to believe that a "normal situation" would imply a much higher level of r* in the coming years.   (Graph 5 – Inflation rate, long time series).  The real rate of interest is low, but so is inflation. In classical economic thinking, growth in pros-perity is linked to labour productivity, labour supply, hours worked etc., while inflation is consid-ered to be a purely monetary phenomenon – this is also called classical dichotomy. While mone-tary policy cannot be decoupled from labour market developments, the link to inflation has be-come weaker. This is often referred to as a flattening of the Phillips curve. Although labour cost pressures have strengthened and broadened amid high levels of capacity utilisation and tighten-ing labour markets, the pass-through to inflation is taking longer than anticipated. Few had pre-dicted that we could reach the present low levels of unemployment without seeing rising infla-tionary pressure.   
  Page 3 of 6 Inflation is held at bay by globalisation: a situation where the global rather than the national la-bour supply is playing a vital role for domestic inflation. The large pool of surplus labour in devel-oping countries is also putting downward pressure on wages and prices in advanced economies. Free trade and open borders result in an inflow of goods produced in low income countries and of migrants entering the labour force.      (Graph 6 – Unconventional instruments playing a larger role).  The situation with a low r* may be regarded as a new normal. The size of r* is important for the impact of monetary policy. Despite low or even negative policy rates, monetary policy may have a less expansionary effect than one might think. A general concern is the lack of monetary policy leeway to deal with the next global downturn. The possible existence of a lower bound for monetary policy rates could challenge central banks if they want to stimulate the economy through conventional policy instruments. The question is whether unconventional monetary policy instruments, such as asset purchases and targeted lend-ing, will become conventional during the next downturn. On 12 September the ECB decided on a stimulative package that points in this direction. The leading policy rate was lowered and net pur-chases under the asset purchase program were restarted. Unconventional monetary policy measures also impact economic developments in Denmark, giv-en the Danish fixed exchange rate policy. Let me remind you: Denmark is in reality a euro member state, but with costs of currency exchanges and without influence on monetary policy decisions by the ECB. On September 12 the Danmarks Nationalbank lowered the key policy rate in line with the ECB.   (Graph 7 – Synchronised Nordic monetary cycles).  While Danmarks Nationalbank meets its objective of ensuring stable prices in Denmark via the fixed exchange rate policy, many other central banks use interest rates to target inflation directly. Although the Nordic countries have implemented different monetary policy regimes, economic implications are in reality quite similar. The reason might be that interest rates across economies are heavily influenced by the global financial cycle At the centre is the Federal Reserve. There is a high degree of spill-overs between financial mar-kets in different countries. Therefore, a change in financial conditions in a large economy like the US quickly transmits to conditions in other financially open economies. It is thus impossible for the Nordic countries to insulate their monetary policy from the central banks in large countries, unless capital flows are controlled. Financial interdependence reduces the ability of monetary policy to target domestic economic conditions independently.  
  Page 4 of 6 The high degree of synchronisation of monetary policy rates in the Nordic countries supports this line of thinking. We occasionally face short-term costs of procyclical interest rate changes, as seen in the wake of the financial crisis. However, these periods occur very rarely and often last for a very short time. Several studies find that Danish monetary policy, in general, works countercycli-cally, as the business cycle in Denmark is highly synchronised with the business cycle in the euro area.  Most importantly, the monetary regime should be credible. In general, evidence shows that the choice of monetary policy regime might not be that important for stabilisation of the business cy-cle.    Monetary policy makers are not the only ones facing challenges from the low level of interest rates. High savings rates, few profitable investment opportunities and negative interest rates are also imposing challenging times on investors. This includes pension funds and commercial banks. This is not least the case in Denmark where a large part of the pension system is funded. A conse-quence in Denmark has been that pension funds have turned their attention away from bonds and towards equities and so-called alternative investments such as infrastructure, forests, energy sup-ply etc. It remains to be seen whether the risks associated with these investments are correctly estimated and priced. The lack of market prices and the lack of liquidity in many of these invest-ments clearly pose a risk which can only be expected to materialise fully during an economic downturn.  By reducing the stock of defined benefit pension plans, pension funds have managed to transfer a large share of the risk stemming from the low yield environment to the pensioners. In general, pensions are a way to allocate society's aggregate income across generations - in a closed econ-omy this would mean domestic production. Choosing a funded system relative to for example a pay-as-you-go system is basically a question of creating the right incentives for the financing of pensions. That is, paying pension contributions rather than taxes. Funded pensions tend to be better at tackling demographic changes, and pay-as-you-go systems tend to be better at coping with large transitory shocks, e.g. large changes in inflation rates. A mixed system like the Danish one therefore seems to be a good solution to secure a decent consumption level at retirement. If yields on the alternative investments of pension funds turn out to disappoint, an open question remains: who will actually pick up the bill for the retirement of our young generations? It is not certain that future pensioners will accept lower benefits, even though they currently take on more risk when moving towards funded pensions. The government might end up as a "pension provid-er of last resort". Another question is whether the low yields are affecting pension contributions to the pension funds? On the one hand, low interest rates might make it less beneficial to transfer income into pension savings. This is referred to as the substitution effect. On the other hand, pensioners will need to save more to receive the same amount of benefits at retirement age - the so-called in-come effect. Empirical studies have shown that an increase in the after-tax yield on pension sav-ings tends to incentivise people to transfer income from other savings accounts to their pensions, 
  Page 5 of 6 while keeping the total amount of savings unchanged. This experience points to a potential de-cline in pension contributions due to the low interest rates. However, the prospects of a long pe-riod with very low interest rates, the so-called "new normal", create an unprecedented situation. So pension savers may choose to increase pension contributions to compensate for the lost yield. Time will tell.    (Graph 8 – Banks' earnings remain high).  The low level of interest rates may also challenge banks' ability to make profits. I acknowledge that banks are in some ways challenged by the present interest rate environment. Fortunately, Danish banks have been able to generate profits from other sources of income. While net interest income has dwindled, banks have increased income from both fees and administration margins on mortgages. Moreover, a favourable macroeconomic setting is underpinned by the interest rate policies of central banks as well as asset purchase programmes. The macroeconomic setting has contributed to a very low level of loan impairment charges in Danish banks. In fact, Danish banks have experienced a period of record profits in recent years. However, impairment charges cannot continue at the currently low levels. If we look ahead, earnings should be expected to decrease again.  (Graph 9 – Recession risks).  Even though unconventional measures remain as part of the monetary policy toolbox, there is no doubt less leeway than previously for monetary policy to support the economy in case of a down-turn.  This is an important insight in a situation of heightened risk of a global recession. With almost 10 years of uninterrupted growth, the US economy is experiencing a record-long economic expan-sion. History shows that such an extended period of optimism tends to cause "speed blindness", sowing the seeds of a downturn.  It may be difficult to predict when the US economy will be hit by a downturn or recession, but his-torically, an inverted yield curve has signalled an upcoming recession. And at the moment, we are facing a situation where yields on 3-month US Treasuries exceed yields on 10-year government bonds. However, the yield curve is affected by a number of factors besides expectations of a cycli-cal turning point. These include the Federal Reserve's asset purchase programme. This may re-duce the predictive power of an inverted yield curve. 
  Page 6 of 6 Surveys also indicate that the perceived recession risk in financial markets has risen in the last couple of years. The trade conflict between the US and China may be a trigger. In general, history shows that upswings are inevitably followed by downturns in a market economy.  The Danish economy is well-positioned to withstand a possible global downturn. The upswing over the past six years has been balanced. Low rates have not resulted in an excessive surge in investments nor hampered household savings. On the contrary, the household consumption ratio is relatively low, despite rising disposable incomes and high household net wealth.   Let me conclude with a few thoughts on the title of this speech: "Low for long - causes and conse-quences". The pertinent question is "how long is long". We do not know. What we do know is that it will be prudent for the financial sector and investors to prepare for a long period of very low interest rates. This is - so to speak - the new normal. It creates new challenges for the financial sector. The only thing you can do is to adapt. And the same is true for monetary policy.  Thank you for listening.

    Sciences Po Paris – Paris, 18 September 2019 Inaugural lesson at the Paris School of International Affairs,  by François Villeroy de Galhau Governor of the Banque de France  What economic sovereignty for Europe? Facing the threats with lucidity, and boldly seizing an opportunity          Press contact: Mark Deen (mark.deen@banque-france.fr; 06 88 56 54 03).
Page 1 of 10  Mr Director, Dean (dear Enrico),  Ladies and gentlemen, teachers, dear students,  It gives me great pleasure to speak before you today. I follow in the footsteps of several Ministers of Foreign Affairs, including Jean-Yves Le Drian and Nathalie Loiseau. Caro Enrico, thank you for your invitation, knowing this makes me feel all the more grateful and honoured! The decision to switch from diplomats to a central banker such as myself perhaps sends out three signals. First, rarely have geopolitics and economics been so closely intertwined. Faced with the rise in protectionist tensions and the verbal volleys, which unfortunately intensified again this summer, some even say that economic interdependence – the “sweet ties of commerce” praised by Montesquieu – is the only thing still shielding us from military conflict. Conversely, rarely has a global economic slowdown been so clearly attributable to political causes: nearly everywhere, public policy instability and uncertainty are on the rise and are damaging private sector confidence; I shall come back to this. Second signal: rarely have central banks been called upon to do so much.  I’m not going to bore you with a lesson on the technical delights and subtleties of monetary policy. Let’s just say that we have a central mandate – price stability – and a main instrument for achieving this – the short-term interest rate. But for the past ten years, since the great financial crisis, we have been using new instruments: quantitative easing (QE), forward guidancei and even negative rates. These non-standard policies have been effective; but they can also create the – mistaken – illusion that monetary policy is omnipotent.  Third signal: rarely has Europe appeared so necessary and at the same time so divided. I am a French and European official, I was in Maastricht 28 years ago to launch the euro; every two weeks I take part in meetings of the ECB Governing Council which manages the currency. I stand by this conviction in Europe and in the belief that the joint work carried out by France and Germany is an indispensable driver, even if it is not enough. Nearly 30 years ago, the fall 
Page 2 of 10  of the Berlin Wall injected new impetus into the construction of Europe. Today, Europe is turning in on itself, is on the defensive. Yet it is vital that it make itself heard in the face of the threats that it is facing, and that it do so with one voice if it doesn’t want to be inaudible. But beyond the threats, and at the risk of sounding paradoxical and even a little provocative, I would like to present you with an opportunity: in the current crisis of globalisation, Europe doesn’t need to keep its head down; it should assert and propose a model – its own social, environmental and mutilateral model. I propose that we do this in the spirit of Stefan Zweig, who as early as 1934, admirably described the state of mind of the great European Erasmus of Rotterdam: “Instead of listening to the vainglorious claims of petty princelings, of fantastical sectarians and of national egoists, the mission of the European is on the contrary to emphasise that which unites the peoplesii”. ** I. Lucidity in the face of two economic threats There are currently two main types of challenges to Europe’s economic sovereignty: the first are linked to political decisions (“man-made”); the second to the emergence of technological powers whose reach extends beyond the confines of individual states (“tech-made”). At the top of the list of political threats are the protectionist tensions stemming from the United States, but also the uncertainties surrounding Brexit. They are weighing on our multilateral order and already contributing to the global economic slowdown:iii in the space of a year, the 2019 forecast for world growth has gone from 3.9% to 3.2%, and for the euro area from 1.8% to 1.1%.iv This loss of growth occurred even before tariffs were raised, and for a reason that is often underestimated: protectionist uncertainty reduces business leaders’ confidence in the future and leads them to postpone their investments. Britain under the threat of Brexit has been a clear illustration of this private sector confidence deficit over the past three years [the Bank of England estimates that business investment is 20-25% below its previous trend], and even the United States is beginning to 
Page 3 of 10  suffer. Faced with this situation, political leaders – and one of them in particular – have the most important role to play: it is up to them to restore the confidence they have undermined. Monetary policies do their part by keeping interest rates low in the face of the slowdown, but they cannot tackle the underlying cause.  For the euro area, these uncertainties are being compounded by a painful paradox: the causes of the slowdown are largely external, but the region is being acutely affected. This imbalance is attributable to the weight of Germany, which is highly specialised in the manufacture of capital goods and “overexposed” to global trade. It nonetheless also illustrates the fact that Europe needs to make greater use of the scope it has to respond: it has less public debt (81% of GDP) than the United States (106%) or the United Kingdom (87%), but it makes less use of fiscal stimulus, especially in Germany.  In addition, the expansion of the euro’s international role would be a useful means of consolidating our economic sovereignty. The euro is 20 years old and it is our success: it ranks second in the international monetary system, but it still needs to increase its importance at the global level. The dollar remains a key pillar of America’s global power, and China is taking a greater interest in the internationalisation of the renminbi.   The other major threat to Europe’s sovereignty is technological. Of the large digital corporations – the GAFA and other bigtechs – whose power equals that of sovereign states, none is European. And Europe is seriously lagging behind in investment: in 2015, the euro area’s stock of information and communication technology (ICT) capital amounted to 7.6% of GDP compared with 10.9% in the United States.v Yet Europe has the advantage of having a single market: you can see what happens without it with Brexit and the cost of a “no deal” for the British economy. But we need to be more bold. By taking full advantage of the size effect: there are still too many implicit borders and too much 
Page 4 of 10  fragmentation. By using the power of standardisation, notably to direct innovation, as illustrated by the GDPR and data where Europe is taking the lead. By daring to implement an industrial policy with public-private partnerships, as in artificial intelligence and batteries.  And lastly, by mobilising our financial resources: Europe has the largest pool of private savings in the world, with more than EUR 300 billion of excess savings invested outside the region each year, but our venture capital market, and more broadly our equity financing market, are underdeveloped compared with the United States. In the financial sector, the bigtechs have the potential to cause a genuine “Big Bang”: they have a strong brand image, a global client base and privileged access to new technologies. Of course, financial regulation needs to remain neutral vis-à-vis technology: the principle of “same activity, same rules” needs to be applied to maintain a level playing field for all players. But we need to increase international cooperation in four key areas of the regulation of digital finance: (i) cyber-security; (ii) data protection; (iii) preserving competition in the face of the risk of ultra-dominant networks and private monopolies; and (iv) fair cross-border taxation. Facebook’s Libra is a prime example of a case where cooperation is imperative. The G7 under the French presidency underlined the challenge this poses for sovereignty, and wants to address some “serious regulatory and systemic concerns”vi before such projects can be implemented.   II. Boldly seizing the opportunity of a social, environmental and multilateral model.  I now come to my provocation, or rather what should be our boldness. To this uncertain, troubled, disruptive, and uncooperative world, does Europe have nothing to offer? Let us start with the very criticisms levelled today at the multilateral economic order, and at what has been called the "Washington Consensus". It was economically sound, but socially too weak. Globalisation has often been felt to have mainly benefited large corporations – and their tax evasion. Inequalities between countries – notably between the North and the 
Page 5 of 10  South – have fortunately decreased; those within countries have increased. And your generation is demanding that we guarantee the protection of the planet. Behind these criticisms are often our very European values. This echoes the work of many researchers who highlight the diversity of capitalist models and seek to correct their excesses.vii I am thinking in particular of Marie-Laure Djelic, co-Dean of the Sciences Po School of Management,viii of Michel Aglietta who denounces the "excesses of financial capitalism"ix or of Dani Rodrik who highlights the dysfunctions of liberal capitalism.x At the beginning of the 1990s, Michel Albert theorised "Rhenish capitalism".xi Jean-Dominique Sénard is now calling for “responsible capitalism” in Europe.  Europe, if it is bold enough, is in a good position to provide concrete answers to the expectations of the world's citizens. The new Commission, led by Ursula von der Leyen, has the means to achieve this ambition. In my view, the "European model" is articulated around four requirements: the fight against inequalities, the promotion of individual autonomy through education and knowledge building, the preservation of the climate, and the renewal of multilateralism. By the way, we are talking here about a “European model” and not a “European way of life” which has been discussed a lot in recent days. In short, Europe can proudly define itself as a social, environmental and multilateral model.  2.1 The social model: the fight against inequalities  The rise in inequalities has – fortunately, in my eyes – become once again a major economic and social issue, as evidenced by the success of the work of Joseph Stiglitzxii and Thomas Piketty.xiii This too long-ignored problem has been at the heart of election results – from Donald Trump to Brexit – and is one of the main reasons for the democratic crisis and the rise of "populism". On the economic front, international institutions, the OECDxiv and the IMF,xv have studied the impact of inequalities on growth. Their findings are clear: persistent inequalities reduce the long-term growth potential of economies. According to some OECD estimates, in the United States and United 
Page 6 of 10  Kingdom, growth in GDP per capita between 1990 and 2010 would have been 20% higher if income inequalities had not increased. Much can be learned from the European model. Firstly, because it is less inegalitarian, especially thanks to redistribution. According to the World Inequality Lab, after redistribution, the income of the wealthiest 10% of US households is, on average, twelve times higher than that of the poorest 50%, compared to a ratio of eight in Europe. This ratio has doubled in the United States since 1980, while it has remained relatively stable in Europe.xvi Our social welfare system plays a key role here: it even defines Europe, whether it is based on a Bismarck or a Beveridge model. Secondly, the European model organises industrial relations and economic power relations in a more balanced way between employers and employees. This is enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, whether one follows the Nordic traditions of negotiation or the Latin ones of regulation. Finally, a high level of public services remains a key factor of integration, from transport to health. As regards the level of public spending, there are significant differences between European countries: unfortunately, France displays the highest level of public spending, at 56% of GDP, and must make its public sphere more efficient. But the euro area average, at 47% of GDP, illustrates a different societal choice to that of the United States and the United Kingdom, with ratios of 35% and 38% respectively, and even more so the large emerging countries Redistribution and social welfare system + industrial relations + public services: let us call it the European social model, or "Soziale Marktwirtschaft" if one is German and more liberal. The vast majority of our fellow citizens, beyond their national or political differences, are attached to this common matrix. Let us affirm it, without shame: it is not only a legacy from the past, it is an asset, today. But we need to recognize that this ambition to achieve social justice is no longer sufficient. We cannot be content with an ex-post "repair" of inequalities.xvii We have to create equal opportunities for all ex ante, and this is the second requirement, that of individual autonomy through education. 
Page 7 of 10  2.2 The major requirement: aspiring to autonomy through education  It is clear that education must be the absolute priority: to offer all citizens the same opportunities for success, regardless of their social background. It is the best way to prepare each and every citizen for the knowledge economy and the technological transformations that he or she will have to face. It is the prerequisite for social mobility, in order to reduce the “longitudinal” inequalities between generations. And hence, it increases growth by raising the “human capital” of a country.  In Europe, we have some of the best education and vocational training systems. For example, the effective Finish education model and the quality of German and Swiss teaching. The skill levels of European students are on average higher than those of OECD countriesxviii in terms of mathematics and science scores and of understanding written texts. As well as performing better, our education systems are more democratic thanks to higher enrolment ratesxix – 90% in Europe compared to 84% in the United Statesxx – and lower average tuition fees.xxi But it is clear that there is a significant North-South divide in Europe in terms of education; and France – it must be said – is "southern" and inegalitarian. PISA studies show that France is the G7 country where academic performance of pupils is the most highly determined by their social environment.xxiiixxii This observation illustrates what the Nobel Prize winner Jean Tirole described as the “délit d’initié” or rigged system. This collective failure also contributes to a structural unemployment rate that is still too high in France, i.e. around 7 to 8%. This challenge is common in Southern Europe, and goes hand in hand with another one: at long last developing apprenticeships and vocational training. There are now fewer young people in apprenticeships in France, Italy and Spain combined than in Germany alone... while there are many more young people, and young people unemployed. It is not a paradox, but rather an explanation... and a call for action. The "Avenir Pro" law passed in France 
Page 8 of 10  in 2018 must now be implemented, and Italy’s way out of economic stagnation can be achieved by taking the same tack. 2.3 Commitment to the environment and climate The third requirement of the European model is a firm commitment to the environment and climate. This issue is currently the largest unifying factor among the young as well as older generations throughout the world. The last European elections showed this clearly. The German philosopher Hans Jonas urges us to respect the imperative of responsibility: you should always consider the possible worst case as a likely option and act accordingly.xxiv And is this respect, Europe is ahead and Donald Trump's America is behind.  But climate is the very example of a global public good: no country has the means or even the incentive to act alone. All European countries signed the Paris Climate Agreement in 2015. Supervisors and central banks are also strongly committed. In December 2017, some of them – including in several European countries – set up the Central Banks and Supervisors Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) at the initiative of the Banque de France. Today, this network has nearly 50 members: it works concretely – and with great enthusiasm – to ensure that banks and insurers better integrate climate change risks and promote green financing. And we must, as Christine Lagarde told the European Parliament, take climate change into account in monetary policy: I made proposals in this respect. 2.4 A new model to renew multilateralism European integration is based first and foremost on a method: multilateralism and cooperation. These are no longer very fashionable terms, but we must use them without wavering. Nationalist escalation does not provide solutions for the major issues facing citizens. We still need to re-establish multilateralism on the basis of three convictions stemming from our European experience, with its limitations: 
Page 9 of 10  - an agenda that meets people's expectations: more inclusive growth, and the protection of common public goods, starting with the climate - an ability to decide and act comprehensively with regard to a few well-identified projects, rather than discussing everything, at too much length.  - a distinction between the independence of states – which may be formal – and real sovereignty on key issues. Emmanuel Macron was among the first who dared to advocate a "European sovereignty", which is still an oxymoron for many, who only dream of national sovereignty. But it is this common sovereignty that Mario Draghi promoted in a speech in Bologna last February, stressing that: “independence does not guarantee sovereignty" and that "countries need to work together to exercise sovereignty.”xxv Let me give you a testimony: this is what we have achieved with the euro. It is never easy – we have cultural differences, including economic differences. But we are proud to have created together a sovereign currency, globally respected, with popular support – 76% of citizens are attached to the euro – and a federal institution – the Eurosystem, consisting of the ECB and the 19 national central banks – which is undoubtedly the one that works the best in Europe.   ** A social, environmental and multilateral model must now be Europe’s message to the world. I do not underestimate any of the difficulties involved: we must first manage today's threats. We must involve and convince the citizens, who too often fear that more economic integration threatens their European social model, when conversely it would strengthen it: we should state much more clearly our commitment to these common "fundamentals". Finally, we must have the courage to assert our values openly. But I will conclude with a former student of Sciences-Po, and one of the greatest, Simone Veil: “Setting itself high ambitions, Europe will be able to make its 
Page 10 of 10  voice heard and defend strong values: peace, the defence of human rights, and more solidarity between rich and poor.”xxvi This fight is worth fighting; it is mine, and I believe above all that it is the fight of your generation. I wish each and every one of you, good luck.

     Page 2/4    Ladies and gentlemen I am very pleased to welcome you all to this year’s Karl Brunner Distinguished Lecture. This occasion marks the 30th anniversary of Karl Brunner’s death. In the Karl Brunner Lecture Series, the Swiss National Bank pays tribute to academics whose research is of particular relevance for central banking. Today we are celebrating the outstanding contribution made by Raghuram Rajan, the Katherine Dusak Miller Distinguished Service Professor of Finance at the Booth School of Business at the University of Chicago. We are honoured that Dr Rajan has accepted our invitation to deliver this lecture. Raghuram Rajan was born on 3 February 1963 in Bhopal, India. He started his career with a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi. Following the decision to leave the sphere of electromagnetic fields and waves in favour of the oscillations of the economy and financial markets, Raghu joined the doctoral programme at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where he received a PhD for his thesis ʻEssays on Banking’. Four years later, at the age of just 32, he became a full professor of finance at the University of Chicago. Exceptional academic Raghu is an exceptional academic. He has done pioneering empirical and theoretical work across a remarkably broad field of topics. His main interests, however, lie in banking, corporate finance and economic development, and especially the role played by finance in economic development. In his paper entitled ʻFinancial dependence and growth’, co-authored with Luigi Zingales, he found evidence of a positive causality between the level of development of a country’s financial sector and income growth. According to Google Scholar, this paper has been cited more than 9,000 times. This is on a par with Milton Friedman’s influential 1967 presidential address to the American Economic Association on the concept of the natural rate of unemployment. Raghu’s trademark is his willingness to challenge the accepted wisdom of the day. The best-known example of this took place at the Jackson Hole symposium in 2005. There he warned of an upcoming meltdown in the global financial system, with substantial negative consequences for the real economy. Three years later, the global financial crisis broke out. And it was largely caused by the very factors that he had identified. For Raghu, financial markets play an important role for economic growth in the long term. However, financial markets have a tendency to deviate from fundamental values. Financial regulation has therefore been a concern of his since well before the crisis. What are his recommendations in this regard? To be effective, regulation must avoid being procyclical, that is, over-regulating in a bust and de-regulating in a boom. Rather, regulation must be comprehensive and contingent. Consider two types of such regulation. First, instead of being required to raise permanent capital, institutions should arrange for capital to be infused when they are in trouble. One example of contingent capital is for banks to issue debt that 
     Page 3/4    automatically converts to equity under specified conditions. The second type of regulation is aimed at ‘too big to fail’ institutions. Instead of limiting their size and activities, a more sustainable form of regulation requires these institutions to develop a plan that would enable them to be resolved over a weekend. Both of these measures proposed by Raghu have become fundamental elements of banking regulation in Switzerland since the financial crisis. Impressive policymaker I have known Raghu for many years. From my personal experience I can say with conviction that he is not only an exceptional scholar but also an impressive policymaker. His career as a policymaker began at the International Monetary Fund (IMF). In the aftermath of the 1997 Asian financial crisis, the IMF wanted to strengthen its financial expertise. Anne Krueger, then the IMF’s First Deputy Managing Director, asked Raghu if he would be interested in becoming the IMF’s Chief Economist. Raghu replied: ‘Anne, I don't know any macroeconomics’. However, this claim was neither convincing nor credible for the IMF’s Deputy Managing Director, and so at the age of 40, Raghu was appointed as the IMF’s Chief Economist. He was both the youngest-ever person to be assigned the position, and the first from an emerging-market nation. During his tenure at the IMF he pushed the research department to focus on financial-sector issues and explore ways of integrating them into the IMF’s macroeconomic models. This was long before modelling the financial sector more effectively became a high priority both in academia and central banking. After his three-year term at the IMF, Raghu returned to the University of Chicago. In 2012, he went back to India to serve briefly as Chief Economic Advisor to the Finance Minister. In 2013, he was appointed as Governor of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), and in 2015 as Vice-Chairman of the Board of Directors at the Bank for International Settlements. With hindsight, Raghu himself acknowledged that putting an academic in the Governor’s job at the RBI was ‘like letting a kid loose in a candy shop!’. Which is not to say that the job was always easy or enjoyable. When he joined the RBI, inflation was at double-digit levels, the rupee was in free fall, capital was fleeing, and growth was weak. Raghu did not waste any time. In September 2013, on his very first day in office, he gave a press conference outlining a number of planned reforms. Investors and markets were soon convinced that the RBI would follow a stability-oriented monetary policy. However, there were also occasions when Raghu’s comments had surprising consequences. For instance, during a press conference in 2015, when asked whether he was dovish like Janet Yellen or hawkish like Paul Volcker, he replied ‘My name is Raghuram Rajan and I do what I do’. Of course, the next day this James Bond-ish remark made headlines in the financial press. When his three-year tenure ended, inflation was near the five percent inflation target, thereby improving conditions for ordinary citizens. Interest paid by the government had been reduced and bonds with maturities up to forty years were being issued for the first time. The value of 
     Page 4/4    the rupee had stabilised, foreign exchange reserves were at a record high, and India was the world’s fastest growing major economy. The three pillars of society Let me finish by saying a few words about one of Raghu’s latest publications. Next to an impressive list of about 90 peer-reviewed papers on specific economic and financial topics, Raghu has also written four books with a broader perspective. In his book, The Third Pillar: How Markets and the State Leave the Community Behind, which was published this year, Raghu emphasises that society is supported by three pillars: the state, markets and the community. Society can prosper if it achieves the right balance between the three pillars. Raghu argues that today, these pillars are seriously out of balance. While states and markets have expanded their powers, communities have been left powerless in dealing with the consequences of technological change and globalisation. As a result, people turn towards populist politicians. Their solutions, however, undermine the liberal market democratic system that has brought about prosperity. The appropriate solution to many of our problems consists of returning power from the state to the community. Communities should be able to develop policies to address their own needs. This makes them less receptive to populist solutions. Raghu’s view reminds me of the political system in Switzerland. Here, political decisions are taken at the lowest possible level of governance, closest to the people concerned. This decentralisation fosters citizens’ engagement in their communities. Today, Raghu will speak about an issue that is more narrow in scope, but which is of great importance to central banks, not least to the Swiss National Bank. His speech is about the spillovers of monetary policy beyond a country’s border. This topic has attracted a lot of attention in the past few years following QE and other unconventional monetary policy measures adopted by central banks. Who better to speak to us on this subject than Raghu with his profound knowledge of capital markets and his experience as the central bank governor of a country highly exposed to monetary policy decisions taken elsewhere? Ladies and gentlemen, please join me in welcoming Raghuram Rajan with a big round of applause. 
 Toward Sustaining a Virtuous Cycle Speech at the Meeting of Councillors of Nippon Keidanren (Japan Business Federation) in Tokyo Bank of Japan December 26, 2019   Haruhiko Kuroda Governor of the Bank of Japan (English translation based on the Japanese original) 
1  Introduction It is a great honor to have this opportunity to address such a distinguished gathering of business leaders in Japan today.  It is only a week before the first year of the new Reiwa era comes to an end. Today, in wrapping up 2019, I would first like to take a look back at this year's economic developments at home and abroad and talk about the Bank of Japan's conduct of monetary policy. Then, I will touch on developments in Japan's economy from a somewhat long-term perspective and future challenges. Specifically, I will explain the mechanism of the virtuous cycle operating in Japan's economy and the challenges to sustaining this cycle.  I. This Year's Economic Developments at Home and Abroad Continued slowdowns in the global economy Starting with a look back at developments in the global economy this year, slowdowns have continued to be observed (Chart 1). At this meeting three years ago, I said that the global economy finally seemed to be entering a new phase by putting the negative legacy of the global financial crisis behind it. In fact, the global economy registered relatively high growth in 2017 and 2018, partly reflecting a global increase in IT-related demand and a boost in business fixed investment. However, a phase shift started from around mid-2018. This is mainly because tension over the U.S.-China trade friction began to heighten and the global cycle for IT-related goods entered into an adjustment phase. Back then, there seems to have been a prevailing view that adjustments would come to an end shortly and the global economy would head toward a pick-up in the second half of 2019. However, it turned out that it remained in a deceleration phase for the whole year. A pick-up in the global economy has been delayed, due mainly to the intensified and prolonged U.S.-China trade friction and the continued slowdown in the Chinese economy, and the global economy has not yet moved out of this situation.  What is the outlook for the global economy next year? The Bank projects that the growth rate will rise moderately through mid-2020, although it is subject to considerable uncertainties. According to the latest World Economic Outlook (WEO) released by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the global growth rate also is projected to recover to 
2  3.4 percent for 2020, which is around the past average, from 3.0 percent for 2019. There are three major reasons behind the Bank's projection. First is that uncertainties over the global economy, including developments in U.S.-China trade negotiations, have eased somewhat. As I explained earlier, the global economic slowdown this year is attributable mainly to political and geopolitical uncertainties, such as the U.S.-China trade friction and Brexit. It is significant that these uncertainties have been easing, at least to some extent. Second is that the global cycle for IT-related goods, which had been exerting downward pressure on the global economy this year, has been picking up. World semiconductor shipments recently have turned to an increase. The adjustment phase of the global cycle for IT-related goods, which started from around mid-2018, finally seems to be coming to an end. Third is the effects of each country's macroeconomic policy. Since the turn of this year, many emerging economies have reduced their policy rates, and the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank (ECB) have conducted monetary easing. This is likely to underpin the global economy.  However, the Bank considers that downside risks regarding such outlook for the global economy remain significant. As for U.S.-China trade negotiations, there remain points of disagreement between the two countries, such as those regarding industrial policy. In addition, it is necessary to pay attention to such factors as uncertainties over emerging economies and geopolitical risks. Thus, future developments in the global economy likely will continue to warrant close attention for the time being.  Developments in Japan's economy Next, I will talk about Japan's economy (Chart 2). Looking back on this year, reflecting the effects of the global economic slowdown, exports have continued to show some weakness and manufacturers' sentiment has become cautious. On the other hand, domestic demand has continued on an uptrend, and nonmanufacturers' sentiment has remained at a high level on the whole.  In the past, there were many cases in Japan where changes in the global economy or external demand affected overall developments in the economy relatively quickly. However, what is unique to the current phase is that domestic demand has remained firm so far 
3  despite weak external demand. One factor underpinning firm domestic demand is business fixed investment. According to the December Tankan (Short-Term Economic Survey of Enterprises in Japan), business fixed investment is planned to continue increasing steadily (Chart 3). This increase in business fixed investment is underpinned by sustained investment that is less susceptible to short-term economic developments, including labor-saving and efficiency-improving investment, construction investment, and research and development (R&D) investment for growth areas. This likely has brought about firm domestic demand that is unlikely affected by external demand. In addition, private consumption has continued to increase moderately on the back of steady improvement in the employment and income situation. For the time being, the effects of the October 2019 consumption tax hike warrant attention. Private consumption registered a somewhat large decline for October, partly affected by natural disasters such as typhoons. However, excluding those effects, a reactionary decline in demand after the tax hike seems to be smaller than that of the previous tax hike in 2014.  As for the outlook, domestic demand is likely to follow an uptrend with a virtuous cycle from income to spending operating. Although its pace of increase is expected to decelerate temporarily, affected by the global economic slowdown to date, the consumption tax hike, and natural disasters, a large decline likely will be avoided. In addition, the global growth rate is projected to rise. Under these circumstances, Japan's economy is expected to continue on a moderate expanding trend.  Let me move on to price developments (Chart 4). Looking back on this year, the year-on-year rate of increase in the consumer price index (CPI) excluding fresh food has decelerated somewhat, partly due to the effects of the decline in energy prices. However, that excluding fresh food and energy, which more clearly shows the underlying trend in the CPI, has been somewhat higher compared to last year. As for the outlook, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is likely to increase gradually toward the price stability target as firms' and households' perception of prices improves amid the continuation of the expanding economic trend.  
4  II. The Bank's Conduct of Monetary Policy Next, I will talk about the Bank's conduct of monetary policy.  The Bank has pursued powerful monetary easing with the aim of achieving the price stability target of 2 percent since the introduction of quantitative and qualitative monetary easing (QQE) in 2013 (Chart 5). In this situation, as the global economic slowdown continued and downside risks to Japan's economic activity and prices became significant this year, the Bank clarified its policy stance of being tilted toward monetary accommodation since around summer. In October, with a view to making this clearer, the Bank decided on a new forward guidance, whereby it would maintain the policy rates at their present levels or, depending on the situation, lower their levels, as long as downside risks to economic activity and prices remain significantly high. While continuing to carefully examine various risks, the Bank will not hesitate to take additional easing measures if there is a greater possibility that the momentum toward achieving the price stability target will be lost.  Meanwhile, early this month, the government released the Comprehensive Economic Measures to Create a Future with Security and Growth. Recently, the cooperation between monetary and fiscal authorities increasingly has been drawing attention globally, so let me explain the basic thinking on it. If the government implements fiscal policy when a central bank pursues monetary easing to achieve its inflation target, economic stimulus effects will become more powerful through their synergy effects. Such a combination of policies is called a policy mix, and this is a standard approach of macroeconomic policy. Therefore, the economic measures that the government recently has implemented can exert significant effects to maintain the expanding trend in the economy with the Bank's pursuit of powerful monetary easing.  That said, the cooperation between monetary and fiscal authorities entails difficulties in terms of ensuring public confidence toward macroeconomic policy. In economic theory, a policy mix is assumed to be conducted in an appropriate manner through monetary and fiscal policies based on their own particular policy objectives. In recent discussions, however, some seem to confuse a policy mix with debt monetization by central banks. Thus, 
5  it is important to clarify each role when considering the monetary-fiscal policy mix. In the joint statement released by the government and the Bank of Japan in January 2013, they took this point into account and made it clear. The government and the Bank confirmed in the statement that they would work within their respective autonomies to fulfill their own roles, and this framework seems to be functioning very effectively.  III. Toward Sustaining a Virtuous Cycle I have looked back at this year's developments in economic activity at home and abroad and explained the Bank's monetary policy conduct during the period. In what follows, I would like to talk about developments in Japan's economy from a somewhat long-term perspective.  Japan's economy has improved significantly since the introduction of QQE in 2013. Three virtuous mechanisms have been operating behind this. The first is the virtuous cycle from income to spending in the corporate sector. The second is the same virtuous cycle in the household sector. And the third is the virtuous cycle that has been operating between the corporate and household sectors, whereby an increase in corporate profits leads to a rise in wages, which enables firms to raise their selling prices, resulting in a further increase in corporate profits. It is important not to disrupt these virtuous cycles in order to achieve sustainable economic growth in Japan. Today, I would like to focus on two cycles that in particular are most relevant to business managers: (1) a cycle from income to spending in the corporate sector and (2) a cycle of wages and prices.  Cycle from Income to Spending in the Corporate Sector Let me first talk about the cycle from income to spending in the corporate sector. Looking back from a somewhat long-term perspective, the collapse of the bubble economy in the 1990s was a significant turning point in Japanese firms' behavior (Chart 6). After the bubble burst, firms were negative toward undertaking fixed investment for a prolonged period, mainly against the background of the burden brought about by excess production capacity that was accumulated during the bubble period and of corporate profits remaining low under the following deflation. Moreover, this hampered the accumulation of capital stock and innovation, and became one of the factors that lowered Japan's growth potential. 
6  A remarkable change in this situation was observed after the introduction of QQE in 2013 (Chart 7). To begin with, corporate profits have improved clearly. Although they recently have shown some weakness in part, due to the effects of the slowdown in overseas economies, they have remained at historical high levels. In this situation, business fixed investment has turned to an uptrend gradually.  However, even after 2013, compared to favorable corporate profits, some cautiousness has remained in firms' fixed investment stance, and firms have continued to save most of their profits (Chart 8). One of the multiple factors behind this seems to be a rise in demand for precautionary saving on the firms' side, in reflection of the experience of severe recessions, such as the collapse of the bubble economy and the global financial crisis. However, firms' fixed investment stance clearly has become active for the past few years, with corporate profits remaining at high levels. Although earned surplus has continued to increase, cash and deposits have stopped accumulating since 2018. The proportion of business fixed investment relative to cash flow has increased, and firms have come to use much of their profits for fixed investment. In addition, the current steady business fixed investment -- mainly in terms of sustained investment -- despite weak external demand seems to be attributable partly to firms' fixed investment stance, which is generally becoming active.  Firms' active stance toward fixed investment also can lead to a rise in Japan's growth potential through an accumulation of capital stock and a rise in productivity. Of course, economic policies such as structural reforms can contribute to enhancing this potential. Monetary policy also has played a part in a rise in growth potential; due to powerful monetary easing, Japan's economy is no longer in deflation and firms' overly pessimistic view has eased. However, the main driving force of a rise in growth potential is the private sector, and the mutual interaction between firms' innovation and investment is more important than anything else. In order to further enhance Japan's growth potential, firms need to continue with positive investment that leads to the creation of new values and an improvement in productivity.  IT investment to address the digitalizing society is expected to be one of the areas of such positive investment. Japanese firms already have made efforts in this area (Chart 9). R&D 
7  expenditure during the past few years has been pushed up largely by investment in automobile-related industries. The increase reflects moves toward advancing CASE technologies -- connected, autonomous, shared & service, and electric -- of automobiles in response to the digitalization. The progress in such firms' efforts is desirable particularly in terms of enhancing Japan's growth potential. Let me give you two reasons why this is the case.  First, since the labor supply is likely to decrease along with the declining and aging population in Japan, the substitution of IT investment for employment has rather positive effects. Regarding the impact of IT investment on the economy, some raise concern that employment opportunities will be lost and the number of unemployed may increase. However, in Japan, the negative impact of a decline in labor force on economic growth can be offset by IT investment compensating for the future decline in labor supply.  Second, overall productivity will be enhanced through the advances in digitalization. On this point, some argue that, among the general-purpose technologies, the productivity improvement effects brought about by IT such as computers and the internet are smaller than those brought about by electricity and internal-combustion engines. Such pessimistic views on IT have been presented by, for example, Professor Robert Gordon of Northwestern University, but there are various counterarguments against this. Erik Brynjolfsson, Professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, noting that innovation will occur by connecting a variety of existing products and ideas, states that IT is the general-purpose technology that can lead to innovation more easily compared to electricity and internal-combustion engines, because it enabled the connection of brand-new products and ideas through networks. Given that the development of such cutting-edge applied technology as artificial intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT) is underway, I suppose innovation brought about by the advances in digitization will improve productivity, and this can be evaluated as favorable.  On this basis, how firms make use of technologies also is important in order to strengthen growth potential through IT investment. According to a survey asking Japanese and U.S. firms why they have increased their IT-related budgets, many Japanese firms answered in 
8  the 2013 survey that it was to improve business efficiency and cut costs (Chart 10). On the other hand, U.S. firms seemed to have focused on so-called aggressive investment, in that they aimed at incorporating new technologies to encourage innovative initiatives such as developing products and services. Although there already had been such a contrast between Japanese and U.S. firms, a significant change was observed in the 2017 survey. That is, Japanese firms also have started to make more active use of technologies to enhance value-added through innovation, rather than only utilizing them to cut costs and streamline production processes. Since Japanese firms are good at making process innovation, I hope that they will proceed further with the current innovations, thereby raising productivity.  In order to foster various innovations by firms, it is essential to promote basic research to support them (Chart 11). For example, "the number of highly cited papers," which is a proxy indicator of basic research, unfortunately is much smaller in Japan than in other countries. Providing sufficient funds may be important to raise the level of such research. On this point, in addition to financial support from the government, it is hoped that the flow of funds from industries to universities will be boosted. Although some statistics show that the proportion of firms providing universities with R&D funds is relatively smaller in Japan than in other countries, Japanese firms have been collaborating with universities by proposing research topics to them. Statistics by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) show that R&D funds in Japan are not at all small compared to other countries. I expect that a further promotion of collaboration among industry, academia, and the government will raise the potential of basic research in Japan into the future, and in turn boost the growth potential of the overall economy.  Cycle of wages and prices I now will move on to the second virtuous cycle. As I said earlier, an increase in corporate profits leads to a rise in wages, enabling firms' selling prices -- that is, general prices -- to rise, which results in a further increase in corporate profits. In order for corporate profits to increase in a sustainable manner, it is important that a virtuous cycle of wages and prices continue to operate.  
9  After the introduction of QQE in 2013, the practice of base pay increases, which had been lost under deflation, has continued for six consecutive years (Chart 12). In this situation, the positive inflation rate has taken hold and Japan's economy already is no longer in deflation. That said, the virtuous cycle of wage increases and price rises still lacks strength. One of the reasons behind this is that, due to the long experience of a severe employment situation under deflation, both labor and management have come to prioritize the stability of long-term employment over wage increases, and this behavior has been deeply entrenched even after wages started rising. The lack of strength in the virtuous cycle also is attributable to the fact that firms have absorbed the upward pressure of costs such as personnel expenses by raising productivity, and only moderately passed on such cost increases to selling prices.  Some of you might think that raising wages and selling prices amid a situation of severe competition is not a viable option. However, realizing an economy where wages and prices rise moderately is beneficial from the viewpoint of corporate management as well. Let me raise two points.  First, given that it is difficult in general to lower the level of nominal wages, if there is some room to reduce the wage growth rate, it will be easier for firms to adjust labor costs in the event of an economic downturn. I mentioned earlier that, in Japan, the stability of employment was prioritized over wage increases under prolonged deflation. However, an empirical analysis suggests that, excluding such an extreme case, it is difficult for firms to lower the level of nominal wages, or in economic terms, there is downward rigidity in nominal wages. Provided that wage growth and inflation are zero in a situation where economic activity neither accelerates nor decelerates, there is no other choice but to cut employment or lower wages in order to adjust labor costs in an economic downturn. However, if wage growth and inflation are sufficiently positive, firms can adjust real labor costs by lowering the wage growth rate. In relation to this, economist James Tobin argued that positive inflation acts as the "grease of the wheels" in the labor market.  Second, aiming at achieving the price stability target of 2 percent as in other advanced economies will lead to stability in foreign exchange rates from a long-term perspective. This is based on the idea of purchasing power parity, whereby the long-term trend of 
10  nominal exchange rates is determined by the difference in inflation compared to other countries. In fact, price differences between Japan and other countries have shrunk with the positive inflation rate taking hold in Japan, and nominal exchange rates have been stable from a long-term perspective. Such stability in foreign exchange rates has contributed to corporate management and the stability of the overall economy.  Thus, moderate rises in wages and prices are beneficial for firms as well. In addition, as I mentioned earlier, in order for corporate profits to increase in a sustainable manner, it is necessary to maintain a virtuous cycle in the overall economy in which prices rise moderately along with wage increases. In fact, the past data suggest that wages and prices generally move in tandem on average, and a rise in only one of them usually does not occur.  Although I said that the virtuous cycle of wage increases and inflation still lacks strength, positive changes have been observed recently (Chart 13). Households' tolerance of price rises has increased, albeit moderately, on the back of improvement in the employment and income situation, as seen in continued base pay rises. Under these circumstances, firms' stance has shifted toward further raising prices. As for the price-setting stance of firms that are closely related to consumption, the output prices DI for consumption-related industries shows that the proportion of enterprises, including small ones, answering that output prices have risen has continued to exceed the proportion of those answering that such prices have fallen, and the gap has been expanding, albeit at a moderate pace.  In an economy where the price stability target of 2 percent has been achieved, if labor productivity rises by around 1 percent, as in Japan's economy at present, the wage growth rate would be around 3 percent; that is, 2 percent inflation plus 1 percent labor productivity. On this point, minimum wages have been raised by around 3 percent for four consecutive years from 2016. I hope that firms' stance will continue to shift toward further raising wages and prices under the favorable economic environment, and that a virtuous cycle of wages and prices will gain further strength.  
11  Conclusion As we are almost out of time, I would like to conclude my speech. Today, I talked in some detail about the challenges to sustaining the virtuous cycle of Japan's economy from the viewpoint of expectations for firms. I also touched on the importance of (1) firms continuing with positive investment, which leads to enhancing productivity, in order to raise the economic growth potential and of (2) making firms' stance shift toward further raising wages and prices to strengthen the virtuous cycle of wages and prices.  Next year, the Olympic and Paralympic Games will be held in Tokyo. The previous Tokyo Games were hosted in 1964, and back then, Japan was full of energy during the period of high economic growth. Looking back on that year, there was a series of historical events that boosted people's confidence, such as joining the OECD in April as well as launching the Tokaido bullet train and hosting the Olympic Games in October. On the other hand, economic expansion that had lasted for two years, dubbed the Olympics boom, had its peak in October 1964 and Japan's economy experienced a downturn for a year thereafter. From this experience, some worry about economic activity from the second half of next year, but there is no need to be too pessimistic. Japan's economy has improved significantly, with the virtuous cycle operating. Corporate activities, which had remained cautious, steadily have become vigorous. The Bank will continue to firmly fulfill its responsibility as a central bank of achieving the price stability target so that Japan's economy will grow in a sustainable manner under the virtuous cycle of the economy.  I would like to close my speech by expressing my sincere hope that the year 2020 will be a wonderful one for all of you.  Thank you for your attention.

Gent Sejko: Enhancing Bank of Albania’s alignment with EU AcquisAddress by Mr Gent Sejko, Governor of the Bank of Albania, at the launching ceremony of theTwinning Project “Enhancing Bank of Albania’s alignment with EU Acquis”, Tirana, 19 December2019.*   *   *Your Excellencies Ambassadors,Representatives of Banca d’Italia and Deutsche Bundesbank,Ladies and gentlemen, Dear guests,I have the pleasure, as the Governor of the Bank of Albania, to welcome you to the launchingceremony of the Twinning Project on “Enhancing Bank of Albania’s alignment with EU Acquis”.The project is financed with IPA 2015 EU funds, following a previous project on needs analysisfor the Bank of Albania – designed and led by the ECB in partnership with 11 central banks of theEuropean System of Central Banks. From this perspective, the new twinning project we arelaunching today may be considered a continuation of the previous one, given that it will address asignificant number of recommendations from 2014.Hoping that in the spring of 2020 we will see a green light for the opening of accessionnegotiations for Albania, I would like to reassure you of Bank of Albania’s commitment to fulfillingpriorities arising from the European integration process. Major objectives for strengthening thelong-term capacities of the institution coincide with the approximation of its legal, regulatory andoperational frameworks to that of the European System of Central Banks. I would like toemphasise that undertaking such projects emphasises the mutual engagement of the EU andAlbania with regard to deepening integration processes of our country, and reiterates Albania’sEuropean perspective.  Dear ladies and gentlemen,In the last decade, Bank of Albania has implemented a number of EU-funded projects.  The firsttwinning project was implemented during 2012 – 2013. At that time, like now, Banca d’Italia – inpartnership with Banque de France – contributed successfully to achieving concrete results insix areas of Bank of Albania’s activity.The second project – needs analysis for Bank of Albania’s approximation, funded by the EU –was led by the European Central Bank and was implemented during 2014. The aim of the six-month project was to assess the legal, regulatory and operational frameworks of the Bank ofAlbania vis-à-vis standards and best practices applied in European central banks. From thisperspective, it should be underlined that the recommendations left upon the completion of thisproject are incorporated in the list of main priorities for Bank of Albania’s institutionalapproximation to the model applied in the European System of Central Banks. In addition, in light of addressing these priorities, the European Commission decided to allocateEUR 800 000 as under IPA 2015. After a long process of consultations and sharing information,for the first time, Bank of Albania’s experts put together a Twinning Project, which was submittedto the European Union Delegation to Albania. At the end of the process, Banca d’Italia andDeutsche Bundesbank were selected to implement Bank of Albania’s project. Banque de Franceand National Bank of Romania are also part of the team for certain components of the project.We feel privileged, certainly, by this close partnership with these two major central banks.Relations with these two institutions date back to quite early in the history of the Bank of Albania. 1 / 2BIS central bankers' speeches
Whether multilaterally or bilaterally, they have assisted for many years the Bank of Albaniaachieve its objectives and operate like a modern and reliable institution. I am therefore optimisticabout the success of this next project, irrespective of the relatively tight agenda and deadlines.Now, let me briefly introduce you to the main components of this project. It will involve eightdepartments at the Bank of Albania and will address important issues, grouped as follows:1. Banking Supervision and Financial Stability2. Monetary Policy and Statistics3. Internal Audit4. Payment Systems5. Other central banking functions such as human resources and European integrationFor each component, measurable results have been envisaged, which will be translated intoregulatory documents, guidelines and specific recommendations related to policies. Alloutcomes will aim to approximate the final product at a higher level to standards and models ofthe European System of Central Banks.Dear ladies and gentlemen,I hope that this project will deliver long-term results, and will strengthen the regulatory andoperational frameworks at the Bank of Albania, an institution that makes substantial contributionto the sustainable economic development of Albania.On behalf of the Bank of Albania, let me iterate our readiness and commitment for the successfulimplementation of the Twinning Project, as we strive with professionalism and responsibility toachieve its objectives.Concluding, I would like to thank the European Commission, for its support in securing fundingfor this project. I am certain that the Commission will continue to support future initiatives of theBank of Albania, as we deal with approximation challenges and endeavour to progress towardthe European family.I would also like to thank the EU Delegation to Albania for their support and valuable suggestionsduring the design and consultation phases of the project, as well as the General Directorate forFinancing and Contracting, for their insistence throughout the design and selection process forcompliance with all EU procedures related to fund management.Special thanks go to Banca d’Italia, an institution that has constantly supported us with theirinvaluable experience. I believe that the experience and dedication of Mr Gola is an addedguarantee in this regard.We are grateful to Bundesbank for their active participation in this project – as well as in theirspecific role in the regional project on “Strengthening the Central Bank Capacities in the WesternBalkans with a view to the Integration to the European System of Central Banks”. We would alsolike to thank National Bank of Romania and Banque de France for their involvement in thisproject.Last but not the least, I would like to thank staff members of the Bank of Albania intensivelyengaged in the design and implementation of the project. I do believe that, as with previousexperiences, this project will be implemented and finalised successfully, contributing to theadvancement of capacities in our institution.Thank You!  2 / 2BIS central bankers' speeches
Cleviston Haynes: Launch of “Both Sides of the Coin: The Story ofthe Central Bank of Barbados 1972-2017”Welcome remarks by Mr Cleviston Haynes, Governor of the Central Bank of Barbados, at theLaunch of “Both Sides of the Coin: The Story of the Central Bank of Barbados 1972-2017”,Bridgtown, 6 December 2019.*   *   *Ladies and gentlemen.I have titled my remarks “Why Write Our History?”One of the early decisions I took as Governor was to approve the continuation of work on thispublication. I did so because I believed then and now that it is important to tell the story of thisBank. I did so also because the author, my friend and former colleague, Harold Codrington, hadtoiled long in the vineyard in a labour of love to document the history of an organisation which,former Prime Minister Owen Arthur, on the occasion of the Bank’s 25th Anniversary, describedas “the Barbadian institution of the 20 Century”.Harold’s career as a central banker and my own were intertwined, spanning over 35 years.  Formuch of that time our careers moved in parallel until finally, he received the reward of retirement. My reward is coming.Through these years he was an accomplished research economist who served in severalcapacities, benefitted from countless experiences, worked on several major economic andfinancial projects and held many senior responsibilities. He was blessed with an encyclopaedicmemory, maintained a filing system for important documents, and engendered the confidence ofthose with whom he worked. In short, he was a valued resource for the organisation and hadeven before this publication become the historian within the Bank. These attributes have enabled him to produce a publication that is a compelling humanistic storyof how the Bank has evolved over more than four decades and how the Bank’s employees havecontributed to the economic, social, and financial fabric of Barbados. The story of many of mycolleagues and first generation of central bankers are interwoven in Both Sides of the Coin. Itcaptures not only our critical work in our core business but also how active we were indeveloping the arts, engaging in public outreach, and uplifting our communities. It reflects therecognition of our founding fathers that a central bank in a developing economy must supportnation building. Hence the title of the book, Both Sides of the Coin. By telling the story, we record a significant portion of Barbados’ post-Independence economichistory. The author traces our contribution to Barbados’ economic diversification, in particular,our leadership in supporting the establishment of, and later defending, our international financialservices sector, highlights our support for businesses through the credit guarantee schemes anddetails the decisions on the creation of our currency.He reflects on the implementation and long-term maintenance of our fixed exchange rate andshares the factors that underpin our economic growth. Our oversight function in exchangecontrol matters, the value of our research and our advice to government, and, of course, ourmany social and cultural programmes also feature prominently in the work. Our contribution on the world stage does not go unnoticed. The book refers to the many staffwho worked at or with international organizations. In her recollections, former Governor, Dr.Marion Williams, recalls candidly her experience in defending Barbados and other small islandsin the international arena on significant issues that posed severe threats to our very survival.Together, these revelations show how we represented our country beyond these shores.th 1 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
We would not have made such an indelible mark at home and abroad without the hard work anddedication of our staff and leaders, and I would wish to pay tribute to all central bankers whobrought us to this stage in our history. Many of them, we feature in the work. Specialcommendations as well to our leaders: Sir Courtney Blackman, the late Dr. Kurleigh King, Mr.Calvin Springer, Mr. Winston Cox, Dr. Marion Williams, and Dr. DeLisle Worrell. They all broughtdifferent leadership styles to manage the Bank but had one goal in mind: creating andmaintaining an institution of world-class excellence. Harold captures their contributions, and theyall tell a story of creating an exemplary institution, that promoted strong leadership, producedexcellent output, nurtured talented staff, and built a resilient economy and society. Theirrecollections are very insightful, and they reveal the heart, soul and conscience of who we are. We learn a lot from their experiences.Writing a book is not an easy task, as Harold admits in the preface. Authors must research,conceptualise, brainstorm, draft and redraft, edit, agonise about the completeness and accuracyof their story, and withstand the judgements of their critics. Harold, you’ll hear soon the critiquesof your readers. I thank you for your commitment to telling our story and chronicling our first 45years of existence between 1972 and 2017.  I also thank your family for the many sacrifices they endured while you penned this history. Youhighlight that your wife, Dolores, nudged, encouraged, and pushed you to cross the finishing line.Dolores, we thank you for your support, and for sharing Harold’s and the Bank’s vision to publishthis history. I thank the reviewers, commentators, critics, editors, and endorsers, and everyone who lent theirtime and talent to this publication. We remain forever in your debt. So, I pose the question again: Why did we write this book? I have already shown how itshowcases our contribution to national development. But it also chronicles our growth frominfancy, to teenaged years, to adulthood into middle age. In the author’s words: the book tells ofour establishment, consolidation, maturity, and modernization; it reveals our purpose andmission, it educates and informs. By tracing our journey from the beginning, we are alsopreserving the institutional knowledge of the first generation of central bankers, many of whomare retired or about to retire. The experiences of this first generation and the information on ournear fifty- year journey should inspire the next generation of central bankers.Let me hasten to add that Both Sides of the Coin is an unvarnished chronicle. The authorcaptures our highs and lows, our achievements and failures, our weaknesses and strengths andour public spats and celebrations. From the robust and contentious Parliamentary debate thatpreceded our formation, to the public sparring with labour, the dispute over the building of ourhome, to the untimely and unprecedented firing of our fourth Governor, Harold reveals it.I commend Both Sides of the Coin to every Barbadian who wishes to understand the role,mission, vision, and values of their central Bank.As we approach our 50 birthday in 2022, we know that the changing economic and financiallandscape at home and abroad will transform the face of central banking. This transformationincludes the evolution of digital currencies, further liberalization of our exchange controls,strengthened regional integration, digital transformation, the emergence of new industries, localand international challenges, and different societal norms. The impact of environmentaldegradation on our people and their livelihoods and the reforms of economic and financialmanagement will also influence what central banks do.Change is inevitable even in central banking, but may the enduring principles of excellence, hardwork, commitment, collaboration, and contribution to national development – the cornerstones ofthis institution – forever live on. This publication is a useful reminder to our successors of thesecritical tenets that underpin the creation of an institution of excellence. th 2 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
The late United States President Theodore Roosevelt once said: “The more you know about thepast, the better prepared you are for the future. “This observation is a universal truth, and BothSides of the Coin helps us and future generations to understand the past forty-five years of theCentral Bank of Barbados: its work, its mission, its vision, its journey and its people, like many ofyou and me. That perspective is, in a nutshell, why we wrote this book.Please enjoy the rest of the evening and get yourself a copy.I thank you. 3 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches

Not for publication before 08:00 Eastern Time      Remarks by Timothy Lane  Deputy Governor of the Bank of Canada Ottawa Board of Trade December 5, 2019 Ottawa, Ontario     Economic Progress Report: Charting Our Own Course   Introduction Good morning. It is a pleasure to be here to share my thoughts about the Canadian economy and discuss the decision we announced yesterday to hold interest rates steady. I’d like to thank the Ottawa Board of Trade for the invitation. It is news to no one that we are living in unsettled times. The world economy continues to be buffeted by trade conflict, and relations between the United States and China are on a roller coaster.  This enduring uncertainty has already done some damage. Global growth has suffered. Because Canada is an open economy dependent on trade, our economy has suffered as well. Commodity prices, which affect a big part of our economy, have weakened over most of the year. Business investment has been weighed down, and our exports have suffered because of softer global demand. But Canada also has notable strengths, and inflation remains on target. Our strong labour market points to sources of growth, such as computer system design and other professional services, education, health care and financial services. It is because of this strength amid the turmoil that we say Canada is resilient, although it is not immune. This resilience has helped the Bank of Canada chart its own course in monetary policy. Many people wonder why we have held our key policy rate steady over the past year while many other central banks have lowered their rates. The comparison between Canada and the United States is front of mind. In 2019, the US Federal Reserve cut its rate three times, partly as insurance against the negative effects of the global environment. In Canada, we’ve kept our policy rate unchanged since October 2018. That divergence is not as stark as it’s sometimes portrayed: when all is said and done, by this October the Bank of Canada and the Fed ended up with the same policy rate. But it is sometimes 
 - 2 - believed we must do whatever the Fed does because our economy is so closely tied to that of our largest trading partner. With that in mind, I’d like to take this opportunity to explain the path we’ve taken, not only in terms of yesterday’s decision but also more generally. In my remarks, I will look back on these separate paths that Canada and the United States have followed over the past several years. I will then review the current situation and explain the rationale behind our policy interest rate decision yesterday.   Long and winding roads It’s now been more than a decade since the global financial crisis and the onset of the Great Recession worldwide. That makes this a good time to briefly review this history because it helps us understand where we are now.  Policy interest rates in Canada and the United States have followed distinct tracks over the past 10 years, reflecting different macroeconomic forces.   Chart 1: Policy rates in Canada and the United States have followed different tracks over the past 10 years   01234562007200820092010201120122013201420152016201720182019%CanadaUnited StatesLast observation: November 29, 2019Sources: Federal Reserve Board via Haver Analytics and Bank of Canadaa.

 - 3 -   Notably, the global financial crisis played out differently in the two countries. Going back to 2009, the recessions in Canada and the United States were about equally severe in terms of output loss, but for different reasons. The United States experienced a home-grown financial crisis in which some major financial institutions failed and many others were threatened. Canada’s financial system was comparatively sound, but exports and commodity prices collapsed. Both countries responded to their respective shocks by cutting interest rates as far as they thought possible at the time. In addition, the Fed resorted to a large suite of unconventional monetary policies. In Canada, we reinforced the low interest rate using forward guidance—what we called the “conditional commitment” to keep our policy rate at the floor for at least another year unless inflation picked up. But we went no further. In both countries—as in much of the world—fiscal policy gave a major boost to demand during the recession. After the rate cuts, Canada bounced back quickly. Exports and investment rebounded, in part reflecting higher commodity prices. The United States had a slower recovery. The Bank of Canada raised rates by 75 basis points to 1 percent in 2010. The Fed held rates near zero for more than five years. Starting in 2010, as the recovery appeared to be underway, most major economies began a course of fiscal consolidation. In Canada, the government took steps to move the federal budget toward balance. The United States implemented a policy of automatic spending cuts triggered by US budget law, known as sequestration. With the benefit of hindsight, those moves toward balanced budgets proved to be premature. The world was in for several more years of lacklustre growth.    -2-10122007200820092010201120122013201420152016201720182019Percentage pointsLast observation: November 29, 2019Sources: Federal Reserve Board via Haver Analytics and Bank of Canadab.

 - 4 - Chart 2: The Canadian economy bounced back faster after the Great Recession   Competitiveness challenges facing Canadian exports also dampened business investment in the non-energy sector. As Canada’s economy continued to fall short of its potential, the Bank of Canada kept the policy rate at 1 percent. Meanwhile, the US economy turned around, and in 2013 the Fed hinted at tapering its purchase of financial assets.  Between 2014 and 2016, Canada had a major setback with the collapse in the prices of oil and other commodities. We had a technical recession—two consecutive quarters of negative growth—in 2015. The Bank of Canada cushioned the blow by cutting policy rates twice, to 50 basis points. The Canadian dollar depreciated by more than 20 percent against the US dollar. That facilitated the adjustment to lower commodity prices. In addition, the federal government introduced measures, including the Child Tax Benefit, that added fiscal stimulus to the economy. In contrast, as US growth continued, the Fed began to slowly normalize policy rates. Reflecting the more favourable US economic situation, the US dollar appreciated. During this period, inflation ran below target in both countries. During 2017–18, economies worldwide expanded largely in sync. A major fiscal boost in the United States pushed that economy above potential. Canada’s economy reached close to potential, and our core inflation measures reached target and stayed there. This expansion allowed both the Bank of Canada and the Fed to raise rates toward what is viewed as a neutral range. Still, Canada remained slightly behind on the rate normalization, given the earlier setbacks to the economy. 9510010511011512020072008200920102011201220132014IndexCanadaUnited StatesReal GDP, index: 2009Q2 = 100, quarterly dataLast observation: 2014Q4Sources: Bureau of Economic Analysis via Haver Analytics, Statistics Canada and Bank of Canada calculations
 - 5 - At this point, it is useful to note another major difference between the two economies. The US housing bubble had burst in 2007–08, but Canada’s housing market and mortgage debt continued to build in the decade after the global financial crisis. Canadians borrowed heavily, and average house prices rose to levels that were high by any metric. This was at least partly the legacy of low interest rates, in a setting where households had room to borrow and commercial banks remained very well-capitalized. These factors create vulnerabilities that could amplify any negative shock to the economy.  Chart 3: Household debt as a share of income has continued to increase in Canada, in contrast to the United States, where it has fallen   Between 2016 and 2018, a combination of policy measures affecting the housing market were introduced. In addition to higher interest rates, macroprudential measures—including the B-20 stress test—tightened mortgage lending. In a bid to counter speculation, provincial and municipal governments targeted taxes at non-resident investors. These measures led to moderation of the housing market in many parts of Canada and to a drop in house prices in the most overheated markets. Starting in late 2018, the Canadian economy slowed once again. The cooling housing market and adjustments in the energy sector related to transportation capacity constraints and associated curtailments weighed on growth. Weak business investment and exports in the sector contributed to the slowdown. Trade conflicts were also a headwind. As an open economy, Canada is hurt by the weaker foreign demand and lower commodity prices that come from trade conflicts. The United States is less dependent on trade but, as the conflict has escalated, has increasingly had the added drag of tariffs. Both countries—and 8010012014016018020002001200220032004200520062007200820092010201120122013201420152016201720182019IndexRatio in Canada adjusted to US conceptsRatio in the United StatesIndex: 2000Q1 = 100, quarterly dataLast observation: 2019Q2Sources: Federal Reserve Board via Haver Analytics, Statistics Canada and Bank of Canada calculations
 - 6 - indeed, the whole world—were adversely affected by the uncertainties around trade conflicts. On the monetary policy front, US inflation has been below target. The Fed has cut interest rates three times during 2019. In contrast, the Bank of Canada has not cut rates. In part, this is because inflation and its outlook remain on target, and also because our policy rate was lower to begin with. Moreover, because Canada already has high levels of household debt, lowering rates further could make those vulnerabilities worse and amplify future shocks. In sum, there is no reason for the Bank of Canada to move in step with the Fed. On the contrary, the experience of the past decade shows that Canada and the United States have followed different roads, reflecting differences in our economic conditions. Canada does share many of the same macro fundamentals as the United States. For long periods, the two economies are highly correlated, so monetary policy can be very similar in those periods. But Canada is a more open economy, with greater dependence on natural resource industries. For that reason, we are more exposed to world events, both directly through demand for our exports and indirectly through commodity prices. As a result, there have been extended periods when our monetary policies have diverged. It is also because of these differences that Canada benefits from a flexible exchange rate.

 - 7 - Globally, economic growth has slowed significantly over the course of this year, and it appears to be levelling off. The Bank still expects that it will edge higher again in the period ahead.  The global slowdown partly reflects the fact that the US economy was boosted by fiscal stimulus that has since been winding down. It also reflects a rebalancing of the Chinese economy as authorities address high levels of corporate and municipal debt. Against this backdrop, the global trade conflict has had a meaningful negative effect on world trade and on business confidence and investment. The damaging effects of trade conflict are only partly offset by easier monetary policy. Since our last full forecast presented in our October Monetary Policy Report (MPR), the trade news has been mixed. The Canada-US-Mexico trade agreement appears to be close to ratification. For most of the period, headlines have suggested progress in the trade conflict between the United States and China, although there continue to be many twists and turns. Financial markets, already strongly supported by central bank actions, have been reacting to trade news. Stock prices have moved close to record levels, some credit spreads have narrowed, and market volatility has been low. At the same time, uncertainty is likely to persist even if a deal is reached between the United States and China. And that uncertainty is likely to have a lasting effect. Although a global recession is not in our baseline forecast, questions remain about whether market pricing fully reflects the risks inherent in the current global situation. Commodity prices have been comparatively stable in the recent period. In this context, the Canadian dollar has also been quite stable, keeping within a narrow range. Turning to Canada, the Bank has been forecasting slower economic growth in the second half of 2019 after a very strong second quarter. That is indeed how the data are coming in. Economic growth in the third quarter was 1.3 percent, as projected in the October MPR.  Underlying this slowdown in overall GDP growth was an outright decline in exports. This has been driven by global weakness and trade uncertainty and by a reversal of temporary factors that had previously boosted growth, in particular for non-energy commodity exports. Furthermore, the pace of inventory accumulation slowed, subtracting significantly from growth. On the positive side, final domestic demand in Canada grew at quite a solid pace. One thing that has surprised us was business investment. We were expecting investment to decline in the second half of this year, but instead we have seen solid growth. Moreover, data have been revised upward, revealing that investment earlier this year was higher than previously reported.  Another area of strength has been housing, which is continuing to rebound. We’ve seen most regions registering gains in resales and housing starts following a period of adjustment after the national and provincial policies had worked their way through. Activity is also being boosted by strong growth in employment and wages, strong immigration and low household borrowing costs, which reflect the decline in global interest rates. House prices have also been rising modestly and household borrowing has been picking up.  
 - 8 - Consumption spending has also been contributing to growth. As we mentioned in October, the strong labour market, particularly in the service sector, has been underpinning the economy. While employment levelled off in October, this comes on the back of past strong gains. Moreover, wages—which could be seen as a barometer of overall labour market conditions—are picking up further. Overall, the data suggest that the labour market is continuing to tighten. Revised historical data also indicate higher disposable incomes and more saving among Canadian households than previously reported. Overall, recent information augurs well for households’ financial situations and their future spending, although consumer confidence has been softening. Government spending is a mixed picture. While it has been supporting growth recently, this support is expected to wane in 2020 as consolidation in Ontario and Alberta takes hold and the recent strength in Quebec and British Columbia normalizes. These dynamics were built into our October projection. On the federal side, the government’s fiscal plans are pending.   The slowing of growth in Canada’s economy has been concentrated in goods-producing industries, which were more heavily affected by the trade conflict and by lower commodity prices. The service sector—which now accounts for about 70 percent of the economy—has continued to show solid growth for some time.  Our overall assessment is that the Canadian economy is near capacity. However, this masks significant regional differences. Oil-producing regions continue to go through a painful adjustment to lower oil prices and transportation capacity constraints, and the labour market in Alberta has been weak. Meanwhile, some other provinces are seeing strong growth in employment and wages. Finally, inflation remains broadly on target, with measures of core inflation holding steady around 2 percent. Total consumer price index inflation was 1.9 percent in October and is expected to fluctuate around 2 percent. The October reading was slightly higher than we anticipated, because of the impact of higher airfares. Inflation is expected to rise temporarily above 2 percent in the coming months, reflecting the impact of weak gasoline prices a year earlier. CPI inflation should then return to target.

Overall, the tone of developments in recent weeks gives us more confidence in the outlook for growth and inflation that we set out back in October.

 - 10 - In our discussion, we noted some initial signs that global economic growth is beginning to level off, as expected. In particular, we noted a recent improvement in global business investment and trade as well as stabilization in manufacturing purchasing managers’ indexes. We continue to expect that global growth will edge higher over the next couple of years. We noted that central bank actions have been supporting financial markets and that prices in many markets have been reflecting an easing of concerns about the possibility of a global recession. However, it is clear that trade conflicts remain the biggest risk to the Canadian and global economies and the related uncertainty is continuing to dampen exports and growth. We also noted that the Canadian dollar has been relatively stable. Turning to Canada, recent data show that the economy slowed sharply in the third quarter, but they also support our forecast that this slowdown will be temporary. Governing Council talked about the surprising strength of investment in the quarter. The Bank will need to assess the extent to which this strength is likely to be maintained as well as the implications for both economic growth and potential output. We also discussed the strong housing markets and moderate consumer spending seen during the third quarter. At the same time, consumer credit growth has picked up. Given these developments, we will continue to monitor how financial vulnerabilities evolve in the context of regulatory changes designed to keep riskier lending in check. Looking ahead, our interest rate decisions will be guided by our continuing assessment of the economic impact of trade conflicts. We will also be watching the sources of resilience in the Canadian economy—notably consumer spending and housing activity. And we will take into account developments in fiscal policy as we prepare to update our outlook in January. 
Benjamin E Diokno: Launch of the new 20-Piso and enhanced 5-Piso NGC coinsSpeech by Mr Benjamin E Diokno, Governor of Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP, the centralbank of the Philippines), at the launch of the new 20-Piso and enhanced 5-Piso NGC coins,Manila, 17 December 2019.*   *   *To the Members of the Monetary Board, BSP Officers, and our friends from the media, goodmorning.We received great news last October when the International Association of Currency Affairs orIACA recognized the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas for Excellence in the Currency 2019 CoinAwards at the biennial Coin Conference in Rome, Italy. Established in 2007, the IACA’sExcellence in Currency Awards Program promotes and recognizes excellence in currencyproduction, processing, management, and distribution.As we recall, the BSP’s New Generation Currency (NGC) Coin Series—which includes the 10-Piso, 5-Piso, 1-Piso, 25-Sentimo, 5-Sentimo and 1-Sentimo—was released in circulation startingin March 2018. This NGC Coin Series and the Coin Education Campaign were among the topthree finalists awarded in the Best New Circulating Coins and Best Public Education Programcategories, respectively.During the awards ceremony, the IACA cited the enhanced aesthetic, cutting-edge securityfeatures, and improved wear and corrosion resistance of the NGC coins.On the other hand, our Coin Education Campaign earned praises for utilizing variouscommunication channels such as nationwide briefings, television, radio and social media, whichemphasized that these NGC coins are “Matibay”, “Maganda”, at “Mahalaga.”The BSP is honored to be among the best in the world in coin design and production, and toreceive a distinction for the education program that came with the successful issuance andcirculation of these coins.Aside from the economic value as payment for goods and services, coins play a significant rolein a nation’s history, often paying homage to Filipinos with outstanding accomplisgments orworthy of emulation, celebrating momentous events, and promoting with pride the country’shistorical sites or natural wonders. Coins also reflect a country’s cultures and traditions, and arepowerful tools of communication and identification as a nation. Today, the BSP is proud to present the new 20-Piso coin which will now be the highestdenomination in the New Generation Currency Coin Series.Prominently featured on the obverse of the 20-Piso coin is Manuel L. Quezon, the first presidentof the Philippine Commonwealth who advocated the adoption of the national language; createdthe National Economic Council, the precursor of the National Economic Development Authority;and worked passionately to regain Philippine independence. The reverse side features the BSP logo and the Malacañan Palace, the official residence of thePresident of the Philippines. Consistent with the theme of the NGC Coin Series, a native flora isfeatured in the 20-Piso coin—the Nilad, which is believed to be the origin of the name of thecountry’s capital city, Manila. It should also be mentioned that President Quezon is the firstPhilippine president to reside in this proud and iconic Palace.These design elements put emphasis on the cultural and historical significance of coins to 1 / 2BIS central bankers' speeches
Philippine society. Moreover, the design of this bi-color 20-Piso NGC coin makes it easilydistinguishable and highly secure.The BSP is also introducing today the enhanced 5-Piso NGC coin with nine sides to make itmore distinct from other denominations in the NGC Coin Series. This reaffirms BSP’scommitment to not only uphold the highest standard of excellence, but also listen to the public’sobservations as it endeavors to bring central banking closer to the people.Maraming salamat and mabuhay! 2 / 2BIS central bankers' speeches
   Honourable Ambassador Apostolova, Dear Minister Hamza, Dear Mr. Taylor, Distinguished representatives of local and international institutions, Dear participants,      It is my pleasure to participate in the presentation of the "Transition Report for 2019" which also marks the 12th anniversary of the Republic of Kosovo's membership in the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Of particular importance is the fact that this year's report on the focus has the topic of corporate governance, for which CBK has demonstrated leadership beyond its mandate, where in the role of Regulator and Supervisor of Financial Institutions in the Republic of Kosovo it has advanced the requirements for better corporate governance   Let me first share with you some views on the importance that corporate governance has for the financial sector and the economy in general. Finance in general and banking in particular relate simply to credibility, this is especially evident in countries with not long experience with financial products, institutions and developed financial markets.   The last financial crisis showed that one of the main causes of the crisis could be attributed to weaknesses in corporate governance. Many studies done so far, confirm the strong correlation of corporate governance with the performance of these banks during the financial crisis.    Now, more than a decade after the last financial crisis, Kosovo's financial sector has been able to overcome without problems some of the challenges that other countries faced. However, we have used this moment to continue building an even more stable financial environment, the pillar of which are the best principles and standards of corporate governance. Our message to the financial sector has been very clear: besides the need for greater clarity in the organizational structure, sharing of responsibilities and increasing professional competence, a new way of thinking by their boards, is needed, with a particular focus on: 
  - Increasing the collective capacity to identify risks; - Focus on the long-term economic viability of financial institutions; - Adopting a corporate governance model that adds value built on the effective organization mechanisms of a financial institution (ie, culture, business model, size, organizational needs, etc.), and - Above all, the adopting of a model that ensures transparency, impartiality and equal treatment of all stakeholders (shareholders, customers and employees).  The Central Bank of the Republic of Kosovo enjoys functional, financial and operational independence and as such adapts a modern corporate governance not only to the internal organization but also to the regulatory requirements we have in relation to the financial institutions we supervise. This independence CBK demonstrates with strong accountability and transparency as a mechanism of particular importance for sound corporate governance.  You have recently witnessed some decisions taken by the CBK in relation to financial institutions that have jeopardized the stability of the financial sector in Kosovo and have not complied with legal requirements. This speaks for the Central Bank's determination to exercise its constitutional mandate and to be governed by the best corporate governance rules and standards. We will continue to remain steadfast in our actions to provide the Kosovo economy with financial institutions and funding sources that suits to the development needs and stability of the economy.   As I noted above, the CBK's commitment to advancing the Corporate Governance agenda in Kosovo is multi-dimensional. Operating based on a modern corporate governance has enabled us to successfully develop the corporate governance legal framework for financial institutions in Kosovo as well. The requirements for advanced corporate governance that came out from this framework have not only influenced the implementation of sound models of governance by financial institutions, but also the same to transfer to the private sector through companies they have funded seeking mechanisms for better risk management, internal controls, disclosure and transparency.  The Central Bank has also played a critical role in installing modern corporate governance mechanisms in two institutions of particular importance to the Kosovo economy; Deposit Insurance Fund of Kosovo and Kosovo Credit Guarantee Fund ”, said Governor Mehmeti.  In this two-decade journey, the Central Bank and other local institutions in Kosovo have enjoyed the privilege of being supported and advised by many international financial institutions, including the IMF, USAID, US Treasury, World Bank, KFW , GIZ, EBRD and others.  In particular, the special contribution in the field of corporate governance in Kosovo has our host today, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, not only being an active investor in the private and financial sectors, but also helping stakeholders in these two sectors 
and other institutions with technical assistance to advance corporate governance practices in highly qualitative manner.   The EBRD's commitment in this regard is also demonstrated by the recent publication of the Transition Report, entitled "Good Governance for a Better Economy". This report highlights the fact that Kosovo has advanced more than other countries in terms of corporate governance, however I estimate that we have not yet managed to integrate good corporate governance deeply and with institutional inclusiveness. Therefore, we need to keep all our efforts focused in this direction, in order to position Kosovo at a competitive level in regional and European markets, and only then will Kosovo be able to present its economy in a growth cycle of productivity and accelerated economic growth.  Let me conclude this speech with the premise of trust on which the financial sector operates. Consequently, to gain credibility in the financial market must have credible institutions, which in essence institutions are the people who build and manage them. Therefore, active shareholders, effective boards, adequate management, responsible customers (borrowers and depositors) and sound institutions are the key factors of quality corporate governance.  In the end, I would like to congratulate the EBRD for an excellent report that in fact reminds us, above all, of the challenges that await us in our journey towards further development.  Thank you!    
SPEECHMonetary policy: lifting the veil of effectivenessSpeech by Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the ECB colloquium on“Monetary policy: the challenges ahead” held in his honourFrankfurt am Main, 18 December 2019In a few days, I will leave the ECB after eight years of unprecedented challenges for the integrity andstability of our single currency, the euro.[1] Throughout these years, the ECB’s resolve and steadiness havebeen the cornerstone of Europe’s crisis response and economic recovery.I feel grateful and humbled to have been given a chance to be part of this effort.I would like to thank former President Mario Draghi, my Executive Board and Governing Councilcolleagues, and the staff of this great institution for their friendship and trust. And I would like to wish IsabelSchnabel and Fabio Panetta the best of luck.The starting point for my remarks this morning is people’s sense of frustration and their criticism of centralbanks for failing to deliver inflation consistent with their aim.This criticism has taken different forms in society.Professional observers and financial market participants often criticise the inadequate size of our actionsand question the effectiveness of our instruments.Private citizens criticise the type of instruments we use – in particular asset purchases and negativeinterest rates – and the side effects they associate with them.The use of these instruments has caused persistent mistrust. While three in four euro area citizens thinkthe single currency is good for the European Union and two in three think it is good for their country, lessthan half of citizens trust the ECB.[2]In my remarks this morning, I would like to make two points that speak to these concerns.The first is that there is no contradiction between inflation being low and monetary policy being effective.Central banks have achieved great success in recent years. Their achievements, however, and this will bemy second point, are of little avail if the public does not recognise or understand them.I will argue that this “veil of effectiveness” creates enormous challenges for the credibility and acceptanceof central banks – challenges which can only be overcome by revisiting the appropriateness of four keycomponents at the heart of our current monetary policy frameworks: how we define price stability, how wemeasure inflation, how we evaluate the credibility of our intentions and the range of counterparts throughwhich we implement monetary policy.Low inflation and the effectiveness of monetary policyMy first point – how to square low inflation with policy effectiveness – centres on two separate questions.   !"#$18.12.19, 15:52Seite 1 von 8
How should we, the central banking community, evaluate the effectiveness of our own actions? And why,despite years of extraordinary policy support, is inflation remaining stubbornly low?Evaluating our own actions is surprisingly difficult.There is no handbook, no checklist that we can use to consistently grade our actions. Ultimately, of course,there can only be one yardstick to measure central bank effectiveness: our track record in deliveringinflation consistent with our aim.But does inflation failing to converge to our aim mechanically imply that our actions have not beeneffective?My answer is a clear “no”.Despite unprecedented challenges to monetary policy implementation, central banks have succeeded indelivering financial and monetary conditions that are exceptionally supportive of real economic activity.Many euro area firms can currently borrow in financial markets at negative rates. Bank lending rates, alsofor small and medium-sized firms, are currently at, or close to, historical lows, with little dispersion acrossmajor economies.Firms have responded to these incentives as economic theory would predict.Over the past five years, real investment has expanded at a faster pace than in the five years precedingthe global financial crisis. This is no small achievement considering the persistent uncertainty that hasweighed on sentiment in recent years.Investment, in turn, has boosted job creation. Employment is up by 7% compared with mid-2014. And inmany euro area countries wages are growing at the fastest pace in many years.All in all, ECB staff estimates show that, without our policy actions, euro area real GDP would have beenup to 2.7 percentage points lower at the end of last year, and inflation would have been up to half apercentage point lower every year over the past four years.[3]Explaining low inflationSuch counterfactuals – based on a wide range of models – are important proof that policy has beeneffective along the full chain of transmission – from financial market prices to economic activity and fromthe real side to the nominal side.For everything we know about how policy propagates through the economy, inflation today would besignificantly weaker in the absence of our actions, maybe even dangerously close to deflation.But such counterfactuals are far too complex to lend true credibility to our actions outside of our narrowcircle.They still raise the question as to why policy support has failed to promote a more robust convergence ofinflation to levels that would allow a normalisation of policy – that would allow graduating the instrumentsthat have caused mistrust and concern.There are two broad hypotheses for why this might be the case.The first is that policy has been wrongly calibrated – that is, slack is larger than widely assumed, andpolicy should be even more accommodative.True, the output gap is an elusive concept that should never have become a gauge for conducting publicpolicy, and it may be larger than thought.[4]And broader measures of unemployment that include, for example, involuntary part-time work remain wellabove headline unemployment.But these measures are now no longer higher than they were before the crisis.I would also dismiss the assertion that the relationship between output and inflation has broken down. Aplethora of empirical studies prove that the Phillips curve is alive and well.[5]18.12.19, 15:52Seite 2 von 8
The second, and in my view more plausible, explanation is that the Phillips curve has shifted inward overtime – that is, inflation today may be lower at every level of the output gap.Such shifts typically relate to persistent and slow-moving changes on the supply side of our economies,where monetary policy has less traction. As such, they are difficult to detect, and even more difficult toprove, in particular when they coincide with weak aggregate demand.But collectively their impact on wage and price inflation is difficult to dismiss.[6]Just consider the structural changes in global energy markets where the shale oil revolution has effectivelyput a ceiling on oil prices by increasing the responsiveness of oil supply to demand shocks.[7]Think of the secular decline in wage bargaining power that contributed to a significant part of recentproductivity gains no longer being distributed to labour, with adverse consequences for real disposableincomes, consumption growth and, ultimately, inflation.[8]Or consider the salient impact of digitalisation on the pricing power of brick and mortar firms, which mayhave contributed, at least in part, to the recent decline in the pass-through of higher wage costs toconsumer prices.[9]Add to these shocks the effects of ageing, the rise of services and the broader effects of globalisation andit is hard not to conclude that the combination of these shocks is likely to have put a lid on inflation inrecent years, and that these shocks are likely to constrain price pressure also in the near future.[10]None of this is necessarily bad news.Many of these shocks are in fact benign, in the sense that they have the potential to ultimately liftproductivity and real wages and pave the way to a low-carbon economy. Central banks clearly need tostep up their research and modelling capacities to understand their joint impact.[11]But until this happens – and the pace will depend a lot on our broader economic policy framework, which Iwon’t discuss this morning[12] – central banks are likely to have to navigate in a low-growth, low-inflationenvironment with the risk of repeatedly failing to deliver inflation in line with their aim.Monetary policy in a low-inflation environmentWhat, then, can, or should, central banks do in this environment?Let me propose four elements for future reflection: how we define price stability, how we treat inflationexpectations, how we measure inflation and how we implement monetary policy.Some proposals are more far-reaching than others.But all share one aim: to bring monetary policy closer to the people – to dismantle the veil of effectivenessand to foster acceptance of policies and instruments that too often are used as scapegoat forshortcomings and deficiencies elsewhere in our public policy apparatus.Rethinking the definition of price stabilityConsider first the ECB’s definition of price stability as inflation rates of “below, but close to, 2%”.A simple answer to the current challenges would be to lower the inflation aim.If my dissection of the current inflation drivers is vaguely on the right track, then it is clear that this strategywould be wrong on many levels.It would misjudge the current low-inflation episode as permanent and thereby dismiss the lessons ofhistory on the slow pace of diffusion of new technologies.[13] It would create perilous time-consistencychallenges for central banks when inflation eventually transitions to the new steady state.And it would shift a disproportionate share of the macroeconomic adjustment burden onto workers as,even more so than today, shocks to euro area economies would have to be accommodated by loweringnominal wages. Not the best way to foster support for Europe and its single currency!18.12.19, 15:52Seite 3 von 8
Raising the aim is similarly misguided. Why raise an aim that you have failed to achieve in the first place?I come at this debate from a different angle.If we communicate that we aim to maintain inflation at, say, 1.9%, then we should not be surprised if thepublic expects us to control inflation up to the first decimal point.It significantly raises the bar for maintaining the credibility of monetary policy, particularly given how littlethe public actually knows about inflation and monetary policy.[14]We need to dismantle the absurd idea of an omnipotent central bank that can mechanically steer inflation.The ECB should clarify that it aims to deliver inflation of 2% over the medium term.And it could communicate the range of inflation outcomes that can be considered acceptable in normaltimes.Such a tolerance band, which can be more or less precise, is not an invitation for inaction or complacency.Research shows that central banks have a strong incentive to already respond to inflation deviations withinthe tolerance zone, rather than waiting until inflation has crossed the edges.[15] And there is no convincingevidence that a tolerance band weakens the anchoring role of a midpoint.[16]It rather recognises the large and inherent uncertainty surrounding price and wage decisions, conveys thisuncertainty to the general public and its elected representatives and establishes consistency with themedium-term horizon of the ECB’s strategy.For this change to be effective, however, two elements are critical.First, the ECB would need to do more to communicate the midpoint to the broader public. A recent surveyin the United States showed that only a quarter of respondent households knew of the Federal Reserve’s2% inflation aim.[17]And, second, the ECB would need to establish a clear track record that emphasises the centrality of themidpoint in the conduct of its policy. The 2% needs to remain the clear nominal anchor for coordinatingboth expectations and actions.Which inflation expectations matter?The second element we should review relates to how we should evaluate expected deviations from themidpoint target.[18]Critics would dismiss the idea of tolerance bands around the inflation aim because they fear that, bysignalling our comfort with a range of inflation rates below 2%, we would entrench expectations of lowinflation and risk downplaying the nominal anchor.I have two comments in response to these fears.The first is that we can no longer ignore the fact that medium-term inflation expectations of bothprofessional forecasters and financial market participants have persistently adjusted lower. Adaptiveexpectations are rational at times of deep structural change.[19]My second comment is really more of a question: which expectations should central banks consider whenevaluating risks to the inflation outlook?Neither the academic community nor the central banking community have ever provided an answer to thisquestion. I see a large gap between the role played by inflation expectations in our profession and theextent of central banks’ actual knowledge about how expectations ultimately affect inflation outcomes andwhich expectations are concerned.Market-based measures are convenient because they are readily available. But convenience may provedelusive.Household inflation expectations, for example, have been found to be a better proxy of firms’ pricing18.12.19, 15:52Seite 4 von 8
decisions than those of professional forecasters or financial market participants.[20]But expectations by household have pointed in a very different direction in recent times, painting a muchless dire picture regarding the inflation outlook. According to one survey, households believed that annualeuro area inflation between 2004 and 2018 was close to 9%, when in fact it was 1.6%.[21]Does the consumer price index need to be changed?The third element relates to the way we measure inflation.The Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) has been a tremendous achievement in terms ofproviding a reliable, timely and comparable measure of consumer inflation across EU Member States.But whether it adequately captures the cost of living should be subject to regular review. A well-knownexample is the cost of housing.The HICP captures only marginally the largest single lifetime expenditure of households – their cost ofhousing. Housing costs currently enter the HICP mainly through actual rentals, with a weight of just 6.5%.The costs of owner-occupied housing, by contrast, are not included even though more than 65% ofhouseholds in the euro area own their main residence.[22]Careful reflection is warranted but allowing a wedge to persist between the inflation that householdsperceive and the rate we officially measure can undermine the validity of our actions.Rethinking central banks’ toolkitRe-evaluating the appropriateness of these three elements – the inflation aim, the role of inflationexpectations and inflation measurement – would probably go a long way towards revitalising policy in linewith the current challenges.But it may not be enough.If the current environment of persistently low underlying inflation and elevated uncertainty were to persistwell into the future – and there is a risk that it may – then the odds are large that firms and social partnerswill increasingly start adjusting prices and wages accordingly.In this case, more forceful policy action would be needed.One option would then be to do more of the same.I have no doubt that the ECB can further ease financing conditions by deploying its current instruments.But one may doubt whether this approach would be more effective in bringing inflation closer to the aimthan it has been so far. And one may wonder how far the depth of our shallow capital markets can besounded, and whether the side effects of our measures would not outweigh the benefits at some point inthe future.A second possible, and complementary, option is to coordinate economic policies more closely.The combination of limited fiscal policy space in many euro area countries, political fixation on large fiscalsurpluses in some, and the persistent opposition to a common fiscal capacity makes this option lesscredible, however.Coordination with fiscal authorities cannot be a fig leaf for central bank inaction or inability to act. And itcan easily degenerate into a threat to central bank independence.But central banks have one key strength, and that is their agility.They have always been able to reinvent themselves, to innovate and overcome even severe impedimentsto transmission.And if transmission through financial markets and banks hits a wall – if the third stage of transmissionremains anaemic – then central banks have the obvious choice of considering whether to broaden the setof counterparties through which they implement monetary policy.18.12.19, 15:52Seite 5 von 8
The discussion about central bank digital currencies is a case in point.At the heart of this discussion is the question of whether central banks should grant the general publicdirect access to their balance sheets. This question comes with many thorny technological choices andpolicy challenges, in particular with regard to financial stability and the future of credit intermediation, aswe know.[23]But assuming that these challenges can be overcome, then there are few reasons why central banks,within their mandate, should not apply the same set of instruments to accounts of private individuals thatthey currently apply to banks – that is, charge interest rates on central bank digital money.[24]By going to the heart of consumer choices, this approach would likely be more effective and faster instimulating demand and inflation, and it could have less negative side effects. Rather than addressing thesymptoms of low inflation, this would amount to precision surgery on the Euler equation.None of this is to say that it would be trivial.Ultimately, central banks would need to weigh the costs against the benefits – just like we did for otherunconventional policy measures. What we should avoid, however, is restricting our toolkit for dogmaticreasons or intellectual convenience, and giving up on our ability to deliver on our mandate.If monetary policy remains a conversation between central banks and financial markets, we shouldn’t besurprised if people don’t trust us. Too many see us as part of a financial system which has failed to delivergrowth and fairness. And this also curtails our policy options.ConclusionLet me conclude.Technological progress will continue to transform monetary policy in the future. To what extent and in whatways will depend both on the preferences of society and the risks that a very protracted period of lowinflation poses to macroeconomic and financial stability.There will be evolutionary changes that will ensure that current and tested policy frameworks remain fit forpurpose. These changes may include progress on how we measure inflation and the evolving consensuson how we define price stability.And there will be revolutionary changes, similar in scale and scope to the shift from banknotes to bankdeposits a few centuries ago or the recent adoption of negative interest rates. Technology will create newpolicy choices and options enabling central banks to continue acting within their mandates. As MarioDraghi said at his last press conference: “Never give up!”I wish Christine Lagarde and her team the best of luck and I fully trust that they will find the wisdom andcourage to act in the face of ever changing conditions, as the ECB has always done in its history.Thank you.[1]I would like to thank Tobias Blattner for his contribution to this speech and for his unwavering support, alongside my formercounsellors, Lorenzo Cappiello and Roland Straub. As always, all opinions expressed here are mine, as are any mistakes.[2]Source: European Commission, Standard Eurobarometer 91, fieldwork in June 2019, and Flash Eurobarometer 481, fieldwork inOctober 2019.[3]See Hammermann et al.

While theory is unclear aboutthe strength of the pass-through from wage growth to price inflation in the short run, long run labour cost inflation and price inflation areclosely interrelated. For the euro area, recent empirical evidence confirms a clear, stable and shock-dependent link between labour costand price inflation (see Bobeica et al.

In addition, thetransition to a low-carbon economy has initiated a process through which demand for fossil fuels will gradually decline. Along thistrajectory, the marginal cost of harvesting renewable energy is likely to become considerably lower and more stable than in the currentregime. See, for example, Bielen et al.

In Germany, it fell from35% to 17% over the same period. Partly as a result of this, over the past 25 years real aggregate productivity per hour in the euro areahas increased by more than three times as much as real compensation per hour.[9]See, for example, Cavallo, A.

Cavallo finds that price levels on websites and physical stores are identical 72% of the time. Pricechanges are not synchronised but are similar in frequency and average size. More research is needed to understand the underlyingfactors. But what might be happening is that increased price transparency through the internet limits the ability of firms to increase pricesin physical stores.[10]See, for example, Cœuré, B.

   12.12.2019 High Level Panel on Climate Change COP25/Naciones Unidas Margarita Delgado Subgobernadora    
 2/5 Good morning: Thank you very much for the invitation to be here today on this panel on the climate-related role of the financial sector. It is obvious that climate change, associated with global warming, is an all-encompassing concern that is translating into initiatives ranging from the most supranational scope possible down to the most local level. In my view this is because it is one of the few issues affecting each and every one of us and, at the same time, the planet as a whole. The fight against climate change has traditionally been a top-down process. The starting point was always an international agreement that had to be transposed into supranational and national regulations; but what we are currently witnessing is a strong bottom-up movement occurring in parallel with this top-down process.  People, in particular the young, are increasingly demanding their Governments act immediately and decisively, even if this affects their lives or pockets.  Another revealing feature of this movement is that these efforts are being undertaken jointly by the public and private sectors. Many of the official initiatives currently under way are in collaboration with the private sector.  For instance, the EU High-level Group on Sustainable Finance, created by the Commission in December 2016 to provide advice and contribute to the implementation of these clean policies, comprises 20 senior experts from civil society, the finance sector, academia and observers from European and international institutions.  The same may be said about the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, (TCFD). This Task Force, formed by 31 members entirely from the industry, was created in December 2015 at the request of the FSB to develop voluntary, consistent climate-related financial risk disclosures for use by companies in providing information to investors, lenders, insurers and other stakeholders. These disclosure standards are increasingly used by companies around the world. The emergence of the so-called “green bonds” is another case in point. These bonds were not created in response to any official initiative; indeedthe market is based entirely on private standards, such as the Green Bond Principles (GBP) issued by the ICMA in 2014. Obviously, the green bond market has grown following the demand from private investors willing to “put their money where their mouth is”.  In this regard investors, corporates and clients demand information on the impact of business activities on the environment. This is why it is so important that we have in the EU finally agreed on this common taxonomy which, hopefully, after being endorsed by the European Parliament, should allow for a more comprehensive assessment of risks and enhanced transparency. In sum, the fight against climate change is clearly not solely a publicly driven initiative. It is no longer the official sector preaching to the rest of the society but rather a joint effort by all stakeholders: Governments, Central Banks, Supervisors and Official Institutions, along with Corporates, Financial Institutions and, ultimately, all individuals.  
  3/5 I say they are all stakeholders because, when it comes to this planet, everybody living on it is a stakeholder.  I believe this is groundbreaking because, when an issue is as global as this one, there is a tendency to go precisely in the other direction. It is too easy to dilute personal and corporate responsibilities, find excuses and carry on without changing anything substantial.  The message we are receiving is that this is not the time to look for excuses. The writing is on the wall:  it is time for action.  Of course, whatever a person, a municipality, a region or even a country can do to combat fight global climate change is quite futile if the rest of the world stays the same. But the message today should be that each of us must do our bit, large or small, without looking at what others might or might not be doing.  I am here today, precisely, to talk about doing “our bit”. The contribution that the financial sector can make to this global struggle is no silver bullet, but it is an important one. It is clear that finance is not regarded as a polluting sector. That, at least, is a positive development in these difficult times for banks´ reputation. Traditionally, the companies dependent on oil products have been those most affected by the environmental regulations resulting from international agreements.  In fact, we should admit that the financial sector’s involvement in this battle has been rather limited. Until very recently, climate change was seen as something outside our remit. This has changed as a result of the 2015 Paris Agreement. What has changed since 2015 to warrant this sudden interest on the part of banking regulators and supervisors in climate risks? First, in 2015, the Paris Agreement stressed for the first time the importance of the financial system for steering the resources needed to transform the economy towards a sustainable model. Second, in 2018, the first NGFS report stated that climate-related risks were a source of financial risk, and that supervisors and central banks should shore up the system’s solvency in the face of these risks. Both elements, risk and funding, are clearly interrelated.  Let´s start from the risk view. In my public interventions I keep on highlighting one essential feature of any viable business model, namely the need to identify and quantify all the costs and risks involved in any given transaction and pass them through to prices and capital.  It is well known that the process of transition will entail two types of risks to the financial system: (i) on the one hand, the physical risks caused by the direct effects of climate change, as a result of the gradual increase in temperature, or more frequent or more severe climate events such as storms, flooding or natural disasters; (ii) on the other, the transition risks, which refer to the potential effect on specific bank borrowers of the regulatory measures aimed at sustainably transforming the economy, technological changes, and changes in customer behaviour and preferences driven by greater environmental awareness. This leads me to the second element:  the contribution of banks to the transition of the economy. Of course, if banks incorporate climate-related risks into costs and capital, they indirectly become “facilitators” of change, by reducing the cost of financing of activities that 
 4/5 contribute most to the sustainable transformation of the economy, while at the same time discouraging more polluting activities.  At the same time, we should stress that the change of production model will also entail opportunities for economic agents, which banks and companies should seize. By way of example, to achieve the EU's 2030 targets agreed in Paris, it is estimated that, for the EU as a whole, there is a need to fill an investment gap estimated at 260 billion EUR per year.  The cost of clean technologies has decreased dramatically –both solar panels and batteries are around 80% cheaper than a decade ago, for instance – and the potential in terms of growth and job creation is also striking.  In this regard, technology, society, regulation and public opinion are aligning to bring about a change towards a more sustainable economic model. Banks should, at the same time, nurture that change and exploit the business opportunities stemming from it. Nevertheless, we should be mindful of the potentially systemic implications that moving to a decarbonised economy entails, which could affect specific economic sectors. The official sector must assess this process carefully and drive its movement gradually if we wish to minimise any undesirable economic and social consequences. The goal is to achieve what has been dubbed “a fair transition”.  Let me talk now about the supervisor’s side. What are we expecting from banks in relation to these risks? Well, in the short and medium term we would expect all banks to include the environmental dimension in their strategic approach, as well as in their risk analysis and monitoring. Banks must begin to fill data gaps, compiling all relevant information at least for new operations. From a methodological standpoint, banks should at least be able to understand the implications of environmental risk and how it may affect their business models, including it in their risk appetite frameworks, in a manner proportionate to their size and complexity. Of course, the Board has to be duly informed, and some of their members should have the necessary expertise to assess these risks. Needless to say, it is not only banks that need to “catch up”; we are also working at the Banco de España to adapt to this reality. I believe it is fair to acknowledge that this is all very new for everyone in the banking sector, including certainly Central Banks and Supervisors.  What are we doing? Firstly, we have created an internal function entrusted with assessing the impact we as an institution have on the environment. The aim is to identify and coordinate the necessary measures to reduce that impact.  Secondly, as a macroprudential supervisor, we clearly need to be able to assess and quantify the risks that the transition towards a more sustainable economy poses, both for individual banks and the financial sector as a whole. We must be able to perform stress tests for the financial system overall and define scenarios to be applied by banks individually.  
  5/5 Accordingly, we are designing internal governance structures and methodologies, actively participating in the cultural shift in the SSM supervisory model. Naturally, we are also evaluating the information and data requirements needed to address this challenge.  Thirdly, as investors in the debt markets, we are working to include environmental risk assessment in our credit analysis. A fourth key element is our responsibility as supervisors. We must foster the implementation of these changes in the financial sector. We cannot wait for change to occur. We need to be proactive. Accordingly, we are also launching several initiatives to help raise awareness of the importance of this issue, including workshops and meetings with the industry to learn more about how the sector is coping with climate change and to promote its transformation. There is certainly much to be done. But, to conclude on a positive note, I wanted to highlight the incredible pace at which initiatives are moving and changes are being introduced.  Let me give you two examples. First, the NGFS was created barely two years ago, but in this very short lifespan it has managed to publish two comprehensive reports, guidance for central banks’ investments and, not least, its membership has surged from 8 to 51 members and 12 observers.  The second example is rather obvious: just look at the composition and topics discussed on this panel today. They would have been quite unthinkable two years ago.  Thank you very much. 
  Japan's Economy and Monetary Policy Speech at a Meeting with Business Leaders in Okayama Bank of Japan December 12, 2019   Masayoshi Amamiya Deputy Governor of the Bank of Japan (English translation based on the Japanese original) 
1  Introduction It is my pleasure to have the opportunity today to exchange views with administrative, financial, and business leaders in Okayama Prefecture. I would like to take this chance to express my sincere gratitude for your cooperation with the activities of the Bank of Japan's Okayama Branch.  Yesterday, I looked at the recovery of areas that were severely damaged by the heavy rain in July 2018, such as Mabicho. It was heartbreaking to see that the impact of the disaster remains even after a year and a half has passed. However, at the same time, it was very encouraging to know that the locals are making steady progress toward recovery. I would like to express my deepest respect for everyone's efforts.  Before exchanging views with you, I would like to talk about the Bank of Japan's view on developments in economic activity and prices, including the global economy, and about the underlying thinking on its monetary policy conduct. In particular, let me explain these by focusing on three questions that I have received often recently: how long the global economic slowdown will continue; whether it will affect domestic demand; and the degree of the consumption tax hike's impact.  I. Financial and Economic Developments I will start by talking about developments in the global economy. Let me first look back at developments over the past few years (Chart 1). From 2017 through mid-2018, the global economy had been firm, supported mainly by global growth in IT-related demand, a resultant boost in business fixed investment, and steady domestic demand in each country. Since around mid-2018, however, the global growth rate and world trade volume have declined, mainly reflecting heightening uncertainties over the U.S.-China trade friction and adjustments in the global cycle for IT-related goods that were affected by weak demand for data centers and smartphones. In particular, the world trade volume started to decrease from the middle of this year. The characteristic of the current slowdown in the global economy is that the manufacturing sector has been relatively weak against the background of the slowdown in trade activity (Chart 2). Business sentiment in the manufacturing sector globally has remained in a state of deterioration. In this situation, machinery investment has 
2  remained somewhat weak. In addition, global automobile sales have been somewhat weak due to various factors such as weak corporate demand, which also is observed in machinery investment, the effects of stricter environmental regulations, and the tightening of financial conditions in some emerging economies. There used to be a prevailing view that the global economy would head toward a pick-up in 2019, but the pick-up turned out to be delayed, and many institutions, including the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Bank of Japan, had to revise downward their projections for global economic growth. The delay is mainly attributable to the intensified and prolonged U.S.-China trade friction and a continuing decline in the growth rate of the Chinese economy.  So, how long will the global economic growth pace continue to be in this deceleration phase? In other words, when will the global economy pick up? The Bank projects that, although it is subject to considerable uncertainties, the growth rate will rise moderately through mid-2020. According to the latest World Economic Outlook (WEO) released by the IMF, the global growth rate for 2019 is projected to decline to 3.0 percent and thereafter recover to 3.4 percent for 2020, which is around the past average (Chart 1).  One of the mechanisms through which the global economy will pick up is the materialization of the effects of each country's macroeconomic policy. Since the beginning of this year, many emerging and commodity-exporting economies have reduced their policy rates. As for advanced economies, the Federal Reserve cut its policy rate at three consecutive meetings held from July through October, with a view to preventing an actual slowdown in economic activity and prices due to risks concerning weak global growth, as well as trade developments. The European Central Bank (ECB) also conducted monetary easing in September. These accommodative monetary policy measures will likely support a pick-up in the global economy by stabilizing economic and price developments in each country. At the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) held this morning, the Federal Reserve decided not to change its policy. As background to this decision, the Federal Reserve has pointed to the projection that the "insurance" rate cuts in the past few months will likely underpin the U.S. economy.  
3  Another driving force of a pick-up in the global economy is a recovery in the global cycle for IT-related goods, which triggered the current global economic slowdown (Chart 3). The global demand for semiconductors is bottoming out, and demand for smartphones and data centers is likely to pick up. In addition, from a somewhat longer-term perspective, demand related to 5G network is expected to increase globally. In this situation, the phase of inventory reductions has almost ended in Japan, and some increase in exports and production of IT-related goods has started to be seen.  Moreover, regarding the U.S.-China trade friction, which entails the largest uncertainties over the global economy, negotiations seem to be continuing toward further progress even after the United States postponed imposing additional tariffs on Chinese goods in October. Global financial markets have taken these developments as favorable, and investors' risk sentiment has improved compared to a while ago. If a globally stable trade relationship is rebuilt, that will boost again the global trade, which has shrunk.  Although signs of a pick-up in the global economy have started to be observed gradually, uncertainties over the outlook continue to warrant attention and the Bank is cautious about future developments. The U.S.-China trade negotiations have shown positive developments, but points of disagreement between the two countries remain in various aspects, and I have to say that uncertainties over the outcome of the negotiations are still high. In addition, close attention should be paid to various risks, including developments in emerging economies such as China, how the exit from the European Union (EU) will turn out in the United Kingdom, where the general election is going to take place today, and geopolitical risks. As for the outlook, if firms have to keep paying attention to risks concerning the global economy for a prolonged period, it could take longer than expected for their fixed investment stance to become active again. Thus, downside risks concerning the global economy will continue to warrant close attention.  Thus far, I have talked about developments in the global economy. Now, I would like to move on to Japan's economic developments. The growth pace in the global economy has remained slow, and this has affected Japan's economy, mainly the manufacturing and export-related industries (Chart 4). Since the turn of the year, manufacturers' sentiment in 
4  Japan has become clearly cautious. With regard to exports and production activity, some weakness has continued to be observed, particularly in capital goods used for business fixed investment and automobile-related goods. As for the outlook, these developments are likely to continue for the time being with the pick-up in the global economy being delayed.  What is unique to the current phase is that, in contrast to somewhat weak external demand, domestic demand has been firm (Chart 5). In the past, large economic fluctuations often occurred in Japan, where the negative impact on the manufacturing sector stemming from changes in the global economy spread to domestic demand. In the current phase, however, although exports have continued to show some weakness, domestic demand has continued to increase in all three sectors -- that is, the corporate, household, and public sectors. Thus, the impact of the global economic slowdown on domestic demand has been limited so far. The Bank expects that, with the virtuous cycle from income to spending operating, domestic demand will follow an uptrend and the impact of the global economic slowdown on domestic demand will remain limited. That is, although the momentum of domestic demand is likely to decelerate temporarily in the short run, reflecting the effects of the global economic slowdown and the consumption tax hike, it is expected that a large decline will be avoided. In what follows, I will explain the outlook for business fixed investment, private consumption, and public investment in further detail.  Let me start with business fixed investment. Business fixed investment in Japan has continued on an increasing trend on the whole, although it has been somewhat weak globally. This is attributable to an increase in sustained investment that is less susceptible to short-term economic developments (Chart 6). Such investment includes labor-saving investment that reflects tight labor market conditions. While the labor market conditions remain tight and labor shortage is expected to continue from the long-term perspective, demand for saving labor and improving efficiency has increased, mainly in the nonmanufacturing sector that is labor intensive. Since Okayama Prefecture, for which the active job openings-to-applicants ratio is ranked in the top three in Japan, faces extremely tight labor market conditions, you may recognize this situation clearly. In industries that face labor shortage -- including retail, accommodations as well as eating and drinking services, and construction -- firms are making efforts to save labor and improve efficiency 
5  and actively are undertaking machinery and software investment. In addition, the uptrend in research and development (R&D) investment for growth areas is expected to be maintained. With a view to improving competitiveness from a long-term perspective, the pace of increase in R&D investment is planned to be maintained in industries such as automobiles and chemicals, which recently have been affected by the global economic slowdown. Moreover, construction investment also has maintained a high level, reflecting a wide range of demand, such as for urban redevelopment projects, construction of distribution facilities that results from the spread of e-commerce, and construction of accommodation facilities that aims at capturing inbound tourism demand. Although business fixed investment in Japan as a whole has been on an uptrend, the effects of the global economic slowdown actually have been seen in part (Chart 7). Let us take the example of machinery investment in the manufacturing sector. In particular, machinery investment in industries related to capital goods that are used for fixed investment and to automobiles has been somewhat weak recently. While I mentioned earlier that exports and production in these industries had been greatly affected by the global economic slowdown, the same thing can be said about their business fixed investment. As for the outlook, business fixed investment is expected to maintain its uptrend on average underpinned by sustained investment; in the short run, however, its pace of increase is projected to decelerate, mainly for machinery investment in the manufacturing sector, with the pick-up in the global economy being delayed.  Next, I will talk about private consumption. Private consumption has increased moderately, albeit with fluctuations that mainly result from the effects of the consumption tax hike, with the employment and income situation continuing to improve steadily. Regarding developments in private consumption for the time being, the key is the effects of the tax hike in October, and this relates to the third question that I mentioned at the outset (Chart 8). First, looking at developments in consumption prior to the tax hike, in September, which was just before the tax hike, there was a significant increase in demand, or the so-called front-loaded increase in demand, for household electrical appliances such as televisions, daily necessities, and high-end products including luxury goods. However, since the increase in demand had not been significant through August, the overall front-loaded increase in demand was constrained this time compared with that of the previous tax hike, when such increase was observed for quite a long period. Next, let us take a look at 
6  developments after the tax hike. Attention needs to be paid to the fact that it is becoming difficult to grasp the underlying trend in consumption due to downward pressure resulting from the effects of natural disasters such as typhoons in October. In fact, consumption-related statistics since October have shown a somewhat large decline, and this seems to be partly affected by the special factor that I just mentioned. Assessing comprehensively by excluding this factor and by taking account of the perception of the relevant industries, a reactionary decline in demand after the tax hike so far does not seem to be as significant as that of the previous tax hike. In addition, downward pressure on private consumption will highly likely be smaller than that of the previous tax hike, underpinned by the government's various support measures for households. That said, attention should continue to be paid to the effects of the tax hike, because they could change depending on, for example, people's sentiment and price developments.  Lastly, let me move on to public investment. Last year, the heavy rain affected western Japan, including Okayama Prefecture, and the earthquake in Hokkaido caused disastrous damage. There also was great damage caused by a series of natural disasters this year, such as several typhoons that hit mainly eastern Japan. In the affected areas, progress has been made in construction projects related to restoration and reconstruction. In addition, construction related to national resilience -- which aims at strengthening the ability to maintain the functioning of infrastructure even when natural disasters occur -- is to be implemented intensively across the country through fiscal 2020. In Okayama Prefecture, as part of the urgent flood control project in Mabicho, construction is underway such as for Oda River, which caused severe damage at the time of the heavy rain last year. Moreover, economic policy measures decided by the government a while ago include initiatives to promote restoration and reconstruction from the recent natural disasters as well as to strengthen the framework for disaster prevention. As these developments show, public investment is expected to increase.  To summarize what I have talked about so far, regarding the outlook for Japan's economy, exports and production are projected to continue showing some weakness for the time being, with a pick-up in the global economy being delayed. As for domestic demand, the pace of increase is expected to decelerate temporarily due to the effects of the global economic 
7  slowdown and the consumption tax hike. However, from a somewhat longer-term perspective, it is expected that domestic demand will remain firm and that, as projected by the IMF, the global economic growth rate will rise. Thus, Japan's economy is likely to continue on an expanding trend, albeit at a moderate pace.  II. Price Developments Next, I will explain price developments in Japan (Chart 9). Looking back from a long-term perspective, for many years starting from the late 1990s, Japan's economy was in deflation in terms of a sustained decline in prices. Reflecting this situation, the Bank introduced quantitative and qualitative monetary easing (QQE) in 2013, and since then has pursued powerful monetary easing. At present, Japan's economy is no longer in deflation, in the sense of a sustained decline in prices, with the economy improving significantly and the positive annual CPI inflation taking hold.  Turning to recent price developments, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI excluding fresh food has remained at around 0.5 percent, partly due to the effects of the past decline in crude oil prices and reductions in mobile-related prices. The CPI has continued to show relatively weak developments compared to the economic expansion and tight labor market conditions. This is mainly because the mindset and behavior based on the assumption that wages and prices will not increase easily have been deeply entrenched among firms and households, due to the experience of prolonged low growth and deflation. Under these circumstances, the consumption tax rate was raised in October. The key point in looking at future price developments is whether firms' price-setting stance will change as a result of the tax hike. I would like to show you two distinctive examples (Chart 10). The first concerns developments in prices of durable goods. As for goods such as televisions and household electrical appliances, an increase and reactionary decline in demand prior to and after the tax hike have been observed. Prices were somewhat strong before the tax hike, when demand increased. However, price-setting has been mixed since the tax hike, when demand declined in reaction to the increase. Whereas the year-on-year rate of change in prices of televisions and laptops -- which have relatively large price fluctuations -- has turned negative since the tax hike, the rate of increase in prices of durable household goods such as refrigerators and vacuum cleaners has remained at a relatively high level. The 
8  second example concerns developments in prices of services such as dining-out. In the case of services prices, it can be confirmed that the tax hike has been passed on steadily. While the consumption tax rate for dining-out was raised to 10 percent, the rate for food products, including ready-made meals such as deli food, is unchanged at 8 percent due to the introduction of a reduced tax rate. For this reason, it had been pointed out that the tax hike might not be fully passed on to dining-out prices, reflecting price competition with ready-made meals, and that dining-out prices excluding the consumption tax could weaken. However, looking at developments in such prices in October, it appears that the tax hike has been passed on almost completely. Although the dining-out industry is making efforts to save labor and improve efficiency in response to increases such as in personnel expenses and distribution costs, there have been moves to gradually pass on cost increases that cannot be absorbed through such efforts. This suggests that many dining out-related firms have passed on the tax hike to selling prices. These moves also can be observed in other services. Of course, attention needs to be paid to the fact that firms' price-setting behavior may change depending on future developments in consumption. However, no major change in their price-setting stance has been observed so far and it seems that firms have continued to pass on costs including the consumption tax.  Taking account of this situation, I will explain the Bank's view on the outlook for prices. For the time being, it is likely that the year-on-year rate of change in energy prices will remain negative due to the effects of the past decline in crude oil prices, and thereby push down the CPI. However, from a somewhat longer-term perspective, the Bank projects that the inflation rate will rise gradually, with firms' and households' perception of prices improving in a situation where the economy continues on an expanding trend. While it is expected to still take time to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, the inflation rate is likely to increase gradually toward 2 percent. One of the assumed important mechanisms for the achievement of such price rises is the output gap of the economy as a whole (Chart 11). Looking at the output gap, which shows the balance between aggregate demand and supply, a positive gap has taken hold for the past few years, with demand exceeding supply. Based on the outlook for economic activity that I mentioned earlier, although the output gap is likely to narrow temporarily within positive territory, mainly due to the effects of the global economic slowdown and the consumption tax hike, it is expected to remain at around 
9  the current level on average. Under these circumstances, as households' tolerance of price rises increases, reflecting a rise in wages, and firms' stance shifts toward further raising prices, not only firms' moves to pass on cost increases but their active moves to raise prices that reflect developments in demand are likely to be more widespread. With wages and prices continuing to rise, the deeply entrenched mindset and behavior among people based on the assumption that wages and prices will not increase easily are expected to change gradually; accordingly, inflation expectations -- that is, people's expectations for future price developments -- are projected to rise. As these developments show, the Bank recognizes that the momentum toward achieving the price stability target has been maintained, whereby a positive output gap results in an increase in actual prices and then in a rise in inflation expectations, leading to a gradual rise in the inflation rate.  III. The Bank's Conduct of Monetary Policy Next, I would like to explain the Bank's conduct of monetary policy.  The Bank has been conducting "QQE with Yield Curve Control," aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent (Chart 12). It has pursued powerful monetary easing; specifically, the Bank sets the short-term policy interest rate at minus 0.1 percent and the target level of 10-year Japanese government bond (JGB) yields at around zero percent, and has conducted large-scale JGB purchases in the market.  The Bank considers that, at present, downside risks to economic activity and prices, mainly regarding developments in the global economy, require the most attention. As I mentioned earlier, there are various downside risks surrounding the global economy. If the materialization of these risks leads to a longer delay in the timing of a pick-up in the global economic growth pace or to a further deceleration in the global economy, Japan's economy inevitably will be affected. In this case, prices could be affected to some extent through downward pressure on the output gap, which is one of the important factors that determine price developments. Based on this recognition, since July, the Bank has clearly shown its policy stance of being tilted toward monetary accommodation. In October, the Bank clarified its stance to maintain the present levels of the policy rates or, depending on the situation, lower them from the present levels, as long as downside risks remain significantly 
10  high, as in the current situation. The Bank considers that downside risks to economic activity and prices, mainly regarding developments in the global economy, will continue to warrant close monitoring, and thus the policy stance of being tilted toward monetary accommodation will be appropriate for the time being. It will continue to carefully examine various risks and not hesitate to take additional easing measures if there is a greater possibility that the momentum toward achieving the price stability target will be lost.  So far, I have talked about the Bank's basic stance of monetary policy conduct. In such conduct, the Bank considers it important to take into account both the effects and side effects of monetary policy, including those on financial markets and the functioning of financial intermediation. On this point, it recognizes that prolonged downward pressure on financial institutions' profits, with the low interest rate environment and severe competition among financial institutions continuing, could create risks of a gradual pullback in financial intermediation and of destabilizing the financial system. Although these risks are judged as not significant at this point, mainly because financial institutions have sufficient capital bases, the Bank will continue to examine these risks as well as those considered most relevant to the conduct of monetary policy and pursue such conduct in an appropriate manner, taking account of developments in economic activity and prices as well as financial conditions.  Conclusion Lastly, I would like to say a few words about Okayama Prefecture's economy.  Okayama Prefecture's economy has been on a moderate expanding trend on the back of firm domestic demand. While the U.S.-China trade friction as well as relatively weak developments in the Chinese economy are affecting exports and production, business fixed investment has remained at a high level. Private consumption has been on a pick-up trend, although fluctuations in demand resulting from the consumption tax hike have been observed. Despite the severe damage caused by the heavy rain last year, Okayama Prefecture's economy has maintained a virtuous expansionary cycle supported by the hard work of residents, firms, and the local government.  
11  Blessed by a favorable climate that earned it the name "The Land of Sunshine," Okayama Prefecture has developed the commerce and logistics rooted in its history as a transportation hub. Its manufacturing industries, as exemplified by the Mizushima Coastal Industrial Zone, have been a driving force in Japanese manufacturing. Moreover, the prefecture is rich in culture, as shown by its many ancient castles, Bizen ware, Korakuen, and the Kurashiki Bikan Historical Quarter, as well as in natural blessings such as its hot springs, fruits, and the delights of Setouchi, which appeal to visitors from Japan and abroad. The promotion of tourism based on these attractions is making progress, and with the "Okayama Art Summit" and the "Setouchi Triennale" having been held this year, many people from Japan and other countries have been visiting Okayama Prefecture.  On the other hand, despite these riches, Okayama Prefecture is very similar to other regions in that it has to address the declining and aging population. However, by thinking ahead using their insight, the people of Okayama seem to have overcome various challenges at different times. During the Edo period, under the feudal Ikeda clan, Kojima Bay was reclaimed and agricultural productivity was dramatically improved. In the Meiji period, Magosaburo Ohara introduced the latest technology of the time to lay the foundations for the development of the textile industry and set up a factory providing a work environment that is in line with today's thinking about work-style reforms. Thereafter, with scars from the war remaining, the development scheme for Mizushima was launched in 1952, and the industrial complex that emerged played a leading role in the development of Japan's manufacturing industry. Recently, the promotion of regional development centered on forestry in the north of the prefecture has been bearing fruit and has become a model for regional revitalization nationwide.  I hope that the growth potential of Okayama Prefecture will be enhanced through collaborative efforts by its people as well as firms and the local government to build up the prefecture's strengths, as seen in their cooperation aimed at overcoming the damage caused by the heavy rain. The Bank, and in particular its Okayama Branch, will seek to play a part in contributing to the further development of Okayama Prefecture's economy.   Thank you for your attention.

Benoît Cœuré: Interview in LibérationInterview with Mr Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank,in Libération, conducted by Mr Jean Quatremer on 4 December 2019, and published on 16December 2019.*   *   *On 25 September, Sabine Lautenschläger, the German member of the Executive Board,resigned after the public sector purchase programme (PSPP), Europe’s “quantitativeeasing”, was reactivated on 13 September following a majority decision of the GoverningCouncil. Several other ECB members also voted against, and the governors of theGerman, Austrian and Dutch central banks openly criticised this decision. Whathappened?In September, the euro area was facing the risk of a further slowdown and inflation wasremaining too far away from our 2% objective. The entire Governing Council agreed on thisdiagnosis – the debate was not about the need to act, but about the choice of instruments. Someof us were not convinced that relaunching asset purchases was the most suitable instrument,because long-term interest rates had never been so low. It’s normal for there to be differentpoints of view, but once a decision has been taken, we should accept it and move on. In fact,that’s one of the ECB’s greatest qualities – that it can take decisions by simple majority, making itmore reactive than other European institutions. Not everyone has to be in agreement, althoughit’s better when they are as that gives the decision more weight.A technical debate that nevertheless resulted in an open and intense confrontation…Sabine resigned for a combination of personal reasons, and only she can comment on them.Another relevant topic is communication. I think that once the institution has taken a decision,whatever your personal opinion you should defend that decision. Things would be different if thevotes were public, which is something I’ve always supported. Each individual would have to takeresponsibility for their vote and explain how it was in the interest of the euro area – the nationalcentral bank governors sit in Frankfurt in a personal capacity and should support the collectiveinterest, not just their country’s.Since the start of the euro area crisis in 2010, the Bundesbank has routinely votedagainst the ECB’s decisions, criticised them publicly, even joined legal actions againstit…The Governing Council was almost unanimous in its agreement that the measures taken duringthe crisis were both necessary and within the ECB’s mandate. I’m thinking particularly about thedecision on Outright Monetary Transactions (OMTs) that we took in September 2012 to protectthe euro area from speculation that could have forced some countries out of the single currency.That decision was almost unanimous; the single vote against came from the President of theBundesbank, who thought these operations crossed the line separating monetary and fiscalpolicy as it was designed to support a euro area country’s bond market that was under attackfrom the markets. This was not the opinion of the Governing Council, which had spent the entiresummer of 2012 ensuring that this line would not be crossed – we therefore made ourintervention conditional on the activation of a European Stability Mechanism (ESM) adjustmentprogramme. That is essential, because it means it is not the ECB that is reforming a country’seconomy or getting a country’s public finances back on their feet when it asks for help – thecountry has to do this itself within the framework of an ESM programme. Then the ECB canprovide the liquidity that enables the bond market to stabilise. Moreover, the European Court ofJustice ruled in our favour. 1 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
We seem to be witnessing a real clash of ideologies between the left and right within theECB, as your zero-rates policy is resulting in the “euthanisation of the rentier”, toborrow a 19th century phrase, meaning it’s hurting savers and pensioners, hence thecriticism from Germany and the Netherlands, but helping workers, or growth, in otherwords.It’s a false dichotomy. One of my regrets is that we haven’t managed to convince the Germanpublic of the merits of our policy. On the one hand, monetary policy always and everywhereaffects the balance between saving and consumption via interest rates. If it didn’t do that, it wouldserve no purpose! And on the other hand, in a period where unemployment skyrockets, growthslows or there is the threat of deflation, as was the case in 2012 and 2014, it is normal for theECB to be on the side of employment. I have no concerns here, it’s part of our mandate: withoutgrowth and employment, you cannot have price stability. Our policy is in the interest of the euroarea as a whole, and therefore of Germany, it’s as simple as that. As soon as you have a singlemarket and a single currency, there’s no point artificially setting the interests of different countriesagainst each other, because we are all in the same boat…Your policies have also weakened the banks, who have seen their margins shrink to thepoint that some of them are no longer concerned about charging for deposits.On the one hand, interest rates are not low because of the ECB. Us lowering our “key rates” (forexample, the rate at which bank deposits held with the ECB are remunerated) to very low or evennegative levels means that there is a savings glut in the economy: the natural rate of interest hasfallen due to weak growth, the ageing population and a sort of anxiety in the global economyleading to demand for very safe assets, like government bonds. But for monetary policy to workand stimulate the economy, the interest rates set by the central bank have to be below thisequilibrium rate. If one wants to return to a situation in which savings generate returns andconditions are supportive for the financial sector, criticising the central bank achieves nothing.Action needs to be taken on the fundamentals to boost returns on capital, which would naturallylead to interest rates increasing, and the central bank could follow.On the other hand, it is true that the fact that the yield curve is flat, in other words that interestrates are low across the maturity spectrum, is weighing on the financial sector. Indeed, thedifference between the long-term performance of savings and the short-term cost of funding iscurrently almost zero. But what is weighing even more heavily on the profitability of Europeanbanks is that they have a cost base that is much higher than that of banks in the United States,Japan, the United Kingdom and Scandinavia, and that, in certain countries, they have non-performing loans on their balance sheet that no longer yield a return. And finally, there are toomany banks in Europe and consolidation has not started.So, we need fewer banks in the euro area?The banking union hasn’t yet enabled consolidation within the sector. We need to see cross-border M&A activity in the banking sector, and we also need to overcome a number of obstaclesto banking activity. But the banking union has played a useful role in stabilising a sector that isnow much more robust than it was in 2012, since the ECB has taken on the role of bankingsupervisor and has strengthened capital and liquidity requirements. It is important to recognisethat one of the major achievements of the past eight years has been to reduce the influence ofthe banking lobby. The banking union has put a stop to the vicious triangle that existed in eachcountry between big banks, the regulator – in other words, the finance ministry – and thesupervisor, which was generally the national central bank. We have created some distancebetween the banking sector and the supervisor, which is a good thing for the people of Europe.Another effect of your monetary policy has been to create the conditions for a new realestate bubble, since there’s no longer any return on savings. 2 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
There is a risk, but we’re not there yet. There are local tensions, but nothing that affects the euroarea as a whole. Preventing risks has to start at the national level – if property prices are soaringin a particular city, is the problem related to mortgage lending or is it related to land-use planning?In the latter case, that certainly falls outside the ECB’s purview. Financial institutions arefundamentally stronger than they were in 2008, because they’re better capitalised and they haveto comply with stricter rules, particularly when it comes to measuring their risks. For example,Basel III has imposed limits on banks’ use of internal models – previously, they could calculatethemselves the risks they were taking, and this made them overconfident. That said, if we remainin this environment of low interest rates for a long time, the risk of real estate bubbles will ofcourse increase. I would like the ECB to develop an approach which allows a better comparisonbetween the benefits for the real economy of low interest rates and the risks created through thefinancial sector. At the moment, it’s not clear at what point the risks start to outweigh the benefits.Isn’t there also a need to strengthen the rules that banks need to observe whengranting a loan?Macroprudential tools offer scope to tighten capital requirements for banks and the conditionsthey impose on borrowers if financial stability problems appear to be emerging. Such measuresare taken at the national level – in France, for example, the High Council for Financial Stability,which is chaired by the Finance Minister, has taken measures related to lending to large firmsand to housing loans. If the ECB thinks that a country isn’t doing enough, it can take matters intoits own hands. The European Systemic Risk Board identifies risks and can makerecommendations to individual countries, but if the ECB thinks that this doesn’t go far enough, itcan take charge and impose additional requirements at the European level, something that hasso far never been done. The area where no tools exist – and this is a matter of concern – is non-bank activity. Since the financial crisis, there has been a shift towards the non-bank sector.Banks have shrunk their balance sheets while investment funds, money market funds and assetmanagers continue to grow and are effectively financing the economy. So, if an investment fundbuys a portfolio of loans from a bank, it becomes a creditor to firms and households. Yet there ismuch less supervision and fewer prudential tools in this sector. This is where major work will beneeded in the coming years – we need to develop a macroprudential approach for non-bankactivity so that credit conditions can be tightened if necessary.Since you started at the ECB in January 2012, the institution has undergone afundamental transformation. It used to be much like the Bundesbank, but now it actsmore like the US Federal Reserve.The existential crises we went through, first with Spain and Italy in summer 2012 and then withGreece in summer 2015, and the actions of one man, Mario Draghi, who was President of theECB until November this year, gave us the necessary maturity to make full use of theinstruments granted to us by the treaties. Does this mean that we have become like the FederalReserve? In a certain sense, yes, because we are equipped with a comprehensive toolbox tosupport the euro area economy at all times, using tools like quantitative easing inspired by the USmodel, and the capacity to intervene in the markets. But there are also significant differences.For a start, we don’t have the same mandate – the Federal Reserve has a dual mandate thatgives equal weighting to price stability and full employment, while the ECB’s mandate prioritisesprice stability. And our financial markets are not the same – bond markets in the United Statesare very deep and liquid, which gives the Federal Reserve an almost unlimited capacity forintervention. In Europe, there is no capital markets union – bond markets are fragmented across19 countries, which limits the capacity of monetary policy.Are you proud of what has been accomplished?There are three things I take pride in. First, Mario Draghi’s speech in July 2012, when he said thatthe ECB, within its mandate, would do whatever it takes to preserve the euro, and the creation of 3 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
Outright Monetary Transactions, which were the concrete manifestation of that commitment andmade it possible to maintain the integrity of the euro area. Then there was the episode withGreece, which was of course very controversial, as can be seen in the Costa Gavras film “Adultsin the room”. But when the Greek government was close to bankruptcy, we ensured thecontinued financing of the Greek economy and of Greek banks – which had lost access to themarkets and to their own savers following a capital flight – while respecting the political will ofeuro area governments that the assistance to Greece should be conditional. Our actionsultimately allowed Greece to remain in the euro. There were those who wanted to make the ECBresponsible for Greece leaving the euro area, but we resisted that! And the third thing I’m proudof is the quantitative easing we launched in 2015, which averted the risk of deflation.Any regrets?We probably started quantitative easing (QE) a little too late, though I’m not blaming anyone. Itwas a major innovation which required an immense effort of persuasion within the GoverningCouncil. For example, we had long discussions as to who would bear the risk of these assetpurchases and we finally decided that 80% would be borne by the national central banks on theirbalance sheets and not by the ECB. The idea was to prevent QE, a massive purchase of publicsecurities – we now hold almost a third of total European debt, equivalent to 20% of euro areaGDP – from being a way of ushering in a fiscal union through the back door against the wishes ofMember States. We also underestimated the impact that the policy of fiscal austerity would haveon activity; this policy was enshrined in the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance andwas necessary at the time in order to provide stability to the financial markets. But this wouldhave required a more accommodative monetary policy, as recommended by the IMF, going asfar as QE, which should have been running from 2010 rather than from 2015. Finally, we mayhave sat on the fence for slightly too long with regard to climate change, even if that is not ourcore task. Other central banks, such as the Bank of England, became aware of it earlier than wedid. For one, climate change needs to be integrated into financial sector supervision, taking intoaccount the risks it poses for certain sectors of activity and financial securities, and we need toreflect on its consequences for monetary policy. And then there were other errors that were notof our making: one reason for the deterioration of the crisis in the euro area was that we laggedfar behind the United States in cleaning up the financial sector. The European countries weredeluding themselves about the state of their banks and we were very late in conducting seriousstress tests and imposing recapitalisations. Certain countries, including France, even foughtrearguard actions so as to avoid bolstering their large banks’ capital base. All of this has weighedon growth. We now need to make sure we don’t slip back again!Christine Lagarde has announced that she will lead a review of the ECB’s strategy.Christine Lagarde is right. It’s a good idea to step back and lead such a discussion. I hope thatthe debate will not be held solely within the ECB, but that independent economists and civilsociety representatives will be involved too.If we look back on how the euro has fared since 1999, we can see that it did not produceall the effects that people had hoped for. Trade in the euro area is declining, the capitalmarkets union is in limbo, countries with large capital surpluses, such as Germany or theNetherlands, are investing them in the United States or in China, etc. In fact, the countrythat is gaining the most from the euro is Germany, which amply benefits from the euro’sundervaluation.Everyone benefits from the euro because the exchange rate risk has disappeared and financialconditions for investment have never been so favourable. Likewise, the euro is a common goodthat enables us to speak with one voice on the international scene, even if we don’t make enoughuse of this strength. But it is true that we created the euro, which was backed up with the bankingunion and the European Stability Mechanism, to enable a single European market, and the fact is 4 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
that this market is at a standstill. Why? Because at the outset it was conceived as a space forthe free movement of goods, whereas we are now in a service economy and there is no singlemarket for services.You cannot ignore the northern European countries’ refusal to offer financial solidarity.We have a political problem: the European states have a single currency which, through its veryexistence, is an extraordinary expression of solidarity. But they tend to see the euro area toomuch as a club with free membership, giving them the right to a certain number of services.However, participation in the euro brings with it a duty of solidarity when your neighbour is goingthrough a rough patch. While it’s true that the Member States fulfilled their duty towards Greece,Ireland, Portugal, Cyprus and Spain, they did so under conditions that were extremely costly, oreven toxic, on a political level. The adjustment programmes generated huge tensions andacrimony. And, conversely, you need to keep your own house in order to avoid creating problemsfor your neighbours. Countries can have whatever economic policy they want, that’s democracy,but on the condition that they do not jeopardise their neighbours. To that end, the members of theclub need to observe certain rules. In reality, however, countries have little regard for those rules.One day we will need to create ad hoc institutions, including an authority in charge of a euro areabudget which would embody the collective interest, have decision-making powers and beaccountable before the European Parliament. For as long as that is not in place, we will have tocross our fingers and hope that no crisis occurs.So is the ECB making up for the failure of political will?Yes. The lack of coordination in the fiscal domain means that we are the ones who are doing thework. I dream of a euro area with a strong and democratic political base, which would alleviatethe burden on the ECB. . The politicisation of the ECB results from the weakness of the politicalpillar of Economic and Monetary Union. Some people accuse the ECB of doing too much and ofnot being democratic enough, but the excessive expectations projected onto the ECB are only areflection of political weakness. 5 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
Christine Lagarde: Interview with NOS NieuwsuurTranscript of the interview with Ms Christine Lagarde, President of the European Central Bank,and NOS Nieuwsuur, conducted by Ms Mariëlle Tweebeeke on 12 December 2019 andbroadcast (in part) on 12 December 2019.*   *   *Christine Lagarde, thank you so much for making time for us today. It’s reallyappreciated. A special day; you’ve just had your first press conference as President ofthe ECB. Had you ever thought you would be President of a central bank?No! Never, but I never thought I would be Managing Director of the IMF, and I never thought Iwould be Minister of Economy and Finance for France, so my life has been like that.Have you already learned the lingo of the ECB?I’m learning! I’m learning a little bit of German, I’m taking lessons and I’m constantly immersed incentral banking jargon and concepts and attitude of mind, but I’m learning fast.You made clear at the press conference that you have your own style.Yes.But can you be yourself in this role? Because every word you say as president of theECB might instantly impact financial markets.Well, first of all, I like words. I tend to be attentive to the words I use, so that suits me fine. Andwhat I did during my press conference, the first one, I tried to warn the journalists in the room andthe journalists and observers behind their screens that they have to take me for who I am and nottry to second-guess or associate or proceed by an analogy, an analysis or comparative workbecause it would probably be misguided. And I think the trade-off for that is that when I havesomething to say, I will say it. That’s more my style and my nature.Yes, you want to make that clear. You never led a central bank before. Do you thinkthat’s an advantage or a disadvantage?Having been Minister of Finance for four years, in the middle of the financial crisis and havingnavigated the difficulty of that, having had to put in place a lot of regulations that still apply today tosanitise and strengthen the financial sector at the time, and having had the privilege of leading theInternational Monetary Fund for eight years, which is in many instances the lender of last resort tocountries in difficulty, I know some of the facets of the work that is done here. I learn fast, I workhard and I’m surrounded by exceptionally competent people. So to the extent that I cansometimes challenge some of the conventional views and the sort of home-grown conventionalwisdom, I think it’s very healthy.Yes, it could be an advantage.It could be.You are the first woman to lead the ECB, which used to be a man’s world. How arepeople reacting?I think they notice but I think they tolerate it and hopefully they will accept that I can do as good, ifnot a better job than men would. I think that’s the beauty of diversity and the openness of thisinstitution, actually, to accept, engage and respect differences and to try to include them. 1 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
Do you believe it’s important that a woman is leading such a prominent institution likethe ECB?Yes, I do, because I see too many younger women – not necessarily younger women actually –but too many of my colleagues and friends and people that I meet in the course of everyday life,who look up to me and say to themselves or say sometimes to me, “About time that a womandoes this job”, number 1. Number 2, “If she can do it, maybe I can do it, too – and if not me thenmy daughters maybe can do it.” So I think that as a signal it’s important. It honestly gives me, Iwould say, additional responsibilities because I don’t want to let them down. That puts anadditional weight on my shoulders. I have to honour that.Also the European Commission is led by a woman now. Do you think that will make adifference somehow?I’m sure it will. When you look at some photos from the days when the European Union was setup in the first place, or when you look at old photos – sometimes not so old photos – of the ECB,of the Governing Council, it does make a difference, if only optically. But I also think that it bringsan added dimension, which is the sheer dimension of diversity of thinking.But also in policy.Oh, I think everybody brings…Maybe risk-taking?On risk-taking, I think, it has been demonstrated empirically now by a lot of analytical work thathas been done on the trade floor and in various circles, that the risk attitude is different. You seethat by the sort of rotation of portfolios, for instance, and that has been studied extensively. I thinkwe tend to have a different horizon and we embrace different priorities. And we have a differentlook at risk, yes.That’s a good development. Let’s talk about the ECB and the Netherlands, because inthe Netherlands there is a lot of criticism of ECB policy, especially the low interest rates.It’s not good for people’s savings, for our pension system. How do you see thiscriticism?Well, first of all, I would like to say that I hear that criticism and I completely understand andappreciate the concern that some people have. If you’re saving, if you are at risk of receiving lesspension, obviously you are concerned and we should look at that. We should monitor it and weshould appreciate what is happening – and we do. I can assure you that it was done in the pastand it will certainly continue to be done, if not emphasised, going forward. But having said that,our job, which has been given by Europe and the euro area in particular in the Treaty, is tomaintain price stability and to use tools that we can use in order to arrive at that. I think that whathas been done by the ECB is to use as many tools as are available and can prove efficient inorder to maintain that price stability which has been defined way back in 2003 as close to butbelow 2%. Until such time when we arrive at this aim that we have, we need to continue usingthe tools. Interest rates are one of them.When I look backward, since 2014, there has been a lot of good development. If I look at yourcountry, for instance, in the Netherlands, where today you have about 9.3 million people at work,from those 9.3 about 800,000 jobs were created as a result of the monetary policy and otherpolicies, fiscal and structural reforms. So it has been extremely useful to use those lower interestrate policies going forward; that’s point number 1. Point number 2, I realise that it’s difficult for thepension system, but it does not affect all pension systems in all euro area member states. So Ithink it’s also how each pension scheme is calibrated, organised, structured that is in questionand that needs to be looked at, because it affects one country, it doesn’t affect others. 2 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
What I wanted to say is that even our President of the Dutch Central Bank is not happywith the ECB monetary policy, and is so unhappy that he addressed it in a publicstatement a couple of months ago. Do you understand his concerns?I don’t want to revisit the past because the past is where it is. I’m more concerned about what Ican do and how I can help, and how we can be attentive to delivering on our mission inaccordance with our mandate. Being attentive to all consequences on inflation, but on all otheritems as well, including the negative effects. Number 3, I would observe also that ever since Istarted on November 1, we have worked very cooperatively, very consensually, including withGovernor Knot.You’ve spoken with him about this?Yes, absolutely, we’ve known each other for a long time and we are very, very close to eachother. I know the problem that some of the Dutch people are concerned about, and I share theirconcern.Yes, but…Don’t forget one thing: very often a saver is also the owner of his house. Houses have increasedin value over the course of time.Yes, but there is also a risk.You can look at everything as a risk, everything as a benefit, and you’re right; that the price ofhouses has gone up. It’s less accessible to young people. Maybe more housing would help in theprocess. So while we have to set our policies at the euro area level, being attentive to each andevery member state as well, there are measures that can be taken at the national level in order toaddress some of the negative effects.Moody’s concluded today that the Netherlands is at risk of a housing crisis. Is thatsomething to worry about?As I said, the housing prices have gone up in many large centres in some of the euro areamember states, and measures can be taken in order to temper these price increases. I think it’snine out of 19 euro area countries that have already taken specific measures to temper prices,meaning reducing a little bit access to credit and providing conditionality so that there is not anexcessive demand relative to supply. I also think that supply measures could be in order and thathousing should be encouraged and developed whenever there is shortage and when supplycannot meet demand.Which brings me to another question: is it even possible to have adequate monetarypolicy in the euro area when the differences between countries are so big? If we look atinflation for example, the last six months, in the Netherlands it was 2.6% while theEuropean average was 1.4%. So is it possible?It’s the rule of the game. When the euro area was set up, when the euro was chosen, when wesee that people support the euro and like the euro as much as they do, we have to find the toolsand put in place the instruments to strengthen the euro area. Why are we short of banking union?Why are we short of capital markets union, so that if I have a small enterprise in France, I canactually borrow the funding that is available in the Netherlands and we can have a consistent anddeeper system of financing our enterprises. These are tools that we have to use to bring moreharmony, more consistency between the markets. It cannot be only about the monetary union. Ithas to go beyond that to be solid and to be more efficient.Does the weak economy in Europe worry you? 3 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
Clearly, growth is not at potential and hopefully by 2022 – this is in our forecast – we will be closeto potential, at 1.4% growth. We have to use all the tools. We will do what we have to do, but Ithink that some fiscal policies should be applied and I’m very pleased to see that the Netherlandsare deploying fiscal policies in a very sensible and wise way in order to respond to the situationand to use the space that is available without even touching the special reserve fund that hasbeen set up. But others should follow suit and should be inspired by the Dutch example.About the Dutch budget surplus, as IMF Managing Director you always said that it wouldbe good if the Dutch Government spent more. Do you think the same, as the ECBPresident?This is happening because what I understand from the forecast for the next two years is that theywill develop spending on education, on infrastructure, on fighting climate change. This is exactlywhat those countries that have fiscal space should do, and I think this is very, very welcome.You still say the same, but our Minister of Finance…No, I said that I admire what is being considered.Yes, because our Minister of Finance, Wopke Hoekstra, was a bit irritated when you saidthat we have to spend more.I completely understand that he was irritated. We discussed that when we met at the Eurogroupthe other day, and he gave me full details of what the funds are and what the expenditures will beand what the spending will be. I think it is very sensible to do that, particularly to invest in thefuture productivity of the Dutch economy at large. I think it’s great.You said it just days before you started as ECB President.So I was not yet committing the ECB.So you understand his irritation?I do. I always try to understand why people get irritated because then I can either explain my caseand argue it, if I think that it is right. But if it is not right and if I stand to be contradicted, I fullyunderstand that and I respect that.You are getting along well now?Yes, we do, absolutely!Why should we spend more?Because the world is changing, because we want to remain productive and competitive,because the very nasty development that we see on the horizon had to be addressed and forthat, we need to spend money. We don’t want climate change to damage our countries. Wewant our kids to be educated. We want artificial intelligence to be something that they play withon a regular basis. We want them to be stronger going forward. So to do that, investment isneeded.Investment in the Green Deal, because it’s not only about economic growth these days.No, it’s sustainable growth and certainly the Green Deal is remarkable in that respect. The 50measures that have been identified by Ursula von der Leyen are good ones, but each country,each member state has to sort of question its own public expenditure and ask itself: is that goingto make a difference for climate change purposes? How should I change it, if not? I think that theNetherlands is clearly looking at those issues. Your country has always been very attentive to 4 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
nature around it anyway.You suggested that the ECB also has a responsibility when it comes to climate change;in what way? Your mandate is price stability, isn’t it?Correct, but to identify price stability, you need to assess risk, you need to forecast growth, youneed to understand better where the economies are going. And if you don’t factor this into the riskassessment and the forecast and the models that underline that, you don’t take into accountclimate change. You’re missing a big chunk of the risks that are looming on the horizon and thatwill be upon us much quicker than we think. So if only in respect of that work, we must takeclimate change into account. Added to that, when we invest, we have to be mindful as well andhow we do that is being debated in our strategy review. Plus when we do supervision and whenwe look at how banks are valuing their liabilities and their assets, we need to ask them whetherthey take climate change risk into account as well. So there are multiple ramifications where weneed to ask ourselves: do I need to change? Is climate change really part of my thinking? I willinsist on that.At this moment, the British people are voting. How important is the outcome for Europe?I think the outcome that will close the loop of uncertainty that we have lived with for the lastcouple of years is very important. Business people and any economic actor, whether you’re in afamily or whether you’re in enterprise, will tell you: “I need to know where I stand and what is theenvironment where I will invest, operate in? If we don’t know, then we don’t invest. Then we don’tcreate jobs, then we don’t trade”. And that’s what has happened a little bit with the UK, becausewe didn’t know and we still don’t know to this day, what is the likely outcome. At the end of todaywe might know a little bit more. It won’t be final because we still have probably a transition periodwhich needs to be gone through, but at least some clarity will emerge out of tonight, I hope.If Boris Johnson wins, Brexit will happen. What will be the effect on the Europeaneconomy?There will be negative consequences in the short term for all economies, predominantly the UK,and within the European Union some countries will be more at risk than others. Ireland is a casein point which will be sort of first affected. The Netherlands might be affected as well because ithas a close relationship with the UK. Germany as well, the automotive industry. But clearly themajor impact will be on the UK.Mario Draghi will go into history as the man who saved the euro. What would you likeyour legacy to be?I’m too young in the job to tell you!Give us something…I just hope that at the end of my term, the euro area and the euro system are even more relevantthan they are today.In what way?More relevant in that it will serve the Europeans consistently and better. It will bring them moretogether and it will reinforce the unbelievable community that has been formed as a result of theEuropean founding fathers of way back, and the euro area founders of a few years back.Christine Lagarde, thank you so much for this interview.Thank you. 5 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches

Gent Sejko: The importance of studying technological anddemographic developments disrupting labour, finance and marketsWelcome remarks by Mr Gent Sejko, Governor of the Bank of Albania, at the 13th SEEEconomic Research Workshop, Tirana, 5 December 2019.*   *   *Dear Ambassador Maître,Dear guests and speakers from academia, central banks and research institutions,Dear participants,It is a great pleasure for me to open the proceedings of the 13th SEE Economic ResearchWorkshop, in which we present and open for discussion research projects undertaken by theBank of Albania in the current year, and have the opportunity to get feedback from colleaguesfrom academia, central banks and research institutions worldwide.This is a very important event for the Bank of Albania, since all the projects that will be discussedduring the two days of the workshop are designed to help the analysis, decision making andimplementation in the areas of monetary policy and financial stability as well as other centralbank aspects.Based on this careful formal analysis, our policies have been successful in preserving monetary,macroeconomic and financial stability. Despite hardships, our economy has registered positivegrowth rates, and our banking system’s performance has been stable. The banking sector is wellcapitalized and profitable, non-performing loans have decreased and banks continue to supporteconomic activity with credit, while managing potential shocks originated from the external sectorof the economy.The agenda is rich and covers the most important areas of research related to traditional centralbank activity. In these two days, discussions will focus on monetary policy, financial stability,economic modelling and forecasting, risk assessment and management, which are all traditionalinstruments in the central bank toolkit and need to be improved constantly. It is very important tonote that, in addition to these traditional topics, the workshop will discuss research in new andimportant areas such as: digitalization of financial services, structural reforms, healthcare and itsimplication for central bank objectives and national welfare. Technological developmentsdisrupting traditional labour, financial products and markets, and demographic developmentsmay impose some of the most important challenges to our societies and institutions. Therefore,it is important to study and adequately understand these phenomena.In addition, we are glad and eager to discuss research findings from a number of authors whocome from academia, central banks and other research institutions. The ideas andmethodologies that are embedded in their research will introduce our researchers andeconomists to new ideas, will help them extend their research agenda, and will reveal potentialopportunities of cooperation in the future.I believe that research in these and other innovative areas, like green finance, will develop furtherand become traditional topics in central banks’ research agenda.  For this reason, I challenge ourresearchers to consider these trends in their future research agenda. Continuous enhancementof research topics and methodologies is a must for a central bank.In this respect, I would like to thank Ambassador Maître, the Swiss Government, the StateSecretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO) and its Bilateral Assistance and Capacity Building forCentral Banks (BCC) program for supporting research activity at the Bank of Albania. This 1 / 2BIS central bankers' speeches
cooperation has been a significant instrument for improving our research work and exposing it toacademic and international research community. Our cooperation will continue in the future toimprove research methodologies and products. We are currently working with SECO toward theoptimization and institutionalization of research agenda and research implementation in centralbanks. These important issues will be discussed in a jointly-organized workshop with all BCCpartners on capacity building for central banks, in Tirana in spring 2020.Dear ladies and gentlemen,Our SEE Research Workshop has become a cherished tradition for Bank of Albania and centralbanks of the SEE region. It is a great pleasure, and we are very happy to see that the workshopcontinues to generate interest beyond the SEE region and central banking community. The list ofparticipants has expanded to include speakers from academic institutions in the EU, the US andSouth-Eastern Asia, as well as from international financial institutions.Your participation is contributing to broadening and enriching our network and we hope thatdiscussions will help our researchers to improve their work and strengthen their researchrecommendations.These days, your participation in the workshop takes another and even more significant meaningin the wake of the tragic consequences caused by the strong earthquake. It helps to show that,despite many losses, we are resilient and will continue to work to overcome the emotional andeconomic hardships of this tragic event, shed the desperation, fear and despair, and return tonormal activity.   I wish the workshop a great success, and all guests and participants a pleasant stay in Tirana! 2 / 2BIS central bankers' speeches
SPEECHFinancial innovation for inclusive growth: a European approachSpeech by Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, at the conference Financial Integration and Inclusive Development – A View from the Mediterranean Countries, jointly organised by Banco de España, OECD and European Institute of the Mediterranean (IEMed)Madrid, 13 December 2019IntroductionThe benefits of technological innovation are tangible: we can see them and experience them in our everyday lives. Financial services are an integral part of our daily activities and are deeply affected by advances in technology. Payment services have changed considerably in recent years, driven by new technologies and shifts in consumer preferences. Instant person-to-person (P2P) retail payment solutions are now a reality in many countries[1]and are increasingly available for consumers and businesses to use around the clock. Mobile P2P payment solutions allow people to simply use a smartphone to transfer money and only require the phone number or email address of the recipient to complete a transaction. At the point-of-sale, large global schemes such as Google Pay and Apple Pay use contactless technologies to enable quick and easy payments. In some markets, Quick Response (QR) codes mean making a payment as easy as taking a picture with a smartphone. Meanwhile, new service providers piggyback on existing banking and payment infrastructures to offer online payment solutions that cater to our digital lifestyle. While I am convinced that technological progress needs to be fostered and not hindered, I can’t but notice that its benefits have failed to reach all corners of our societies – in particular underprivileged populations and vulnerable groups, for whom financial innovation has not yet made a difference. And while in certain regions mobile money has given millions of customers access to our financial systems, more work is needed to ensure access for the 1.7 billion adults who currently do not have a transaction account.[2]Furthermore, in stark contrast to other ubiquitous technologies, existing cross-border payments are not always “up to speed” and cost-efficient. In fact, while the global average cost of remittances has decreased, it is still well above the 3% target indicator for sustainable development by 2030.[3] At the same time, the importance of remittances has grown: they have overtaken foreign direct investment as the largest source of external financing to emerging economies.[4] These facts and figures should not come as a surprise to anyone in this room. Yet they caused quite a stir earlier this year, and rightly so, when global stablecoin initiatives made headlines by pledging to address these long-standing issues. “Same business, same risk, same rules” So can stablecoins deliver on their promises? Retail stablecoins could be accessed and used for making payments irrespective of whether their users have a bank account. In principle, retail stablecoins could provide a functional means of payment and even serve as a gateway for other financial services[5]– two of the three fundamental functions of transaction accounts.[6] The third is to safely store value, but I will cover that separately. Global stablecoin initiatives are built on a sufficiently broad network to maximise acceptance for a wide range of use cases and are designed to work across country borders. Stablecoin ecosystems could also potentially integrate additional financial products offered by financial institutions acting as partners, should the latter decide to play an important role in this area. However, to increase financial inclusion, retail stablecoins must successfully address outstanding issues such as high costs, a cash-in/cash-out infrastructure, identification and know-your-customer requirements. These are formidable barriers to 
overcome. Moreover, stablecoins must be designed and implemented so that they do not compromise other public objectives such as anti-money laundering and consumer protection –to name just two.We must also recognise that a stablecoin’s business model is based, first and foremost, on its ability to minimise fluctuations in its price relative to fiat currencies. Stablecoins therefore promise users a stable value and the possibility to exchange their holdings at all times.[7]But these are not bank deposits in your fiat currency. The value of a stablecoin will crucially depend on its governance, risk management and the value of the underlying assets or funds portfolio. A mere promise that proceeds from the sales of coins will be invested in low-risk financial instruments will not be enough to ensure the stability of the coin. The industry should therefore responsibly manage users’ expectations, making it clear that losses could occur and they would not be covered by the traditional financial stability net, which includes deposit guarantee schemes and central banks’ role as lenders of last resort. In this respect, the term stablecoin is a misnomer. They are not stable and they are not coins, for that matter.So it is far from certain that stablecoins can deliver on their promises, and it is clear that they could pose risks to consumers and the financial system. It is therefore understandable that authorities around the world are calling for stablecoins to be regulated.[8]The same rules must be applied to all activities that give rise to the same risks, irrespective of the technologies used or the identity of the service providers. In other words, we should uphold the principle of “same business, same risk, same rules”, which is at the core of technology-neutral regulation. Providers of innovative services should not be penalised just because they use new technologies. Similarly, portraying existing financial products as something new by using innovative technologies to circumvent regulation must not be rewarded.Challenges for both private and public sectors The announcement of the “Libra” global stablecoin initiative was a wake-up call for both the private and the public sectors to press ahead and make further progress on issues such as cross-border payments. We must admit that there is indeed an unmet consumer demand for payment services that are faster, cheaper and easier to use and that can work across borders. The combination of rapid technological progress and the entrance into the market of large global digital firms is putting established banks and payment service providers under pressure to innovate and compete on scale and user convenience. For instance, the combined volume of new credit provided by fintech and bigtech in 2017 exceeded 500 billion US dollars – a tenfold increase from 2014.[9]Financial institutions will need to rise to the challenge. However, to date, European payment service providers have struggled to develop a common solution that can match up to large global digital firms’ initiatives in terms of immediacy, convenience, scale and branding power. In particular, the European instant payments landscape remains fragmented, with no European solution emerging for point-of-sale and online payments.[10]The public sector is already responding to the advent of stablecoins in a coordinated manner. Work is underway under the umbrella of the G20 to assess their risks, examine the applicability of the existing rules, and identify gaps in the current regulatory and oversight framework. Given the cross-border nature of global stablecoin arrangements, such international coordination is crucial to ensure consistency across borders and prevent regulatory arbitrage. Otherwise, providers of stablecoins, or any new financial services for that matter, will have every incentive to operate in the most lenient regulatory environment. We have to make sure that there is no scope for regulatory arbitrage. For this reason, we need to have information-sharing arrangements in place and rely on cooperative oversight where appropriate.Putting the response to stablecoins aside, there is no shortage of initiatives from central banks’ and standard-setting bodies to increase their knowledge of technological innovations and their implications for the financial sector. Indeed, a number of internationally coordinated efforts have tackled issues related to financial inclusion and remittances. Nevertheless, I have to admit that the latest developments have raised more fundamental questions about the suitability of existing forms of money for meeting the new and emerging needs of economic actors, the role of the public sector and, more recently, the possibility that central banks could issue their own digital currencies.In this environment, fulfilling the central bank’s mandate has taken on a new dimension and requires an active role in driving change.Eurosystem initiativesThe ECB is not the only driver of change in this field, but we are determined to play a proactive role. Our efforts, are focused on four main areas:First, we are investing in instant payments infrastructure. Since 2014, the ECB has fostered the development of a pan-European instant payments scheme under the European Payments Council. The 
Euro Retail Payments Board – a high-level strategic body tasked with fostering integration, innovation and competitiveness of euro retail payments – continues to build momentum on instant payments, by identifying outstanding challenges to adoption and recommending measures to overcome these challenges. Last year, the ECB launched TARGET Instant Payment Settlement (TIPS), a platform that enables payment service providers to transfer funds to their customers in real time, on a 24/7/365 basis – and that settles in central bank money. Second, we are treading new ground. The ECB has been exploring how to apply new technologies, particularly distributed ledger technologies, to financial market infrastructures both within the European central banking community and globally through “Stella” – our joint research project with the Bank of Japan. We are also assessing the value of central bank digital currencies (CBDC) for European citizens and the economy. We are analysing the forms CBDC could take with a view to fulfilling its underlying motivations while mitigating possible negative consequences for monetary stability and financial intermediation. Third, we are reviewing our oversight of payments. The aim is to future-proof the existing Eurosystem oversight frameworks for payment instruments, schemes and arrangements by applying a holistic, agile and functional approach. In accordance with its mandate the ECB, together with Eurosystem central banks, is preparing to apply its oversight framework for payment systems to innovative projects, including stablecoin arrangements. As the payments landscape continues to evolve, we will work with other international authorities to ensure that the Eurosystem requirements remain relevant by closing any gaps that innovative solutions might create. We also support the creation of cooperative oversight frameworks whenever a payment arrangement is relevant to multiple jurisdictions.Fourth and finally, we are reforming the European retail payments strategy. Earlier this month the ECB’s Governing Council decided to relaunch its retail payments strategy. One of our aims is to actively foster pan-European market initiatives for retail payments at the location of the purchase or interaction.[11]ConclusionLet me conclude. The benefits of financial innovation should be available for all to see and experience. Financial institutions have a window of opportunity to leverage technological advances to deliver innovative payment and financial solutions that meet consumers’ expectations of convenience, affordability, safety and global acceptance. European stakeholders should join forces or brace themselves for external disruption with potentially far-reaching implications for public policy. There is strong political momentum to make the financial system more inclusive – starting with access to transaction accounts and cross-border payments. Central banks have an important role to play both individually and collectively in the international community. The ECB is drawing on this momentum to give new impetus to a European strategy on retail payments that is fit for the global challenges ahead. As a central bank, we will continue to monitor how new technologies are changing payment behaviour and project the potential of innovative ways of making payments cheaper, more efficient and more inclusive onto our tasks and activities to the benefit of the European people and beyond.[1]Currently, fast retail payment systems operate in 45 jurisdictions. This is projected to rise towards 60 in the near future.

  News conference   Page 1/4    Berne, 12 December 2019 Fritz Zurbrügg Introductory remarks by Fritz Zurbrügg  In my remarks today, I will begin with the current assessment of the situation at the big banks and domestically focused banks. I will then go on to discuss the significance of climate change for financial stability. The final part of my speech will focus on the issuance of the new banknote series, which was completed in September. Big banks I will start with the situation at the big banks. Both Credit Suisse and UBS have made significant progress since the ‘too big to fail’ regulations were introduced almost ten years ago. They have strengthened their capital bases, reduced their risk positions and implemented key organisational measures as regards crisis management.. With respect to resilience, Credit Suisse and UBS have already achieved their targets. Both banks have increased their regulatory capital to the target levels and thus meet all final requirements on a consolidated basis. Compliance with the requirements of the ‘too big to fail’ regulations is necessary to ensure adequate resilience of the two Swiss big banks. This is confirmed by our loss potential analyses of both banks as well as historical loss experience during the last financial crisis. With respect to resolution, the statutory deadline for finalising the Swiss emergency plans is the end of this year. In their plans, Credit Suisse and UBS have to demonstrate that they would be able to maintain their systemically important functions without interruption in a crisis. FINMA, as the competent authority, is currently checking whether the submitted plans meet this requirement. As for the overall assessment of the ‘too big to fail’ regulations, the SNB shares the Federal Council’s view that the Swiss regulatory approach is consistent with international 
 Berne, 12 December 2019 Fritz Zurbrügg News conference   Page 2/4   developments and that no fundamental change to this approach is necessary.1 At the same time, the SNB also shares the view that there is a need for selective adjustments. This applies in particular to funding in resolution, which is aimed at ensuring that the big banks have sufficient liquidity reserves in a crisis. To this end, together with FINMA and the SNB, the Federal Department of Finance is reviewing whether current liquidity requirements for the two big banks are sufficient to cover estimated funding needs in the event of a crisis, or whether regulatory adjustments are necessary. Domestically focused banks I shall now turn to the domestically focused banks. There has been little change in their situation since the Financial Stability Report was published in June. Interest rate margins of domestically focused banks remain under pressure and declined further in the first half of the year. Many banks have responded to this challenge in recent years by making efficiency improvements, for instance by digitalising their business processes. At the same time, numerous banks have increased their risk appetite, especially in mortgage lending. This development can also be seen in the course of 2019 to date. Affordability risks of new mortgages financing residential investment property are high and have risen further. These developments have taken place against a background of persistent imbalances in the mortgage and real estate markets. Both mortgage-lending volume and prices for single-family houses and apartments continued to rise at a moderate rate in 2019. Although prices of residential investment property have stagnated of late, there is still a risk of a price correction in this segment in particular. On the one hand, this is due to the sharp price increases in previous years. On the other, larger numbers of vacant dwellings suggest that brisk construction activity in rental apartments may have led to an oversupply. Despite banks’ high risk appetite and the persistent imbalances in the markets, SNB stress tests suggest that the resilience of the domestically focused banks remains adequate overall. Thanks to robust capitalisation, most of these banks would be able to absorb the losses incurred in adverse scenarios. Given the risks I just mentioned, this is positive. It is crucial for the stability of the financial system that banks continue to hold sufficient capital to be able to cover the risks on their books. Ongoing pressure on margins means that the incentive for domestically focused banks to take on risks remains high. This applies to mortgage lending in particular. The revised self-regulation rules for banks in the residential investment property segment, which come into force at the beginning of 2020, should help to prevent a further build-up of risks in this segment.

Climate change and financial stability Let me now turn to climate change, a subject already addressed by my colleague Thomas Jordan. Climate change can pose longer-term risks to financial stability. There are primarily two ways in which climate risks can affect the financial system. One is through the increase in the frequency and severity of natural disasters with all their consequences, and the other is through changes to climate policy and to the corresponding regulations. It is the responsibility of individual financial system participants to fully understand climate risks relevant to them and to correctly assess the potential consequences from a business perspective – just as with other risks. For its part, the SNB is focusing on how climate risks could impact on the stability of the Swiss banking system as a whole, as well as on systemically important financial market infrastructures. Currently, the SNB considers the likelihood of risks linked to climate change threatening the stability of the banking system as a whole to be low. In the case of financial market infrastructures, climate risks are minimised, for example, by stipulating that technical facilities be distributed over different locations. The significance of climate risks to financial stability may change over time. The SNB therefore considers it a priority to continuously monitor developments and review its assessment.  Completion of the ninth banknote series To finish, let me turn to a very different topic – the issuance of the ninth banknote series. The development of the new banknotes was a complex, long-term project with exacting design and production requirements. The 100-franc note, which entered circulation on 12 September 2019, was the sixth and final denomination of the SNB’s new banknote series. Since the issuance of the first of the new banknotes, the 50-franc note in April 2016, feedback on the new banknotes has been very positive. The new series has been well received by the public. The new substrate Durasafe® has also proven a success. Preliminary evaluations suggest that this substrate should ensure a longer lifespan for the banknotes. The issuance of modern and forgery-proof banknotes is a central task of the SNB. It is important to us that we are able to meet the expectations of the Swiss population. The new banknotes use state-of-the-art technology, and are robust and easy to handle. The entire logistical processes, including the modification of ATMs to accommodate the new notes, also proceeded without significant problems. The eighth banknote series will continue to be legal tender until further notice. The SNB plans to announce the recall date for the eighth-series notes in the course of 2020. The old notes will 
 Berne, 12 December 2019 Fritz Zurbrügg News conference   Page 4/4   lose their status as legal tender from the date of recall, although it will still be possible to exchange them at the SNB or at one of our agencies. The partial revision of the Currency and Payment Instruments Act (CPIA), recently adopted by parliament, abolishes the previous deadline for exchanging banknotes with effect from 1 January 2020. It thus allows for banknotes from the sixth series, issued in 1976, and all subsequent series to be exchanged at any time. 
   13.12.2019 Welcome address Conference “Financial integration and inclusive development: A view from the Mediterranean Countries”/Banco de España e Instituto del Mediterráneo (IEMed) Pablo Hernández de Cos Governor    
 2/3 Good morning ladies and gentlemen,   It is a great pleasure for me to welcome you all to this Conference on Financial integration and inclusive development: A view from the Mediterranean Countries, hosted by Banco de España and jointly organised with the European Institute of the Mediterranean (IEMed) and the support of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).  Let me start by thanking our colleagues from the European Institute of the Mediterranean and from the OECD for their cooperation in organising this Conference. The European Institute of the Mediterranean (IEMed), created in 1989 with the participation of the Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation, the Government of the Autonomous Community of Cataluña, and the Barcelona City Council, incorporates a broad representation of civil society and is a leading institution in the analysis of Euro-Mediterranean relations.  In accordance with the principles of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership's Barcelona Process, and with the objectives of the Union for the Mediterranean, the aim of the IEMed is to contribute to mutual understanding, exchange and cooperation between the different Mediterranean countries. And Banco de España is delighted to collaborate to this objective in the field of economic and financial relationships. Our second partner today, the OECD, is playing an invaluable role in the international arena to shape policies that are decisively contributing to the well-being for all. It is no exaggeration to say that the world count on the leadership of the OECD in many fronts such as those that we are going to discuss today: financial inclusion, capital flows, migration, among others.  This is the fifth edition of this Conference organised by IEMed, with the support of the Banco de España, to discuss economic and financial matters in the Mediterranean region. The first and third editions took place in Barcelona, in 2014 and 2017, the second in Rabat in 2015 and the fourth in Tunisia in 2018, on those occasions with the support and hospitality of Bank Al-Maghrib and the Central Bank of Tunisia. Past editions of this conference had provided useful exchanges of ideas between different actors with interests in the economic and financial developments in this region. I firmly believe that forums like this are particularly relevant to shape public policy in times of change as those we are witnessing today. The deep-rooted transformations in economic and financial relations globally force us to re-think the design of economic policies in order to better contribute to the progress of our society. In particular, these forums are instrumental for central banks in its role of providing guidance for economic policies that are not in their mandates. Let me add that in order to exert this role of assessing public policies, central banks need to be granted with political and operational independence, in order to provide recommendations free from political pressure or vested interests.  The theme of this Conference, Financial integration and inclusive development, is particularly timely at this current juncture of the world economy. Global economic growth is at its lowest level since the global financial crisis, partly as a consequence of the high level of uncertainty surrounding trade and international relations. This weakness of the global economic landscape is adding to the new challenges that have emerged over the last decades: population aging, migration, security threats, the emergence of new economic and political powers, and climate change, to mention only some. And this evolution has taken place in an era of increasing globalization, that is being threatened by the emergence 
  3/3 of protectionist measures, and of digitalization and rapid development of new technologies. Together, these developments constitute a new frontier for policies that make it necessary to promote mutual understanding and make extensive coordinated efforts in the field of policies. In order to preserve the benefits derived from financial interconnectedness and technological innovation, it is now of the essence to put in place an internationally agreed response that allows to achieve the benefits of innovation while ensuring the mitigation of its potential risks. Policy-makers have the responsibility to support the research and analysis to base to foster growth and fight inequalities.   In this Conference we are going to debate on a number of challenges that our countries are currently facing: from technological innovations in finance to migration flows in search for better opportunities, going through increasing financial interdependences or the need of boosting financial education. I have no doubt that the quality of the discussions we have today will allow us to deepen our understanding of these challenges and, hopefully, allow us to draw some useful conclusion in terms of economic policy.   I leave the floor now to Mr. Isidro González, Deputy Secretary General of the Union for the Mediterranean, thanking him as well as you all for your presence here today, and thanking Mr. Senén Florensa, President of the Executive Committee of IEMed, for the cooperation in the organisation of this event.  Now, Isidro, the floor is yours. 
   13.12.2019 Session: “Central banks, financial inclusion and digitalization: harnessing technology for inclusive growth” Conference “Financial integration and inclusive development: A view from the Mediterranean Countries”/Banco de España e Instituto del Mediterráneo (IEMed) Pablo Hernández de Cos Governor    
 2/3 Good morning. It is a privilege for me to chair this panel on the importance of financial inclusion and how digitalisation can contribute to it. It’s all the more a privilege given that the panel includes governors from four countries with broad experience in promoting financial inclusion, where significant initiatives in this area have been launched with the central bank taking the lead.  Access to financial services continues to be a primary problem globally. On the latest World Bank estimates, almost 1.7 billion adults do not have access to an account offering basic functionalities and, therefore, they are excluded from basic services such as payments, credit and saving. This has obvious repercussions for economic and social development, as there is a positive correlation both with growth and employment1, and it is thus essential to understand the causes behind it. In this respect, most studies have highlighted the fact that, although there may in specific cases be voluntary factors relating mainly to cultural or religious aspects, the explanation for this lack of access to financial services is usually to be found in involuntary factors. These include most notably a lack of funds for saving, cost, distance from the nearest branch, a lack of education and the absence of the financial infrastructures needed to improve the availability of financial services.  It is indeed here where new technologies can contribute decisively to overcoming or lowering these barriers. Technology can reduce many fixed costs, traditionally associated with the development of financial services, while providing for a greater adaptation of supply on the basis of each society’s idiosyncratic characteristics. Unsurprisingly, then, the technological proposals linked to financial inclusion hail from different areas. We can find them in traditional financial institutions, in the new fintech companies, in telecommunications corporations and in the large technology consortiums known as bigtech.  As to scope, one of the activities concentrating the bulk of the initiatives is payments. Thus, in the past decade we have seen so-called mobile money – i.e. transactional services offered mainly by mobile operators – become commonplace. Adding to these, more recently digital wallet solutions have emerged with multiple functionalities and specific proposals for international remittances. Aside from the progress in payment solutions, developments on intermediation markets are providing for improvements in the financing of those groups with a greater degree of financial exclusion, such as microenterprises and small agricultural producers. However, these developments are not spontaneous or uniform from one country to another. The role of regulators and their policies are thus important, at least regarding two aspects: the promotion of the use and development of technology, including the incorporation of technological improvements into financial services provision; and the need to ensure that headway in financial inclusion does not impair consumer safeguards or financial stability. I would like to offer some brief thoughts on each of these two points. Promoting the use and development of new technologies. Logically, developing technological solutions requires suitable telecommunications infrastructures. They must provide widespread access to the Internet, including in rural areas, while seeking to improve digital education and offer safeguards against vulnerabilities such as cyber threats. We should not forget that approximately two-thirds of the adult population without access to                                                                                               1 See Cull et al (2014). 
  3/3 banks do have a mobile phone. And, as the World Bank points out, these devices are proving essential for improving accessibility to financial services. Moreover, the development of a stable institutional framework – paving the way for competition, providing legal security to the new financial proposals and ensuring an appropriate level of interoperability – is vital for generating the necessary confidence in financial services. Also, aspects such as legal recognition of digital identification, the use of biometrics in identification and ease of access to public data in “Know your costumer” (KYC) procedures, are matters the different tiers of government can push and which catalyse significantly the progress in financial inclusion.  Monitoring the risks inherent in financial innovation. Along with the aforementioned risks linked to cyber threats, financial innovation, in particular that aimed at the most vulnerable population segments, can cause situations of over-indebtedness, market abuse and fraud. This process must then be accompanied by financial education actions, the strengthening of consumer safeguard measures and the development of data privacy policies. But we should not lose sight of the speed at which these innovations develop. Such speed poses difficulties for setting regulations in place since, on many occasions, their implementation can only come about when the use of certain practices has become widespread on the market. Hence, the use of formulas such as sandboxes or innovation hubs may help the regulators act more nimbly while creating an environment in which innovators can better anticipate regulatory trends. Lastly, and before giving way to the panellists, the true protagonists of this debate, I would mention the importance of international coordination and cooperation. Many of the challenges surrounding financial inclusion and the use of new technologies are common to all countries. This is why the role of organisations such as the IMF, with the Bali declaration, and the Alliance for Financial Inclusion, with the Maya declaration, is pivotal to boosting the use of new technologies in this field. We should also not forget the role that global companies such as the bigtech can play. Indeed, financial inclusion is one of the essential elements highlighted by Facebook in its proposal for a global means of payment, its so-called Libra. In view of such initiatives, with a worldwide and immediate scope, you will agree with me that international coordination is not an option but an obligation.  
Yutaka Harada Member of the Policy Board Economic Activity, Prices, and Monetary Policy in Japan  Speech at a Meeting with Business Leaders in Oita Bank of Japan December 5, 2019   (English translation based on the Japanese original) 
 1  Introduction Thank you for giving me this opportunity to exchange views with you and for having taken the time to be here despite your busy schedules. It is indeed a great honor to be here today. Please allow me to express my gratitude for your great cooperation with the business operations of the Bank of Japan, particularly of the Oita Branch.  The Bank has implemented quantitative and qualitative monetary easing -- or QQE for short -- since April 2013 and introduced various additional measures such as the negative interest rate policy, yield curve control, strengthening the framework for continuous monetary easing, and clarification of forward guidance for policy rates, all with the aim of achieving the inflation target of 2 percent.  As a result of these measures, Japan's economy has been improving. It is true that the economic expansion has not exactly been robust, reflecting such events as the consumption tax hike in fiscal 2014 from 5 percent to 8 percent, the latest hike in October 2019 from 8 percent to 10 percent, the slowdown in the global economy observed from mid-2015 through early 2016 and from the second half of 2018 to the present, and the downtrend in the working-age population. Nevertheless, the economy has managed to continue its expansion so far.  Today, I would like to explain monetary policy measures conducted by the Bank and what they have achieved. First and foremost, the achievements are obvious. The unemployment rate has declined to its lowest level in nearly three decades and productivity has been increasing. The challenge lies elsewhere; namely, in the fact that prices have not been rising. It is increasingly being argued that interest rates consequently have remained low, eroding banks' profitability. However, I believe that the deterioration in banks' profitability is caused by the structural problem that banks are accumulating more deposits than they can lend. Banks therefore need to deal with this problem. Moreover, if interest rates were raised, this would lead to a decrease in the demand for loans, a decline in prices, an appreciation of the yen, an economic downturn, an increase in bankruptcies (raising banks' credit costs), and so forth. Therefore, raising interest rates would not solve the problem. Considering that the current low interest rates are partly attributable to the deflationary monetary policies 
 2  pursued in the past, as I will describe later, the only way out is to maintain the current accommodative monetary policy in order to achieve sustained expansion of economic activity until we see increases in prices and interest rates.  I. Monetary Easing Measures Table 1 presents an outline of the monetary policy measures conducted by the Bank since April 2013, when it introduced bold monetary policy.  Table 1 Timeline of the Bank's Monetary Policy Measures                       Jan 13Introduction of the "price stability target" of 2 percentIntroduction of QQE- Monetary base: increase at an annual pace of about 60 to 70 trillion yen- Amount outstanding of the Bank's JGB holdings: increase at an annual pace of about 50 trillion yenExpansion of QQE- Monetary base: increase at an annual pace of about 80 trillion yen- Amount outstanding of the Bank's JGB holdings: increase at an annual pace of about 80 trillion yenIntroduction of "QQE with a Negative Interest Rate"- A negative interest rate of minus 0.1 percent is applied to the Policy-Rate Balances in current accounts   held by financial institutions at the Bank. "Enhancement of Monetary Easing"- Amount outstanding of the Bank's ETF holdings: increase at an annual pace of about 6 trillion yenIntroduction of "QQE with Yield Curve Control"- Yield curve control　　The Bank will purchase Japanese government bonds (JGBs) so that 10-year JGB yields will remain      more or less at the current level (around zero percent). With regard to the amount of JGBs to be　　purchased, the Bank will conduct purchases more or less in line with the current pace.- Inflation-overshooting commitment "Strengthening the Framework for Continuous Powerful Monetary Easing"- Introduction of forward guidance for policy rates　　The Bank intends to maintain the current extremely low levels of short- and long-term interest rates　　 for an extended period of time, taking into account uncertainties regarding economic activity       and prices including the effects of the consumption tax hike scheduled to take place in October 2019. - Yield curve control      The yields may move upward and downward to some extent mainly depending on developments in      economic activity and prices.      With regard to the amount of JGBs to be purchased, the Bank will conduct purchases in a flexible      manner so that their amount outstanding will increase at an annual pace of about 80 trillion yen.Clarification of forward guidance for policy rates　　The Bank intends to maintain the current extremely low levels of short- and long-term interest rates　　for an extended period of time, at least through around spring 2020, taking into account uncertainties      regarding economic activity and prices including developments in overseas economies and the effects      of the scheduled consumption tax hike.Oct 19Introduction of new forward guidance for policy rates    As for the policy rates, the Bank expects short- and long-term interest rates to remain at their present    or lower levels as long as it is necessary to pay close attention to the possibility that the momentum    toward achieving the price stability target will be lost.Apr 19Apr 13Oct 14Jan 16Jul 16Sep 16Jul 18
 3  As a result of these measures, real interest rates -- nominal interest rates minus expected inflation rates -- have greatly declined due to the decrease in nominal interest rates and the rise in inflation expectations.  The decline in real interest rates has stimulated investment, boosted stock prices in Japan, and led to a depreciation of the yen. Rising stock prices further raise investment and lead households that have become wealthier to increase their consumption expenditure. It is through these channels that economic activity started to improve.  Next, I would like to explain my stance on the new forward guidance introduced in October 2019, which is shown in Table 1. The forward guidance in April 2019 stated that the Bank "intends to maintain the current extremely low levels of short- and long-term interest rates for an extended period of time, at least through around spring 2020." While I thought that clarifying the forward guidance was desirable, I opposed the policy proposal on the basis that the Bank should indicate data-dependent guidance to further clarify its link with the price stability target.1 Under the new guidance, the Bank "expects short- and long-term interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels as long as it is necessary to pay close attention to the possibility that the momentum toward achieving the price stability target will be lost." Although it is somewhat ambiguous, I voted for this proposal because the guidance became more akin to data-dependent guidance, in which the link to the price stability target is clearer, and allowed for the possibility of a future interest rate reduction. However, I continued to oppose allowing long-term yields to move in a more flexible manner. Since I already have elaborated on my reasons for this in the past, let me move on to the next topic.2  II. Achievements of Bold Monetary Easing Improvement in economic activity can be seen in various fields. There are a lot of indicators that show improvement, such as employment, productivity, fiscal conditions, investment, exports, corporate profits, and wages; moreover, perceptions that the economy is recovering,                                                  1 For my opinion regarding data-dependent forward guidance, see Yutaka Harada, "Economic Activity, Prices, and Monetary Policy in Japan: Speech at a Meeting with Business Leaders in Yamanashi," Bank of Japan, March 2019. 2 See the reference cited in footnote 1. 
 4  the suicide rate, the income distribution, and women's entry into the labor market provide further indications of improvement.3 Of these indicators, I would like to talk today about the improvements in employment, productivity, and fiscal conditions.  Improvement in Employment The improvement in employment is clear from the rise in the active job openings-to-applicants ratio, the decline in the unemployment rate, the increase in the number of employees, and other indicators. The increase in the number of employees is due to the rise in the employment rates of women and the elderly in particular. While there remains the issue that many of the women and the elderly are not regular but non-regular employees and only work short hours, the situation certainly is an improvement from the past. In an aging society, the fact that the employment rate of the elderly actually has risen holds great importance. The problem with an aging population is that the number of people who cannot work because of old age is increasing relative to the number of working-age people. It is worrying that it seems the ratio of the elderly (those aged 65 and over) to the working-age population (those aged 15-64) will rise from 47 percent in 2018 to 70 percent in 2045 (and then further rise moderately to 75 percent in 2065). However, if we assume that the working-age population comprises those aged 15-69 and the elderly population consists of those aged 70 and over, the ratio of the elderly to the working-age population will reach only 49 percent in 2045 and 55 percent in 2065. Looked at this way, the increase in the employment rate of the elderly brought about by monetary easing can be regarded as good news for Japan's aging society.  Next, I would like to look at the employment situation, focusing on the employment environment for the young. Chart 1 shows the unemployment rate, the youth unemployment rate, and the job offer rates for university students as of October and December of the year before they graduate and as of February and April of the year of graduation.4,5 As                                                  3 Regarding improvements in these indicators, also see Yutaka Harada, "Economic Activity, Prices, and Monetary Policy in Japan: Speech at a Meeting with Business Leaders in Fukushima," Bank of Japan, November 2017, and Yutaka Harada, "Economic Activity, Prices, and Monetary Policy in Japan: Speech at a Meeting with Business Leaders in Yamanashi," Bank of Japan, March 2019. 4 The job offer rate is the ratio of students who have received job offers among applicants. 5 The academic term in Japan starts in April and ends in March. 
 5  mentioned earlier, the overall unemployment rate has declined almost consistently, marking 2.4 percent in October 2019. While the youth unemployment rate usually is higher and tends to be more volatile than the overall unemployment rate, this also has been declining steadily. In addition, the job offer rates for the respective months have registered record highs. While figures for the job offer rates are only available from 1997, the rates must have been high during the bubble period and lower after the burst of the bubble, given that they are negatively correlated with the youth unemployment rate. The shaded areas in the chart represent the so-called "employment ice age."6 If the unemployment rate had been lowered through monetary policy, there might not have been such an employment ice age, or at least it might have been mitigated.  Chart 1 Unemployment Rates and Job Offer Rates                                                               6 Per its support plan for the employment ice age generation, released on May 29, 2019, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare defined people who graduated from university from around 1993 to 2004 as the "employment ice age generation." The period of a few years from the outbreak of the global financial crisis in 2008 is also regarded as a reemergence of the employment ice age, according to the following report.

 6  The Bank started QQE in April 2013, but if it had been introduced earlier, the unemployment rate in Japan without doubt would have remained in the range of 2.0-3.0 percent throughout. Since the unemployment rate from the mid-1990s to 2012 on average was roughly 4.5 percent, the current unemployment rate of 2.4 percent means that the unemployment rate has almost halved. This decline in the unemployment rate also has helped to raise productivity, which I will touch on next.  Productivity Growth Productivity also has been rising in tandem with the improvement in employment. Since I have talked about this in the past, here I only would like to note that it has been rising.7 Let me just briefly summarize the reason behind this occurrence. When an economy is in recession, firms curtail investment in physical assets, human resources, and research and development. Young people caught up in the employment ice age missed out on on-the-job training opportunities. Although it is impossible to make up all the lost ground, some of it can be slowly gained over time, helping to gradually raise the productivity of the economy.  Improvement in Fiscal Conditions Bold monetary easing has stimulated economic activity, increased tax revenues, and improved fiscal conditions. Chart 2 presents the ratios relative to nominal GDP of the general government fiscal balance, gross government debt outstanding, and net government debt outstanding. The GDP ratio of the general government deficit has decreased by 5.6 percentage points from 8.3 percent in fiscal 2012 to 2.7 percent in fiscal 2017, and the GDP ratio of net government debt, which had been increasing sharply, is more or less unchanged at around 121 percent since fiscal 2012.8                                                    7 See Harada Yutaka, "Nihon keizai to seisansei: Special Lecture at a Conference Commemorating Daiwa Institute of Research's 200th Release of Japan's Economic Outlook," Bank of Japan, March 2019. 8 Of the improvement in the GDP ratio of the general government fiscal balance of 5.6 percentage points, 1.5 percentage points were brought about by the consumption tax hike from 5 percent to 8 percent. 
 7  Let me explain the importance of net government debt.9 Net government debt is calculated by subtracting government financial assets from gross government debt. It used to be argued that, although Japan's gross government debt was substantial, this was not a problem because net government debt was not that large. However, at present, net government debt is actually also fairly large. Net government debt matters when considering the possibility of government debt default. While some argue that, given the large amount of government debt, even a small increase in interest rates could cause serious problems, it is important to think about the impact in terms of net debt. The reason is that when interest rates rise, interest receipts on financial assets held by the government also increase, partly cancelling out the impact on gross government debt.

 8  III. Why Interest Rates Are Low Since the introduction of QQE, employment has been improving, productivity has been rising, and fiscal conditions have been improving. What, then, is at the core of the problem of bold monetary policy? Simply put, prices have not been rising. Prior to the introduction of QQE, the Bank decided that it would aim to achieve inflation of 2 percent. However, the year-on-year rate of change in the consumer price index (CPI) excluding fresh food for October 2019 is 0.4 percent, a long way off the target.10 You might think that it is not a problem that prices are not rising if employment is improving, productivity is rising, and fiscal conditions are improving. However, if prices do not rise, neither will interest rates, which poses a problem for financial institutions.11  When asked "Why are interest rates in Japan low?" one might answer: "Because that is the Bank's very intention." However, this is not necessarily the case. From a theoretical perspective, maintaining interest rates at low levels will cause the economy to overheat and prices to rise, possibly resulting in inflation that significantly exceeds 2 percent. In order to avoid this, interest rates will need to be raised. Alternatively, they will rise over time in due course. In a nutshell, in the long term, a low interest rate policy brings about increases in prices and nominal interest rates. Looked at from a different angle, what this means is that Japan fell into deflation and a situation of low interest rates because interest rates were not                                                  10 According to the Statistics Bureau, Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, the CPI figure becomes 0.2 percent when the effects of the consumption tax hike and the introduction of free preschool education are excluded. 11 I have explained the importance of the 2 percent price stability target in the section titled "Why Is the 2 Percent Inflation Target Important?" in Yutaka Harada, "Economic Activity, Prices, and Monetary Policy in Japan: Speech at a Meeting with Business Leaders in Nagasaki," Bank of Japan, May 2019. 
 9  lowered sufficiently during economic downturns in the past.12 Moreover, this decline in interest rates is actually not unique to Japan, but rather a global phenomenon.

Interest rates have been declining globally and, although not visible in the chart, 10-year government bond yields have been negative in Japan, Germany, and France since around the middle of 2019.

 10  Low interest rates reflect low rates of both real economic growth and inflation. Let us look at the nominal GDP growth rate, which is the sum of these two rates. As can be seen in Chart 4, nominal GDP growth rates of major countries have been declining on the whole.  Chart 4 Nominal GDP Growth Rates of Major Countries               While nominal GDP growth rates have indeed been declining, this alone cannot fully explain the decline in interest rates. In Chart 5, the vertical axis represents 10-year government bond yields, while the horizontal axis represents the nominal GDP growth rates of major countries. Each dot in the chart depicts the five-year average for each country from 1990 to the present. Up until the 2000s, interest rates moved in sync with nominal GDP growth rates and were around 2 percentage points higher than them. However, looking at the trend since the second half of the 2010s, interest rates have fallen 2 percentage points below nominal GDP growth rates and have failed to rise substantially when nominal GDP growth rates increased to some extent. However, because it is only since the start of 2010 that interest rates have been below nominal GDP growth rates, the situation might change quickly and interest rates may rise swiftly if nominal GDP growth rates increase. Therefore, we might not have to expect the situation of the past five to ten years to last forever.

 11  Chart 5 Nominal Interest Rates and Nominal GDP Growth Rates                 Why did interest rates fall more than the nominal GDP growth rate? Proposed explanations for the decline in interest rates, in addition to the decline in the rates of inflation and real GDP growth, include changes in the saving-investment balance.13 Various factors are said to be responsible for such changes: demographic forces; higher inequality; the glut of precautionary saving by emerging markets; the decline in the relative price of capital; the high profitability of large IT firms and their large cash reserves; lower public investment; the shortage of safe assets; and the improvement in fiscal conditions.14 Some argue that the recent decline in interest rates is cyclical and changes in the saving-investment balance might be due to the decline in investment and increase in savings, and that this has led to the decline in interest rates.                                                  13 See Lukasz Rachel and Thomas D. Smith, "Are Low Real Interest Rates Here to Stay?"

 12  Among the reasons behind the decline in interest rates mentioned earlier, I will focus on the effects of the improvement in fiscal conditions in Japan. First, let us assume that interest rates in Japan are determined by the saving-investment balance in Japan. Another assumption is that a change in fiscal conditions does not affect private-sector decisions with regard to saving and investment.  In fiscal 2012, long-term interest rates in Japan were 0.8 percent, while gross national savings, which equal total investment -- the sum of domestic and foreign investment -- amounted to 115 trillion yen. The general government deficit declined by 26 trillion yen from fiscal 2012 to fiscal 2017. Due to this decline, gross national savings should have increased by 26 trillion yen. Chart 6 shows the relationship between interest rates and gross national savings, which equal total investment. As the interest elasticity of savings is said to be small, the supply curve of savings is almost vertical. Meanwhile, the investment demand curve is drawn assuming that the interest elasticity of investment is one. The chart indicates that interest rates declined by 0.18 percentage points due to the decline in the general government deficit by 26 trillion yen.15  Chart 6 Fiscal Balance and Interest Rates                                                            15 Nakamura and Yagi ibid. (see footnote 9) estimates that, in the case where the ratio of net government debt to GDP exceeds 90 percent, a 1 percentage point increase in the ratio of fiscal deficit to GDP would push up nominal long-term interest rates by 0.26 percentage points. This estimate is around 8 times as much as the one presented in my speech today.

 13  While it is difficult to judge whether this decline in interest rates is large or small, what is clear is that, if the government deficit led to a rise in interest rates, this would pose a major problem, as it would reduce important investment and damage Japan's economy in the future; on the other hand, if the government deficit does not lead to a rise in interest rates, it also does not reduce important investment, and would not be a major problem.  Arguments That Low Interest Rates Cause Problems In addition to the debate surrounding low interest rates mentioned earlier, it has been argued that the low interest rate policy allows inefficient firms to survive, leading to a decline in productivity and, consequently, a decline in the natural rate of interest. This could be called the "zombie firm argument" -- that is, the argument that low interest rates artificially keep inefficient firms alive.16 Yet another argument is that the current low interest rates are due to low interest rates in the past that brought about a "frontloading" of demand and resulted in a further decline in interest rates.17  First of all, it needs to be noted that these arguments focus on real, not nominal, interest rates. Thus, as for the first argument that the low interest rate policy allows inefficient firms to survive, leading to a decline in productivity, this is implausible given that productivity has been rising as a result of QQE. In addition, if inefficient firms were forced to exit the market because of higher interest rates, this would lead to employment issues. In contrast, Japan's economy is currently facing labor shortages due to monetary easing. If inefficient firms are to be forced to exit the market, it is much better if this occurs through labor shortages and upward wage pressures.  With regard to the second argument that the current low interest rates are merely the result of a "frontloading" of future demand, both production and people's incomes have been                                                  16 There had been claims that, due to low interest rates, inefficient firms are able to survive. For example, see "Zonbi kigyō to wa hatan jōtai 'oi kashi' de enmei," Nikkei, February 9, 2019 and Kamei Katsuji, "Zonbi o amayakasu nichigin," Nikkei, October 4, 2019. These referred to the following analysis indicating that the increase in the number of zombie firms is linked to the effects of lower interest rates: Ryan Banerjee and Boris Hofmann, "The rise of zombie firms: causes and consequences," BIS Quarterly Review, Bank for International Settlements, September 2018. 17 See, for example, Okina Kunio, Kinri to Keizai (Tokyo: Diamond, Inc, 2017), 174-177. 
 14  rising. I assume that when people have higher incomes, they are likely to demand a higher standard of living in the future as well. Owing to the stable exchange rate environment brought about by QQE, more foreign visitors have been coming to Japan. I feel that it is rather strange to think that Japan has merely attracted visitors that were expected to come in the future and that, since these visitors will not come in the future, this would lead to a decline of the economy in the future.  When the Bank introduced QQE, I assumed that achieving the inflation target of 2 percent would not take much time. If the inflation rate were to approach 2 percent, the Bank would have to raise interest rates. I therefore did not expect interest rates to stay at around 0 percent or in negative territory for such a long period of time. It seems that many economists had similar expectations.18  Let me go back to the discussion regarding the factors underlying low interest rates. Given that interest rates have fallen 2 percentage points below nominal GDP growth rates, the decrease in the fiscal deficit mentioned earlier cannot fully explain the low interest rates. In fact, the reasons why interest rates have fallen so much are not yet fully understood. However, given that interest rates in the United Kingdom and the United States -- where inflation rates of around 2 percent had been successfully maintained -- have remained higher than interest rates in Japan, it is clear that Japan's past deflationary monetary policy has led to the decline in interest rates. In addition, it is only for the last five or ten years that interest rates have been 2 percentage points below nominal GDP growth rates. Therefore, we might not have to expect this situation to last forever.                                                  18 For example, Hayakawa argues that private banks currently hold huge amounts of government bonds. In terms of quantity, major banks have substantial amounts of government bonds, but the duration of their bonds is little more than two years. Meanwhile, the duration of the bonds held by regional financial institutions is around four years -- longer than that of bonds held by major banks. Since there is little demand for credit from regional financial institutions, such institutions' only option is to buy bonds, which extends the duration of their bonds. If prices of government bonds were to fall, it is regional financial institutions that would incur the greatest losses, not the major banks. For details, see Hayakawa Hideo, "Waga kuni kin'yūgyō no kadai," Shin kokusaku, Research Institute for National Policy, November 2012. This argument is based on the assumption that monetary easing eventually increases interest rates. Also, the idea that government bonds with a duration of four years entail risks reflects the assumption that, in about four years, prices will rise, thereby leading to an increase in interest rates. 
 15  IV. Low Interest Rates and Banks' Profitability Although it is not clear why, interest rates have fallen globally and are negative, not only in Japan but also in many European countries. Banks are dissatisfied with low interest rates. While these have improved the employment situation and boosted productivity, it frequently is argued that they undermine banks' profitability.19  Functions of Banks Before considering the relationship between low interest rates and banks' profitability, I would like to explain banks' functions. How do banks make profits? Textbooks on finance define the functions of banks as consisting of information production and asset transformation and explain banks' profits as the result of performing these two functions.20  As for information production, banks, on behalf of depositors, examine borrowers' future profits from investments and the quality of their assets, assess whether the projected outcome has been achieved after a loan was made, and check whether borrowers' accounting information is correct. Banks demand collateral and/or personal guarantees from borrowers. Sufficient collateral and personal guarantees alleviate banks' burdens of monitoring firms' accounting information and therefore reduce the cost of information production. Since depositors cannot demand collateral or personal guarantees, the function of information production falls on banks. If firms provided more detailed accounting information, given that they are sufficiently large, they could obtain funding through capital markets and would not have to rely on bank lending. The reason that in practice most large firms in Japan borrow from banks is that banks provide inexpensive lending to them. This means that lending to large firms is less profitable for banks.  While it is very difficult to project future profits to begin with, there are certain firms other than banks that can project the future profits of another firm more accurately. For instance, a large assembler to a certain extent knows the sales figures of its suppliers. The simple reason is that the assembler procures orders from the supplier. Similarly, trading and other                                                  19 See, for example, "Mienu 'deguchi,' fukusayō zōdai: ginkōkai ni takamaru fuman -- mainasu kinri 3-nen," Jiji Press, Ltd., February 15, 2019, https://www.jiji.com/jc/article?k=2019021500887&g=eco. 20 See, for example, Iwata Kikuo, "Kin'yū chūkai to kigyō kin'yū," chapter 4 in Kin'yū (Tokyo: Toyo Keizai Inc., 2000). 
 16  companies that take part in the management of particular firms may also be better placed to project their future profits. Banks compete with such firms with information advantages. Even if the firms they lend to are very successful, the margin that banks can earn is very small. Since banks are not allowed to invest depositors' money, they cannot invest in venture firms and earn returns that are considerable multiples of their outlays.  If banks try to assess the future profits of a firm, which are unknowable, it is the person with the greatest authority that ultimately makes the assessment. If a firm is not managed properly, it likely would face a situation illustrated in the world of novels -- that is, the credit examination division would stop functioning and the human resources division, which is responsible for assessing personnel, would engage in internal power struggles.21 If banks instead provide loans based only on observable and objective criteria such as collateral, they could cut costs by substantially downsizing their credit examination division and/or human resources division. That is, banks should lend based on observable and objective criteria and examine future profits of firms only in exceptional circumstances.22 Even by focusing only on the examination of observable and objective criteria, banks would be doing something that depositors cannot.  Asset transformation -- banks' other function -- consists of two components. The first is the act of accumulating short-term deposits and transforming them into long-term lending. Since borrowers use funds to buy machinery or construct buildings, they cannot pay back the money on short notice. Banks can lend over the long term by accumulating deposits from a large number of depositors. The second component is the transformation of loan assets, which entail the possibility of default, into risk-free deposits. As a result, depositors can rest assured that their funds are safe when entrusting them to banks. This means that                                                  21 Although fiction, similar situations are vividly described in books focusing on banks written by Jun Ikeido, such as, Oretachi Baburu Nyūkōgumi, (Tokyo: Bungeishunju Ltd., 2004), Shairokku no Kodomotachi, (Tokyo: Bungeishunju Ltd., 2006), and Rosujene no Gyakushū, (Tokyo: Bungeishunju Ltd., 2012). The stories are exaggerated but are more or less similar to fragmentary information that I gained personally. 22 Observable and objective criteria include deposits and withdrawals from firms' accounts as well as deposits on housing rent. There also are cases where lenders, not banks, manage the accounts for deposits on housing rent. 
 17  banks transform assets that involve risks into safe assets through the function of information production.  To what extent can banks maintain the amount of loans by utilizing these functions? There are some landowners that only have a small amount of deposits, but their deposits would increase if they succeed in their business. If the quality of people's lives improves, the number of people who can let their assets lie idle over the long term would increase, leading to a narrowing of the spread between short- and long-term interest rates. As some borrow money even at high interest rates, banks might be able to make loans to them at such rates. However, these people do not represent the majority.  Banks can make loans even without sufficient collateral. If a borrower makes a certain down payment to start up a shop, banks can place confidence in the borrower's diligence and steadiness. Even if the amount of collateral is not sufficient for banks, the borrower certainly should be considered serious enough, since all the efforts made over several years would be in vain upon failure. In the case of housing loans, a 10-20 percent down payment might be insufficient for banks. However, it seems that such a down payment level would not cause problems because borrowers would want to keep their houses at all costs.  Looking at banks' assets, as of end-September 2019, of the total loans made by domestically licensed banks of 509 trillion yen, 324 trillion yen was for corporations (including 206 trillion yen for small enterprises) and 144 trillion yen for households.23 As for loans to households, as of end-September 2019, the amount of housing loans was 131 trillion yen and that of consumer loans was 10 trillion yen.24 I assume that the total amount of loans -- those to small enterprises and households combined -- with which banks might be able to gain profits is around 350 trillion yen. Though based on different statistics, as of end-August 2019, of the total loans of 485 trillion yen, the amount of loans made at interest rates of 5 percent or more only stood at 5.9 trillion yen.25                                                   23 Bank of Japan, Deposits, Vault Cash, and Loans and Bill Discounted. 24 Bank of Japan, Loans to Households. 25 Bank of Japan, Loans and Discounts Outstanding by Interest Rate. 
 18  Increase in Deposits in Excess of the Increase in Loans at Japanese Banks An increase in deposits in excess of the increase in loans at banks also is a problem. Chart 7 shows the loan-to-deposit ratios (calculated by dividing loans by deposits) of banks in Japan, the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, and France. In Japan, the ratio, which had been at around 100 percent through the end of the 1990s, declined sharply thereafter and is hovering at around 60 percent at present. On the other hand, the ratios in the other countries, albeit declining, have remained at around 100 percent except in the United States. Banks in those countries accumulate deposits only to the extent necessary to make loans. Even then, banks in Europe have had difficulties maintaining profitability. For banks in Japan that have been accumulating an excessive amount of deposits, the situation should become even more severe.  Chart 7 Loan-to-Deposit Ratios of Banks in Major Countries              From the time of the introduction of QQE up until September 2019, loans by domestically licensed banks, which had been on a declining trend, increased by 79 trillion yen while deposits increased by as much as 161 trillion yen.26 In this context, news reports suggest that financial institutions are struggling to attract personnel and that staff members are                                                  26 Bank of Japan, Financial Institutions Accounts.

 19  retiring early.27 While this is reported as though it is troublesome, it consequently could lead to a reduction in the number of personnel contributing to the collection of more deposits than needed and in that of branches. I think that this would increase the productivity of the banking sector, and thus of Japan's economy as a whole.  There are concerns that, facing difficulties in expanding lending while accumulating too much deposits, banks in Japan do not seem to be trying to reduce deposits, but instead are relying on riskier lending or investment and recommending that their customers buy investment trusts rather than make deposits. Estimates by the Financial Services Agency (FSA) of customers' total return on investment trusts (after fees and commissions) suggest that, as of end-March 2019, 34 percent of customers of all investment trust distributors face negative total returns.28 Given that the average holding period of such funds is thought to be around three years and that stock prices in major countries have risen during that period, including in Japan, where the Nikkei 225 Stock Average has risen by around 25 percent, the return on most funds should be positive. This means that the negative returns must be due to high fees and commissions. As highlighted by the FSA, some of the distributors of investment trusts seem to be encouraging their customers to churn between funds in the short term to gain profits from transaction fees.29 Moreover, looking at the costs and returns of investment trust funds by type of distributor, I find that banks and securities firms engaged in face-to-face sales tend to sell trusts involving high costs and low returns. In contrast, independent investment trust firms and securities firms specializing in sales via the internet tend to sell trusts at a lower cost and that offer higher returns.30                                                   27 See, for example, the 2-day series, Minami Takero and Nakatani Shogo, "Chigin haran jinzai kokatsu no kiki," Nikkei, February 20 and 21, 2019. 28 For details, see Financial Services Agency, "Publication of the monitoring results pertaining to the implementation status of customer-oriented business conduct taken by financial institutions" (the full text is available only in Japanese), November 2019, https://www.fsa.go.jp/en/newsletter/weekly2019/367.html. In fact, this situation where customers are making losses in their investment trusts has even made it into works of fiction, such as Shairokku no Kodomotachi (p.16) by Jun Ikeido, mentioned earlier. 29 Toshihide Endo, "To turn challenges into opportunities," Speech at the 34th Annual General Meeting and Reception of the International Bankers Association of Japan, Financial Services Agency, November 2018. 30 See footnote 28 for the reference. 
 20  Some financial institutions in Europe, where interest rates also are low, are in the process of significantly enhancing their business efficiency due to the prolonged sluggishness of profits. Since drastic employment adjustments in Europe seem to be difficult due to factors such as labor practices, some financial institutions are revising their organizational structure globally, including in Japan. Given that Japan is facing labor shortages due to bold monetary easing, such revisions should be easier than in Europe. If banks successfully can downsize their number or their asset holdings, they would become profitable. In capitalism and a market economy, firms need to switch from unprofitable to profitable business areas. If banks release human resources and capital while making this shift, this will have a positive impact on Japan's economy as a whole. Although I recognize the difficulty of giving up business in Japan, if banks -- which should form the core of capitalism and the market economy -- understand this point, I believe productivity of the economy will improve greatly.31  Concluding Remarks Nearly seven years have passed since the introduction of bold monetary easing in 2013, and almost five years have passed since I was appointed as a Member of the Policy Board of the Bank. Even now, achieving the inflation target of 2 percent seems to be a long way off. Interest rates have not been rising due to low inflation. However, owing to bold monetary easing, economic activity clearly has improved. Employment, especially youth employment, has improved. Had the Bank implemented bold monetary easing since the 1990s, the employment ice age could have been avoided. There also have been various other positive developments, as I mentioned earlier.  However, since interest rates have not been rising, banks, which believe their profits would increase with higher interest rates, express growing dissatisfaction. In my opinion, banks' low profitability is caused by the structural problem that they are accumulating more deposits than they can lend and the banking sector as a whole therefore will not be able to maintain its current size. As shown in Chart 5, it is only over the past ten years or so that                                                  31 The solution of shrinking the size of banks is not considered at all in the novels by Jun Ikeido mentioned earlier. I fully understand that it is difficult to implement in practice what is difficult even in the world of fiction. 
 21  interest rates have failed to rise to any meaningful extent, and thus it might be premature to conclude that it is not possible to see a return to the former situation. If the Bank were to raise interest rates now, this would revive the deflationary mindset and consequently further delay increases in prices and interest rates. This would not benefit the banking sector either. Some argue that the Bank should raise interest rates soon because Japan's economy is in a good state given the demographic trends. However, it was only after the introduction of QQE that real GDP per working-age person started to increase; therefore, raising interest rates would just throw us back. That is, raising interest rates would lead to the following: an appreciation of the yen; falling stock prices; declines in exports, investment, consumption and employment; and the reemergence of the employment ice age.  Thank you for your attention.   
U.S. Regulations and Approaches to Cryptocurrencies December 03, 2019 Posted December 12, 2019 Michael Held, Executive Vice President and General Counsel Remarks at the BIS Central Bank Legal Experts’ Meeting, Basel, Switzerland As prepared for delivery Thank you, Diego, for “volunteering” me to speak about digital currencies—a field in which I count myself as very much a trainee, not an expert. Today I will focus on the U.S. regulatory landscape for digital currencies, in particular on digital currencies issued by private organizations that are intended to be used like money. As always, the views I express are my own, not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System.1 Policy makers and regulators in the United States, to date, have not developed an overarching framework for regulating private digital currencies. The field has been seen as too new for a comprehensive regulatory response. To be sure, the digital nature of new private currencies will raise challenges to which policy makers must respond. In my view, however, we spend so much time wrestling with the novelty of digital currencies that we forget that private currency is nothing new. The theme of my talk today is accordingly best encapsulated by a quote that is attributed—perhaps wrongly—to Mark Twain: “History may not repeat itself, but it does rhyme.” The Past Is Not Dead. It Isn’t Even Past So, let’s take a little walk through the history of privately-issued currency. We begin in Michigan in 1837, when the state legislature passed the first “free” banking law in the United States.2 Upon commencing business, free banks could issue banknotes—that is, private currencies—that were redeemable in specie—gold or silver.3 These banknotes were transferable debt backed by the general creditworthiness of the bank that issued them, plus assets like bonds and mortgages on real estate, and for a brief time, personal guarantees.4 The statute permitted bank organizers to establish a bank by filing an application with the local county treasurer and county clerk. They did not need approval from the state banking commissioner. (At the time, the United States had no federal banking supervisor.5 Indeed, the “free banking” era generally begins with Congress’s failure to recommission the Second Bank of the United States before its charter expired in 1836, and ends with the passage of the National Bank Act in 1863.) The result, predictably, was chaotic. The state banking commissioner was unsure of how many banks had even been established.6 Some banks in Michigan were established with the intent to issue banknotes but without the intent to ever redeem them.7 By 1839 almost the entire system had collapsed. After closing down one bank in Michigan, the commissioner found shards of window glass, lead, and nails where he should have found gold and silver coin.8 Some of these free banks became known as “wildcat” banks. They set up offices in remote areas—where only the wildcats roamed—making it difficult to redeem notes for specie.9 In 
truth, the fate of free banks was not all bad. Free banks in New York apparently fared pretty well.10 But the experiences of Michigan and some other states demonstrated the risks in dealing with lightly regulated issuers of private currencies of that time. Banknotes of that era were consistently transferred at a discount,11 state-to-state requirements to value the assets that backed them varied,12 and banks were engaged speculative activities: building hotels, roads, railroads, and canals.13 I’m told they also engaged in banking. By the 1860s Congress was fed up with the free banking system. In an address to the United States Senate in 1863, Senator John Sherman of Ohio decried: “We had every diversity of the bank system in this country that has been devised by the wit of man, and all these banks had the power to issue paper money. With this multiplicity of banks . . . it was impossible to have a uniform national currency, for its value was constantly affected by their issues. There was no common regulator; they were dependent on different systems. . . . There was no check or control over these banks. There was a want of harmony and concert among them.”14 The National Bank Act authorized the creation of national banks that would issue national bank notes. It was a push towards harmony in private currency, a pressing need for a wartime government in the throes of a civil war. Unlike wildcat banknotes, national bank notes were backed universally by federal government bonds and deposits of other money, such as U.S. government issued “greenback,” in each case held by the United States Treasury, and they circulated at parity with other forms of money.15 The National Bank Act also introduced the division between banking and commerce in the United States, which may have erased some of the more-speculative bank activities of the wildcat era.16 Federal intervention and tighter regulation meant that national banks and their notes were both safer and more fungible than their wildcat predecessors, and the United States’ transition into national bank notes, coupled with new, unfavorable tax treatment for state bank notes, meant the demise of wildcat banknotes.17 Decades later, the establishment of the Federal Reserve System, a central bank currency, and a push for banks to engage in deposit-taking activities meant the overall demise of private currency in the United States for decades.18 The Child Is Father to the Man This is, admittedly, a fairly crude history of money and banking in the United States, but you see where I’m going with this. It is hard not to see certain parallels between today’s digital currencies and the bank notes issued during the wildcat era. Digital currencies are developing in in the absence of a comprehensive regulatory system, and there are countless digital currencies, with countless idiosyncrasies, and countless entities of varying quality that can issue them. According to one source, there are currently nearly 3000 digital currencies but I doubt anyone really knows the true number.19 While we have not seen issuers of digital currencies hold shards of glass, lead, and nails in reserve, we have seen digital currencies with no backing by design—Bitcoin being the prime example—digital currencies backed by other volatile digital currencies—for those who put a premium on safety—and digital currencies styled after Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin, and Kanye West—though Mr. West’s lawyers made sure that Coinye never really got off the ground. 
The analogy between the current era and the wildcat era isn’t perfect, of course. History rhymes after all; it doesn’t repeat. In contrast to the wildcat era, various federal regulators have demonstrated a willingness to apply existing regulatory tools to digital currencies. But, policy makers and regulators are also still monitoring developments in digital currencies, and we have not fully formulated a cohesive policy response. Whether we like it or not, however, we are beginning to confront at least two questions similar to those that policymakers addressed in the waning days of the wildcat era: 1. Should national governments restrict unsafe or particularly volatile private currencies? 2. Should national governments limit private currency issuance to tightly regulated institutions so that governments can incentivize or mandate certain desirable features? As I’ve already suggested, current U.S. law does not have direct answers to these questions. Digital currencies can fall into a variety of categories: commodities or securities or other instruments. How a digital currency is classified will depend partly on the functional use of the digital currency and partly on the priorities of various lawmakers and regulatory agencies that have the authority to regulate it. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), the primary U.S. authority responsible for implementing U.S. anti-money laundering laws, was one of first authorities to issue guidance in the United States on digital currencies. FinCEN clarified in 2013 that transmitters and exchangers of digital currency are money service businesses under FinCEN regulations, if the digital currency acts as a substitute for real currency or has an equivalent value in real currency.20 Accordingly, any person that engages in the business of transferring or exchanging digital currency is subject to FinCEN requirements to establish an anti-money laundering program, which includes recordkeeping, reporting, and customer identification and verification requirements.21 FinCEN’s early entrance into the field sought to address the fact that digital currencies, like other forms of payment, may be used for nefarious purposes. Fast forward to 2017. Jay Clayton, the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the federal agency that regulates securities, released a statement on digital currencies and initial coin offerings (ICOs). In Chairman Clayton’s view, “tokens and offerings that incorporate features and marketing efforts that emphasize the potential for profits based on the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others continue to contain the hallmarks of a security under U.S. law.”22 In 2018, SEC staff published guidance to clarify that exchanges, investment vehicles, investment advisers, and dealers doing business in digital currencies that are digital asset securities would be subjected to securities laws.23 The guidance makes clear that digital currencies that function as securities will be subject to U.S. securities law, but where we draw this line may not always be clear. Products that blur the boundaries between money and securities are not new. Take, for instance, certificates of deposit. In 1982, the United States Supreme Court analyzed whether a certificate of deposit was a security for purposes of certain U.S. anti-fraud laws. The Court concluded that it was not. In doing so, the Court recognized that the most important distinction between a certificate of deposit issued by a bank—money—and other long-term debt was the comprehensive regulation of the banking system.24 The Court’s conclusion was a sensible one more than a century after the “wildcat” banking era: Lawmakers could not 
have intended to treat money in the banking system like it was something else because there was no need to do so. At least for now, the case does not appear to be as strong for digital currencies. Without a regulatory framework designed for digital currencies, regulators in United States are reacting to abuses instead of proactively addressing risks. As an example, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the agency in the United States that regulates futures and derivatives contracts, used its enforcement authority over fraudulent purchases or sales of commodities to stop an alleged digital currency scheme.25 Organizers of the scheme claimed that the digital currency in question—My Big Coin—was backed by gold and actively traded, but the CFTC concluded that neither was true, that payouts to customers were funded with money fraudulently obtained from other victims of the scheme, and that the organizers misappropriated approximately $6 million in customer assets.26 My Big Coin appears to have been a modern wildcat currency, but the scheme was detected only because the CFTC could regulate it as a commodity. We are fortunate that, today, the CFTC has this market-based authority to combat fraud in U.S. commodities markets that was not present in the wildcat era. Meanwhile, banks, which are the focus of our federal regulatory efforts for holding and transferring money, have largely not engaged in holding, transferring, or <gasp> issuing digital currencies, and federal banking regulators in the United States have remained largely silent on the permissibility of these activities.27 The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) sought to carve out a special-purpose charter—its so-called “fintech charter”—presumably to bring some of these activities under the OCC’s regulatory umbrella, but it has since been mired in litigation over issuing these special-purpose charters with states in the U.S. that wish to license these activities under local law.28 Separately, the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, which has authority to write rules governing certain consumer accounts and payment products, determined it would further analyze digital currencies and did not try to bring them into its purview in a recent amendment to its Regulation E.29 To be sure, states within the U.S. have begun to adopt laws and regulations for digital currency businesses. New York and Wyoming, to cite two examples, have adopted digital currency-specific regimes. There is, however, little coordination in the approach at the state level,30 which highlights that a state-by-state approach risks both inconsistent treatment and the possibility of a “race to the bottom” on licensing standards that could be reminiscent of the wildcat era. The challenges states will face in crafting sensible rules are only amplified with respect to digital currencies, which tend to operate without borders. If you were a worrier like me, would you worry that we are putting off alternative approaches until new problems exhaust old solutions? Would you worry about how effectively we will respond if a digital currency achieves critical mass? Governor Quarles highlighted this latter concern in his recent remarks at the European Banking Federation.31 He noted that stable coins do not pose risk to financial stability today but that they bring with them the potential for scale that could pose regulatory challenges from a financial stability standpoint in the future. But knowing that regulators in the U.S. are already dealing with concerns over fraud and the prospect of other forms of misconduct related to digital currencies, and acknowledging 
Governors Quarles’ concerns about financial stability, would it behoove us to start identifying areas of focus for crafting a regulatory response that is more proactive? Pablo Hernández de Cos, Chairman of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) and Governor of the Bank of Spain, remarked in November that digital currencies “do not reliably perform the standard functions of money and are unsafe to rely on as a medium of exchange or store of value.”32 That sounds like a problem. We have dealt with a somewhat similar problem before. Under the National Bank Act, the United States chose to reform its currency system by adopting a new regulatory regime for national banks—the would-be issuers of stable private currencies (that is, national bank notes)—and by crafting requirements for these issuers to backstop their currencies with safer government-issued bonds. These steps served to stabilize private currency issuers and their currencies, but there were other benefits of the approach that are easy to overlook: we disincentivized less desirable products—wildcat notes (that is, by imposing taxes on them); certain key participants in the system—specifically the custodian banks and trust companies—were already regulated institutions; bank notes had a certain level of transparency built in—a holder’s right to receive payment and from whom was literally written on the face of the note; and for all intents and purposes, federal law and regulation were ubiquitous. We have also developed comprehensive regulatory schemes targeted at other widely-used financial products as they have evolved, including recent work to regulate swap transactions. If digital currencies reach critical mass, we may want to draw on lessons from these efforts and consider whether tools for regulating systemically important activities are fit for purpose. The designation process under the Dodd-Frank Act for systemically important financial institutions may be instructive here, regardless of whether it is directly applicable to digital currencies. In this process, the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) has the authority to designate for enhanced regulation and supervision certain financial institutions, financial market infrastructures, and payments, clearing, and settlement (PCS) activities, to the extent that FSOC determines the organization or activity to be systemically important. Though the authority in the Dodd-Frank Act is limited in some ways—it applies only to certain systemically important activities and the designation process requires coordination across regulatory agencies and related administrative processes—the scheme is flexible in other ways because it contemplates an activities-based approach to regulation and oversight in addition to a prudential approach for certain institutions.33 To be crystal clear, I am not saying that any digital currencies are currently ripe for consideration under the FSOC designation process; just that a similarly flexible though not necessarily identical process involving coordination and collaboration across multiple regulators may be warranted. The Path Forward In applying lessons learned from the past to the modern era, one path forward might be to consider the following questions in determining whether a broader regulatory scheme is sensible: 1. First, who should be authorized to act as an issuer of a digital currency or as an intermediary that can hold or transfer a digital currency on behalf of a holder? And, is existing regulation adequate to cover each? If not, should we consider expanding the regulatory perimeter to address each from a prudential regulatory standpoint? 
Doing so would provide us with an avenue for addressing risks each may pose to holders or the system more broadly. 2. Second, are there certain features of digital currencies that are either desirable or undesirable from a regulatory or policy standpoint? If so, are there restrictions or incentives we should adopt to avoid a recurrence of a landscape that resembles the wildcat era? At a minimum shouldn’t we aim for clarity on certain essential features, such as clarity on the rights of digital currency holders and the nature of assets that back a digital currency? 3. Third, are there key activities that are cardinal to the functioning of digital currencies that require special attention from regulators? These may include actions to create, distribute, destroy, or and transfer digital currencies, and may also include key infrastructures, such as the technology that underpins a particular digital currency. To the extent that these critical activities are performed by actors that are not within a regulatory purview, should we fill this potential gap in oversight? 4. Fourth, should we agree on a common approach across jurisdictions on least some aspects of a refined regulatory approach? Digital currencies can be designed to be used across borders. Key parties may be situated across the globe. If we are to reach ubiquity in regulation, or at least something approaching it, isn’t coordination the way to do so? The Financial Stability Board and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision may address some of these questions, but it’s too soon to know what they will conclude. 5. Last, should we consider other lenses through which to view these activities? Common sense dictates that we begin with an approach that considers protections for holders of digital currencies against unfair losses and the potential for certain digital currencies to present risk to financial stability. Are there other factors for us to consider? This is not easy stuff. Some might look at this list, and want a faster, ready-made solution. I can hear them now: “Why not just put this activity in the banking system and borrow a more robust regulatory structure?” I think we should consider that, but bank regulation may not be fit for purpose. History rhymes; it doesn’t repeat—that’s the last time I will use that line. So, at the same time we consider what banks will or should be going forward, we also should consider some more fundamental questions: (i) What is the most practical approach? (ii) What approach gives us the right balance of functional and risk-based regulation? (iii) What approach is the most neutral to technological change? (iv) What approach provides the clarity to the greatest extent possible (recognizing that every model will have its faults)? (v) What approach will last to and through the next cycle of innovation? I mentioned the SEC earlier. The SEC analyzes digital currencies using a test that the Supreme Court formulated almost 90 years ago—that is mind boggling, but for what the SEC does, it is also still very relevant—this is something worth striving for. You might be surprised that I don’t have the answer to what the next 90 years of digital currency regulation will look like, but I hope to have the opportunity to explore this issue with some of you. Thank you.   1 Many thanks to Joseph Torregrossa and Thomas Noone for their assistance with these remarks.

22 Chairman Jay Clayton, Securities and Exchange Commission, Statement on Cryptocurrencies and Initial Coin Offerings (Dec. 2017). Clayton is applying the “Howey” test, a product of the court case SEC v. W.J. Howey Co.,which sets out the criteria for determining whether an instrument qualifies as an “investment contract” (and thus a security) for the purposes of the Securities Act of 1933. 328 U.S. § 293 (1946). An investment contract is “a contract, transaction or scheme whereby a person invests his money in a common enterprise and is led to expect profits solely from the efforts of the promoter or a third party.” Id. 23 Securities and Exchange Commission, Statement on Digital Asset Securities Issuance and Trading (Nov. 2018). 24 Marine Bank v.

Christine Lagarde: ECB press conference - introductory statementIntroductory statement by Ms Christine Lagarde, President of the European Central Bank, and MrLuis de Guindos, Vice-President of the European Central Bank, Frankfurt am Main, 12 December2019.*   *   *Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to our press conference. Today is the first time that I have hadthe privilege and pleasure of chairing the monetary policy meeting of the Governing Council of theECB. I am delighted to proceed now with reporting on the outcome of our meeting, together withthe Vice-President. The Governing Council meeting was also attended by the CommissionExecutive Vice-President, Mr Dombrovskis.Based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided to keep the key ECBinterest rates unchanged. We expect them to remain at their present or lower levels until wehave seen the inflation outlook robustly converge to a level sufficiently close to, but below, 2%within our projection horizon, and such convergence has been consistently reflected inunderlying inflation dynamics.On 1 November we restarted net purchases under our asset purchase programme (APP) at amonthly pace of €20 billion. We expect them to run for as long as necessary to reinforce theaccommodative impact of our policy rates, and to end shortly before we start raising the keyECB interest rates.We also intend to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securitiespurchased under the APP for an extended period of time past the date when we start raising thekey ECB interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidityconditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation.The incoming data since the last Governing Council meeting in late October point to continuedmuted inflation pressures and weak euro area growth dynamics, although there are some initialsigns of stabilisation in the growth slowdown and of a mild increase in underlying inflation in linewith previous expectations. Ongoing employment growth and increasing wages continue tounderpin the resilience of the euro area economy.The comprehensive package of policy measures that the Governing Council decided inSeptember provides substantial monetary stimulus, which ensures favourable financingconditions for all sectors of the economy. In particular, easier borrowing conditions for firms andhouseholds are underpinning consumer spending and business investment. This will support theeuro area expansion, the ongoing build-up of domestic price pressures and, thus, the robustconvergence of inflation to our medium-term aim.In the light of the subdued inflation outlook, the Governing Council reiterated the need formonetary policy to remain highly accommodative for a prolonged period of time to supportunderlying inflation pressures and headline inflation developments over the medium term. Wewill, therefore, closely monitor inflation developments and the impact of the unfolding monetarypolicy measures on the economy. Our forward guidance will ensure that financial conditionsadjust in accordance with changes to the inflation outlook. In any case, the Governing Councilcontinues to stand ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflationmoves towards its aim in a sustained manner, in line with its commitment to symmetry.Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Euroarea real GDP growth was confirmed at 0.2%, quarter on quarter, in the third quarter of 2019,unchanged from the previous quarter. The ongoing weakness of international trade in anenvironment of persistent global uncertainties continues to weigh on the euro area manufacturing 1 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
sector and is dampening investment growth. At the same time, incoming economic data andsurvey information, while remaining weak overall, point to some stabilisation in the slowdown ofeconomic growth in the euro area. The services and construction sectors remain resilient,despite some moderation in the latter half of 2019. Looking ahead, the euro area expansion willcontinue to be supported by favourable financing conditions, further employment gains inconjunction with rising wages, the mildly expansionary euro area fiscal stance and the ongoing –albeit somewhat slower – growth in global activity.This assessment is broadly reflected in the December 2019 Eurosystem staff macroeconomicprojections for the euro area. These projections foresee annual real GDP increasing by 1.2% in2019, 1.1% in 2020 and 1.4% in both 2021 and 2022. Compared with the September 2019 ECBstaff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for real GDP growth has been revised down slightlyfor 2020.The risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook, related to geopolitical factors, risingprotectionism and vulnerabilities in emerging markets, remain tilted to the downside, but havebecome somewhat less pronounced.According to Eurostat’s flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation increased from 0.7% inOctober 2019 to 1.0% in November, reflecting mainly higher services and food price inflation. Onthe basis of current futures prices for oil, headline inflation is likely to rise somewhat in thecoming months. Indicators of inflation expectations stand at low levels. Measures of underlyinginflation have remained generally muted, although there are some indications of a mild increasein line with previous expectations. While labour cost pressures have strengthened amid tighterlabour markets, the weaker growth momentum is delaying their pass-through to inflation. Overthe medium term, inflation is expected to increase, supported by our monetary policy measures,the ongoing economic expansion and solid wage growth.This assessment is also broadly reflected in the December 2019 Eurosystem staffmacroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual HICP inflation at 1.2% in2019, 1.1% in 2020, 1.4% in 2021 and 1.6% in 2022. Compared with the September 2019 ECBstaff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for HICP inflation has been revised up slightly for2020 and down slightly for 2021, mainly driven by the expected future path of energy prices.Turning to the monetary analysis, broad money (M3) growth stood at 5.6% in October 2019,unchanged from the previous month. Sustained rates of broad money growth reflect ongoingbank credit creation for the private sector and low opportunity costs of holding M3 relative to otherfinancial instruments. The narrow monetary aggregate M1 continues to be the main contributor tobroad money growth on the components side.The growth of loans to firms and households remained solid, benefiting from the continued pass-through of our accommodative monetary policy stance to bank lending rates. The annual growthrate of loans to non-financial corporations increased to 3.8% in October, up from 3.6% inSeptember, while the annual growth rate of loans to households continued on its gradual upwardpath, reaching 3.5% in October. Our accommodative monetary policy stance will help tosafeguard very favourable bank lending conditions and will continue to support access tofinancing, across all economic sectors and in particular for small and medium-sized enterprises.To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals comingfrom the monetary analysis confirmed that an ample degree of monetary accommodation is stillnecessary for the continued robust convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to,2% over the medium term.In order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy measures, other policy areas mustcontribute more decisively to raising the longer-term growth potential, supporting aggregatedemand at the current juncture and reducing vulnerabilities. The implementation of structural 2 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
policies in euro area countries needs to be substantially stepped up to boost euro areaproductivity and growth potential, reduce structural unemployment and increase resilience. The2019 country-specific recommendations should serve as the relevant signpost.Regarding fiscal policies, the euro area fiscal stance is expected to remain mildly expansionaryin 2020, thus providing support to economic activity. In view of the weakened economic outlook,the Governing Council welcomes the Eurogroup’s call for differentiated fiscal responses and itsreadiness to coordinate. Governments with fiscal space should be ready to act in an effectiveand timely manner. In countries where public debt is high, governments need to pursue prudentpolicies and meet structural balance targets, which will create the conditions for automaticstabilisers to operate freely. All countries should intensify their efforts to achieve a more growth-friendly composition of public finances.Likewise, the transparent and consistent implementation of the European Union’s fiscal andeconomic governance framework over time and across countries remains essential to bolsterthe resilience of the euro area economy. Improving the functioning of Economic and MonetaryUnion remains a priority. The Governing Council welcomes the ongoing work and urges furtherspecific and decisive steps to complete the banking union and the capital markets union.We are now at your disposal for questions. 3 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches

     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches 2  2   Introduction The Accelerating America’s Pledge report comprehensively documents the scale of change that is needed across our economies to put emissions on a trajectory consistent with building a net zero economy. That will require a more sustainable financial system. Changes in climate policies, new technologies and growing physical risks will prompt reassessments of the values of virtually every financial asset.   Firms that align their business models with the transition to net zero will be rewarded handsomely.  Those that fail to adapt will cease to exist. Now is the time to ensure that every financial decision takes climate change into account. For that change to happen, we need to focus on the three Rs – reporting, risk management and return. First, reporting In 2015, G20 leaders tasked representatives from the public and private sectors to review how the financial system takes into account climate risks.  We established a Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), chaired by Mike Bloomberg. Four years on, the TCFD has generated a step change in both the demand for and supply of climate reporting. The demand for TCFD disclosure is now enormous.  Current supporters control balance sheets totalling $120 trillion and include the world’s top banks, asset managers, pension funds and insurers. The supply of disclosure is responding, with four fifths of the top 1100 global companies now disclosing climate-related financial risks in line with some of the TCFD recommendations.  On every recommended metric in TCFD, disclosures have been steadily increasing.  Three quarters of major investors surveyed are now using available TCFD disclosures when investing. Mike Bloomberg’s path-breaking initiative on climate disclosure is creating the platform to bring sustainable to the finance mainstream.  Now we must build on this foundation by: First, over the next year, enhancing both the quality and quality of disclosures to make TCFD standards as comparable, efficient and as decision-useful as possible.   And, by COP26, exploring pathways to make TCFD disclosure mandatory. 
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches 3  3   Second, risk management For the market to understand where climate risks and opportunities lie, disclosures need to go beyond the static to the strategic.  That means assessing the resilience of firms’ strategies to transition risks. This is hard.  Only half of TCFD supporters systematically conduct scenario analysis and, of those that do, three fifths don’t disclose it. Fortunately, a number of promising initiatives are currently in train to build best practice. First, TCFD case studies – from Rio Tinto to Unilever and Citi – detail characteristics of good scenario analysis. Second, the TCFD Knowledge Hub provides guidance, research, tools, standards, frameworks and webinars.  Third, the Bank of England will become the first regulator to stress test its major banks and insurers against different climate pathways, including the catastrophic business–as-usual scenario, the ideal – but still challenging –transition to net zero by 2050, and the late policy action – or climate Minsky moment – scenario that could bring a sudden recognition of the scale of stranded assets. Our stress test of the world’s leading international financial centre will show how major financial firms expect to adjust their business models, and what the collective impact of these responses could be on the wider economy.   It will reveal the banks – and by extension companies – that are preparing for the transition to net zero as well as those who have not yet developed strategies consistent with America’s Pledge or the UK’s legislated commitment to net zero. To take this approach global, we will share it with the 50 other central banks and supervisors in the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) so that they can stress test their own financial systems, which cover two thirds of the world’s emissions. Finally, return. The Paris Agreement calls on the financial sector to reorient financial flows in line with the two degree target. Achieving this transition will require sustainable investment to go mainstream. To do so, sustainable investment must do more than exclude incorrigibly brown industries and finance new, deep green technologies.  Sustainable investing must catalyse and support all companies that are working to transition from brown to green. 
     All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches 4  4   To date, approaches to measuring and managing the financial implications of climate change for investments have been inadequate.  Carbon footprints are not forward-looking, divestments only focus on the most carbon-intensive sectors, green investments are still small scale, and the impact of shareholder engagement is hard to measure. One of the most promising options is to assess the “warming potential” of investment portfolios.  For example, GPIF, the world’s largest pension fund, estimates that its assets are currently consistent with a  3.7 degree path.   Such a forward looking measure can help asset owners and asset managers understand the transition pathways of their investments and develop strategies to align financial flows with the necessary transition to net zero. Degree warming will reveal who is on the right and wrong side of history.  It will provide a signal to governments about where the economy is on the transition path and therefore the effectiveness of their policies.  It will empower consumers, giving them more choice in how to invest to support the transition. With our citizens, particularly the young, demanding climate action, it is becoming essential for asset owners to disclose the extent to which their clients’ money is being invested in line with the values of those clients. To this end, for COP26, the TCFD is establishing a subcommittee to consider how to standardise the methodology for measuring the warming potential of assets and expanding its use.  Conclusion A market in the transition to a net zero world is being built.  It will reveal how the valuations of companies could change over time as climate policies adapt and carbon intensity declines. It will expose the likely future costs of doing business, of paying for emissions, and of tighter regulation. It will help smooth price adjustments as society’s opinions and government policies change. As countries build their policy track records and their credibility grows, the financial system will amplify the impact of those policies and pull forward adjustment to the net zero carbon future, Consistent with the ambitions of America’s Pledge, the next year will be critical to mainstreaming sustainable finance.

 1 I. Introduction I am delighted to be given this opportunity to speak to you at this symposium.  Japan is at risk of various natural disasters -- wind and flood damage caused by typhoons or heavy rain, volcanic eruptions as well as earthquakes, such as the Great Hanshin-Awaji Earthquake and the Great East Japan Earthquake. This year again, typhoons such as Faxai and Hagibis inflicted serious damage. The probability that a massive earthquake may occur in the Nankai Trough off the Pacific coast within the next 30 years is estimated to be 70-80 percent. Disaster prevention measures have also been updated in preparation for cases where earthquakes occur consecutively with a certain time lag after the initial event in the Nankai Trough, something which has been experienced in the past.  Many other countries seem to be vigilant of the risks of terrorist attacks, cyber attacks, or widespread power outages triggered by transmission equipment malfunction. Growing attention, however, is being paid to natural disasters worldwide. According to statistical data on natural disasters compiled by the Université catholique de Louvain's Center for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters, the number of cases has recently been in the range of 300-350 a year, which is larger than in the past1  (Chart 1). Although different countries put priority on different risks, climate change risk has increasingly been recognized as a global issue, especially among European countries in recent years.2 This could also be related to unusual weather, including concentrated heavy rains frequently experienced in Japan lately.3                                                    1 The increase since the 1970s seems to partly reflect an improvement in the accuracy of statistics. Tomohiko Inui, "Shizen saigai to keizai seichō," Keizai Seminā, no. 706, February/March 2019 issue: 25. 2 Growing attention is being given to the impact of climate change on the real economy and financial system among financial supervisory authorities and central banks. This topic has been increasingly discussed at international conferences, including the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS). The Bank of Japan announced today (November 28) that it has joined the NGFS. For examples of central banks' initiatives on this issue, see Margherita Giuzio et al., "Climate Change and Financial Stability," Financial Stability Review, May 2019, https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/financial-stability/fsr/special/html/ecb.fsrart201905_1~47cf778cc1.en.html#toc1; and Lael Brainard, "Why Climate Change Matters for Monetary Policy and Financial Stability," speech at "The Economics of Climate Change," a research conference sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, November 8, 2019, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/brainard20191108a.htm. 3 According to a report compiled by Japan's Ministry of the Environment and others, there is no solid 
 2 How we should respond to climate change has been discussed from various perspectives thus far, but will be treated as a more practical, more global issue going forward.  Looking back at natural disasters in postwar Japan, many severe disasters are called to mind. In particular, Typhoon Vera, also known as the Isewan Typhoon, struck in September 1959, becoming a turning point for Japan in developing disaster countermeasures.4 The extensive damage caused by the Isewan Typhoon led to the Basic Act on Disaster Management, which stipulates the basics underlying Japan's disaster management and control measures, being enforced in 1962 (Chart 2). In response to this, the Bank of Japan formulated its disaster management operation plan in 1967.  The theme of this symposium is "The Impact of Natural Disasters on Financial Markets and Financial Institutions." Today, I would firstly like to describe the Bank's role and function in the context of Japan's disaster management, and then, referring to past actions, talk about the importance of maintaining "financial and settlement systems as social infrastructure" in times of disaster. In normal times, we tend to assume that social infrastructure, such as transportation, water, sewage, electricity, gas, and telecommunication, is naturally available like air. Once a large-scale disaster strikes, however, we become aware that whether such social infrastructure will continue to work or not is critical to our lives. Financial and settlement systems are also part of the social infrastructure. Facing a large-scale disaster, financial institutions play various roles as social infrastructure over time -- from the recovery phase to the reconstruction phase, for example (Chart 3). In the next part, I will first elaborate on the expected roles of financial institutions shortly after a disaster strikes.   Moreover, disaster management can be considered as a cycle of actions. The cycle is comprised of two parts: (1) post-disaster actions for minimizing the spread and prolongation                                                    evidence that the frequency and strength of cyclones have increased in the long run, except for the North Atlantic.

Particularly serious damage was experienced in Aichi, Mie, and Gifu Prefectures due to storm surge. 
 3 of damage and (2) pre-disaster actions for preventing damage and forecasting future disasters based on lessons from the past. It is important to view these two parts as an interrelated sequence, or a cycle (Chart 4).5 Toward the end of this talk, I would like to describe disaster management from this perspective.  II. The Bank of Japan as a Designated Public Institution The Bank is listed as a designated public institution in the Basic Act on Disaster Management, together with the Japanese Red Cross Society and electric power companies, for example. Along with the national and local governments, designated public institutions are required to make necessary arrangements to protect "the lives, bodies, and property of citizens from disaster." The Bank not only issues banknotes and conducts monetary policy, but also provides a system to settle funds smoothly among financial institutions. For example, let's consider the situation, shown in Chart 5, where you pay for goods and services by a bank transfer from your account at Bank A to the merchant's account at Bank B. Transaction information, such as the amount of transferred funds and the payee's account number, is notified to Bank B through the Zengin System, a nationwide online network system for banks. The net settlement position is calculated for each financial institution and notified to the Bank of Japan Financial Network System (BOJ-NET). Funds are then settled through financial institutions' current accounts at the Bank. In a situation where a firm makes a bank transfer for salary payment from its account at Bank B to your account at Bank A, funds are settled in the opposite direction. The Zengin System is affiliated with the Japanese Bankers Association, and the Bank monitors such major private payment and settlement systems at all times to ensure their stable operation. The BOJ-NET is a system developed and operated by the Bank, settling funds among financial institutions while preparing for various risks. The Bank prepares for necessary business continuity, aiming at fulfilling its mission of ensuring stable operation of payment and settlement systems in addition to issuing banknotes even in times of disaster.                                                     5 Cabinet Office, "Heisei 17-nen-ban bōsai hakusho" [White paper on disaster management 2005], 2005, http://www.bousai.go.jp/kaigirep/hakusho/h17/bousai2005/html/honmon/hm140106.htm. 
 4 III. Experience of the Great East Japan Earthquake What would you do if a severe earthquake strikes and an alert warning of massive tsunamis is issued a few minutes later? Those who are near the coast would evacuate to higher ground immediately with the bare minimum of belongings. What would you do if you return home after the tsunami recedes and find your cash muddy or burnt and stuck together at home? What if your passbooks or registered seals are washed away by the tsunami? What if your payday is next week but the bank branch at which you have an account is swept away by the tsunami? When the Great East Japan Earthquake struck in 2011, these problems actually occurred extensively in the affected areas, causing anxiety for many people.  At that time, financial institutions in the affected areas themselves were damaged, but continued to make strenuous efforts to fulfill their mission. To help us consider today's topic, let me briefly look back on the financial institutions' actions at the time.6  1. The Bank of Japan's Experience At 2:46 p.m. on March 11, 2011, the Bank's Sendai Branch experienced a strong quake. Objects fell from the ceiling and the branch was shrouded in haze created by dust. When the quake finally subsided, a voice resounded in the branch, "The BOJ-NET is functioning properly." Triggered by this call, the staff resumed their work to continue business operations. Financial institutions make massive fund transfers with each other via the BOJ-NET every day.7 If you compare money to the blood of Japan's economy, the shutdown of the BOJ-NET means the absence of blood flow in the economy.   The Bank made the following responses at the time. Firstly, 15 minutes after the earthquake occurred, it set up a disaster management team headed by the Governor. The team gathered information concerning the damage, coordinated with government and other relevant parties, and disseminated information domestically and internationally on the operational status of the Bank's offices and financial markets.                                                     6 Bank of Japan Payment and Settlement Systems Department, "Higashi Nihon Daishinsai chokugo no kin'yū kessai-men no dōkō: Dēta ni motozuku jijitsu seiri," BOJ Reports & Research Papers, March 2013, http://www.boj.or.jp/research/brp/ron_2013/data/ron130311a.pdf. 7 The value of fund transfers settled via the BOJ-NET were about 150 trillion yen on average every business day in fiscal 2018. 
 5  As March 11 was a Friday, the Bank's branches and offices in the affected Tohoku region continued to supply cash to financial institutions by opening service counters during the weekend. This was to meet the increased cash demand because, once a disaster occurs, people seek to hold more cash on hand out of a need to secure funds for immediate living expenses and out of fears about the future. In times of disaster, demand for cash tends to increase sharply as it performs the two-fold functions of money: a medium of exchange (i.e., a means of payment) and a store of value.8  A few days after the disaster, a massive amount of damaged banknotes and coins were brought to the Bank to be exchanged for clean ones. The Bank met these requests by sending staff from other parts of Japan to help branches in the affected areas. In Iwate Prefecture, where the Bank does not have a branch, we set up a temporary counter at a local financial institution to provide the exchange service.   The Bank delegates some services to private financial institutions to make payments for public pensions and government workers' salaries, as well as to provide services related to receipts and payments of treasury funds, including receipts of taxes. Since many of the delegated agents, or financial institutions' locations, were also damaged at the time,9 the Bank itself took over part of the work that was delegated to them. A timely response was required, partly because the payday for self-defense officers involved in relief and rescue operations in the region was scheduled in the week after the disaster.  With regard to payment and settlement systems, the BOJ-NET continued to operate in a stable manner without a halt even during the time of the disaster. The Bank also continued to monitor the operational status of the payment and settlement systems run by private organizations, working in cooperation with them as necessary to effect smooth settlement of transactions, including salary payments, which increased toward the end of the month.                                                      8 Strictly speaking, money also functions as a measure of value. 9 Of the 40 agents in the Tohoku region, 16 became temporarily unable to continue business operations. 
 6 2. Impact on financial institutions and their response Let me turn to the impact on financial institutions in the affected areas immediately after the disaster. As of March 14, about 280 locations were closed following the evacuation order in response to the tsunamis and the nuclear accident. This was more than 10 percent of all the locations of the 72 financial institutions headquartered in one of the six prefectures of the Tohoku region or Ibaraki Prefecture. This fact alone is enough to tell you that financial institutions found themselves in a difficult situation along with the affected population. How did financial institutions fulfill their roles as social infrastructure in this situation? Let us look back on their actions in details.   First, financial institutions in the affected areas sought to secure more abundant cash on hand than usual immediately after the disaster to meet increased cash demand from affected customers. These institutions withdrew cash from their current accounts at the Bank and delivered it to their headquarters and branches in the affected areas. Since there were traffic network disruptions and restrictions as well as a lack of cash-delivery vehicles, financial institutions in neighboring areas sometimes shared them. On the back of such actions, cash totaling about 310 billion yen was withdrawn from the Bank by financial institutions in the Tohoku region during the first week after the disaster. This is about three times the amount in the same period in the previous year.   Financial institutions conducted their business in a flexible manner to enable affected customers to withdraw their deposits as long as their identification was confirmed, even if they had lost their passbooks or registered seals. This response incorporated requests made by the Financial Services Agency and the Bank to financial institutions to treat affected people favorably.10 Disaster victims who had lost passbooks or other relevant documents were able to withdraw close to 6.0 billion yen from financial institutions by April 2011, even in the three affected prefectures alone (Chart 6). Moreover, when those affected brought waterlogged or burnt cash to financial institutions, they were able to exchange it for new cash. Damaged cash brought in by financial institutions and disaster victims was also exchanged at                                                    10 In general, the Financial Services Agency and the Bank make a decision on whether to put such requests forward to financial institutions each time the Disaster Relief Act is applied to the affected areas. 
 7 the Bank's service counters, the amount reaching 470,000 banknotes (3.5 billion yen) and 4,220,000 coins (0.14 billion yen) by March 2012 (Charts 7 and 8).   Even when financial institutions found it difficult to restore their affected branches, they remained available for affected depositors as much as possible by, for example, setting up temporary locations. Among the bank locations closed immediately after the disaster, about 40 percent resumed business by the end of March. During that time, 41 temporary locations were also set up (Charts 9 and 10).11   Meanwhile, the BOJ-NET and core payment and settlement systems in the private sector maintained stable operations as a whole. Even at the end of March, when there was a concentration of a large number of payments for salaries, public utility services, and others, there was no serious disruption in payments and settlements in the affected areas. Behind the scenes, the Zengin System, which processes transfer data, and the BOJ-NET extended operating hours for consecutive days to complete as many scheduled transactions as possible within the day.12 In addition, various other measures were taken to maintain the clearing function of financial institutions. They include some clearing houses covering the work of other clearing houses which had had to be closed due to damage to their buildings or other reasons.   At the time of the Great East Japan Earthquake, foreign media often reported that Japan's public order was maintained even in an extreme situation.13 I believe that ensuring the payment and settlement functions of financial institutions as well as the circulation of cash on the whole contributed to social stability in the affected areas.                                                    11 In addition, some financial institutions organized information-sharing arrangements among themselves so that affected persons who evacuated to distant locations would be able to withdraw cash at financial institutions other than those where they have accounts. 12 A system failure at a financial institution on March 14 significantly delayed its submission of transfer instructions to the Zengin System. The Zengin System and the BOJ-NET dealt with the situation by extending their operating hours.  13 Nicholas Kristof, "Sympathy for Japan, and Admiration," New York Times, March 11, 2011, https://kristof.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/11/sympathy-for-japan-and-admiration/.

 8  3. Developments in financial markets and policy response The Great East Japan Earthquake also had a significant impact on financial markets. When uncertainty about the future heightens due to a disaster or other reasons, financial institutions and firms seek more proactively to secure cash on hand, or liquidity. This is similar to households increasing their cash demand after the earthquake as I mentioned earlier.  In response to such developments, the Bank judged that it had to take all possible measures to relieve concern about funding immediately and ensure financial market stability. It provided funds totaling a record high of 21.8 trillion yen through funds-supplying operations on March 14, the first business day after the earthquake. The Bank continued to offer same-day funds-supplying operations for six consecutive business days through March 22 (Chart 11). With the Bank's provision of ample funds, there was no notable turbulence in money markets, where financial institutions lend and borrow funds with each other.  The Bank also decided on April 28, just about a month after the disaster, to introduce the funds-supplying operation to support financial institutions in disaster areas. Although this was quite some time before funding needs for recovery and reconstruction gained momentum, the Bank aimed to make funding by financial institutions easier there both in the initial and subsequent phases after the disaster.  Meanwhile, looking at the developments in the stock and foreign exchange markets, the Nikkei Stock Average, for instance, declined sharply as the damage became apparent, eventually falling by 1,015 yen, or 10.6 percent on March 15 from the previous business day (Chart 12). This rate of decline is still the third largest in history, following only those recorded on Black Monday in 1987 and after the Lehman Brothers failure in 2008. In the foreign exchange market, amid the yen's appreciation, concerted foreign exchange market intervention was conducted by the authorities of Japan, the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and the European Central Bank on March 18.   IV. Initiatives after the Great East Japan Earthquake Over eight years have passed since the Great East Japan Earthquake. Based on lessons from 
 9 the disaster, initiatives to enhance disaster management have been taken at various levels from Japan's government to individual firms, and are still under way. Financial institutions have also enhanced their disaster management programs, as can be summarized in the following three points (Chart 13).   The first is self-help initiatives. Many financial institutions faced risks of a power shortage and traffic network disruptions at the time of the earthquake. Such experiences highlighted the importance of having backup arrangements for computer systems and headquarters' functions at places remote from their headquarters -- for example, in Osaka when the headquarters is in Tokyo -- in order to maintain the payment and settlement functions even in times of disaster. In fact, financial institutions have striven to set up such sites and enhance their functions. Recently, an increasing number of financial institutions have introduced dual operation, under which not only main offices but also backup offices conduct part of their business operations even in normal times.14  The second is mutual assistance initiatives. Financial institutions have recognized that, given the expected magnitude of damage by a possible Nankai Trough Earthquake or other disasters, an individual institution alone cannot make adequate preparations, or even if it tries, it will be too costly compared to their management resources. Some of these financial institutions created regional councils, making arrangements where participating financial institutions will provide needed cash to each other in times of disaster. On the level of financial markets, including money markets, securities markets, and the foreign exchange market, initiatives have been pushed forward to enhance the framework of a market-level business continuity plan (BCP). This will enable financial institutions participating in the market to immediately share their damage situation and, based on that assessment, discuss possible changes to trading practices for the market to function smoothly.15                                                     14 According to a survey conducted by the Bank in May 2019, close to 80 percent of the financial institutions with backup offices in Osaka responded that they had introduced dual operation for some business in normal times. 15 The market-level BCP is a framework for participants in money markets, securities markets, and the foreign exchange market to share information and cooperate when disasters disrupt normal market management, with a view to maintaining or quickly recovering the functioning of markets. 
 10 The third is public assistance initiatives. Since the Great East Japan Earthquake, Japan's national and local governments have revised upward their estimation of damage that can be caused by possible large-scale earthquakes, floods due to heavy rains, and other disasters, and have also updated hazard maps. This imposed challenges on financial institutions, especially those located near the coast, but it added momentum to the progress of detailed considerations and preparations from the viewpoint of business continuity and employee safety. Specific measures based on local circumstances have also been advanced; for example, the improvement of priority roads that are supposed to be restored sooner as well as the registration of emergency vehicles -- both of which will be useful for cash delivery in times of disaster. Meanwhile, the Bank introduced a framework enabling financial institutions to receive cash from another nearby branch of the Bank when a branch of the Bank or an office of a financial institution which has a current account at a branch of the Bank is affected.16  V. Continuous Review and Enhancement of Business Continuity Arrangements Of all the financial institutions in Japan, how many have already prepared business continuity arrangements? According to the Bank's survey in 2014, 85 percent of the financial institutions, including banks and securities companies, answered that a companywide business continuity management framework had already been put in place and regularly reviewed.17 Financial institutions run their businesses while assessing various risks such as the credit risk of borrowers and market risk associated with bond holdings. Operational risk, including that for computer system failures, also needs to be considered, and therefore, upgrading business continuity arrangements is an important managerial issue in disaster preparation. Given this, financial institutions take it for granted that such arrangements should be in place, but there is also a need to advance them further. From my perspective, with a view to serving as social infrastructure even in times of disaster, three things are expected of financial institutions going forward (Chart 14). Each contributes to the enhancement of resilience against disasters -- that is, the capability to minimize the damage, achieve prompt recovery, and continue business operations.                                                     16 http://www5.boj.or.jp/hakken/hatsu1809.pdf. 17 Bank of Japan Financial System and Bank Examination Department, "Questionnaire Survey on Business Continuity Management (September 2014)," Paper Series on Risk Management in Financial Institutions, May 2015, https://www.boj.or.jp/en/research/brp/ron_2015/data/ron150515a.pdf.  
 11 The first is to enhance disaster preparedness. Referred to as the "6 Ps" -- Proper Planning and Preparation Prevents Poor Performance -- it is essential to repeatedly review and improve business continuity arrangements by taking the opportunities of coping with actual disasters and by conducting periodic emergency drills. The Bank practices an emergency drill every September, involving its disaster management team headed by the Governor. We have continued to update the way it is conducted, for instance, by implementing the drill scenarios, including the details and extent of damage, without advance disclosure to the participants, but presenting them with the information on the spot. To improve our existing business continuity arrangements, we have reflected on lessons learned from each drill. It is essential for each financial institution to get their business continuity framework entrenched in its organization and keep working toward increasing its feasibility in times of disaster by, for example, updating the content of emergency drills and reviewing their experience under management leadership.   The second is to enhance inter-organizational cooperation. When a disaster strikes, controlling the damage is key. In this connection, cooperation among related organizations matters to minimize the impact of the damage and achieve a swifter recovery. One option is to build relationships in normal times with local governments, financial institutions, utility firms as well as monetary authorities, including the Bank's branches, to be able to cooperate in times of disaster as necessary. It is also important to confirm that there is no significant gap with the counterparts in their business continuity arrangements and assumed emergency situations.  The third is to enhance flexibility and imagination. Changes in circumstances and the emergence of new risks take place constantly. As I mentioned earlier, climate change risk has been increasingly recognized worldwide. Moreover, although it is not a natural disaster, we have also observed increasing cyber security threats on a global scale in recent years. In the financial sector, cyber drills are conducted both at an international level, such as under the G-7 framework, and at a domestic level, among financial institutions. National governments have also taken the lead in developing cyber countermeasures.18 Such cyber security                                                    18 For a work that raised alarms over cyber risk, see David E. Sanger, The Perfect Weapon: War, Sabotage, and Fear in the Cyber Age (London: Scribe, 2018). Principles for regulatory response to 
 12 measures have become even more important with the increasing use of mobile payments. Japan's national and local governments may revise their disaster damage estimation again in the future, and public expectations of services provided by social infrastructure may also change. It is vital to pay due attention to changes in circumstances and the emergence of new risks, reviewing with flexibility and a fertile imagination to see whether there is any room for improvement in business continuity arrangements.   VI. Concluding Remarks Thus far, my discussion has focused on the role of financial institutions in times of disaster, while looking back on their response to the Great East Japan Earthquake. In times of disaster, it is critical that financial institutions ensure cash circulation and maintain their payment and settlement functions as social infrastructure underpinning financial and economic activities. Even if we are prepared for disasters, we are often required to take different measures in times of actual disaster. After a disaster winds down, it is essential to reflect on the experience, serving as a starting point toward more advanced preparation for possible future disasters. In this sense, risk and crisis management never ends.19  I heard that the Central Japan Economic Federation published a report on the current situation and challenges of the social infrastructure in preparation for the Nankai Trough Earthquake, one of the anticipated natural disaster risks particularly feared in this region.20 I expect financial institutions to further advance the reviews of disaster management and actions to                                                    cyber risk are proposed mainly from the perspective of macroprudential policy in Anil K.

 13 ensure the safety of their employees and play the necessary roles in their respective business areas. The Bank will continue to provide firm support for their efforts.  Let me close my presentation by citing a brief episode I heard about. After the Great East Japan Earthquake, a student found muddy banknotes in a chest of drawers at the back of a room, when he, as a volunteer, helped an affected family to clean up their house after being flooded by the tsunami. The student visited a branch of the Bank with the family, and they had the muddy banknotes exchanged for clean, new ones. The student now works at the Bank. It is among the missions of the Bank to make sure that cash will be provided and circulated even in times of disaster.  Thank you for your kind attention.

1  Senad Softić PhD Governor, Central Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina Conference: Macroeconomic Imbalances and EU Convergence 07 November 2019 Welcome speech and opening of the Conference  Dear friends of the Central Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina, distinguished panelists, dear guests, dear colleagues, a very good morning to all of you. It is my great pleasure to welcome you to Sarajevo, to another international research conference of the central bank, jointly organized with the USAID FINRA project.  A number of experts have agreed that large macro imbalances were the main cause of the Euro area crisis. The EU has reacted with many institutional and organizational changes. This process will continue and our conference hopes to be a part of the efforts to discuss both the macroeconomic imbalances and the EU convergence process.  I would mention some of the main macroeconomic imbalances: excessive government deficits and debts, excessive bank credit expansion, stock market and real estate bubbles, and large external 
2  account surplus or deficits. All of them can result in serious economic problems if unattended.  In Bosnia and Herzegovina, as you all know, we have a currency board regime. We do not have independent monetary policy, nor can we use nominal exchange rate as a policy tool. If action is needed, we must rely on fiscal policy or use flexible labor markets to bring about the necessary adjustment. Fiscal policy options can also be limited, especially if there is a trend of ageing population or decrease in working age population. In the case of structural imbalances, even fiscal policy measures can be of reduced efficiency. Policy makers must keep in mind the macroeconomic context. Let us take, for example, the annual growth rates of credit in BH in 2006, 2007 and the first half of 2008. Just before the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), loans to private sector were growing at the rate higher than 30 per cent annually. Although it was viewed as a sign of overheating, the policy makers also considered factors such as low initial levels of lending. Today, such accelerated credit growth would be considered a serious vulnerability.   Similarly, the path of the accession towards the EU is bringing structural changes to a candidate country’s economy. The convergence process itself will generate imbalances that, if not addressed properly, may be dangerous for macroeconomic stability. If the imbalances are neglected, the country may, at best, stay in the accession process for a long time. During the accession period, the legal framework and 
3  institutional landscape of the EU continues to evolve, so, this may trigger additional challenges in the process of economic convergence.  BH is far from formally reporting to the European Commission via the defined framework for countries’ identification of and reporting on macroeconomic imbalances within the so-called European Semester. For this conference, we have selected several topics that are relevant for the Central and Eastern European EU member states, and the Balkans. These will indicate the kind of challenges which might lie ahead for BH and other candidate and potential candidate countries. In addition, BH may better understand how fast real economic convergence might happen. Today, we will also share with you some findings of the key macroeconomic imbalances in BH. We have also chosen two topics that are of special interest to central banks: the harmonization between business and financial cycles, and the determinants of real exchange rates. None is fully dependent on the actions of central banks, but both have an impact on them.  Finally, I would like to express my gratitude to the authors and panelists for accepting our invitation to come and share their key messages with us. Ladies and gentlemen, it is our wish that this conference contribute to improvement of macroeconomic policymaking in Bosnia and Herzegovina and productive and professional dialogue with institutions of the European Union. I am certain that this conference will build new and enhance the existing ties between the researchers and policy 
4  makers. It should help us all to better understand the mechanisms between various macroeconomic segments and different policy makers. Allow me to finish by wishing you all a successful and interesting day. Thank you so much for your attention.  
Stephen S Poloz: Big issues ahead - the Bank of Canada’s 2020visionRemarks by Mr Stephen S Poloz, Governor of the Bank of Canada, to the Empire Club ofCanada, Toronto, Ontario, 12 December 2019.*   *   *IntroductionIt has become a tradition for me to give a speech at the end of the year about the major issuesaffecting the Canadian economy. I will only get to say this once, so I hope you will permit me…Today, I want to focus on the Bank’s 2020 vision.I want to walk you through some of the major forces acting on the economy and indicate what theBank will be doing about them. I touched on some of these issues back in September at theChanging Fortunes Round Table at Spruce Meadows, in Calgary. Since then, I’ve been workingto formalize those ideas in a paper, which the Bank is publishing today.In stepping back from the many short-term issues we have on our plate, I can avoid covering thesame ground as in last week’s speech by Deputy Governor Tim Lane. Tim discussed theconsiderations behind our latest interest rate announcement and offered an excellent historicalanalysis to put it all in context.Big issues aheadThe basic story of the global economy since the 2008 global financial crisis has been one ofdisappointing economic growth—serial disappointment, we came to call it. Yes, it proved verydifficult to recover from the Great Recession that followed the crisis. But other long-term,structural factors have also been at work.Two basic factors drive trend economic growth: population growth and productivity growth.Global population growth peaked in the mid-1960s and has been slowing ever since. This puts anatural brake on global economic growth. And recent productivity gains have not been largeenough to offset the impact of this demographic slowdown.There is of course potential for higher productivity growth in the future. I am referring to what hasbeen called the fourth industrial revolution—the increasing use of artificial intelligence (AI),machine learning and big data throughout our economy. However, judging from past experience,these productivity gains could be slow to arrive. Computers went into widespread use during the1980s, but a surge in productivity growth did not emerge until the period from 1995 to 2005. Idelivered a paper about this a few weeks ago at a conference hosted by the Federal ReserveBank of San Francisco.Besides, the near-term risks around productivity growth are tilted to the downside. This isbecause trade conflicts, and the emergence of nationalist or populist policies more generally,threaten to reverse some of the prior productivity gains made through globalization. Tariffs onimports are forcing companies to dismantle supply chains and create new ones that are likely tobe less efficient. At the same time, uncertainty about the future of trade policies and criticalinstitutions like the World Trade Organization is having a more insidious effect—companies havecut their investment plans, which also means less potential economic growth in the future.On balance, then, it looks like the global economy is set for continued slow economic growth formostly structural reasons. For these same reasons, this means that low interest rates are likelyto persist too. 1 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
To be clear, I am not making a near-term prediction about the Bank of Canada’s policy rate. I amtalking about structural forces acting on the global economy and global interest rates over aperiod of years. In any era, interest rates fluctuate around a trend line, which is determined bystructural forces, not by monetary policy. What I am saying is that in this era, it looks like interestrates are likely to fluctuate around historically low levels.Now, one possible consequence of persistently low interest rates is that household indebtednessmay continue to increase relative to the overall economy. Government indebtedness might alsocontinue to rise as governments try to kick-start sluggish economies.The world stock of debt of all types is now more than three times global gross domestic product(GDP). Experience shows that high debt levels can amplify the impact of a shock on theeconomy, such as a rise in unemployment. This is because some borrowers could default ontheir debts, leading financial institutions to lend less, or even fail. Meanwhile, governments with ahigh debt load may be less able to stimulate a faltering economy.In Canada, household indebtedness is our most important financial vulnerability. The latest datashow household debt is 177 percent of disposable income, a bit below last year’s record high,but still elevated.For some countries it is the stock of government debt that causes the most concern. USgovernment debt is more than 100 percent of GDP and rising quickly. In Japan, it is more than200 percent. In comparison, Canada’s total government debt is close to 90 percent of GDP, ofwhich federal debt is about 30 percent.Policy-makers have taken the lessons learned from the 2008 global financial crisis to heart. Theyhave imposed new rules on banks around capital and liquidity, and the global financial system ismuch safer today as a result. Here in Canada, authorities have also imposed stricter guidelinesaround mortgage lending to help contain financial vulnerabilities. Thanks to these changes, evenif household indebtedness rises further, its sustainability is gradually improving.In contrast, the lessons of the Great Inflation of the 1970s seem to be fading from our collectivememory. Perhaps the recent tendency for inflation to run below target in many countries hasfostered a degree of complacency. More likely, inflation risk is being overwhelmed by deepstructural forces limiting economic growth, keeping even long-term interest rates very low.The risk of a surprise outbreak in global inflation is low. But it seems to me that the combinationof elevated household and government indebtedness and populist politics holds inflationarypotential for some countries. Some leaders are even actively questioning both the value ofinflation targets and the need for central banks to be politically independent. Highly indebtedhouseholds might be inclined to vote for politicians proposing to promote higher inflation. The factis, the Great Inflation of the 1970s resulted in a substantial transfer of wealth from savers toborrowers, including to governments.Fortunately, we have an institutional framework in Canada that addresses this risk directly. TheBank of Canada and the federal government agree formally and transparently every five years onthe goals of monetary policy. This gives our inflation targets democratic legitimacy, whileproviding the Bank the operational independence to pursue them. Importantly, Canada alsomaintains a flexible exchange rate, which is essential to maintaining low and stable inflationdomestically, regardless of developments abroad.Our 2020 visionGiven this backdrop, a veritable smorgasbord of work will be going on at the Bank in 2020. But letme focus on four areas. 2 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
Inflation-target renewalFirst is the inflation-targeting agreement I just mentioned. The next renewal of the agreement isscheduled for 2021. The Bank uses the time between renewals to take stock of experience withthe framework and to look seriously at any improvements we can make to our monetary policy.There is a section on our website where you can follow the current renewal process. Here weare posting new research as it is completed and providing information on workshops andconferences that are dedicated to the topic. In this renewal cycle we are going back to basics,comparing alternative targeting frameworks—such as inflation-averaging strategies and nominal-GDP targeting—with inflation targeting. We are also researching the various tools we have at ourdisposal and how our policy interacts with other public policies.Moreover, we are expanding our efforts to gather outside views on these issues. We have beentalking to a wide range of stakeholder groups, including business and labour organizations,academics and other central banks. In 2020, we plan to hold a number of round tables with civilsociety stakeholders to deepen our understanding of the economy across sectors and regions.As an accountable public institution, we are eager to hear your views. That is why in 2020, we willconduct an open, public consultation process on our website to gather input from Canadiansacross the country.We will summarize these public and stakeholder consultations, as well as new research on thesubject, on our website in late 2020. We will then make a recommendation to the governmentand hold discussions that will lead to the next formal agreement on the framework in 2021.Monetary policy and financial stabilityAnother important area for the Bank next year will be to continue to embed financial stabilitylinkages in our monetary policy framework.Let me illustrate with an example. Consider a situation where we updated our economic forecastand concluded that inflation was likely to move below our target. Our models would suggest thatwe should lower interest rates to stimulate economic growth and bring projected inflation back totarget, usually over six to eight quarters.Now consider the same situation, but with high levels of financial vulnerabilities. Strongereconomic growth from lower interest rates would make it easier for everyone to service theirdebt. But lower interest rates would also encourage a buildup of more debt, making economicgrowth more vulnerable to a future shock to the economy. In turn, this could make it harder toachieve the inflation target sometime in the future.Accordingly, bringing financial vulnerabilities into the equation means introducing a degree offlexibility into the inflation-targeting process. The horizon over which we would work to getinflation back to target depends on the severity of financial vulnerabilities. Of course, to the extentthat macroprudential policies are in place to keep financial vulnerabilities in check, policy-makerscan put less weight on those vulnerabilities.Over the past couple of years, Bank staff have developed a new framework to help us objectivelyevaluate this trade-off, called a growth-at-risk model. It combines the risks to economic growthand inflation coming from both the macroeconomy and financial vulnerabilities in any givensetting. It requires a lot of judgment to use, but this framework is helping to bring more rigour toour deliberations and to our communications.The growth-at-risk framework we are using today is a prototype, based on internationalexperience with financial vulnerabilities and on a very simple macroeconomic model. Work toenhance the model and incorporate more Canadian detail into the financial vulnerabilities is well 3 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
underway and these enhancements should be deployed in 2020. Meanwhile, we will continue torefine our core economic forecasting models to enrich the linkages between the financial sectorand the economy. We have also begun to scope out a work program on the next-generationeconomic model to replace our core structural projection model, ToTEM (Terms-of-TradeEconomic Model). Judging from past experience, this effort could take up to 5 to 10 years.The impact of digitalizationA third area of focus for the Bank in 2020 will be to assess the economic and financial impact ofdigitalization.As I mentioned earlier, we can see evidence of the spread of AI all around us. Its effects on theeconomy may be profound. My main message in San Francisco was that the fourth industrialrevolution is likely to follow the pattern of the previous three. We can expect a significantdisruption of workers in many industries. We can also expect the new technologies to lead tostronger growth in sectors where they are deployed. And the higher productivity that will result willincrease the economy’s potential to grow. This will create new job opportunities widelythroughout the economy, while also causing inflation to fall short of what our models wouldpredict.So far, we have not seen signs of higher productivity in the economic data. Once again, theexperience of previous industrial revolutions can be instructive. In the last few years of the 1990sand early 2000s, we now know that productivity rose quickly. But the economic statistics of thetime did not capture this until long after the fact because it is difficult to measure developments innew economic sectors. It is certainly possible that the same dynamics will emerge in the nearfuture.In 2020, the Bank will be working hard on new ways to detect and determine the economicimpact of the fourth industrial revolution. One area that shows promise is to use AI to analyze bigdata for keywords and to build synthetic indicators of technological change. Michelle Alexopoulosfrom the University of Toronto, a winner of a Bank of Canada Fellowship Award, is doinginnovative work in this area. Of course, we will also continue to talk directly to Canadiancompanies to gather intelligence on the spread of AI.The future of moneyFinally, there is the central banker’s favourite subject, money. Technology is affecting howCanadians make payments, so it will affect money too.To start with, Payments Canada is working with the Bank and with the major financial institutionsto modernize our core payments systems. This will allow for wider access and more innovation.The first stage is to replace the wholesale system, now over 20 years old, which managestransfers between major financial institutions and through which the Bank of Canada operates.Most of the work on the new wholesale system should be completed in 2020.Now, the wholesale system handles most of the dollar value of payments. But there arethousands of times more retail transactions on any given day. So, modernizing the retailpayments system is a top priority. Two to three years from now, you will be able to executetransactions between yourselves in real time—a major advance over today’s lags.These prospects have the Bank thinking hard about the future of money, especially cash. Adecade ago, more than half of all transactions in Canada were done with cash. Today, thatnumber has dropped to about one-third. It is more and more common to see people tap a card ortake out their phone to make a payment. Canadians are also doing more business online, andmore than half of us have sent money with PayPal or Interac e-transfer. Certain businesses havebegun to accept only electronic payments. 4 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
I believe that central bank money—the bank notes you have in your pocket—will always providean important public good: an individual’s sovereign right to make payments with an instrumentthat is universally accepted and final. A private digital currency cannot deliver that, regardless ofhow widespread its use may become. The other nice thing about cash is that it will still workeven during power blackouts or cyber attacks. As a consequence, bank notes will probablyalways be around to some degree, if only as a contingency for unusual events.All things considered, then, it is an open question whether the Bank of Canada would ever seethe need to issue a currency in digital form as a substitute for cash. Nevertheless, the world ofmoney is evolving very rapidly, so we need to develop plans to deal with whatever contingencyarises. We will have more to say about this early in 2020.Given this context, the Bank needs to think about other emerging payment technologies. Theseinclude cryptoassets, such as Bitcoin, as well as stablecoins, such as Libra. Because these arepotentially global, they are attracting attention from central banks and other regulatory authorities.Such innovations will bring new risks to the financial system. We need to understand these risksand apply appropriate regulation. One area of particular interest to central banks is cross-bordertransactions.As usual, the Bank will be working on many more issues in 2020 than I have been able tosummarize here. Before I conclude, though, let me mention one topic that has garnered a lot ofinterest lately: Modern Monetary Theory.Essentially, the idea is that governments that can issue their own currency can never gobankrupt. Accordingly, rather than borrowing from the public by issuing bonds, governmentsshould spend as much newly issued money as needed to keep the economy growing andmaintain stable inflation.This sounds like Modern Monetary Theory is offering a free lunch, and most of us know there isno such thing. First, the idea is not monetary. Government spending is a fiscal decision, not onefor the central bank. Second, the idea is not modern. It has been tried many times in the past,and the record is not pretty. For example, in the late 1960s the US government was running largefiscal deficits to finance the war in Vietnam. This led to very rapid money creation. The result wasa breakdown of the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates and a surge in global inflationspanning the 1970s. There are far better means of avoiding slow growth and deflation—promoting innovation, providing infrastructure, removing impediments to international andintranational trade, eliminating red tape—just to cite a few obvious examples. With stronger trendgrowth, fiscal and monetary policy can focus on buffering economic fluctuations.ConclusionIt is time for me to conclude.We can see the broad forces of low interest rates, rising debt and technological change workingin combination to stress households, companies and governments. The impact of these forceswill keep the Bank of Canada busy in 2020 and beyond. The precise way these forces will unfoldis highly uncertain. All of us—consumers, business people, policy-makers—will have to deal withthese sources of uncertainty over the long term.That sounds challenging, and I will not pretend otherwise. But when you consider the broadsweep of history, you must admit that Canadians have always had to deal with powerful globalforces and uncertainty, some more potent than the ones we face today. Yet here we are, in athriving modern economy.That is not to say things are perfect. Far from it—sectors and regions of our country continue tostruggle, and policy-makers have lots of work to do. Still, consider what we have been through 5 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
over the past decade—the global financial crisis, the subsequent slow recovery, the collapse ofoil prices, and political uncertainty abroad. Despite all of that, Canada’s economy is operatingclose to capacity, inflation is on target, labour force participation is up across almost all agegroups, and the jobless rate is near historic lows.In my experience, one should never underestimate the ability of Canadians to face and overcomechallenges, using the same tools they always have—hard work and ingenuity.I wish you the very best for 2020. 6 / 6BIS central bankers' speeches
I would like to thank Don Coletti and Erik Ens for their help in preparing this speech. Not for publication before November 19, 2019 13:00 Eastern Time Remarks  Carolyn A. Wilkins – Senior Deputy Governor International Finance Club of Montréal  Montréal, Quebec November 19, 2019 Financial Stability in an Uncertain WorldIntroduction It’s always a pleasure to be here in Montréal. I’d like to thank the International Finance Club of Montréal for the invitation.  Today, I’d like to speak with you about financial stability in Canada, in a world that seems more and more uncertain. This is part of our commitment to update Canadians twice a year about financial-stability issues that are relevant to them.1  The Canadian economy is performing relatively well overall. Inflation is close to target, the unemployment rate is near historic lows, and wage growth has picked up. There are, nonetheless, important regional differences. The Quebec economy is performing particularly well these past few years, bringing many people back to work. However, the ongoing adjustment to lower oil prices continues to weigh on economic activity in the energy-producing provinces, causing hardship for many people. Beyond our shores, the global economy is facing immense challenges. The trade war between the United States and China is top of mind for all of us. Yes, there is a possibility of an initial deal. Still, uncertainty about trade policy remains high. This uncertainty has caused a global slowdown and even fears of a global recession—1 Every spring, the Bank of Canada publishes an extensive assessment of key vulnerabilities and risks to the financial system in the Financial System Review (FSR). Bank staff also conduct research throughout the year to keep Governing Council informed of issues we may want to flag to our federal or provincial partners or tell Canadians about. You can find this material on the Bank’s Financial System Hub. 
-2-    though most baseline forecasts, including our own, don’t call for one. Even if the trade war doesn’t get any worse, by 2021 it could cost around US$1 trillion in lost economic output around the world. As you saw in our latest Monetary Policy Report (MPR), Canada’s being hit too, but a domestic recession isn’t in our forecast either.  The trade war isn’t the only source of uncertainty. There’s Brexit, tensions in the Middle East and social unrest in Hong Kong and some countries in Latin America. Risk managers here today know how difficult it is to design business strategies in this environment.  The Bank of Canada and other authorities must assess the risks and have the right safeguards in place. Ideally, you want to put the winter tires on before the snow falls. It not only protects you, but also everyone else who’s on the road.  I’d like to spend my time today making three points: 1. Canada has made progress taming financial vulnerabilities over the past couple of years—but that doesn’t mean we can let our guard down.   2. The global context has worsened, increasing risks to the global expansion and the chances of financial stress that could spill over into Canada.  3. In the unlikely event of a storm, Canada’s financial system is resilient, and we are in a good position to deal with whatever comes our way.  I will also share our research plan for a major issue that is shaping the financial system—climate change.  Keeping vulnerabilities in check You’ve heard us say for a while now that Canada’s biggest domestic financial vulnerabilities are the high level of household indebtedness and imbalances in the housing market. We worry about these things because weaknesses in the financial system can make economic outcomes far worse if a downside risk comes to pass.  Let’s remember where we were a few years ago. Household debt had climbed to nearly 1.8 times disposable income. Almost one in five new borrowers had mortgages at least 4½ times their income. National house-price growth peaked at 20 percent (year over year), with increases in the Toronto and Vancouver areas even higher into the stratosphere.  The good news here is that we have made progress. Credit growth has moderated, and income growth has picked up. So the debt-to-income ratio has been stable over the past couple of years. Also, the share of new mortgages going to highly indebted borrowers fell to a low of 13 percent. Growth in home prices in Toronto has slowed to a more sustainable pace. In Vancouver, prices continue to fall relative to last year but are showing signs of stabilizing. And expectations of future price increases in these markets have come back to Earth.  
-3-    These improvements didn’t happen on their own. Federal authorities made changes to mortgage-financing rules to ensure that borrowers could handle higher interest rates or lower incomes.2 British Columbia and Ontario introduced tax measures to reduce demand for housing from non-residents and speculative buyers. And the Bank increased its policy interest rate from 0.5 percent in mid-2017 to 1.75 percent last autumn, where it remains today. We did this to achieve our inflation target, and when borrowing costs rise, credit growth slows.   Due to the stricter requirements and higher mortgage rates, some people have been unable to buy the homes that they wanted. Some are buying less expensive homes, and others are saving for a larger down payment. We need to remember that house prices would have been even less affordable had authorities left the vulnerabilities unchecked. This is true across Canada, but particularly in Toronto and Vancouver.  Despite the progress that we’ve made in addressing vulnerabilities, household debt is still elevated. It will likely remain high for a while, particularly if global interest rates remain low. Households’ debt-servicing costs are also at a historic high.  While we seem to have avoided the hard landing in housing that many had feared, prices in Toronto and Vancouver are still about 40 percent higher than in 2015, when the pickup began. They’re also notably higher in markets that weren’t on the radar then, such as Montréal. We also see that mortgage credit growth and some housing prices have started to pick up again. The market has been boosted by a drop in mortgage rates. And the share of new mortgages going to highly indebted borrowers has started to creep up.3 Many of the same ingredients that were present in some housing markets three years ago—namely strong underlying demand, tight supply and low interest rates—are present again. This time, however, we expect that the regulatory and other measures in place will support the quality of new credit and mitigate the buildup of imbalances in the housing market. This is not the time to let our guard down, though. Robust defences are especially important when difficulties abroad could affect us at home.                                              2 Prudential regulators in Alberta, Saskatchewan and Quebec adopted similar guidelines, as did some credit unions—on a voluntary basis—in other parts of Canada. 3 Mortgage rates are down about 100 basis points since the beginning of the year because of weaker foreign interest rates. Data for the third quarter of 2019 show that the share of new mortgages with a loan-to-income ratio of 450 percent or greater has risen from 13 to 15 percent.   
-4-    Global context clouding skies This brings me to my second point. The global context has worsened, increasing risks to the global expansion and chances of financial stress. Participants in our latest Financial System Survey would agree.4 The trade war is a major concern.  As I said earlier, we don’t see a recession as the most likely outcome, particularly given that global monetary policy conditions have eased in recent months. It’s still our job to understand what might happen if things were to go terribly wrong.5 That means looking at different ways that a perfect storm might play out.  Numerous financial vulnerabilities at the global level are all related to the usual suspect: leverage. Total global debt is now more than 3 times global gross domestic product (GDP), much higher than it was before the Great Recession. This leaves many households, businesses and governments exposed should their financial situations deteriorate.6 It also means that an economic downturn could be deeper than usual and fraught with financial stresses. I’ve already discussed high leverage in the household sector in Canada. Other countries such as Sweden and Australia are facing similar vulnerabilities.  When it comes to non-financial corporate debt, the worries extend to both advanced economies, including Canada, and emerging economies. The quality of debt has declined, with about 50 percent of investment-grade corporate bonds issued in the United States and Europe now rated BBB. In a downturn, when corporate profits are challenged, the risk is that these bonds are downgraded, making it more costly for these firms to fund themselves. Corporate debt in emerging markets has also exploded, as investors search for yield in the low interest-rate environment. China accounts for around two-thirds of the more than US$30 trillion in outstanding emerging-market corporate debt. Non-bank financial intermediation has enabled a lot of this borrowing, and cross-border flows of funds into equity and debt have grown as sources of capital flows.  An increasing proportion of corporate bonds are being packaged and sold to retail investors in exchange-traded funds (ETFs). These investors are looking for higher returns, but with the sort of liquidity that they associate with equities. The biggest ETF market is in the United States, but Canada’s ETF market is also growing. The concern                                             4 Cyber risk also features prominently in their list of concerns. For more detail, see the highlights of our latest Financial System Survey, which we posted to our website yesterday. 5 In the October MPR, we presented a downside risk scenario with a significant rise in uncertainty. This scenario captured many channels likely to affect the Canadian economy, including foreign demand and commodity prices. It also attempted to capture some amplification from elevated household debt. It did not, however, include the effects of any financial turbulence coming from international markets. 6 See C. A. Wilkins, “The Age of Leverage” (remarks to UBC Vancouver School of Economics and CFA Society Vancouver, Vancouver, British Columbia, March 14, 2019).  
-5-    is that in times of stress, redemptions of fixed-income ETF shares could amplify volatility in the value of these shares and in prices in the underlying corporate bond market.  Other riskier forms of lending, such as leveraged loans, which are increasingly being packaged into collateralized loan obligations (CLOs), have been growing rapidly too.7 Globally there’s about US$700 billion of CLOs outstanding and issuance is strong. The financial engineering behind the structure has been improved since the crisis, but there is still room for concern. For one, the quality of the underlying loans has declined, and many of them lack the usual protections through covenants.  The dynamics in an unwind of any of these more complex instruments could look a lot like a case of déjà-vu. Those in Montréal during the financial crisis will remember that complexity of financial engineering and liquidity mismatch were at the heart of more than one problem.  The first line of defence against these risks is clearly with people like you in this room— understanding and mitigating your own risks and building contingency plans in case something goes wrong. The Bank is stepping up our own monitoring too, especially as it pertains to non-bank financial intermediation, and is leading an initiative to build greater information sharing among federal and provincial regulators.8, 9  Now, how could the trade war create a perfect storm? What I mean by a perfect storm is a combination of an economic downturn and financial stress. An increase in uncertainty or bad trade news could be the trigger. This, in turn, could spark a sharp reversal in risk premiums and lead to a drop in prices for assets, including for houses. Creditors would see more defaults, especially from corporations with lower credit ratings. Moreover, if enough investors rushed to adjust their portfolios at the same time, liquidity would dry up, amplifying the effects.10 All of this would find its way to the banking system, making it harder for business owners and families to borrow and intensifying the downturn.  Resilient to storm pressures Let me now turn to my third point: the Canadian financial system is highly resilient.                                             7 Leveraged loans are high-yield loans to non-financial corporations with lower credit ratings. Banks underwrite most leveraged loans and issue them in US and European markets. They are sold to a wide range of financial system participants, and a substantial share is securitized into CLOs. CLO structures are subject to tighter regulations than they were before the global financial crisis, including more stringent subordination requirements and restrictions on asset holdings. 8 See G. Bédard-Pagé, “Non-Bank Financial Intermediation in Canada: An Update,” Bank of Canada Financial System Hub (March 26, 2019). 9 The Bank chairs the Heads of Regulatory Agencies (HoA), a federal-provincial forum for discussing financial sector issues. The HoA also includes the Department of Finance Canada, the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions, the Quebec Autorité des Marchés Financiers, the Ontario Securities Commission, the Alberta Securities Commission and the British Columbia Securities Commission. 10 In our May 2019 FSR, Bank staff looked at what would happen to open-ended fixed-income mutual funds in Canada if many people pulled their investments out simultaneously.  
-6-    Canadian banks are part of a global banking system that is more solid than it was a decade ago. Globally active banks are holding over US$2 trillion more capital than they were at the beginning of 2011, when the phase-in of the post-crisis reforms began. This translates to a 7-percentage point increase in their Tier 1 capital ratio.11  The leverage limits and new liquidity regulations also make these banks more resilient.12 Canada has implemented new measures to further strengthen our banking system. For example, Canada’s prudential regulator, the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI), increased the required amount of capital that Canada’s big banks have to hold to protect themselves against financial-system vulnerabilities. Canada introduced a bail-in regime to ensure that investors—not taxpayers—would take the brunt of the financial burden in the unlikely event that a big bank were to fail. Also, OSFI asked many smaller, single-business-line banks to reduce their reliance on short-term brokered funding, which can be flightier in stressful situations.  The Bank of Canada, along with OSFI, evaluates these safeguards by conducting stress tests on the major banks. Given that the idea is to plan for the worst, it’s important to study extreme scenarios. The most recent test was in the context of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)’s Financial System Stability Assessment of Canada, published in June.13 The scenario used was worse than anything seen in Canada in recent decades. There’s a recession that lasts two years, the unemployment rate increases by 6 percentage points, and house prices fall by 40 percent.14 Clearly this would be very difficult for people if it were to materialize. That said, this test found that our banks could withstand even this kind of severe, system-wide shock. This says to me that efforts to increase resilience in the banking system have been worthwhile, because they would help prevent a bad situation from becoming even worse.  When assessing the risks, it’s important to look at a range of scenarios. In the October MPR, for example, we studied the impact of a rise in uncertainty that’s large enough to cause the current global slowdown to become significantly worse, though not nearly as bad as in the IMF stress test.15 Our analysis found that Canada would be hit particularly hard because demand for our exports and commodity prices would both fall. The fact that household debt is higher than it was in 2008 would make things worse too. That’s because indebted households facing a deteriorating financial situation would have to adjust their consumption spending more than they would have had to in the past. In fact, this factor amplifies the negative impact on domestic consumption by about 30 percent.                                             11 A bank’s Tier 1 capital ratio is the ratio of its equity capital to its total risk-weighted assets. 12 See T. Gomes and C. A. Wilkins, “The Basel III Liquidity Standards: An Update,” Bank of Canada Financial System Review (June 2013): 37–43. 13 See International Monetary Fund, “Canada: Financial System Stability Assessment” (June 2019). 14 For context, the unemployment rate in Canada rose about 3 percentage points during the global financial crisis.  15 The simulation, in Box 3 of our October MPR, was calibrated to match the implicit degree of uncertainty that participants in the US overnight index swap market seem to see.  
-7-    This is a reminder of the importance of the interaction between monetary policy and financial vulnerabilities. In the current context, lowering interest rates could provide some insurance against downside risks to inflation. However, this insurance would come at a cost in terms of higher household vulnerabilities down the road. Policies such as the mortgage stress test that I spoke about earlier would help keep vulnerabilities in check if monetary policy needed to be more accommodative.16 Still, with vulnerabilities high and inflation close to target for more than a year, we said at our most recent interest-rate decision that taking out insurance wasn’t worth the cost at that time. We also said that in considering the appropriate path for policy, we’d watch how the trade situation and household vulnerabilities evolve as well as fiscal policy developments. It’s important to note that in our adverse scenario in the October MPR inflation declines but stays within the inflation-control range of 1 to 3 percent. Our policy interest rate may be relatively low now, but at 1.75 percent we still have room to manoeuvre. And, we have other options in our tool kit, such as extraordinary forward guidance and large-scale asset purchases.17  Work agenda on climate change  Before I conclude, let me update you on our research plan on climate change issues that are relevant to the Bank of Canada.  The Bank is devoting analytical firepower to understanding how climate risks are shaping the macroeconomy and financial system. We released today a multi-year research plan, outlining some of the questions we’re tackling. This work will focus on two areas that are central to our mandate.  The first relates to how climate change could affect our macroeconomic forecasting and monetary policy-making. To do our job, we need to understand the economic impact of more frequent and severe weather events. The floods this past spring were very trying for people in Quebec and other parts of the country. And they affected the broader economy.  At the same time, we’re also thinking through how different sectors of the economy and the jobs that go with them could change as we reduce our carbon footprint. At the global level this could affect potential output and the neutral rate of interest. These trends are particularly relevant for a resource-rich country like Canada.  The second area of research relates to financial-stability implications of climate change. There are physical risks to better understand as weather events become more severe and more frequent. We are seeing this in real time at home: annual insurance claims for                                             16 For more detail, see S. S. Poloz, “Toward 2021: The Power—and Limitations—of Policy” (remarks to The Chamber of Commerce of Metropolitan Montreal, Montréal, Quebec, February 21, 2019).  17 See S. S. Poloz, “Prudent Preparation: The Evolution of Unconventional Monetary Policies” (remarks to The Empire Club of Canada, Toronto, Ontario, December 8, 2015).  
-8-    property and infrastructure damage in Canada averaged $1.9 billion from 2009 to 2018—up from $200 million from 1983 to 1992.18  There are also risks related to the transition to a low-carbon economy. Investors are already adjusting portfolios to reduce their exposures to climate-related risks, and this creates repricing of carbon-intensive assets.19 The risk is that this transition doesn’t happen smoothly. As a concrete example of the work to come, the Bank of Canada is developing models that will allow us to assess different scenarios of the transition. As a first step, in the coming weeks we hope to publish a preliminary example of this kind of work. We’ve also just posted an article in The Economy, Plain and Simple that sets out why climate change matters for the economy and the financial system.  This is the start of a long journey, and we are partnering with others to make progress.20 We’re a member of the Network for Greening the Financial System, which is a productive forum for central banks and other authorities.21 We’re also engaging with others to better understand how companies and investors are assessing and mitigating climate risks.  Conclusion Now it’s time to conclude.   The fact that the unemployment rate is near a historic low and inflation is running close to target means the Canadian economy is in a relatively good place overall. Still, I know that Canadian businesses and workers are facing considerable uncertainty about the trade environment. And there are still painful adjustments underway in energy-intensive regions. That’s why Governing Council is watching all this closely. Canada has made some hard-won progress in terms of stabilizing household debt and taking the froth out of certain housing markets. Let’s remember, though, all that debt took many years to build and will take at least as many to dissipate.  With storm clouds gathering, we can’t let our guard down. This is even more important given that high global leverage would amplify any global downturn, especially if it became a recession. It is reassuring that should a storm arrive, the Canadian economy and financial system are in a good position to weather it.                                              18 Insurance Bureau of Canada, 2019 Facts of the Property and Casualty Insurance Industry in Canada. 19 In 2018, Canadian asset managers had around $2 trillion in assets being managed with explicit environmental, social and governance criteria taken into account. 20 We also recognize it’s important to be a leader when it comes to our own operations. We’ve developed a multi-year strategy to reduce waste and start measuring—and shrinking—our own carbon footprint. 21 For more details, see the website of the Central Banks’ and Supervisors’ Network for Greening the Financial System, which was established in December 2017, and the Bank’s announcement this past March when we were accepted as a member.   
Elvira Nabiullina: Review of recent inflation developments in Russiaand economic outlookStatement by Ms Elvira Nabiullina, Governor of the Bank of Russia, in the follow-up to the Boardof Directors meeting, Moscow, 13 December 2019.*   *   *Today, the Board of Directors has decided to cut the key rate by 25 bp down to 6.25% perannum.We will consider the necessity of further key rate reduction in the first half of 2020.Let me dwell on the main factors behind the decision.First. Annual inflation continues to decline faster than we expected. Our revised inflationforecast for the end of this year is 2.9–3.2%. Meanwhile, average 2019 inflation will stand at4.5%, which reflects the high price growth rate in late 2018 and the first months of 2019.This significant slowdown in inflation in the second half of the year was caused by a joint actionof a number of disinflationary factors, both temporary and more persistent. These factors includean increased supply of individual food products due to a bumper harvest. Also, price growth ofimported goods is still limited due to the ruble appreciation and inflation deceleration amongstRussia’s trading partners. At the same time, moderate demand, both external and internal, is amore persistent factor. The proportion of temporary and persistent factors has yet to beestimated.Most indicators that we analyse reflect low inflationary pressure. Annual core inflation is decliningat the same rate as the headline consumer price index. Both indicators were registered at 3.5%in November. Seasonally adjusted monthly price growth has been around 0.2% since June.Forfood products, this indicator came in even lower in October and November. If we transform thesemonthly indicators into annualised form, the result will be lower than 4%.However, looking at the key product groups, while annual food and non-food price growth keepsfalling, services prices increased slightly faster in November with their growth rate reaching3.9%. This was mainly owing to the market services segment, which could be an early sign of apotential revival of demand. Survey results also indicate an improvement in consumer sentiment.As to the next year, our inflation forecast for the first quarter is below 3%. This decrease will betemporary. It is in line with our expectations and is explained by the fact that the effect of the VATrate increase will be factored out from the calculation of annual inflation. In the second half of theyear, inflation will be returning to around 4%. This will be helped by the monetary policy easingthat the Bank of Russia has implemented this year. I would like to reiterate that monetary policymeasures influence the economy and inflation in a gradual manner. The accumulated effect ofthe earlier key rate decisions will manifest itself throughout 2020. Therefore, it may take sometime to assess the necessity for a further key rate reduction.Taking into account the key rate decisions and other assumptions of our baseline forecast, weexpect inflation to range within 3.5–4.0% by the end of 2020. Moving forward, the monetary policypursued will keep annual inflation close to 4%.Second. Household inflation expectations decline but stay above the lows registered inApril 2018. However, the perception of inflation by households is gradually changing. We seethat inflation expectations are forming now at the level that is lower than the one observed amidcomparable price dynamics in late 2017 – early 2018. This is largely associated with the recenttrend for average inflation to be much lower than before. The inflation volatility range has also 1 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
narrowed. However, inflation expectations remain sensitive to changing prices of individual goodsand to one-off events. In our policy, we take into account the fact that we need more time to fullyanchor inflation expectations.Business price expectations decreased in the first half of the year and have remained generallystable during the last few months. Mid-term inflation expectations of analysts and professionalmarket participants are close to 4%.Third. Monetary conditions are easing and this process will continue mainly due to theearlier key rate decisions.OFZ yields stay at their lowest levels for the last few years after the October key rate decision.Interest rates in the deposit and credit market are going down. I would like to specifically point outthat the interest rate on housing mortgage loans extended in October fell to 9.4% vs 10.6% inMay. At the same time, real deposit rates remain positive taking into account inflation forecast,which supports the attractiveness of savings.Our estimates suggest that there is still a certain potential for a further decrease in loan interestrates. We will assess further adjustment of monetary conditions, in particular, gradual changesin interest rates in various market segments as well as monetary indicators. Their further effecton economic indicators and price dynamics. This is a lengthy and gradual process. Our furthermonetary policy decisions will depend on its development and consistency with our expectations.The most important factor that we analysed today is the situation in the economy. Weexpect that GDP growth rates will be closer to the upper bound of our forecast range of0.8–1.3%.The Q3 results show that economic growth accelerated to 1.7%. Industrial output keeps growing.In October, after a prolonged slowdown, we saw an increase in annual retail sales growth. Thiswas supported by an acceleration in real wage growth largely due to inflation slowdown amidrelatively unchanged nominal wage growth.Starting in September, we have observed a notable increase in budget spending on nationalprojects. In the second half of the year, government investment started to support economicgrowth.At the same time, we have yet to estimate the stability of higher economic growth rates. Demandremains contained in general. Various investment activity and business sentiment indicatorsshow mixed dynamics. In particular, new (especially, export) order expectations in industryremain low. This reflects a slowdown in global economic growth, continuing global trade tensionsand geopolitical risks. These are all restraining factors for our economy.Regarding the three-year forecast horizon, our expectations here have not changedoverall since October. We expect that the GDP growth rate will gradually increase to 1.5–2.0%in 2020 and to 2–3% in 2022. Successful implementation of national projects should provide thelargest contribution to the increase in growth rates. This will support internal demand whileexternal conditions remain a factor of uncertainty in the forecast.As regards oil prices. Last week, the OPEC+ countries reached a deal to extend oil productioncuts until the end of March 2020.As of now, we stick to a conservative assumption for oil pricesin our forecast: their reduction to 55 US dollars per barrel in 2020 and to 50 US dollars per barrelin 2021 and further on. We will adjust this opinion depending on, among other factors, futurechanges in the OPEC+ agreements and global demand for energy commodities.As to the balance of payments, we have slightly adjusted some indicators for this year, taking intoaccount the actual data available. Let me remind you that the current account balance will 2 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
gradually decrease over the forecast horizon remaining sustainably positive: approximately to 3%of GDP in 2020 and to 1–2% of GDP in 2021. This is associated with oil price trends and externaldemand. The financial account balance of the private sector will shrink to about 1% of GDPin 2020–2022.As usual, making our decisions, we also factored in risks. We are currently talking a lotabout disinflationary factors, and they do prevail for the moment. However, there arealso proinflationary risks over the forecast horizon.First, such risks are associated with external factors, which include the world economy andglobal financial markets.Second, it is hard to exactly assess the extent to which the inflation slowdown in the food marketis caused by temporary factors, the timing and the likelihood of the turnaround in their dynamicsand the intensity of balancing changes in food prices given the current low base.Third, as we have noted, the aggregate effect of five earlier key rate cuts will be gradual and itsestimation will take time.As for the fiscal policy, the situation seems more balanced in terms of its effect on inflation in2020, given that budget spending, including into the national projects, will be distributed over time.Let me remind you that the next policy meeting of the Board of Directors will also be acore one, same as today. This is associated with the changes in the schedule of the Board ofDirectors’ policy meetings. We are going to sum up the results of 2019 at our next meeting. Wewill then have detailed data on GDP for the third quarter, preliminary data on the balance ofpayments for the entire 2019, as well as current economic statistics for December and first dataon inflation in January. We will adjust our mid-term forecast based on this information.Winding up, I would like to get back to the signal of our future actions. We have said todaythat we will consider the necessity of a further key rate reduction in the first half of 2020. Notingthat, after similar signals in the past, it was twice that we cut the key rate already at the nextmeeting, namely in October and today, and anticipating your clarifying questions, I would like topoint out the following. This wording means that we still see room for a slight decrease in the keyrate. But both in February and at the next meetings we will comprehensively assess thereasonableness and relevance of such a decision taking into account the entire range of newdata that will be available by that time. Our signal does not imply that we will necessarily lowerthe key rate in February or in the first half of 2020. A further key rate cut will become possible onlyif our analysis confirms that this is needed to bring inflation back to the Bank of Russia’s 4%target. 3 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches

    All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches 2  2   Before I begin, I must emphasise that those who might be searching for cryptic central bank signals about future policy will be disappointed.  I am speaking in the MPC’s quiet period, and my comments have no bearing whatsoever on the decision the MPC will announce on Thursday.   This wonderful evening celebrates an extraordinary individual.  There should be, and will be, great joy and immense gratitude.  But as with all such occasions there is also the melancholic feeling of an end of an era, the passing of the ancien regime.   Certainly, central banks face many challenges:  Markets prone to severe bouts of illiquidity;  A global economy that risks falling into a low growth, low inflation rut caused by deep structural forces, limited policy space, and growing concerns over the fracturing of the global trading system;   Innovations in private payments encroaching on central banks’ very raison d’être, the provision of money;  and   A growing climate crisis that will affect every aspect of finance.  So it is tempting to ask:  Après Benoît le déluge? Fortunately, the financial guillotine is not preordained, for Benoît did not spend his days in power as did Louis XV.  Where the king grew idle, Benoît remained frenetic (189 public speeches during his eight years).  Where the king was conservative, Benoît was radical.  Where the king became nostalgic, Benoît always looked forward. If central banks are to rise to their challenges and serve our citizens, we will need to build on Benoît’s legacy.   I.  Improving market functioning  Let me start with market functioning. Before the crisis, financial alchemy appeared to have sliced, diced and distributed risk to those who wanted it most.  The revolutions in securitised and derivative finance were cheered on by policymakers who saw more markets as the solution to any market failures and who believed the lie that markets always clear. But of course markets always clear only in textbooks.  In reality, people are irrational, economies are imperfect, and nature itself is unknowable.  The pre-crisis system had merely spread risk, contingently and opaquely, in ways that often increased it.   
    All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches 3  3   Once the crisis began, risk quickly concentrated on the balance sheets of intermediaries that were themselves capital constrained.  And with the fates of borrowers and lenders tied together via  hyper-globalised banks and markets, problems at the core spread violently to the periphery. The post-crisis response included major reforms to simplify markets and make them more robust. A vital plank was to encourage greater central clearing of OTC trades, which prior to the crisis had been largely unregulated, unreported and bilaterally settled.  When Lehman fell, uncertainty about these exposures sparked panic.   Routing bilateral trades through central counterparties untangles this tangled web.  Globally, the stock of centrally cleared derivatives has more than doubled since the crisis.1  And around two-thirds of outstanding interest rate derivatives in the UK and Europe are cleared through CCPs.2   Of course, central clearing means that CCPs are sources of systemic risk, which is why Benoît led efforts to build their resilience and improve their resolvability.   As Chair of the Committee on Payments and Markets Infrastructure (CPMI), he oversaw the implementation of the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructure – a set of demanding, international standards for payment, clearing and settlement systems that ensure CCPs are robust to shocks.  As a result, an additional $1 trillion of collateral is now held globally against all derivative trades. Under Benoît’s leadership, the CPMI has worked with other authorities to finalise and implement global standards for resolution.  And he has consistently encouraged greater cross-border cooperation, better information sharing and more coordinated stress testing.   Whilst the infrastructure that underpins our markets is now in much better shape, nascent risks remain that, if left unchecked, could bring new problems.  Consider market liquidity. During the crisis, liquidity dried up, particularly in the interbank market, as cash-rich banks hoarded excess funds.  In parallel, a “run on repo”, triggered by increased haircuts on collateral to guard against counterparty risk, pushed the shadow banking sectors in advanced economies to collapse.  In the euro area, the sovereign debt crisis compounded these problems, causing some markets to splinter along national lines. Global reforms address the fault lines that caused this fiasco.  New global standards for liquidity regulation are now in place including the Liquidity Coverage Ratio and Net Stable Funding Ratio.  Bank capital standards now take into account exposures to shadow banks, including step-in risk, and through-the-cycle margining prevents Minsky cycles in secured lending.                                                       1 See https://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/R191118-1-1.pdf. 2 See https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/library/esma50_157_2025_asr_derivatives.pdf. 
    All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches 4  4   These reforms are transforming banks’ approach to liquidity management and building the resilience of the system as a whole.  For example, liquid assets – relative to liabilities that can readily run – are tenfold higher than before the crisis. However, the recent volatility in US dollar repo markets suggest there are still frictions that need to be addressed.  Contrary to expectations, banks did not step into the market to lend cash, viewing the profit opportunity to be insufficient to offset the impact on perceived regulatory liquidity requirements.  The Federal Reserve’s open market operations have since calmed the market, but term repo rates remain elevated, as dealers are pricing in a higher likelihood of similar spikes in future. While it may be tempting to conclude this is an isolated incident, there have been others, including the taper and bund tantrums.  These could signal a broader problem of discontinuous market liquidity in stress.   The solution is not to unwind post-crisis liquidity regulation, a recidivism that would only recreate, with time, the enormous systemic risks of the past.  Moreover, the limited systemic consequences of these events should be noted.  After all, the riskiness of an asset depends on who holds it.  A “crisis” in the periphery is a bad day in the markets;  one in the core is an annus horribilis for the real economy. Nevertheless, market infrastructure must evolve to take account of new dynamics.  In one of Benoît’s (many) speeches last month, he identified one of the potential problems underlying the repo market stress:  that what may look to be sufficient liquidity in aggregate can prove too little if it is asymmetrically distributed – either across institutions or national boundaries.   As Benoît noted, this may require central banks to provide more liquidity in aggregate, including by widening access to their balance sheets.  Prompted by the potential risks that come with Brexit, the Bank of England has come to a similar conclusion:  we are already running weekly auctions in sterling, US dollars and euros that could be used to absorb pressures as they arise.  We also have a contingent term repo facility that we could activate at a higher frequency if needed; and we – like the ECB – can lend to a very broad range of counterparties against a wide range of collateral. Central banks and regulators must also be clear that liquidity facilities and buffers are there to be used.  For example, in October, the Bank clarified our supervisory expectations to re-emphasise our commitment to providing liquidity in the ordinary course of business.  We do not expect firms to justify any usage, nor is there any presumption they would use their own buffers before our facilities.  Next year’s first system-wide liquidity stress test will be another opportunity to demonstrate that liquidity buffers are fully useable. Increased central clearing would be a capital-efficient way to further improve repo market liquidity; this would be most effective if smaller institutions participated directly.  And a more holistic approach by firms to internal capital management would make them more agile, including not applying the leverage ratio at the desk level. 
    All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches 5  5   Liquidity concerns also go to the heart of otherwise immensely positive developments in market-based finance. As is the case for banks, the institutions at the heart of market-based finance, particularly open-ended investment funds, must prudently manage their leverage and liquidity.  Mismatches between redemption terms and the liquidity of some funds’ assets means there is an advantage to investors who redeem ahead of others, particularly in stress.  This has the potential to become a systemic risk as first mover advantage could prompt a de-stabilising rush to the exits.   In response, the Bank of England and the FCA have decided that there should be greater consistency between the liquidity of a fund’s assets and its redemption terms.  Specifically:  The liquidity of funds’ assets should be assessed either as the price discount needed for a quick sale of a vertical slice of those assets or the time period needed for a sale to avoid a material price discount.   Investors who redeem should receive a price for their units that reflects the discount needed to sell the required proportion of a fund’s assets in the specified redemption notice period;  and   Redemption notice periods should reflect the time needed to sell the required proportion of a fund’s assets without discounts beyond those captured in the price received by redeeming investors.  Our next steps are to consider how these principles could be implemented and, in particular, the stress against which liquidity measures and redemption terms should be calibrated.  We expect to publish the review’s conclusions in the summer and these will, where appropriate, inform the development of UK standards for open-ended funds.  Our conclusions will also inform our international engagement for example with the FSB, IOSCO and other competent authorities on the financial stability risks of asset management activity. II.  Creating monetary policy space Effective market functioning matters for price stability as well as financial stability.   During the crisis, the impaired banking system and dysfunctional corporate debt markets muted the transmission of monetary stimulus and led to inefficiencies in risk-sharing and capital allocation.  Ultimately, companies and households bore a heavy cost. Strains in monetary policy transmission were particularly pronounced in the euro area, where the fragmentation of markets along national lines meant cuts to the ECB’s policy rates were not passed through equally in all countries.  Households and companies of comparable credit worthiness faced different borrowing rates depending on their location.  These problems worsened over 2012, when markets began to price in some redenomination risk in a few euro-area countries.   It fell to Benoît and his fellow members of the ECB’s Governing Council to fix the problem. 
    All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches 6  6   Throughout the crisis, the ECB rightly and swiftly injected huge quantities of additional reserves into the system, as asset-backed commercial paper and the interbank markets dried up.  In response to the worsening sovereign debt crisis in 2012, the Governing Council created Outright Monetary Transactions, a programme whose very existence eliminated the unwarranted and self-reinforcing fears of a euro-area break-up and restored sovereign bond spreads to levels more consistent with credit rather than currency risk.   During this time, Benoît added his voice to the calls for a capital markets union, not least because it would broaden the transmission mechanism and increase the potency of monetary policy. He also recognised that the ECB’s actions could only tackle the symptoms of financial market fragmentation.  Addressing their root causes required stronger banks, a more resilient financial system, solvent governments, and the delinking of bank and sovereign credit risk. On the two of these imperatives, the EU has made welcome progress, with the establishment of the Single Supervisory Mechanism and the European Systemic Risk Board.  These bodies are helping address a classic collective action problem by overcoming the inevitable temptation of national supervisors to ring-fence liquidity and capital within national boundaries to the detriment of a single market for capital. Alongside improving the transmission mechanism, the ECB made important advances in the conduct of monetary policy.  It has reduced the effective lower bound on policy rates and created additional stimulus through forward guidance, new lending facilities and innovative asset purchase programmes.  These actions have helped shape the expectations of both market participants and the general public. The challenge now facing the ECB – and monetary policy makers more broadly – is to provide sufficient stimulus to meet its price stability objective when powerful structural forces are pushing down equilibrium interest rates.   As I noted at Jackson Hole,3 the risk of a global liquidity trap puts a high premium on getting more than just monetary policy right.  In a global liquidity trap, central banks cannot be the only policy makers who do “whatever it takes.”  There are clear gains from coordination, with other policies – particularly fiscal policy – having important roles.   The biggest gains would come from lowering trade tensions.  This is pushing up hurdle rates on investment, swamping the impact of lower policy rates.  Reducing uncertainty would turn a vicious cycle – in which falling equilibrium interest rates eat into policy space, exacerbating downside risks and pushing down equilibrium rates further – into a virtuous one, of rising equilibrium rates, increased policy space, and stronger global growth.                                                       3 “The Growing Challenges for Monetary Policy in the current International Monetary and Financial System”, speech by Mark Carney at the Jackson Hole Symposium 2019.

Transforming payments  During Benoît’s time at the ECB, the public provision of money has faced challenges from Bitcoin to stablecoins. The Bank of England has an open mind but not open door when it comes to such innovations.  Unlike social media, for which standards and regulations are only now being developed after the technologies have been adopted by billions of users, the terms of engagement for any new systemic private payments system must be in force well in advance of any launch.  And there are a host of issues that still need to be addressed – from maintaining the highest standards of operational resilience and managing financial risks, to addressing privacy and anti-money laundering concerns. Like Benoit, we recognise that these initiatives were not conceived in a vacuum;  rather they seek to address long-standing problems in payments.  Despite the ongoing revolution in online commerce, payments are often more expensive than they need be and still take too long to clear.   UK card payments are convenient and they are now the most popular means of payment, but they can cost between 0.5% and 2% of the total transaction value, and it can take three days for the merchant to receive their money.   The scope for improving cross border payments is bigger still.  These can cost up to 10 times their domestic equivalent.  Anti-money laundering checks that are rightly required can be cumbersome.  Settlement is slow, with money taking up to a week to reach the recipient. During his time at the ECB, Benoît oversaw significant progress in building a pan-European payments system for the wholesale side.   Nonetheless, developments in retail payments have lagged.  Euro-area customers are now starting to turn to non-European cards when making non-cash payments.   Last month, sensing the opportunity for another speech, Benoît announced that the ECB’s Governing Council was relaunching its retail payments strategy.  The goal is to create a retail payments system that is as convenient, cost-effective, safe and secure when operating across borders as across the shop counter; and one that works as well for merchants outside the EU as it does for those within it. Delivering a better retail payments experience will require the ECB and the Bank of England to provide the best-in-class payment infrastructure that can enable private innovators to deliver the payment products and services our citizens need.  We intend to collaborate closely, sharing perspectives on policy issues and technical designs.  And we look forward to leveraging advancements arising from Benoît’s new role leading the BIS Innovation Hub. 
    All speeches are available online at www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/speeches 8  8   Innovation is best achieved by empowering competition.  For the Bank, this means levelling the playing field between old and new by allowing new entrants access to the same resources as incumbents, while holding similar risks to similar standards.  It also means updating our public infrastructure to enable state-of-the-art private sector solutions to emerge which will lower costs, increase speed and improve customer experience of domestic and international payments. Any new payments system must be efficient, resilient and secure.  A safe payment system is only useful if people use it, which means it must deliver fast, user-friendly and inclusive services.  This in turn requires that payment systems are open to innovation and competition, and are built around the comparative advantages of central banks and the private sector. Addressing the Climate Crisis My final challenge facing central banks is the most fundamental.  Indeed, it is existential. Four years since the Paris Agreement, a more sustainable financial system is being built.  It’s funding private sector innovation, it has the potential to amplify the effectiveness of government climate policies, and it could accelerate the transition to a net zero economy. But we must go much further if the world is to reach net zero carbon emissions.  Disclosure must become comprehensive.  Risk management must be transformed.  Sustainable investing must go mainstream. In short, every financial decision must take climate change into account. Achieving that requires improvements on three Rs:  reporting, risk management and return.  On reporting, TCFD standards must be enhanced to be as comparable, efficient and decision-useful as possible.  And we need to develop pathways to mandatory climate disclosures.  To manage risks, disclosures need to go beyond the static to the strategic.  We must assess the resilience of the core of the financial system to transition risks, including through stress testing.  The Bank will publish a discussion paper on our planned climate stress test tomorrow and we look forward to taking this forward internationally through the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS).  On returns, asset managers and asset owners will increasingly have to assess the transition paths of their investments and report their impact to their clients.  Our citizens need to be able to see whether their investments are consistent with the path to net zero.   Central banks cannot stand on the side lines of this revolution.  And with Benoit’s research and Christine’s leadership, I am confident that the ECB will be at the vanguard. Conclusion

Gent Sejko: Transparency, communication and the importance ofthe media partnershipAddress by Mr Gent Sejko, Governor of the Bank of Albania, at the end-of-year meeting with themedia and the Governor’s Award ceremony, Tirana, 13 December 2019.*   *   *Dear ladies and gentlemen,Welcome to the Bank of Albania, to spend some time together as the year end approaches.Sadly, the atmosphere at the end of this year is different from previous ones, following thedevastating earthquake, which hit Albania in late November. In the aftermath, we are allheartbroken by the tragic loss of 51 lives, with hundreds of others injured and many buildings,which have collapsed or have been heavily affected by the strongest quake in decades. Yet,beyond the material consequences and psychological shock, this tragic event foregroundedanother – somewhat dormant – dimension of our society: solidarity and unconditional support foreach other. We all witnessed an impressive demonstration of voluntary support from fellowcitizens to those affected by the devastating earthquake. In this extraordinary situation, the mediaplayed a key role in promoting solidarity and alleviating the human pain caused by this naturaldisaster.In light of this event, and in retrospection of 2019, let me express my sincere thanks and heartfeltgratitude to the media, to those who are present here tonight, and those that were unable toattend, for their invaluable work, reporting news truthfully and in real time. Staying on the media, but shifting to another, concrete contribution of it, professionalism andintegrity in covering news related to economic and financial developments in Albania increasednotably this year. Let me emphasise. We are glad to say that we find your work has advanced inall its dimensions. The language you use as well as the breadth and depth of your analysis inpresenting our reports to the public reflect a serious approach and professionalism. Thanks to you, our decisions have been passed on in a timely fashion.  Further, they have beentranslated and adapted using simple and easy-to-assimilate language, not only for market actors,but also for the general public. The media is a unique ally in our efforts to enhance theeffectiveness of our decision-making.  Please allow me to thank you once again for your work,filled with passion and dedication during the course of this year. I am confident that in the comingyear your dedication, truthfulness and objectivity in reporting economic and financial news willcontinue to characterise your work.I would like to assure you that the Bank of Albania will continue be a transparent institution, readyto provide opinions and assessments as necessary in all public debates related to theperformance of our economy and financial markets. For the Bank of Albania, macroeconomicstability and financial solidity in Albania are essential and long-term objectives. We workincessantly to enable such stability, which is vital for all the citizens of Albania. I want to underlinetoday that you are an important partner in our efforts and when we join forces guaranteeing thewelfare of future generations becomes an easier task.Dear guests,We have constantly emphasised that financial education and research are an integral andsignificant part of the activity of the Bank of Albania. They are a precondition and source for thesocial-economic development and welfare of the citizens of Albania. In this regard, I would likenow to turn your attention to what has now become a tradition, the ceremony for the Governor’sAward for the Best Diploma. 1 / 2BIS central bankers' speeches
This is the 13th year that the Bank of Albania has selected and awarded three diploma theses.Over the years, we have found that the quality of research work has been improving, to the pointthat it has become actually difficult to distinguish the work presented by a recently graduatedstudent from that of a researcher at the Bank of Albania. The selected topics present greatinterest, as they focus on critical issues related to the economic and financial reality in Albaniaand beyond. As in previous years, Albanian students from domestic or foreign universities have applied andpresented their best research work. We are happy to note that participation and interest fromstudents and universities has been significantly on the rise, revealing the recognition, reliabilityand reputation this Award has achieved. This year, we received 39 studies, ranging frommonetary policy and economic and financial development of the country to topics related toaspects of management of production and financial activities, European integration, andtechnology innovations applied in the fields of virtual money and finance. These works arecharacterised by the use of contemporary research methodologies and make use of amplestatistical information, to research, through theoretical arguments and cause-effect practicalrelations, various economic phenomena and the rules governing them.Despite the objective difficulties in selecting the most interesting studies, we have eventuallycome to a decision on the “Governor’s Award for the Best Diploma Theses” for 2019.Having said that, while limited to selecting only three winners, I take this opportunity tocongratulate all the participants for their serious commitment and the ideas, methods andconclusions in their laudable research. I would encourage you to continue in your career, afterthis first step in scientific research, with many more ambitious ones.Let us now present the winning candidates.Thank you and happy holidays! 2 / 2BIS central bankers' speeches
SPEECH  SVERIGES RIKSBANK SE-103 37 Stockholm (Brunkebergstorg 11)  Tel +46 8 787 00 00 Fax +46 8 21 05 31 registratorn@riksbank.se www.riksbank.se  DATE: 3 December 2019  SPEAKER: Deputy Governor Per Jansson  VENUE: Danske Bank, Stockholm         1 [17]  Contemplations of an interest-rate dove and inflation hawk* Those who follow the media reporting on monetary policy have probably noted that I have been considered the most dovish member of the Riksbank’s Executive Board for some time. By this, I mean that I am considered to be the one who, at least for the time being, is inclined to conduct the most expansionary policy. For anyone unfamiliar with the terminology, the opposite of a dove is a hawk, some-one who instead advocates a tighter monetary policy. An alternative terminology that is common in theoretical models is that a hawkish policy instead attaches considerable importance to the inflation target and gives less weight to other things.1 So actually, as I think it is justified to prioritise the inflation target and confidence in it, I could also be considered a hawk. More precisely, I could be de-scribed as a combination of an inflation hawk and an interest-rate dove. Describing the orientation of monetary policy-makers in ornithological terms is ra-ther practical. Apparently, however, it is not entirely uncomplicated and misses some subtle differences. I would therefore like to start by elaborating on my view of current monetary policy and my reasoning at the most recent monetary policy meetings. The picture given in the monetary policy minutes can easily become a little compressed and I would therefore like to provide a slightly more compre-hensive and cohesive account here.  After that, I intend to address slightly more fundamental issues. More specifically, I would like to give my view of the advantages of the current framework, with an inflation target and a floating exchange rate. I feel that the debate over the last few years has been biased towards emphasising the disadvantages of this system and that the positive aspects have been overshadowed or perhaps even entirely forgotten. I think it is good to remind people of these now and again.                                                            * I would like to thank Mikael Apel for his help in writing this speech and Charlotta Edler, Mattias Erlandsson, Re-becka Hallerby, Jesper Hansson, Marie Hesselman, Åsa Olli Segendorf, Marianne Sterner, Ulf Söderström, and Emelie Theobald for comments.   1 See, for example, Orphanides and Williams (2003). 
       2 [17]  Communication is of great importance To describe what has perhaps been my most important basis for the policy I have recently advocated, I would like to start by referring back to a speech I made two years ago. It concerned the international ideological debate on monetary policy and the lessons I thought could be learnt from developments in Sweden.2 One of the lessons I highlighted then was that it is important not to lose sight of inflation and inflation expectations. What I had in mind was the period from 2011 and a few years onwards when inflation in Sweden was unexpectedly low and periodi-cally below the inflation target by quite a wide margin. Once inflation had under-shot the target for a while, long-term inflation expectations also began to fall. In addition, there were signals from the labour market parties that the inflation tar-get was no longer a given starting-point in wage negotiations. In other words, a risk began to arise that confidence in the inflation target would weaken to such an extent that the target would no longer function as an anchor for price-setting and wage formation. As is well known, we eventually managed to reverse the develop-ment and bring up inflation to the target again, but it took a long time and re-quired a very expansionary policy, as well as a slice of good fortune.  An important reason for inflation being so low for so long was the debt crisis in Europe which hit after the financial crisis and which most analysts had not seen coming, at least not with so much force and so soon. It slowed down the recovery that had begun and caused economic activity to deteriorate again, dragging down inflation in the process. The Riksbank underestimated the inflation effects, but we were far from alone in doing so.3 That expectations gradually followed actual in-flation downwards was perhaps not so strange in itself but it took a while, at least for me, to understand how serious the situation was about to become. Another factor that may have contributed to the fall in inflation expectations, and which I also raised in my speech a few years ago, was how the Riksbank communi-cated monetary policy at the time. Overheated and structurally deficient housing markets had exacerbated the effects of the financial and debt crisis in many coun-tries. Concern that this would also happen in Sweden made us direct much of our communication towards highlighting the risks associated with the development of debt and housing prices. Even though our forecasts still made it clear that we were striving to fulfil the inflation target and this was also emphasised in our com-munication, it may very well be the case that we talked a little too much about the risk of financial imbalances and a little too little about the importance of infla-tion being close to the target. This may have created uncertainty among economic agents regarding the actual status of the inflation target, and, in turn, may have contributed to the weaker confidence in the inflation target. The emerging suspi-cion was perhaps that we, so to speak, had taken our eye off the ball.4                                                             2 Jansson (2017). 3 During the first half of 2013, for example, the average of Swedish forecasters expected inflation to barely reach 1.5 per cent in 2014. The outcome was almost one percentage point lower, that is, one and a half percentage points below the target. 4 That there may be a good deal of truth in this interpretation is supported by a number of critical newspaper articles published around that time, see, for example, “Nya direktörer men samma gamla riksbank” [New direc-tors but same old Riksbank], Aftonbladet (2013), 22 May and “Ta tillbaka makten över Riksbanken” [Take back control over the Riksbank], Dagens Nyheter (2014), 15 June. 
       3 [17]  The important lesson to learn here is, as I see it, that it is absolutely key to show that you always do have your eye on the ball and do not let other factors come into the picture in a way that risks economic actors starting to doubt that this is the case.  I have been reminded of this lesson on a number of occasions lately, most re-cently at the monetary policy meeting in October. The picture we painted at that time of monetary policy going forward, in which we predicted that the repo rate will be raised very slowly to take it back into positive territory in the longer term, was one that I largely considered to be well-balanced. However, I expressed con-siderable doubt over the next increase in the repo rate happening as early as around the turn of the year, most probably at our next meeting in December, as implied by our forecast for the repo rate.  There were several reasons why I did not think it was a good idea. First, our fore-cast was that inflation would remain below the target in the near term, and was not expected to stabilise at 2 per cent until late 2022. Of importance here was also the fact that I could not see any appreciable upside risks for the inflation fore-cast either. Second, as I saw it, an increase in the interest rate in the near future could hardly be expected to lead to a greater probability of the downward trend in inflation expectations reversing. This worried me quite considerably as it can af-fect the inflation rate on which the labour market organisations base their forth-coming wage negotiations. Third, I felt there was reason to worry about the con-sequences of both the Federal Reserve and the ECB increasing their monetary pol-icy stimuli while in Sweden, if the announced rate rise were to be implemented, we would be going in the opposite direction. Many analysts also interpreted the signals from the meeting in October as the Riksbank viewing the abolition of negative rates as an end in itself. This applies not only to analysts in Sweden but also internationally. A couple of examples are articles from Bloomberg and in the Financial Times, in which the authors argue that the Riksbank has now realised the problems of negative interest rates and is therefore keen to get away from them.5 A number of analysts have also specu-lated that the Riksbank sees the zero level as so important in itself that it would be wary of lowering the repo rate over the coming years even if the economic outlook and inflation prospects were to deteriorate. My view is that, as a result of this, there may be a risk of several people starting to make the interpretation that we have indeed taken our eye off the ball to a certain extent, or at least don’t have it as sharply in focus as we usually have.  Too low average inflation creates problems Let me elaborate a bit on this. If the repo rate were to be raised as soon as around the turn of the year, the serious aspect is not in itself that the interest rate would then be 0.25 percentage points higher, although for someone who prefers an un-changed rate, there is of course no advantage in this either. The problem is in-stead that it might be perceived as the Riksbank deviating from what it normally                                                            5 Gordon, Skolimowski and Stirling (2019), and Milne (2019). An alternative view is that the Riksbank has simply become difficult to interpret, see, for example, Boije (2019).  
       4 [17]  does: designing monetary policy so that it is always very clear that the inflation target is the point of departure. This is of course particularly important in situa-tions where there is a risk of confidence in the inflation target starting to evapo-rate. Consequently, it is not “the tenths” themselves that are important – and they are of course even less important under more normal circumstances. But when confidence in the inflation target is at stake, even tenths can send signals and this is something I think one is well advised to consider. Let me stress that I of course believe that my colleagues on the Executive Board also take arguments like these into consideration. However, it can certainly be the case that we make different assessments of how important they are. This is natu-ral and in a way the whole point of an executive board. What I am presenting here is my way of looking at things and my personal assessments. A necessary condition for maintaining confidence in the inflation target is, as I see it, that the monetary policy we conduct and plan to conduct means that we antici-pate inflation being 2 per cent at least at the end of the forecast period we are considering. If the inflation forecast is not 2 per cent even in this time perspective, the monetary policy, on which our inflation forecast is based, is wrong and we must adjust it. But as I was just discussing, this is not always enough – it is not a sufficient condition. Even though our inflation forecasts are in line with the target, but we act and communicate in a way that can make it unclear how important we consider the inflation target to be – and in the worst case do this on repeated oc-casions – economic agents will sooner or later start to doubt our intentions. If such doubt takes hold, inflation expectations in the economy may start to fall. Economic agents may start to expect lower inflation than 2 per cent even in the long term, and ultimately also begin to incorporate this into their economic deci-sions. In this case, a self-reinforcing process arises leading to average inflation “getting stuck” at too low a level. But would this really be so problematic? Yes, I think it would be. That I am such a committed advocate of the inflation target is not about me considering the 2-per-cent target to be “holy”, just for the sake of it. It is about it not only being im-portant from an economic perspective that inflation does not rise too high, but also that it does not fall too low. I have often discussed the arguments for this, but they are worth repeating.   There are above all two aspects that I think make it important to maintain confi-dence in the inflation target of 2 per cent and which indicate that the target should not be lower. One is that, when average inflation is too low, it becomes more difficult for wage formation to distribute the resources in the economy effi-ciently. The reason is that it has proved difficult in practice to lower nominal wages. If inflation is low and nominal wages cannot be lowered, then it becomes difficult to adjust real wages between different professions, companies and sec-tors. This can ultimately lead to both higher unemployment and poorer productiv-ity growth in the economy. A moderate level of inflation mitigates these prob-lems. It functions as grease in the wheels of the economic machinery. Another advantage with an inflation target of 2 per cent, which has come to the fore in recent years, is that it creates at least some scope for lowering the policy rate before it reaches its lower bound. If the inflation target, and hence average 
       5 [17]  inflation, were to be lower, then the nominal rate would also on average be lower. This would be particularly problematic in a world where real interest rates are very low, as is currently the case. The scope for lowering the rate before it reaches its lower bound would then be more limited than it is today, which would make it more difficult to counteract future recessions. Therefore, if one does not like negative interest rates, one should not advocate a lower inflation target, as that would imply that the policy rate would have to be negative for longer peri-ods. In the international debate, moreover, there are several economists who think that not even an inflation target of 2 per cent provides sufficient scope to conduct as expansive a monetary policy as is sometimes necessary. So there are sound economic arguments for an inflation target that is not lower than 2 per cent.  To sum up, it is these considerations I have in my mind when I talk about the im-portance of keeping our eye on the ball. Basically, it is a question of constantly be-ing very clear about the guiding role of the inflation target in the design of mone-tary policy.  The lower bound of the repo rate is less than zero Regarding negative interest rates, I presented my own view on the matter in a speech around this time last year.6 I think that the difficulties with negative rates are not so much a question of purely economic aspects, but rather of what is fea-sible according to social conventions and possible to create understanding for. For example, the biggest problem is probably not the one that is commonly high-lighted, namely that the general public would choose to empty their bank ac-counts and only hold cash, as soon as the interest rate is negative. Holding savings in cash is, when it comes down to it, both troublesome and costly and given that most people in Sweden have started to abandon cash, it is not something that would seem particularly natural. The pain threshold here is probably relatively high, from a purely economic perspective.  On the other hand, I strongly suspect that it would be difficult to gain understand-ing for a policy that involves private individuals also encountering negative rates on their deposit accounts; in other words having to “pay to save”. This is perhaps a limitation that simply has to be accepted. Ultimately, the legitimacy of, and con-fidence in, an independent institution like the Riksbank is based on the general public understanding the policy conducted, or at least not considering it to be il-logical and unjust. But it is exactly this that I think constitutes the limitation. That zero per cent should be some magical limit for the repo rate is for me more diffi-cult to understand, however.7                                                             6 Jansson (2018). 7 It is worth noting that the real yield on bank accounts is often negative, even if the nominal rate is positive. That a negative nominal interest rate is special is, in this sense, an example of so-called “money illusion”. That said, I realise of course that the figure zero is of particularly psychological significance in many contexts.  When the zero as such (and negative figures) was introduced in mathematics, it was, for example, met for a long time with con-fusion and even loathing, see, for instance, Weiss (2017). 
       6 [17]  During the almost three years that the repo rate was –0.5 per cent, normal bank-saver deposit rates never became negative, so there seems nevertheless to be some scope for negative interest rates. And bearing in mind that monetary policy resources are not inexhaustible, I think it is good to be able to make use of this scope if it can thereby help to avoid major costs to the economy.  If it were to take longer to reach the target, it does not mean we would give it up I made the point earlier that it is very important how monetary policy is communi-cated. Before I go on, allow me to discuss a hypothetical case that makes it partic-ularly clear how central this point is. It is no secret that very low real interest rates have reduced the scope for managing cyclical fluctuations with the help of mone-tary policy. In a speech three years ago, I said it could not be ruled out that we might at some stage reach a point at which we consider it no longer desirable to make monetary policy more expansionary.8 If we were to find ourselves in such a situation – and I say if – we may as a consequence have to accept that it takes longer than it normally does to attain the inflation target. The advantages I just described of an inflation target of 2 per cent would of course still apply and we would continue to do our best to attain the target. The differ-ence would be that we open up for the possibility that it could take longer than we normally expect, and we accept this without making monetary policy more ex-pansionary.  In such a hypothetical case, we would thus not “give up the inflation target” and suddenly start conducting an entirely different policy and, for example, raise the interest rate. There would still be reason to conduct a policy that is as expansion-ary as we deem possible, to avoid taking longer than necessary to attain the tar-get. However, one consequence might be that the Riksbank’s communication be-comes even more central. The damage in a situation where monetary policy is not made more expansionary, despite inflation being expected to undershoot the tar-get for a long time, will be much less if the general public can be convinced that the target has not been abandoned, but that it is merely a question of taking longer than normal to attain it. Clarifying this would be a difficult but hopefully not impossible task. Often unclear whether the criticism applies to monetary policy or the target  Having gone through how I view the current situation and discussed a few related aspects, I would now like to widen the perspective a little and talk about more fundamental issues. More specifically, I thought I would go into why we have the framework we have, with an inflation target and a floating exchange rate, and what benefits this system provides. This is not the first time I have done so, but I                                                            8 Jansson (2016). 
       7 [17]  believe it is useful and important to remind people of this now and then. Having lived with a monetary policy framework for a long time, it is easy to start taking the benefits of it for granted and to focus on the drawbacks. The debate in recent years suggests that this is what has begun to happen, at least in some quarters.   The debate has had slightly different angles. One line of reasoning criticises the policy conducted by the Riksbank, although it is not always clear, to me at least, the extent to which this criticism is directed at the policy as such – i.e. that we have taken the wrong action given the target we have – or at the target definition itself. The monetary policy mandate given to the Riksbank by the Riksdag is in short to keep inflation over time close enough to 2 per cent so that long-term in-flation expectations in the economy are anchored at that level. More or less all central banks in western countries with a floating exchange rate have the same main task and the same target level, for example Norges Bank, the Bank of Eng-land and the Federal Reserve.  Broad support for the inflation target Before continuing, allow me to digress a little on the subject of the Riksbank’s mandate. Those who follow the current debate can certainly gain the impression that the Riksbank has unilaterally adopted a monetary policy target that it thinks is appropriate – 2 per cent inflation – but that is quite controversial in the rest of society. In other words, the inflation target is the Riksbank’s and only the Riks-bank’s. This interpretation is, however, both incorrect and unfortunate. So whose is the inflation target, then? The decision to introduce an inflation tar-get of 2 per cent was taken in 1993 by the General Council of the Riksbank. At that time, the General Council had a different role to the one it has today and was the Riksbank’s decision-making body. The then Governor, Bengt Dennis, has described the prevailing regime as follows (Dennis, 2003, p. 182): “The General Council con-sisted of eight members. Seven members were elected by the Riksdag while the eighth, the Governor of the Riksbank, was appointed by the General Council. It was a council elected on political grounds and the majority of its members were active politicians”. At the outset, the inflation target received a fair amount of criticism, even from politicians. But quite soon, when the advantages of the target had become clearer, broad support emerged for it. For many years now, the Riksdag Commit-tee on Finance has performed a review of monetary policy and every few years has also tasked two foreign economists to review monetary policy. These reviews largely concern the policy that the Riksbank has conducted but there is of course nothing in principle to prevent framework issues being addressed, which has also happened on occasion. If the Committee on Finance or the foreign reviewers had considered the inflation target of 2 per cent to be inappropriate, it is reasonable to assume that this would have been communicated at some point over the twenty-five years or so the target has been in force. But this has not happened.  Thus, elected representatives played a key role in the introduction of the target, they have always supported it, at least a majority of them, and there is nothing to 
       8 [17]  suggest that this is no longer the case.9 As I see it, this is approximately the crite-rion for being able to call the inflation target “Sweden’s” inflation target. So it is not just the “Riksbank’s” target, even though it is of course the Riksbank’s task to try to attain it. Good target attainment in recent years With that, I will return to the debate on the monetary policy framework. The Riks-bank has performed its task rather successfully in recent years. In terms of the tar-get variable CPIF, inflation has been very close to 2 per cent over the past two years as well as during the first half of 2019, albeit with some help from an in-crease in energy prices. It is only in the most recent months that inflation has fallen back somewhat and it has done so largely as a result of a lower contribution from energy prices.  Many who have been critical of the policy conducted by the Riksbank claim they support the monetary policy framework and the inflation target. But bearing in mind the aim of monetary policy having been to keep inflation around the target and to maintain confidence in it, and that the Riksbank has had to work quite hard to achieve this, it does not seem far-fetched to conclude that the criticism is im-plicitly nevertheless that the target itself should have been different. This is true at least if one believes that monetary policy could have been very different to what it has been. And this is exactly the opinion many critics must be perceived to have; otherwise it is difficult to understand at all why the discussion is so lively. In this context, it can be worth emphasising that the expansionary policy con-ducted by the Riksbank has been just enough to bring up inflation to 2 per cent. Inflation has never been excessively high in recent years, but on the contrary has recently fallen back somewhat and is now once again below the target. It is there-fore difficult to see how we, so to speak, have gone too far in view of our target. I think it is reasonable that those who claim they support the monetary policy framework and the inflation target, but nevertheless have been critical of the pol-icy conducted, take this into consideration. The inflation target has had considerable benefits...  Apart from this criticism, there is also a line of reasoning that states more clearly that the target definition should be different. It is above all this part of the debate that I will concentrate on in my discussion going forward. I would like to go deeper into two specific areas: wage formation and the exchange rate. It was fail-ures in these two areas in particular that caused, or rather forced, Sweden to                                                            9 It is, for example, worth noting that the terms of reference for the recently presented Riksbank inquiry made it clear that the baseline should be that “the objective of price stability shall remain central” (Swedish Ministry of Finance, 2016, p. 1).  
       9 [17]  switch over to the monetary policy regime we have today with a floating ex-change rate and inflation target. To provide some background to my continued discussion, allow me to describe the situation prior to inflation targeting.  Since the early 1970s, Sweden had been stuck in what could be called a devalua-tion cycle. Pegging the exchange rate, at least in theory, is the same as setting a target for domestic inflation. The idea is that the domestic rate cannot exceed (or fall below) inflation in the countries to which the domestic currency is pegged, at least not for any longer periods of time. But in order to make the commitment of maintaining a fixed exchange rate credible, it must be supported by other policies. This was not the case in Sweden. As there were expectations of continued high in-flation and of the Swedish krona being devalued, in other words of the target for the exchange rate being abandoned sooner or later, the wage inflation trend in Sweden was stronger than it was abroad. As the exchange rate was fixed, the competitiveness of Swedish companies weakened and a cost crisis arose. To rec-tify this, no other solution than to devalue the krona was thought to be available, which meant that the expectations of the krona’s devaluation were met. This in turn meant that the inflation trend could continue, competitiveness gradually weakened again, the exchange rate was once more adjusted downwards, and so on. What is normally referred to as “the nominal anchor” – the benchmark for in-flation expectations and thus for price-setting and wage formation – did not func-tion as intended. It was far from obvious that inflation targeting, introduced in 1993, would succeed in achieving what the fixed exchange-rate policy had failed to – to re-establish the anchor for price-setting and wage formation. Today, we know that it did succeed and furthermore did so relatively quickly. If I was to pick out the most important contribution made by inflation targeting, it would be precisely this – providing a nominal anchor for the economy. As far as Sweden is concerned, it is quite clear that the inflation target has helped provide greater orderliness by playing this role, and this has probably been an important explanation for the Swedish econ-omy having developed so favourably since the crisis at the beginning of the 1990s. … but these benefits seem to have begun to fall into oblivion As I noted earlier, there is broad support for the inflation target. But as regards wage formation, there is currently an opinion, at least in some quarters, that the inflation target has played its part and become irrelevant: It was important when bringing down wage inflation from its high levels of the 1970s and 1980s, but once this has been achieved, the target no longer fulfils any function and might as well be abolished. For several reasons, I see this as a historically questionable and my-opic argument, and it would be unfortunate if this view were to gain a firmer foot-hold. First, it is always sensible to not let oneself be influenced too much by the prevail-ing situation when discussing the design of frameworks that are expected to be stable and be in place for a long time. It is of course true that the kind of inflation 
       10 [17]  and wage surge seen during the 1970s and 1980s does not seem likely in the fore-seeable future. But at the end of the day, what do we really know about how the situation will be a few years in the future? Even if inflation has been subdued in recent years, it is not likely that we have arrived at “the end of inflation” for all eternity. Inflation has always varied and never been constantly high or low for any particular length of time (see Figure 1). It is difficult to see how society could have changed so fundamentally that this historical regularity now no longer applies. As-sume that inflation, for reasons we cannot currently identify, will be, say, 4 per cent a few years ahead. Even those who now consider the inflation target having become irrelevant would probably then see the benefits of a credible anchor at 2 per cent. A credible inflation target stabilises wage formation, both when inflation is unexpectedly high and when it is unexpectedly low.  Second, it is very unclear what might replace the inflation target as the anchor for prices and wages in the economy. One possibility is of course for Sweden to revert to a fixed exchange rate. This is something I will return to shortly. My interpreta-tion, however, is that those who think the inflation target has run its course for wage formation are not predominantly advocating a return to a fixed exchange rate. Instead, they seem to be relying on the wage formation reforms themselves being sufficient. According to these reforms, which are collectively known as the Industrial Agreement, industry has, for over twenty years, been setting the bench-mark for wage negotiations and is thereby steering wage growth in the entire economy. In this way, international competitiveness is taken into account when Swedish wages are set. The Industrial Agreement has definitely fulfilled an important function as regards bringing about more controlled wage formation with restrained wage increases. But from a broader economic perspective, it is difficult to see how an agreement between labour market parties could constitute a sufficiently stable anchor for prices and wages in the entire economy, in order to be able to replace the infla-tion target. As far as I am aware, Sweden would then be the first country in the world to abandon inflation targeting in order to rely on such a system instead. The ways of trying to provide an economy with a nominal anchor that are currently employed are either directly via an inflation target or indirectly via a fixed ex-change rate.  Important to discuss the conditions for wage formation In recent years, a number of challenges with regard to the system whereby indus-try sets the benchmark for wage negotiations in the rest of the economy are being increasingly discussed. One aspect addressed is that this standardisation makes it more difficult to change relative wages, which might be called for from the per-spective of fairness and distribution. For example, it can be an obstacle to reduc-ing wage gaps between women and men. But the problem has also been high-lighted from a macroeconomic perspective. If relative wages are not flexible enough, it could counteract an economically effective distribution of the labour force among professions and sectors. This could in turn create imbalances on the labour market. Many analysts argue that, instead of the most important aim of 
       11 [17]  wage formation being to safeguard the international competitiveness of industry, it should be to achieve balance in the labour market as a whole.10   Another important aspect highlighted in the discussion is the extent to which this wage standardisation is always compatible with an inflation-targeting regime. The reason for highlighting this issue is the strikingly low overall nominal wage growth in the economy despite a healthy economic situation and more or less on-target inflation. That wage agreements in Swedish industry have been restrained is due to a large extent to modest wage growth in our European competitor countries, probably because many of these countries have been hit very hard by the interna-tional financial crisis and subsequent European debt crisis. As the agreements in industry also set the standard for wage agreements in other sectors that are only partly or not at all exposed to competition, these agreements will also be low. From a theoretical perspective, this type of wage standardisation should not be incompatible with inflation targeting in the long term as the euro area’s inflation target is very much in line with Sweden’s. But in periods when wage growth in the euro area is unusually low, standardisation based on the industrial sector contrib-utes to low wage growth in the Swedish economy as well. Even though the Riks-bank would make monetary policy more expansionary in such a situation, the in-flation target may take longer than normal to attain. During these periods, there is a risk of inflation expectations falling and of confidence in the inflation target weakening. This would not be good for the Swedish economy. We could then get stuck in a situation with too low average inflation and nominal interest rates, longer periods of negative rates and greater difficulties in counteracting reces-sions via monetary policy. A more general challenge is the fact that the constantly ongoing structural trans-formation is changing the playing-field. It has already been highlighted in the de-bate that there are labour shortages in parts of the labour market, primarily pub-licly funded activities, which will also increase in the years ahead for demographic reasons. Substantial real wage increases will be necessary there in order to meet staffing requirements. Another aspect is that a new exposed sector is gradually emerging, above all with more service companies. The longer-term consequences of a relatively limited and probably decreasing part of the economy setting the benchmark for the entire labour market is therefore not something we can just ig-nore and refrain from discussing (see Figure 2). The interaction between the monetary policy framework and the conditions for wage formation is an important issue to analyse. The Riksbank shall, of course, not strive to directly influence wage formation nor try to steer the agreements in a particular direction. It is up to the labour market parties to determine this. But if there is a perception starting to spread that the inflation target is irrelevant and should be scrapped, we have, given our mandate, an obligation to bring this up to discussion and point out that we consider it to be a problem. When it comes                                                            10 See, for instance, Calmfors (2018) and Calmfors et al. (2019). It should be pointed out that there are studies indicating a certain amount of wage flexibility with regard to changes in unemployment at a regional level, see Carlsson et al. (2019).  
       12 [17]  down to it, Sweden is not the only country with an inflation target of 2 per cent and an industrial sector exposed to international competition. Important to have perspectives on the krona development Let me now go over to the other area I wish to delve deeper into; the exchange rate and development of the krona. When Sweden introduced an inflation target in 1993, we chose an exchange-rate regime at the same time. As I just pointed out, a fixed exchange rate and an inflation target with a floating exchange rate are two different ways of trying to provide the economy with a nominal anchor, that is, a benchmark for price-setting and wage formation. An inflation target tries to steer expectations in the economy directly, while a fixed exchange rate tries to steer them indirectly, by virtue of it becoming more costly if price increases and wage growth are higher than abroad. As we have established, the latter discipli-nary mechanism did not work well for Sweden. So all that remained was to test an inflation target. My firm conviction is, as I have already touched upon, that the political system clearly supports the system with an inflation target of 2 per cent and a floating ex-change rate, and my perception is that the same applies for a large majority of the Swedish people. It is reasonable to assume that they therefore also expect the Riksbank to do what it can to maintain confidence in the inflation target. It would be odd if the idea was for Sweden to, on the one hand, have an inflation target but that, on the other hand, it was not so important for the target to be credible, nor for the Riksbank to try to ensure that this was the case.  If the view is that confidence in the inflation target is important, it follows, or at least should follow, that there is an acceptance that, when the Riksbank conducts an expansionary policy to maintain confidence in the inflation target, the krona exchange rate will be affected. This occurs via the normal exchange-rate channel of monetary policy, that is to say, a low interest rate in relation to abroad makes it less profitable to hold financial assets in Swedish kronor than in other currencies. The demand for kronor then decreases and the krona exchange rate depreciates. Development of the krona has been weak for a few years and there is no doubt that one reason for this is indeed the exchange-rate channel and the expansionary policy to maintain confidence in the inflation target. It would be strange if this were not the case as this is partly how monetary policy works. But, and this is an important ‘but’, it is far from the whole picture. It is obvious that another part of the explanation is that currencies in small, open economies tend to depreciate when there is turbulence in the world. For example the Norwegian krone and the New Zealand dollar have experienced a very similar development as the Swedish krona in recent years, despite the policy rate in Norway and New Zealand being 1.50 and 1 per cent respectively, that is to say significantly higher than in Sweden (Figure 3). This is a very important observation to consider when criticism is being levelled at the Swedish inflation-targeting regime. It gives some perspective to, among other aspects, the “krona collapse” that is often highlighted in the debate.   
       13 [17]  But if one holds the view that the movements in the krona are not acceptable, one can of course argue for a return to a fixed exchange rate. This would, how-ever, be a political decision and nothing the Riksbank can decide on. Under the Currency Rate Act, the government takes decisions on the exchange-rate system that is to be applied.11 If one argues for a fixed exchange rate, it is reasonable that one explains why the costs of having a floating exchange rate should now have become too great. As far as I am concerned, I cannot see that this has happened. On a more general level, one needs to explain why the general benefits of a fixed exchange rate are considered greater than those of a floating rate, including that the latter can function as a shock-absorber in times of crisis. If one thinks that the krona should be retained but tied to the euro, for example, it is of course an ad-vantage if, in the light of our past negative experiences, one has a convincing story as to why this type of arrangement would work this time. It is also possible to go a step further and argue in favour of Sweden abolishing the krona and introducing the euro instead. This is obviously an even bigger deci-sion as it is basically irrevocable. If one believes that adopting the euro would be a good idea, I am sure it is possible to find several good reasons for doing so. But I cannot see that one of these would be that the inflation-targeting regime has been ineffective and made us poorer as a people and nation.  My most important messages Let me round off by summarising my main messages. I started by presenting my reasoning at the most recent monetary policy meetings. Here a key argument was that I find it crucial to be very clear about the guiding role of the inflation target when designing monetary policy. If such clarity is lacking, there is a risk of a self-reinforcing process emerging leading to average inflation “getting stuck” at too low a level. Such a development would be problematic, not least as it would lead to the policy rate having to be negative for longer periods. I then discussed the current framework with an inflation target and a floating ex-change rate as a point of principle. Here my main purpose was to remind people of the positive aspects of this framework, as my experience is that the debate over recent years has been biased towards emphasising the disadvantages. I dis-cussed and responded to two arguments that have occurred in the debate: that the inflation target is no longer relevant as a benchmark for wage formation and that the krona’s development in recent years shows that the costs of having a floating exchange rate have now become too great. The framework with an inflation target and a floating exchange rate, which we launched in 1993, is not perfect in all situations and for all events. But unfortu-nately, no perfect system exists and the interesting question is whether there is a better alternative. This reminds me of Winston Churchill’s evaluation of democ-racy as a form of government:                                                              11 Currency Rate Act (1998:1404), Section 2. 
       14 [17]  “Indeed it has been said that democracy is the worst form of government except for all those other forms that have been tried from time to time.” I think this is also an apt quotation for inflation targeting, so far at least.

For release on delivery  5:15 a.m. EST (11:15 a.m. local time) December 18, 2019 Update on Digital Currencies, Stablecoins, and the Challenges Ahead Remarks by Lael Brainard Member Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System on the Monetary Policy, Technology, and Globalisation Panel at  “Monetary Policy:  The Challenges Ahead,” an  ECB Colloquium Held in Honour of Benoît Coeuré sponsored by the European Central Bank Frankfurt, Germany December 18, 2019 
I am honored to be here today to celebrate Benoît Coeuré’s tenure at the European Central Bank (ECB).  I have been working with Benoît now for a decade—starting at our respective Treasuries where we both were drafted as financial firefighters, migrating to our respective central banks to help with stabilization, recovery, and normalization, and most recently preparing for the challenges that lie ahead.  Over the course of that decade, I have developed deep admiration for Benoît’s keen insights and outstanding judgment.1 Equally important, Benoît always has a plan.  Generally, it is the right plan addressed to the right problem, and he executes it with exceptional efficacy and strong support.  That is a rare and invaluable combination in public service.  Indeed, Benoît’s tenure at the ECB coincided with an incredible turnaround in unemployment and output growth.  Both the euro area and the global economy have benefited greatly from Benoît Coeuré’s outstanding public service.   Moreover, Benoît’s research interests are forward-looking and extend well beyond the macro economy.  When Benoît was appointed chair of the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI), the global standard setter for payment issues, he doubled its output, resulting in 75 reports.2  He turned its focus to distributed ledger, stablecoins, and central bank digital currencies long before many other central bankers realized these issues would be transforming their worlds.  Indeed, the number of Google searches for “central bank digital currencies” increased sharply over the course of Benoît’s tenure as chair of the CPMI.    1 I am grateful to Paul Wong, David Mills, Theresa Dinh, and Lacy Douglas of the Federal Reserve Board for assistance in preparing this text.  These remarks represent my own views, which do not necessarily represent those of the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee. 2 See https://www.bis.org/cpmi. 
-2 -Digital Currencies, Money, and Payments I was asked to provide some brief thoughts about digital developments in the world of monetary policy and central banking.  At the start of Benoît’s ECB term, bitcoin’s market capitalization was small, and only a handful of cryptocurrencies existed.  In the eight years since then, bitcoin’s market capitalization has grown rapidly and now exceeds 100 billion euros, and thousands of cryptocurrencies have been created.3   The potential of “global stablecoins” to scale rapidly is evident from the increasingly fast rates of technology adoption and the growth of large networks.  Adoption rates for new technologies have accelerated over time.  In 1921, 35 percent of U.S. households had telephone service, and it took 40 more years for telephone lines to reach 80 percent of homes.  In contrast, the internet achieved the same level of adoption in only 13 years.  More recently, smartphones and social media have achieved the same level of U.S. household adoption in less than a decade.4 Rapid adoption is also evident in the payments landscape, where network externalities figure prominently.  Between the first quarter of 2014 and the first quarter of 2019, transactions through Venmo grew over 66 times to $21 billion (18.5 billion euros).5 Systems in other countries have also scaled rapidly.  In China, mobile payments grew over 35 times during the same period to $8.2 trillion (7.2 trillion euros).6  India’s Unified Payments Interface (UPI) has grown even faster: between the fourth quarter of 2016 and 3 See https://www.blockchain.com and https://www.coinmarketcap.com.  4 Hannah Ritchie and Max Roser (2019), “Technology Adoption,” published online at OurWorldInData.org, retrieved from https://ourworldindata.org/technology-adoption [Online Resource]. 5 “Venmo’s Monetization Will Be Worth Watching,” Business Insider, January 31, 2017, www.businessinsider.com/venmos-monetization-will-be-worth-watching-2017-1. 6 See http://www.iresearchchina.com/.  Roughly 90 percent of mobile payments in China from 2014-19 were through Alipay and Tenpay. 
-3 -the first quarter of 2019, the transaction value grew nearly 400 times to $49.7 billion (43.8 billion euros).7  Digital currency payments projects from big technology firms that have network advantages have the potential to scale even more rapidly.  Because the utility of any medium of exchange increases with the size of the network using it, the power of a stablecoin payment system depends on the breadth of its adoption.  With nearly one-third of the global population as active users on Facebook, the Libra stablecoin project stands out for the speed with which its network could reach global scale in payments.   Stablecoin networks at global scale are leading us to revisit questions over what form money can take, who or what can issue it, and how payments can be recorded and settled. While central bank money and commercial bank money are the foundations of the modern financial system, nonbank private “money” or assets also facilitate transactions among a network of users.  In some cases, such nonbank private assets may have value only within the network, while in other cases, the issuer may promise convertibility to a sovereign currency, such that this becomes a liability of the issuing entity.  Stablecoins aspire to achieve the functions of traditional money without relying on confidence in an issuer—such as a central bank—to stand behind the “money.”  For some potential stablecoins, a close assessment suggests users may have no rights with respect to the underlying assets or any issuer. We have already seen the growth of massive payments networks on existing digital platforms, such as Alibaba and WeChat.  So far, these networks operate within a jurisdiction based on the sovereign currency as the unit of account, and balances are 7 See https://www.npci.org.in/product-statistics/upi-product-statistics. 
 - 4 - transferable in and out of bank or credit card accounts.  We have also seen the issuance of stablecoins on a smaller scale, such as Gemini or Paxos.  What would set Facebook’s Libra apart, if it were to proceed, is the combination of an active-user network representing more than a third of the global population with the issuance of a private digital currency opaquely tied to a basket of sovereign currencies.8  Libra, like any stablecoin project with global scale and scope, must address a core set of legal and regulatory challenges.  A significant concern regarding Facebook’s Libra project is the potential for a payment system to be adopted globally in a short time period and to establish itself as a potentially new unit of account.  Unlike social media platforms or ridesharing applications, payment systems cannot be designed as they develop, due to the nexus with consumers’ financial security.  This is why in many jurisdictions, including the European Union, there is a regime to oversee retail payment systems. Without requisite safeguards, stablecoin networks at global scale may put consumers at risk. Cryptocurrencies already pose a number of risks to the financial system, and these could be magnified by a widely accepted stablecoin for general use.  Estimated losses from fraud and thefts associated with cryptocurrencies are rising at a staggering pace – from $1.7 billion (1.4 billion euros) in 2018 to over $4.4 billion (3.9 billion euros) in 2019, based on one industry estimate.9  The hacking of exchanges represents a significant source of the theft, followed by the targeting of individual users                                                  8 Active-user network includes people who were using at least one of the company’s core products (i.e., Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, or WhatsApp). 9 Ciphertrace (2019b), Cryptocurrency Anti-Money Laundering Report, 2019 Q3, November, https://ciphertrace.com/q3-2019-cryptocurrency-anti-money-laundering-report/ and Ciphertrace (2019a), Cryptocurrency Anti-Money Laundering Report, 2018 Q4, January 2019, https://ciphertrace.com/cryptocurrency-anti-money-laundering-report-q4-2018/. 
 - 5 - through scams using QR codes, malware, and ransomware.  These estimates reflect only known fraud and thefts; it is likely that not all losses are reported and some amount of cryptocurrencies is lost or forgotten.  In most cases, customers bear the losses.  By contrast, over many decades, consumers in the United States and euro area have come to expect strong safeguards on their bank accounts and the associated payments.  Statutory and regulatory protections on bank accounts in the United States mean that consumers can reasonably expect their deposits to be insured up to a limit; many fraudulent transactions to be the liability of the bank; transfers to be available within specified periods; and clear, standardized disclosures about account fees and interest payments.  Not only is it not clear whether comparable protections will be in place with Libra, or what recourse consumers will have, but it is not even clear how much price risk consumers will face since they do not appear to have rights to the stablecoin’s underlying assets.   Anti-money laundering (AML), counterterrorist financing (CTF), and know-your-customer (KYC) requirements are significant concerns.  In one industry report, researchers found that roughly two-thirds of the 120 most popular cryptocurrency exchanges have weak AML, CTF, and KYC practices.10  Only a third of the most popular exchanges require ID verification and proof of address to make a deposit or withdrawal.  This is troubling, since a number of studies conclude that cryptocurrencies support a significant amount of illicit activity.  One study estimated that more than a quarter of                                                  10 Ciphertrace (2019b).

If not managed effectively, liquidity, credit, market, or operational risks, alone or in combination, could trigger a loss of confidence and run-like behavior.  This could be exacerbated by the lack of clarity about the management of reserves and the rights and responsibilities of various market participants in the network.  The risks and spillovers could be amplified by potential ambiguity surrounding the ability of official authorities to provide oversight, backstop liquidity, and collaborate across borders. The precise risks would depend on the design of the cryptocurrency as well as the scale of adoption.  The effect of a stablecoin on financial stability, for example, would be driven in part by how the stablecoin is tied to an asset (if at all) and the features of the asset itself.  A stablecoin tied one-to-one to an individual currency would have different implications than one tied to a basket of currencies.  A stablecoin that is built on a permissioned network would have different risk implications than a permissionless network, which may be more vulnerable to money laundering and terrorist financing risks.  A stablecoin used solely by commercial banks would have a different risk profile than one for consumer use.  Similarly, there are potential implications for monetary policy.  For smaller economies, there may be material effects on monetary policy from private sector digital                                                  11 Sean Foley, Jonathan R Karlsen, and Tālis J Putniņš (2019), “Sex, Drugs, and Bitcoin: How Much Illegal Activity Is Financed Through Cryptocurrencies?,” The Review of Financial Studies, volume 32(5), (May), pp. 1798–1853, https://doi.org/10.1093/rfs/hhz015. 
 - 7 - currencies as well as foreign central bank digital currencies.  In many respects, these effects may be similar to dollarization aside from the fast pace and wide scope of adoption.  The Work Ahead  The emergence of cryptocurrencies—and particularly stablecoins—has raised important questions for central banks and other authorities, including on the appropriate regulatory framework.  In the United States, the regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies is not straightforward.  Our current framework is based largely on whether a cryptocurrency is deemed to be a security or has associated derivative financial products and whether the participating institutions have a supervisory agency overseeing their activities.  Unlike many other jurisdictions, regulators do not have plenary authority over retail payments in the United States.  Moreover, the regulatory challenges are likely to be inherently cross-border in nature.  Because stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies are unlikely to be bound by physical borders, regulatory actions in one jurisdiction are unlikely to be fully effective without coordinated action elsewhere.   The prospect of global stablecoin payment systems has intensified the interest in central bank digital currencies.  Central bank digital currency typically refers to a new type of central bank liability that could be held directly by households and businesses without the involvement of a commercial bank intermediary.12  Proponents argue that central bank digital currencies would be a safer alternative to privately issued stablecoins because they would be a direct liability of the central bank.  A more relevant question may be whether some intermediate solutions may be able to offer the safety and benefits                                                  12 The Federal Reserve and other central banks currently provide money digitally in the form of central bank deposits in traditional reserve or settlement accounts.

In the United States, there are important advantages associated with current arrangements. Physical cash in circulation for the U.S. dollar continues to rise due to robust demand, and the dollar plays an important role as a reserve currency globally.  Moreover, we have a robust and diverse banking system that provides important services along with a widely available and expanding variety of digital payment options that build on the existing institutional framework with its important safeguards. Circumstances where the central bank issues digital currency directly to consumer accounts for general-purpose use would raise profound legal, policy, and operational questions.  That said, it is important to study whether we can do more to provide safer, less expensive, faster, or otherwise more efficient payments.  Some jurisdictions are likely to move in this direction faster than others, based on the particular attributes of their payments and currency systems.  At the Federal Reserve, we look forward to collaborating with other jurisdictions as we continue to analyze the potential benefits and costs of central bank digital currencies.  Most immediately, the Federal Reserve is actively working to introduce a faster payment system for the United States, to improve the speed and lower the cost of consumer payments.  In many countries, consumers are already able to make real-time payments at low cost.  This summer, the Federal Reserve announced the first new payment service in more than 40 years—the FedNow Service—to provide a platform for consumers and businesses to send and receive payments immediately and securely 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.     
 - 9 - As the public and private sectors work to reduce payment frictions, one of the most important use cases is for cross-border payments, such as remittances.  Current cross-border payments solutions are often slow, cumbersome, and opaque.  Authorities in many jurisdictions, including the United States, recognize the importance of cooperating across borders with each other and the private sector to address these cross-border frictions.13  Technology will continue driving rapid change in the way we make payments and the concept of “money.”  As central bankers, we recognize the power of technology and innovation to transform the financial system and reduce frictions and delays, and the importance of preserving consumer protections, data privacy and security, financial stability, and monetary policy transmission and guarding against illicit activity and cyber risks.  Given the stakes, any global payments network should be expected to meet a high threshold of legal and regulatory safeguards before launching operations.  The work ahead is not easy—the policy issues are complex, the coordination challenges are significant, and there are likely to be few simple fixes. Because the road ahead is complicated and challenging, I am especially pleased that Benoît will continue to help us navigate these issues as the new Head of the Bank for International Settlements’ Innovation Hub.                                                    13 Similarly, the introduction of a central bank digital currency in one country could affect other jurisdictions.

SPEECHHouseholds and the transmission of monetary policySpeech by Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the Central Bank of Ireland/ECB Conference on Household Finance and ConsumptionDublin, 16 December 2019IntroductionIt is a special pleasure to speak at the Sixth Conference on Household Finance and Consumption, which is jointly organised this year by the Central Bank of Ireland and the European Central Bank.[1]The engine behind this conference series is the Eurosystem’s Household Finance and Consumption Network, which coordinates the Household Finance and Consumption Survey (HFCS). The HFCS gives us an insight into the distributions of assets, liabilities and incomes across euro area households. It is very promising that many of you, together with other researchers, are using this dataset to improve our understanding of key features of economic behaviour in Europe.In my remarks today, I wish to discuss the relevance of differences across households for macroeconomic outcomes and the transmission of monetary policy. Households differ across many dimensions: age, geography, employment, income, wealth, assets, and debt. It follows that the impact of a macroeconomic shock or a shift in monetary policy will naturally vary across households. In turn, understanding how shocks and policies affect different types of households has the potential to improve our modelling of aggregate dynamics compared with the restrictive approach of imposing that aggregate household behaviour can be adequately represented by a single, representative household. Moreover, the examination of household-level data is also important in measuring the distributional impact of macroeconomic shocks and macro-financial policy decisions, which can help inform wider policy discussions about income distribution.Before turning to the microeconomic evidence, a natural starting point is to review the standard macroeconomic analysis of aggregate consumption dynamics. Chart 1 shows that consumption has increased steadily in recent years, which lines up with the substantial increase in household incomes due to rising employment and increasing wages. Another important indicator is consumer confidence, which in turn relates to how consumers view their personal financial situation and the wider macroeconomic situation (Chart 2). In addition, households do not only consume, but also contribute to investment in the form of residential property – both house purchases and renovations (Chart 3).Chart 1Households’ real disposable income and consumption(year-on-year percentage changes, percentage point contributions)

Sources: Eurostat and ECB.Note: The data refer to nominal gross fixed capital formation by households and non-profit institutions serving households.Latest observation: Q2 2019.For monetary policy analysis, an important question is the extent to which easier financial conditions have contributed to these dynamics through a variety of direct and indirect channels. A comprehensive analysis of this question requires a microeconomic approach, which takes into account relevant differences across households.[2]Household-level data, such as those available from the HFCS, are essential for this purpose. These data highlight some quantitatively-important dimensions of heterogeneity in the euro area, which can be grouped into two broad categories.First, the level and volatility of income varies across households according to socio-economic characteristics such as education, age and occupation.[3]Households with different income sources (e.g. employees, firm owners, unemployed), different skill levels, or different labour supply elasticities will respond differently to macroeconomic shocks. In turn, wages vary strongly with characteristics such as age and education. Such differences not only matter for understanding how different types of households react differently to economic shocks: evidence suggests that changes in the composition of the workforce can help explaining euro area wage growth at the aggregate level.[4]Estimates for the largest four euro area countries indicate that the increase in income after an expansionary monetary policy shock is particularly large for households in the lowest income quintile (Chart 4).[5]The explanation is that low-income households are substantially more likely to be unemployed at any point in time: it follows that this group is more likely to benefit from the employment creation triggered by a monetary expansion. Similarly, the elasticity of labour income in relation to changes in aggregate GDP growth is significantly higher for workers in lower-income households.[6]Chart 4Effect of monetary policy easing on household income by income quintile(percentages)
Sources: Lenza, M. and Slacalek, J. (2018) op. cit., Eurosystem Household Finance and Consumption Survey, wave 2.Notes: The chart, taken from Lenza, M. and Slacalek, J. (2018) op. cit, shows the percentage change in mean income across income quintiles in the euro area four quarters after the impact of a quantitative easing shock, which is assumed to correspond to a 30 basis point drop in the spread between a 10-year sovereign bond and the policy rate. It also shows the decomposition of the change into the extensive margin (transition from unemployment to employment) and the intensive margin (increase in wages). The numbers in brackets show the initial levels of mean gross household income in each quintile. The statistics cover the euro area, which is modelled here as an aggregate of France, Germany, Italy, and Spain. Second, households differ substantially in the size and composition of the assets they own and in their indebtedness (Chart 5). Based on the second wave of the HFCS almost 60 percent of euro area households are homeowners, of which about a third have a mortgage. Almost all households own financial assets, even if their value is typically only a small fraction of the value of their real estate holdings.[7]These dimensions of household heterogeneity clearly matter for the exposure of individual households to monetary policy decisions.Chart 5Household assets and debt by income quintile(x-axis: quintiles and deciles; y-axis: EUR thousands)Sources: De Bond, G. et al. (op. cit), and Household Finance and Consumption Survey, results from the second wave.Notes: The chart shows the average value of assets and debt per household across five income quintiles for the euro area. The top quintile is further broken down into two deciles. Housing wealth is composed of the households’ main residence and other real estate. Other assets include the value of households’ vehicles, voluntary pension/life insurance, shares, valuables, bonds, managed accounts and money owed to households.For instance, ECB simulations suggest that unexpectedly-low inflation tends to harm young and middle-aged households, and more so for young income-rich households that disproportionately have nominal debt liabilities. [8]By contrast, older households tend to gain from unexpectedly-low inflation, especially if they are income-rich, since this group tends to hold nominal assets.[9]To the extent that their financial assets have short maturities and their mortgages have adjustable rates, households will also be differently affected by a reduction in the interest rate.[10]
The estimates in Chart 6 show that an average net borrower has gained close to EUR 2,000 per year in lower interest payments in recent years, whereas an average net saver has lost close to EUR 700 per year.[11]Chart 6Change in net interest income for borrowers and savers in the euro area(euros per household; change in annual net interest income, 2007-2017)Sources: Dossche, M. et al. op. cit., using the Household Finance and Consumption Survey (second wave).Notes: Net borrowers are defined as households with a negative net financial wealth position and net savers are defined as households with a positive net financial wealth position. Percentages in brackets indicate the share of net borrowers and net savers in the total household population. Analogously, only homeowners will benefit from any increase in house prices induced by a monetary policy easing and those with mortgages will benefit disproportionately due to the impact of leverage. Conversely, Chart 7 reports estimates of the evolution of household net wealth as a result of the lower house prices observed in many countries between 2011 and 2014. It suggests that the net wealth of homeowners declined by 6 percentage points more than the wealth of renters. The decline was especially marked for homeowners with mortgages, for whom it amounted to as much as around 20 percent. Chart 7Growth of median net wealth by housing status, 2011-14(HICP-adjusted; percentages)Source: Household Finance and Consumption Survey, waves 1 and 2.Note: The chart shows the growth rates of the median net wealth in the euro area for outright owners, owners with a mortgage and renters from 2011 to 2014, deflated by the HICP.Assessing the overall implications of these many dimensions of heterogeneity is challenging. Recent ECB research suggests that the most important dimension of heterogeneity is related to employment status.[12]
Following an easing of monetary policy conditions, there are disproportionate increases in income in the lower part of the income distribution, which results in a decline in measured income inequality. By contrast, since a majority of households are homeowners, an increase in house prices due to a looser monetary policy has a relatively even impact of house prices across the wealth distribution.[13] At the same time, it is worth keeping in mind that the degree of home ownership can vary considerably across countries. The more concentrated ownership of equities and bonds among households means that this component of the wealth distribution varies with the monetary stance, even while recalling that many households have indirect financial holdings through pension funds and other types of investment vehicles.From a broader perspective, we should also bear in mind that the contribution of monetary policy to changes in inequality is small, compared with the role of fiscal policy (especially the degree of redistribution in the design of the tax and transfer systems) and structural economic trends.Differences across households also matter for the relation between aggregate income and aggregate consumption. In particular, if an increase in aggregate income is not uniform across households, the overall consumption response will depend on the marginal propensity to consume that is, the fraction of an additional euro received that is spent on consumption – of the different household types. A rich empirical literature has uncovered considerable heterogeneity in marginal propensity to consume across household types. In particular, this literature finds that the spending decisions of households owning few liquid assets are much more sensitive to shocks than the spending decisions of households that own sufficient liquid buffers. Similarly, highly-indebted households tend to have a higher propensity to consume than savers.[14]Quantifying the implications for the transmission of monetary policy of heterogeneity in the marginal propensity to consume requires detailed institutional and socio-economic information on households at higher frequency. This type of information is available in certain countries and it is encouraging that researchers are starting to make use of it.[15]The results indicate that this heterogeneity does play a role in shaping the transmission of monetary policy. Beyond the intertemporal substitution channel, other channels have been highlighted by the expanding literature on heterogeneous-agent New Keynesian (HANK) models.[16] These include: a “cash-flow” channel, through which the decline in debt service for debtors means that they have more of their income available for spending; an “income” channel, whereby higher consumption expenditure results from the increase in employment and wages; and a “wealth” channel, such that the increase in asset valuations generates more spending through wealth effects.Some initial estimates of the quantitative impact of all these channels are also available for the euro area. They are reported in Chart 8, where households are classified into three groups: (i) renters with limited financial assets; (ii) homeowners with limited financial assets but possibly a (sizable) mortgage; and (iii) homeowners with adequate financial assets. According to this classification, 10 percent of households in the euro area are renters with limited financial assets, 12 percent are homeowners with limited financial assets and 78 percent are homeowners with adequate financial assets.Chart 8Effects of a 100 basis point cut in interest rates on consumption in the euro area, depending on household wealth (change in consumption; percentages)Source: Slacalek, Tristani and Violante (2019), Household Finance and Consumption Survey, wave 2.
Notes: The figure shows a decomposition of the effects of a 100 basis point cut in interest rates on consumption. The total consists of four parts. The standard intertemporal substitution effect (IES), the cash-flow effect, the income effect and the housing wealth effect. The size of these effects varies depending on households’ wealth. Euro area in this chart refers to France, Germany, Italy and Spain.This classification is relevant, since it has been argued that the two groups of households with limited financial assets are more constrained in their ability to smooth consumption over time and tend to respond more strongly to temporary changes in income.[17]In addition, the composition of wealth of the different groups varies: while homeowners with limited financial assets tend to have a mortgage (and their debt service decreases when the policy rate is cut), the homeowners with substantial financial assets often experience lower returns on interest-rate-bearing assets if the policy rate declines.Chart 8 decomposes the overall effect on consumer spending into the components attributable to the various transmission channels.[18]First, the standard, intertemporal substitution channel is present only for financially-unconstrained households which are able to save. It makes up only about a third of the total impact on aggregate consumption. Second, the cash-flow channel is particularly strong for homeowners with limited financial assets, who tend to have large mortgages, often with adjustable rates. Third, spending is substantially stimulated via the income channel. This channel is heavily skewed towards lower-income households, who also tend to benefit disproportionately from a stronger labour market. Fourth, the strongest asset price effect occurs through the increases in house prices. This effect turns out to be quite large for highly leveraged homeowners, since their consumption is more sensitive to house prices.[19]Overall, the spending of the lower-income cohort and the cohort of homeowners with only limited financial assets is much more strongly stimulated by monetary policy easing. A 100 basis point cut in interest rates increases consumption of these groups by almost 1.0 percent and 1.6 percent respectively, while consumption of the financially-unconstrained group increases only by 0.4 percent.These estimates suggest that the standard intertemporal substitution channel substantially contributes to the spending decision of many households, but the other three channels, which have traditionally been neglected, are decisive for the consumption choice of the lower-income cohort and highly-leveraged homeowners. These three channels contribute about two thirds of the total response of aggregate consumption to a monetary policy shift. It follows that household heterogeneity can help to explain how the effects of monetary policy can be relatively large, due to the larger consumption response of the hand-to-mouth group, even if the intertemporal substitution channel is weaker than in the representative agent framework.[20]To summarise, it is important to account for heterogeneity in the transmission of monetary policy, but this is not a simple exercise. Comparisons between “winners and losers” based on a single channel, or a specific factor, are necessarily incomplete and likely to prove misleading.Concluding remarksLet me conclude. Attention to variation across households and its relation to monetary policy is welcome. It helps us to make progress in understanding the key features of the transmission mechanism of monetary policy.It is also very promising that the economics profession is finding ways to incorporate relevant dimensions of household heterogeneity in our models. This flourishing field recognises that monetary transmission is more complicated and dependent on many institutional features than suggested by the traditional representative-agent model.Further advances will require more data and more analysis. An essential source to estimate these effects in the euro area is the HFCS. One avenue is to make use of the administrative data available in other datasets (including tax data and credit registers) to complement and improve the information collected via household surveys. I very much applaud this effort. Another important element is to better understand how consumers form expectations.[21]To this end the ECB is working on establishing a Consumer Expectations Survey, which we hope will provide a useful basis to deepen our understanding of consumer behaviour at a granular level and the extent to which this matters for macroeconomic outcomes.[1]I am grateful to Maarten Dossche, Jirka Slacalek, and Oreste Tristani for their contributions to this speech.

(2018) “Monetary Policy According to HANK”, American Economic Review, Vol. 108(3), pp.697-743. Of course, in addition to the New Keynesian framework, there is also a wider literature studying the implications of household heterogeneity for macroeconomic dynamics through a variety of mechanisms. See, among others, Huggett, M. (1996) “Wealth distribution in life-cycle economies”, Journal of Monetary Economics, Vol. 38(3), pp. 469-94; Heathcote, J., Storesletten, K. and Violante, G. L. (2009) “Quantitative Macroeconomics with Heterogeneous Households”, Annual Review of Economics, Annual Reviews, Vol. 1(2), pp. 319,354.[17]See, among others, Kaplan, G., Violante, G. L. and Weidner, J. (2014), “The Wealthy Hand-to-Mouth”, Brookings, Papers on Economic Activity, 45(1), 77–153, on the importance of accounting for hand-to-mouth households.[18]The figure is based on Slacalek, J, Tristani, O. and Violante, G. L. (2019), “Household Balance Sheet Channels of Monetary Policy: A Back of the Envelope Calculation for the Euro Area”, mimeo.[19]Slacalek et al. op. cit. also consider the effects on consumption via stock market wealth. In the euro area household portfolios are heavily skewed toward housing, except at the very top tail of the distribution. Correspondingly, Slacalek et al. op. cit. show that the effect of stock market wealth on consumption is limited, even for the non-hand-to-mouth households, also because their marginal propensities to consume out of stock market wealth are very small. This result holds even after the holdings of stock market wealth by the non-hand-to-mouth households in the survey are corrected for underreporting. Compared to aggregate sources, the survey covers about 70 percent of the stock market wealth at the euro area level.[20]Analogous additional amplification can occur via heterogeneity across firms due to differences in leverage and other factors; see, amongst others, Jeenas, P. (2018), “Firm Balance Sheet Liquidity, Monetary Policy Shocks, and Investment Dynamics,” Technical Report.and Ottonello, P., and Winberry, T.

SPEECHWelcome remarksRemarks by Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, at the fourth annual ECB macroprudential policy and research conference Frankfurt am Main, 16 December 2019I am delighted to welcome you all to the fourth annual ECB macroprudential policy and research conference. This conference is held annually to ensure that we meet regularly and advance our understanding of macroprudential policy. This year’s focus is on monetary policy and financial stability as it represents the conclusion of the ECB’s Research Task Force dedicated to this topic.In my remarks today I will cover three aspects of macroprudential policy and research. First, I will reflect on the economic and financial conditions that may represent challenges for macroprudential policy. Second, I will focus on selected achievements at the ECB in advancing the research frontier. Finally, I will address the need of rebalancing capital requirements towards releasable buffers to allow macroprudential authorities to act more effectively in a countercyclical manner especially in adverse economic conditions.Macroprudential policy in a changing environmentThe current environment is characterised by a weakening of the macroeconomic outlook and increasing uncertainty, even though the latest indicators point to a stabilisation of economic activity. The associated low-for-longer interest rate environment is likely to put pressure on bank profitability. Weak profitability and squeezed margins pose a risk to financial stability as they may hamper banks’ intermediation and capital generation capacity. It is thus important to assess the interaction of monetary and macroprudential policies while respecting their individual mandates. I am happy to say that quite some research on the interaction of these two policy areas has been undertaken here at the ECB.[1]In particular, two papers of the Research Task Force are dedicated to this issue: one documents the macroeconomic impact of macroprudential policy measures and its interaction with monetary policy[2]; a second one sheds light and quantifies the transmission between monetary policy and bank stability.[3]On-going research at the ECBMoreover, ECB research has showcased the particular importance of remaining vigilant about banks’ resilience in episodes of increasing cyclical systemic risk. Recent work quantifies how exuberant credit and asset price dynamics lead to large downside risks to bank-level return on assets, putting a banking system’s capital at risk over the medium term.[4]The quantification of bank capital at risk can support the calibration of macroprudential instruments. In turn, by subjecting the banking sector to specific shocks, a macroprudential stress-testing framework can help in assessing the capital shortfall in times of stress. Whereas traditional stress-testing frameworks focus on initial capital shortfalls, macroprudential stress-testing frameworks quantify the propagation of costs for banks and the real economy over time. This is the aim of the macro-micro approach, which takes into account the heterogeneity in banks’ reaction functions.[5]More generally, stress-testing has become a key instrument in the macroprudential and financial stability toolkit for assessing risks to the banking system in adverse conditions. The bottom-up approach used in the context of the EU-wide stress test relies on banks’ own reporting of projections based on common scenarios and gives national supervisors and the ECB an important role with regard to quality assurance. 
Recent research provides tentative evidence that “supervisory scrutiny” relating to quality assurance has a disciplining effect on banks’ risk-taking.[6]We also need to understand how banks will react to the policy measures that are applied to them. A dynamic micro-founded structural model of bank behaviour examines changes in capital and liquidity requirements and confirms considerable heterogeneity among banks’ reactions.[7]Moreover, our 3D model, with default modelled in the household, non-financial corporations and banking sector, has been successfully used in various policy exercises and exemplifies how cutting-edge research can help inform policy decisions.[8]The role of macroprudential policySo what is the role of macroprudential policy in the current environment? The financial crisis showed that macroprudential policy is needed to complement supervisory scrutiny by accounting for system-wide macro-financial feedback loops. Macroprudential policy is called to act countercyclically, tightening requirements when we see excessive risk-taking and loosening them to avoid a credit crunch when risks materialise.Since the crisis, the resilience of euro area banks has improved significantly and their capital level is currently considered to be adequate. However, in addition to the level of capital, also its composition deserves appropriate consideration. The macroprudential buffers that are currently implemented in the SSM banking system are of a predominantly structural nature and are thus expected to be maintained over the cycle.[9]The countercyclical capital buffer (CCyB) is the only buffer that is intended to be released in case of a downturn. However, the CCyB has only been activated by seven of the 19 euro area countries and currently represents, in the aggregate, only 0.1% of risk-weighted assets [10]A lack of releasable buffers curbs the countercyclical role of macroprudential authorities. When breaching their combined buffer requirements, banks may uphold capital ratios by disposing assets to avoid the automatic restrictions on dividend distributions. If such behaviour becomes widespread in the event of systemic stress, it can result in a credit crunch, which would aggravate the downturn. This is exactly what we observed in previous crisis episodes, and what we should avoid in the future.Macroprudential space in the form of releasable buffers could serve as a potential macro-financial stabilisation in euro area countries. The release of the buffers in a downturn should help banks to sustain the flow of credit. To this end, releasable buffers would first need to be available. In sum, we are in a situation where the overall level of capital requirements is broadly adequate, but the composition may not be optimal. It is therefore important to have a discussion on the need to reallocate capital requirements towards releasable buffers in a capital-neutral manner. Other national authorities have had – or are having – similar discussions, such as in the United Kingdom and in the United States.[11]To me, such a reallocation appears to make sense in the current environment of heightened uncertainty and risks tilted to the downside. With a reallocation of buffers, cyclical systemic risk factors – common to the entire banking sector – would be covered appropriately by the CCyB. In turn, remaining idiosyncratic bank-specific risks will continue to be covered by microprudential requirements. The reallocation would be capital-neutral because the resulting increase in the CCyB would be offset by a corresponding decrease in other capital requirements, for example in Pillar 2, as done by the Bank of England.The capital-neutral creation of releasable buffers does not require a regulatory change. Indeed, the CCyB is already enshrined in EU law and transposed in the national context. It is used to address cyclical systemic risks that are common to the entire banking sector. To ensure that all relevant risks in the banking sector continue to be appropriately covered calls for continued close cooperation among all relevant authorities. This includes close coordination both among micro- and macroprudential authorities as well as between the ECB and national macroprudential authorities. National authorities will continue to remain first in line to deploy the CCyB to address changing systemic risks in their jurisdiction.Concluding remarksLet me conclude. The current macro-financial environment has become more challenging. The lower-for-longer interest rate environment creates strains on bank profitability with implications for financial stability.
This implies that we need to further build our analytical toolkit to identify risks and devise a coherent policy response. It calls for intensifying both our outreach to state-of-the-art research from academia and our analytical work in-house. As mentioned earlier, deepening our understanding on the interplay between monetary and macroprudential policies is a key priority in a low-for-longer interest rate environment. Furthermore, we aim at better capturing interactions between banks, other market participants and the real economy in a fully integrated macroprudential stress-testing framework combining macro and micro building blocks. This requires estimating and modelling behaviour of financial and non-financial agents to realistically capture their balance sheet adjustments also in times of stress.On the policy side, our key priority is to become more agile in fulfilling our countercyclical macroprudential policy mandate. We need to ensure that releasable buffers are available to enable the banking system to support the real economy in a downturn. At present, the best option is to set the CCyB in a capital-neutral manner to be able to withstand current headwinds.I wish us all an insightful conference.[1]See, for instance, van der Ghote, A.

erHubBetter Data, to Inform Better Policy - Deputy Governor Sharon Donnery 16 December 2019 Speech Opening remarks at the Sixth Conference on Household Finance and ConsumptionGood morning, and welcome to the sixth conference on Household Finance and Consumption1.I would like to thank both my colleagues in the Central Bank of Ireland and the ECB for all their hard work in organising what promises to be a fascinating network event. Looking at the programme, and the range of topics; from inflation, housing, credit, and business cycles, to inequality, demographic change, and of course, monetary policy, you’re in for a stimulating couple of days.What I see as a common thread across this diverse range of issues is ultimately, how better data informs better policy. Like many policy institutions, a decade ago, the crisis, prompted us to reflect on the type of data we collect, how it is analysed, and, crucially, how the analysis feeds through to policy decisions.  The work that you, the network, are doing and what we will discuss today, is critical to how we make policy, how we decide, and how what we do affects society. But it’s important we don’t just think about the gaps in data that emerged in the past. We also need to develop data in areas that have grown and changed recently, such as non-bank, or market based finance. Finally, today, I wish to note how data can enhance debates and policy discussion where before it had been unavailable. For example, today the Central Bank of Ireland is launching a report on the national claims information database (NCID), a report that will add important numbers and facts to a widely debated topic here in Ireland.Understanding household balance sheets through data, The Irish Household Finance and Consumption Survey (2013), provided really important insights in to household finances in the wake of the crisis. We know that high-leverage households were twice as likely to face credit constraints, even after controlling for different income shocks faced by households (LeBlanc & Lydon 2019).  The cross-country evidence paints a similar picture – amongst Euro area households in 2013/14, Irish households were the most indebted and the most likely to be credit constrained – almost one-in-five households at the time (ibid).  Heavily indebted households reduce their spending by significantly more in response to a given income shock. This partly explains why Ireland experienced one of the largest drops in consumer spending during the Great Recession, and a slow recovery in consumer spending (ibid).Today, consumer spending is almost back at pre-recession levels, providing significant support for domestic demand and, crucially, employment (CSO 2019).Although, I note that this time spending growth is not accompanied by a build-up in household indebtedness. In fact, since 2016 – a period when consumer spending growth has averaged around three per cent per year – household debt-to-income ratios have fallen by 31 percentage points, from 151 to 120 per cent (Central Bank 2019).Beyond the aggregate, distributional effects in economic outcomes is now a key theme in macro modelling (Moll, 2017). Issues like the distribution of income, wealth and debt are increasingly discussed in central banking circles. It is important that we understand how different shocks and policy choices affect different groups in society, and how these differences influence aggregate outcomes (Ampudia et al, 2018).
And this is possible now, precisely because of the advent of better data like the Household Finance and Consumption Survey. Not only does it bring macro theory more into line with reality, but it also allows for differences in behaviour across the income and wealth distributions to be better reflected in the models. One interesting finding is the extent to which a monetary stimulus reduces income inequality by boosting the incomes and employment of lower income households (Lenza et al, 2018). I look forward to hearing more in Philip’s lunch-time remarks, as well as in the conference tomorrow. And while here we refer to micro household finance data in monetary policy, we have of course had lengthy discussions on the role of micro data in monetary policy more widely (Donnery, 2016).A house purchase is for many the largest asset they will buy over their lifetimes. In Ireland, we have seen excessive swings in house prices, and so had different wealth effects on households depending when they purchased. Through data analysis we know how debt affects households’ responses to income and wealth shocks. A lack of resilience spills over to the real economy making for longer, and deeper, recessions. The Irish experience over the last two decades paved the way for us to collect loan level data and develop what are now critical macro prudential instruments. The data we collect allows analysis of both bank and borrower balance sheets which contribute to our policy framework. Good data is key to understanding both the origin and transmission of shocks, and to develop policy to build resilience moving forward. It is key for calibrating the levers in our macro-prudential policy toolkit. Such as the mortgage measures, which aim to build resilience of both borrowers and lenders. Or capital buffers that target lender resilience.  The aim of macro-prudential policy is to strengthen the resilience of the economy to adverse shocks, as well as to reduce the cyclical movements in credit and asset prices that have proven so detrimental in the past. Rigorous data driven analysis is part of our policy design, assessment and calibration (Central Bank, 2019).As economists, we are always interested in new data, in looking at a topic from a different angle, or through a different lens. Looking forward, the Central Bank of Ireland’s central credit register and AnaCredit are two sources that may be able to add to our analysis of household and firm resilience. We also are also looking forward to new pension fund data coming on stream shortly.  Pension assets represent the second largest financial asset of Irish households. The new dataset will, for the first time, allow us look through to the granular holding within each fund and better understand the risk exposures of households.Non-bank financial intermediationThe last crisis highlighted the need for better data to understand, and better policy to strengthen, the balance sheet resilience of households and lenders. However we must be careful not to just focus all our resources on the data gaps that were exposed in the past. We also need to develop tools to understand the world as it has changed. One area of growth since the crisis is non-bank financial intermediation, otherwise referred to as market based finance. The Eurosystem’s Household Finance and Consumption Survey (HFCS) provides important information on mismatches between the assets and liabilities of individual households, in terms of their size, volatility, interest rate sensitivity and liquidity.  Many of the questions that can be addressed with these data have parallels with some of the issues facing policymakers regarding market based finance. The Central Bank of Ireland actively employs micro-level data to assess and understand this sector. For example, we use this to assess non-bank financial institutions’ engagement in credit intermediation, liquidity mismatch and leverage.  We also monitor their interconnectedness with other parts of the financial system. And we engage internationally to assess and understand trends and developments in the non-bank sector.Market-based financing activity can be broadly defined as the raising of equity or debt through financial markets, rather than through the banking system.  It can provide a valuable alternative to bank financing for many businesses and households and support economic activity.Developing alternative channels of financing through deep capital markets is one of the key objectives of the Capital Markets Union (CMU) initiative. Developed financial markets can also provide households with a wider range of investment choices, some of which can be facilitated by non-bank financial institutions such as investment funds.    However, activities related to market-based finance may also give rise to financial vulnerabilities, which needs to be monitored and, if needed, addressed. The resilience of market based finance in the current scale both domestically and internationally remains untested in times of stress.2
Given the scale and growth of this part of the financial system, it is important to monitor the activities of non-bank financial institutions engaged in market-based finance. The changing nature of financial intermediation complicates the assessment of potential vulnerabilities. Moreover, the past is unlikely to be a good guide to the future, as these markets may behave differently going forward.  Just last week, some colleagues in the Central Bank published a paper “Mapping market based finance in Ireland” that summarises our ongoing analysis of this sector. The analysis builds on previous work and provided an informative overview of the types of entities and activities to be found in the Irish domiciled non-bank financial intermediation sector.Building on this micro data and developing our understanding of the sector will be a priority area for the Central Bank in 2020.Data and insurance:So yes, better data informs better policy. And we must develop data to address gaps, and to keep pace with changes in the economy and financial system. Data can especially enhance debates and policy discussion on topics where before it had been unavailable.And while speaking about data informing policy, I want to briefly mention a new report on non-life insurance data that the Central Bank is releasing today. The Cost of Insurance Working Group was established by Government in 2016 to examine the factors contributing to the increasing cost of insurance and to identify measures to reduce this cost, taking account of the requirement to maintain a financially stable insurance sector.  Where in some cases, anecdotes are being used as evidence, one of the group’s key recommendations was that policy discussion in the area of insurance should be supported by independent and reliable statistics. The Central Bank was tasked with this job and we have worked to address this data gap in the motor insurance market through the establishment of the National Claims Information Database (NCID).Today’s report on the NCID will increase transparency in the sector. The report will assist the Cost of Insurance Working Group, Government, Oireachtas and wider stakeholders in their consideration of the relevant issues.The motor insurance report has a range of new information in relation to claims; premiums; comparison of settlement channels and a breakdown of insurers’ income and expenditure for private motor insurance (Central Bank, 2019)The overall trend is consistent with the long term insurance underwriting cycle, with peaks and troughs in premiums, reserves and profitability.  Cycles typically last six to nine years. The report is rich in data but one key comparison will undoubtedly draw attention. Between 2009 and 2018, the average cost of claims per policy decreased by 2.5% from €437 in 2009 to €426 in 2018. In contrast, between 2009 and 2018, the average premium per policy increased by 42% from €495 in 2009 to €705 in 2018. Now, I’m not saying this is a black-and-white case. Data cannot be considered in isolation – it has to be considered both in the round and in the contextual circumstances, such as the underwriting cycles mentioned previously.  For instance, while it is correct to say from the data that the average cost of claims per policy has fallen, it is also true to say that the average cost of each claim has steadily increased over the same period.In all, the average cost of claims is up by 64% per cent over the period. Within that there has been a compositional shift to a greater proportion of higher value injury claims.  The average cost of an injury claim has been increasing steadily over the entire period and is now over 50% higher than a decade ago, currently at just over €47,000.  Looking at the loss ratio for insurance firms, there was a prolonged period of losses peaking in 2014. This has since been coming down. Firms are more profitable, in line with peaks and troughs in the cycle. Like I said, our task was to gather the data and publish it, and it will be for others to analyse and contextualise some of the patterns we are seeing above. But I can say with confidence that this first report will play an important role in bringing a greater level of transparency to the market, and providing data to support evidence based decision-making. Better data on insurance claims can inform the policy debates in Government, in the Oireachtas, in the firms and in wider society as well as informing our own work in the Central Bank. And now coming back to where we started, on household finances and the need for data, I want to finish with some thoughts and challenges for the network going forward. The HFCS is uniquely positioned to answer questions that will shape policy going forward. Issues such as demographics and how they affect our macro models will benefit from micro foundations (Lane, 2019).34
Also the role of financial innovation and households, the rise of non-bank finance, the disruption of traditional banking services by technology based service providers is well under way. How will these changes affect households, affect our economy, and our policy? And of course beyond data, we also need to push the boundaries in how we analyse, how we model and estimate. This includes using behavioural economics, which provides insights on how people actually make decisions in the real world, and the factors that affect those decisions, to gain new perspectives on a diverse range of topics such as mortgage switching or differential pricing for example. By constantly developing our analytical approach we can gain greater insight and understanding of the world around us. But more detail on that is for another day. Let us continue with the excellent research and analysis we see already. But we must always be on the lookout for new areas and challenges where our resources, our skills and our knowledge can contribute – in short, where better data can make better policy.[1] I would like to thank my Central Bank colleagues who contributed to my remarks across the range of topics.

  News conference   Page 1/6    Berne, 12 December 2019 Thomas Jordan Introductory remarks by Thomas Jordan  Ladies and gentlemen It is my pleasure to welcome you to the Swiss National Bank’s news conference. As usual, I will begin by explaining our monetary policy decision and presenting our assessment of the economic situation. I will also be addressing three additional subjects: five years of negative interest, the possible consequences of climate change for the SNB in fulfilling its mandate, and a study on the methods behind our company talks. After my remarks, Fritz Zurbrügg will report on the developments in the area of financial stability, and Andréa Maechler will then talk about the situation on the financial markets. We will – as ever – be pleased to take your questions afterwards. Monetary policy decision  I will begin with our monetary policy decision.  We are keeping the SNB policy rate and interest on sight deposits at the SNB at −0.75%. We remain willing to intervene in the foreign exchange market as necessary, while taking the overall currency situation into consideration. Our expansionary monetary policy continues to be necessary given the inflation outlook in Switzerland.  The trade-weighted exchange rate of the Swiss franc is practically unchanged compared with September 2019. The franc thus remains highly valued, and the situation on the foreign exchange market is still fragile. Negative interest and the willingness to intervene counteract the attractiveness of Swiss franc investments and thus ease the upward pressure on the currency. In this way, the SNB stabilises price developments and supports economic activity.  The new conditional inflation forecast for the coming quarters is slightly lower than in September. The longer-term forecast is virtually unchanged. For 2019 the forecast stands at 
 Berne, 12 December 2019 Thomas Jordan News conference   Page 2/6   0.4%, for 2020 at 0.1% and for 2021 at 0.5%. The conditional inflation forecast is based on the assumption that the SNB policy rate remains at –0.75% over the entire forecast horizon. Global economic outlook International trade tensions and political uncertainty have weighed on the global economy in recent months. Accordingly, economic growth around the world was again slightly below average in the third quarter. The increase in manufacturing output was modest in many countries, this being accompanied by subdued capital spending and lacklustre global trade in goods. Against this backdrop, employment growth in the advanced economies was slower than a few quarters ago, and unemployment fell only slightly. However, it is already very low in many countries, and is thus lending support to consumer demand.  Various central banks eased their monetary policy in the autumn in light of modest inflation and the economic risks. Moreover, they signalled that they would probably leave their policy rates at a low level for an extended period of time. The SNB is maintaining its existing baseline scenario for the global economy, and expects momentum to remain modest over the short term. The monetary policy easing is likely to contribute to the economy – and thus also inflation – picking up again over the medium term.  Risks to the global economy remain tilted to the downside. Chief among them are still trade tensions and the possibility of the persisting weakness in manufacturing activity spreading to the economy as a whole. Swiss economic outlook According to the initial estimate, the Swiss economy grew by 1.6% in the third quarter. This growth was primarily driven by manufacturing, where value added increased significantly thanks to strong growth in the exports of pharmaceutical products. The other industries in the manufacturing sector recorded a more modest expansion, in line with the slowdown in manufacturing worldwide. The labour market continues to be a mainstay of the economy. Employment figures rose again slightly, and the unemployment rate persisted at a low level through to November. GDP is likely to expand by around 1% in 2019, and the SNB expects growth of between 1.5% and 2% in 2020. The stronger expansion next year reflects the gradual firming expected in global economic activity as well as an exceptional effect. The latter stems from the fact that the forecast includes the revenue generated by major international sporting events, which is likely to increase growth by around half a percentage point. Monetary situation and inflation expectations Let me now move on to address monetary conditions – that is to say, exchange rates and interest rates – as well as inflation expectations. 
 Berne, 12 December 2019 Thomas Jordan News conference   Page 3/6   The external value of the Swiss franc has remained stable since the monetary policy assessment in September. There has also been scarcely any change in the trade-weighted exchange rate over 2019 as a whole, although it initially declined before appreciating again in the summer. The Swiss franc thus remains highly valued, and the situation on the foreign exchange market is still fragile.  Short-term interest rates are close to the SNB policy rate. The long-term Swiss franc rates reached new lows in the summer, and have recovered only slightly since. This pattern reflects global interest rate movements. The yield on 10-year Swiss Confederation bonds currently stands at –0.5%, compared with –0.2% at the beginning of the year. The long-term interest rates in the euro area and the US have declined even more strongly. All in all, the low interest rate environment around the world has become more entrenched over the course of 2019. Finally, inflation expectations have declined slightly in Switzerland by comparison with the start of the year. However, they remain within the range of 0% to 2% that the SNB equates with price stability. Five years of negative interest Ladies and gentlemen, the SNB introduced the negative interest rate five years ago. Hardly anyone thought then that it would still be in place at the end of 2019. I would therefore like to take this opportunity to set out for you why we are convinced that negative interest remains necessary today.  As a rule, Switzerland has lower interest rates than other countries, one of the reasons for this being that investors value the security of Swiss franc investments. Following the outbreak of the financial crisis, many central banks quickly lowered their policy rates towards zero. This meant Swiss money market rates were practically at the same level as those of other countries. Amid the prevailing uncertainty at that time, the demand for Swiss francs rose sharply. To counter the extreme upward pressure, and thus ward off the threat of a severe recession coupled with deflation, we introduced the minimum exchange rate in 2011. This initially brought calm to the situation. Owing to international developments, it became apparent at the beginning of 2015 that the minimum exchange rate was no longer sustainable. To limit the appreciation of the Swiss franc after its discontinuation, we set a negative interest rate of −0.75%. The impact of negative interest proved considerable, as it helped stabilise the exchange rate situation in short order. Without it, the franc would have been significantly stronger in recent years, which would have been highly detrimental to the Swiss economy and would have jeopardised price stability.  And, ladies and gentlemen, negative interest remains central to our monetary policy to this day. If we were to dispense with it, Swiss interest rates would increase compared to those of other countries, Swiss franc investments would be markedly more attractive, and we would 
 Berne, 12 December 2019 Thomas Jordan News conference   Page 4/6   have to expect a marked and rapid appreciation in our currency. Inflation would thus fall significantly into negative territory, and the economy would be slowed.  But why are interest rates so low in the first place? This is in some part due to the expansionary monetary policy. However, the main reason is that for some time saving has been increasing worldwide, with comparatively little investment being made. The high saving rate is largely attributable to demographics. The dearth of investment is due, among other things, to low productivity gains. Both these factors have been heightened by the prevailing uncertainty since the onset of the financial crisis. If there is more saving and less investment, the interest rate at which the economy is in equilibrium falls. Switzerland cannot distance itself from this global development. Central banks set their policy rates relative to this equilibrium interest rate. To have an expansionary effect, a policy rate must be lower than the equilibrium interest rate. And if the latter is very low, it can be that the policy rate has to be lowered below zero. Unusual though they may be, ladies and gentlemen, negative interest rates are nonetheless necessary in the current situation if we are to fulfil our mandate against the backdrop of low interest rates worldwide.  At the same time, low interest rates do give rise to certain challenges. Negative interest therefore also attracts criticism. That said, we are convinced that the benefits clearly hold sway. Our assessment centres on the fact that we take an overall view, and seek to serve the interests of the country as a whole.  From the perspective of savers and pension funds, the present situation with low interest income is, of course, difficult. You might think that the SNB could simply remedy this. But let us assume that we were to raise the SNB policy rate to zero in the current situation. The economy would cool down dramatically, inflation would fall well into negative territory, and unemployment would rise. In such an environment, there would be scarcely any increase in longer-term interest rates. Furthermore, we would probably soon have to lower our policy rate again given the economic slowdown and lower inflation. Hence any gains in income for savers and pension funds would not be sustainable. From the banks’ perspective, negative interest rate payments to the SNB are a cost factor. We are aware of the burden this represents. That is why in September we adjusted our calculation of the exemption thresholds in such a way that the payments made by the banking system have nearly halved. We do not burden the banking system any more than is necessary for us to be able to steer short-term money market rates.  Ladies and gentlemen, we monitor the impact of negative interest precisely, and we take the side-effects seriously. However, we remain convinced that the benefits it brings Switzerland as a whole clearly outweigh the costs. The negative interest rate and the willingness to intervene are currently the best instruments for ensuring appropriate monetary conditions and thus securing price stability and supporting the economy. 
 Berne, 12 December 2019 Thomas Jordan News conference   Page 5/6   Monetary policy outlook  Allow me to summarise the key messages with regard to our monetary policy. We anticipate that our economy has expanded by around 1% this year. We are expecting growth of between 1.5% and 2% next year. Inflation expectations are within the range consistent with price stability. The conditional inflation forecast for the coming quarters is slightly lower than in September, but it is essentially unchanged in the longer term. The Swiss franc remains highly valued, and the situation on the foreign exchange market is still fragile. Against this backdrop, our expansionary monetary policy remains appropriate.  Monetary policy and climate change This brings me now to the significance of climate change for the SNB. When it comes to this key issue, we are focused first and foremost on being able to properly assess the possible consequences for the functioning of economies and financial systems, both in Switzerland and worldwide. Broadly speaking, climate change can affect monetary policy in two ways. On the one hand, it can lead to structural changes in the economy. This rather slow and steady process must be taken into account in our forecasting models over the course of time. On the other hand, regulatory climate protection measures can lead to sudden changes in the prices of important goods. The SNB analyses the impact that both these types of change have on growth and inflation, and the resultant consequences for monetary policy.  The dialogue we have within the framework of the Central Banks’ and Supervisors’ Network for Greening the Financial System also helps us in this respect. The SNB is actively involved in NGFS working groups that address monetary policy, financial stability and investment policy aspects. We also regularly exchange information on climate-related issues with other institutions. My two colleagues will talk about climate change from the perspective of financial stability and investment policy afterwards. Study on the methods used in the SNB’s company talks I would now like to talk about an additional document that you will find in your press kits, namely a study looking at the methods the SNB’s delegates use in carrying out their discussions with companies. As you know, our delegates for regional economic relations regularly conduct talks with managers of companies throughout Switzerland. These provide us with a timely, first-hand account of the latest cyclical and structural developments in the Swiss economy. A summary of the results has for some time now been published in our quarterly Business Cycle Signals report. The enclosed study explains the objectives and the methods underlying these company talks.  You will also find the latest issue of the Business Cycle Signals in your press kits. Both of these sources of information are, of course, also available on our website.

  News conference   Page 1/6    Berne, 12 December 2019 Andréa M. Maechler Introductory remarks by Andréa M. Maechler  I would like to begin by reviewing developments on the global financial markets, paying special attention to the situation on the Swiss franc money market. I will also brief you on how preparations to replace Libor are progressing. After this, I will address the importance of climate risks for the SNB’s investment policy. I will close with a few remarks about the SNB’s involvement in the new Innovation Hub being set up by the Bank for International Settlements.  Situation on the financial markets Economic concerns and political uncertainty have shaped developments on the global financial and foreign exchange markets in recent months. For instance, the tug of war in the US-China trade dispute weighed on investors’ risk sentiment, especially in the third quarter. Interest rates declined significantly around the world during this phase. Yield curves flattened markedly. In some countries, long-term interest rates even dropped below the level of short-term rates. The yield on ten-year Confederation bonds fell to a historic low of −1.1% in August (cf. chart 1). Investor sentiment picked up again from September against a backdrop of monetary policy easing by the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank and somewhat more favourable economic data. The equity markets benefited in particular from reduced trade tensions in October, with some of the major share indices reaching new highs in November. The Swiss Market Index (SMI) has gained almost 5% since mid-year, recently surpassing the 2007 peak by over 12% (cf. chart 2). In this environment, interest rates recovered slightly from their lows and yield curves also steepened again. However, yields on government bonds issued by countries considered safe by investors have mostly been below mid-year levels of late; around 28% of government debt 
 Berne, 12 December 2019 Andréa M. Maechler News conference   Page 2/6   worldwide is still trading at negative yields. In Switzerland, the yield on 10-year Confederation bonds recently stood at −0.5%, approximately the same level as in mid-2019.  Overall, uncertainty dominated the financial markets – a fact that was also reflected in foreign exchange market prices. Weaker economic data weighed particularly heavily on the euro, which has depreciated by some 2.5% in trade-weighted terms since the end of June. On the other hand, currencies considered safe havens by the markets were able to appreciate in this environment. The Japanese yen and the Swiss franc have gained slightly since mid-year; the franc thus remains highly valued. The situation on the foreign exchange markets is still fragile (cf. chart 3). Money market developments Let me now turn to developments in the Swiss franc money market. Thomas Jordan has already mentioned the adjustments we have made to the way we calculate exemption thresholds for the negative interest rate. These changes came into effect on 1 November. Since then, many banks have been benefiting from higher exemption thresholds and have an incentive to take on liquidity via the money market. As expected, this demand for liquidity led to higher trading volumes and a slight rise in SARON and other short-term repo rates in the week following the introduction of the new calculation basis (cf. chart 4). The SNB was active in the repo market from time to time in order to keep SARON close to the SNB policy rate.  The Swiss franc repo market functioned smoothly throughout the transition, not least thanks to the state-of-the-art and reliable money market infrastructure. The SNB trades using the same infrastructure as the banks on the interbank market. This is particularly helpful as it ensures that the SNB’s operations are highly effective. Transitioning from Libor to SARON SARON is currently establishing itself as the leading reference interest rate for financial products in Swiss francs and is replacing Libor. As you know, the UK’s financial regulator will only be supporting Libor until the end of 2021, so it is important that the transition process on the market take place now. Over the last few years, the National Working Group on Swiss Franc Reference Rates (NWG) has put forward recommendations on how to proceed with replacing Libor. Market participants must now act decisively to implement these recommendations.  A SARON-based swap market is especially important for the financial markets. Swap markets are used to hedge interest rate risk (e.g. in mortgages); the associated transactions produce a swap curve, which serves as a benchmark for pricing and valuing bonds and loans. To date, however, trading – and hence liquidity – in SARON swaps has been low. This will change once more SARON-based cash products become available. The successful transitioning away from Libor therefore hinges on the development of such products.  
 Berne, 12 December 2019 Andréa M. Maechler News conference   Page 3/6   In order for SARON to be used as the reference rate for cash products, a longer-term interest rate must be calculated from the daily rate. As early as 2018, the NWG recommended various options for calculating an average interest rate based on realised SARON values. This approach, known as compounding, is also gaining traction abroad. A wide range of options for calculating such average rates has been proposed and evaluated. At its latest meeting, the NWG was more specific and narrowed down its set of recommended options.1 As a result, market participants can now begin embedding the compounding approach in products such as mortgages.  In addition to new SARON-based cash products, solutions must be found for existing Libor-based products. Ideally, these will be replaced by new, SARON-based contracts. At the very least, the existing contracts must be furnished with fallback clauses, which will come into effect when Libor is no longer available as a reference rate. I should stress that it is evident that the Swiss franc Libor will cease to exist. The stage has been set for the transition to SARON, and it is now up to market participants to use the time until the end of 2021 to complete the work that remains to be done. A successful transition from Libor to SARON is crucial for the smooth functioning of the Swiss franc money and capital markets. Importance of climate risks for the SNB’s investment policy I would now like to say a few words about the importance of climate risks for the SNB’s investment policy. Let me start by summarising this policy. Our asset management is governed by the primacy of monetary policy. In applying its investment policy, the SNB has two main objectives. The first is to ensure that the balance sheet can be used for monetary policy purposes at any time. In particular, the SNB must be in a position to expand or shrink its balance sheet if needed. The second objective is to preserve the value of currency reserves in the long term. A high degree of asset liquidity and diversification is required to ensure sufficient room for manoeuvre in the implementation of monetary policy. As the SNB does not pursue any strategic or structural objectives with its investments, it seeks to achieve the broadest possible market coverage in managing its assets.  So what do climate risks mean for the SNB’s investment policy? In the context of investment policy, climate risks are not fundamentally different from other financial risks – they too can trigger or amplify market fluctuations, which influence the attractiveness of certain assets. By opting for broad coverage of entire markets, the SNB takes into account the complexity of the many different risks. We regularly review changes in the risk landscape and factor them into our investment policy where necessary. Furthermore, as an investor the SNB has long had in place a clear set of exclusion criteria for companies that violate Switzerland’s fundamental norms and values. For instance, it does not invest in companies that systematically cause   1 Relevant documents are available on the SNB website: www.snb.ch/en/ifor/finmkt/fnmkt_benchm/id/finmkt_reformrates

Given the monetary policy requirements of our mandate, we are convinced that the approach we have chosen is appropriate.  Foundation of the BIS Innovation Hub In October, the SNB announced that it was collaborating with the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) to establish the BIS Innovation Hub Centre in Switzerland. This Hub Centre, which is scheduled to commence operations at the beginning of 2020 alongside the Hub Centres in Hong Kong and Singapore, will initially focus on two projects. The first will examine the integration of central bank money into a distributed ledger technology infrastructure, with a view to facilitating the settlement of tokenised assets between financial institutions. With respect to integrating digital central bank money, the focus is on two options: an SNB-issued digital token for financial institutions (‘wholesale central bank digital currency’) and an interface with the Swiss Interbank Clearing payment system. The project will be carried out as part of a collaboration between the SNB and SIX Digital Exchange in the form of a proof of concept.  The second project will address the growing demands placed on central banks to be able to track and monitor fast-paced electronic markets. We are convinced that the work of the new BIS Innovation Hub will make an important contribution to central banks’ understanding of developments in the fintech area.

‘Financial integration and inclusive development - a view from the Mediterranean countries’Banco de España, IEMed, OECD conferencePanel on ‘Central banks, financial integration and capital flows’Remarks by Luigi Federico Signorini Deputy Governor of the Bank of ItalyMadrid 13 December 2019

It is a great pleasure to be here. The topic of this session is among the most challenging for central banks today. My contribution will be in four parts. I shall start with some observations on monetary policy and financial spillovers in a financially interconnected world, before moving on to consider the role of the euro area, followed by the implications for the Southern Mediterranean countries. I shall conclude by discussing policy implications. The debate on monetary and financial spillovers in a financially interconnected world Global financial integration has been increasing rapidly over the last twenty years. Cross-border asset and liability positions have doubled as a share of global GDP since the Asian financial crisis of 1997-98. The pace of growth has been faster in advanced economies (AEs) – partly reflecting the disproportionate rise in the gross assets and liabilities of financial centres1 – but it has also been remarkable in emerging economies (EMEs), where the average level of gross external assets and liabilities has reached 60 per cent of GDP, up from less than 40 per cent in 1997 (Fig. 1).Greater financial interconnectedness allows for more risk sharing, increasing each economy’s ability to absorb idiosyncratic shocks; however, it may also intensify the transmission of global shocks, especially those originating from core countries. Capital flow volatility and the cross-border correlation of asset price movements and credit growth have increased in recent years, in connection with unconventional monetary policies put in place in major AEs and with the intensifying search for yield. This has revived the debate over the risks posed by international spillovers, not only to financial stability but also to monetary policy autonomy, particularly in EMEs with less developed domestic financial markets. 1 Lane, P.R. & Milesi-Ferretti, G.M. IMF Econ Rev (2018) 66: 189. https://doi.org/10.1057/s41308-017-0048-y.
4The classical ‘trilemma’ of international macroeconomics has been called into question. According to this ‘trilemma’, to preserve monetary autonomy, more open capital accounts require more flexible exchange rates. In a well-known paper presented at Jackson Hole in 2013, Hélène Rey contested the validity of the ‘trilemma’.2 She argued that the existence of a global financial cycle, essentially driven by US monetary policy due to the dominance of the US dollar in the international monetary and financial system, has increasingly undermined the usefulness of flexible exchange rates for insulating an economy from external shocks. On the contrary, the financial implications of exchange rate changes may well dominate their real implications, so that exchange rate movements may even exacerbate spillovers (I shall come back to this issue later). According to the ‘dilemma’ view, the only way out is to resort to the management of capital flows, either through explicit controls or by means of macroprudential measures aimed at reducing boom and bust cycles of asset prices. The debate is still very much alive today; indeed, this was one of the key topics at the 2019 Jackson Hole Economic Symposium.3 The question then is which domestic policies and country fundamentals still matter, and how they can be used to tame the impact of volatile capital flows. On the one hand, the empirical literature has provided some evidence that capital controls, in combination with macroprudential regulations, can be effective in reducing the volatility of capital flows.4 Furthermore, studies have found that capital inflows tend to be both larger and more stable in countries with sounder financial systems and better institutions.5 On the other hand, recent research,6 including some conducted by staff at the Bank of Italy,7 has found that, in a more financially interconnected world, exchange rate flexibility helps in mitigating monetary and financial spillovers to EMEs, but it does not provide full insulation. This is true not only for small countries with weak economic fundamentals, but also for advanced economies and large monetary regions. 2 H.

5The euro area: a dual roleTurning to the euro area, let me focus briefly on the international transmission mechanism of monetary policy.Despite being a large economic area, the euro zone is not immune to international spillovers. The relative importance of global versus local shocks is increasing as globalisation and financial markets’ integration advances. US monetary policy, the key driver of the global financial cycle, also influences euro-area financing conditions.At the same time, given that the euro is the second most important currency in the international monetary system, the ECB’s monetary policy is itself potentially a source of spillovers (Fig. 2). In recent years, extraordinary monetary stimulus has also been provided through unconventional monetary policy measures; international spillovers have been sizeable.Traditionally, monetary policy is thought to have cross-border effects mainly through the implied exchange-rate movements. Recent experience, however, has shown that the monetary policy international transmission mechanism may have several dimensions. The international environment is now much more deeply integrated; portfolio substitution by global asset managers acts as a powerful additional mechanism for transmitting financial shocks across monetary areas. Moreover, with policy rates close to their effective lower bound and the Eurosystem’s balance sheet greatly expanded, the entire macro-financial environment has been transformed. Accordingly, the theoretical framework to study the international transmission of the ECB monetary policy stance has been enriched to take into account the role of the increased global integration of financial markets and the distinctive traits of non-standard measures. Unconventional monetary policy can have significant effects abroad through two relatively new channels. The first is the so-called portfolio rebalancing channel of asset purchase programs, which is likely to impact financial conditions beyond currency area boundaries to the extent that domestic and foreign long-term bonds are substitutes. The second channel – the international bank lending channel – is likely to be even more important across the Mediterranean. The ECB’s accommodative monetary measures, especially those aimed at making credit more 
6abundant, can spur the growth of euro-denominated loans outside the euro area, especially in economies with a significant presence of euro-area based banks.Implications for the Southern Mediterranean countries The issue is quite important for Southern Mediterranean countries. In fact, while capital controls are still stringent in many of them (Fig. 3), the region has become increasingly integrated into global financial markets. Gross external financing needs have grown fast, with few exceptions, and for some countries lie above the emerging and developing countries’ average (Fig. 4).Capital flows to the Southern Mediterranean countries have been quite resilient overall since the global financial crisis and the so called ‘taper-tantrum’ episode in 2013 (Fig. 5), helping to finance ‘twin’ (current account and fiscal) deficits in those countries (Tab. 1).However, the more volatile components of capital inflows (portfolio and banking flows) have become larger than foreign direct investment (FDI). A sizeable share of these inflows has gone to financing the government sector’s large fiscal deficits (Egypt, Lebanon, Jordan). At the same time, the reduction of FDI inflows in the region may also reflect weak fundamentals (feeble growth prospects and policy uncertainty, as well as geopolitical tensions). Portfolio and banking flows are notoriously more volatile than FDI flows, as they are more sensitive to global push factors, such as global risk aversion and real interest rates in core countries, exposing recipient countries to sudden stops. A recent study conducted by the IMF shows that portfolio inflows to the Middle East and North Africa are almost twice as sensitive to changes in global uncertainty as those to other countries.8  Another worrisome feature concerns the currency composition of debt flows. Foreign currency debt has expanded rapidly in many countries over the past decade (Tab. 2), making the financial channel of the exchange rate especially important. For countries with sizeable net foreign currency liabilities, this channel will have 8 IMF, ‘Regional Economic Outlook: Middle East and Central Asia’, October 2019.
7the opposite sign to the traditional trade channel and may more than fully offset it (i.e. a devaluation can be contractionary). Moreover, for many countries in the region trade integration is primarily with the euro area (Tab. 4) while exchange rates are mainly anchored to the US dollar (with the exception of Tunisia; Tab. 5). This creates potential currency mismatches, especially if export proceeds are mainly euro-denominated while debt obligations are in US dollars. Policy implicationsGiven the interdependencies across the Mediterranean countries that I have just described and the ongoing integration with the euro area, it is natural to ask: how should policies be designed in order to promote sustainable capital flows in the Mediterranean area? The issue of how to deal with undesired spillovers from policies conducted in the euro area and in the US remains a controversial one. I would like to use the remainder of my time to discuss this question from three perspectives: that of the country (or area) generating the spillover effects (‘originating country’), that of the country impacted and, finally, the multilateral approach.Should the central banks in originating countries internalise the spillovers of their monetary policy to the rest of the world? The textbook answer to that question is that central banks pursue domestically-focused mandates: thus, they take into account the adverse effects of volatile capital flows only insofar as they negatively affect global financial stability, and through this channel may generate spillback effects to their domestic economy. Both conceptually and empirically, the measurement of these spillbacks is very challenging as they depend in part on the policy response of the countries affected. However, central banks can limit adverse monetary policy spillovers, notably through transparency and clear communication of their monetary policy decisions and intentions. The 2013 ‘taper tantrum’ episode exemplifies the potentially destabilising effects of policy communication mishaps. In addition, central banks can contribute to the resilience and soundness of their own financial systems with monetary policies designed to support economic activity and with macroprudential policies, as well as in their capacity as financial supervisors where 
8they have such responsibility. This, in turn, contributes to global financial stability, with favourable spillovers to the rest of the world.From the perspective of the countries affected, the question is how can they shield their economies and financial systems from adverse spillovers? Experience shows that having strong domestic fundamentals and sound policy frameworks is essential. This usually includes sustainable budgetary positions; a business environment capable of stimulating investment and attracting FDI; a policy framework that ensures effective regulation and supervision of the financial sector; and the monitoring of private and public debt in foreign currency. Deep and developed domestic financial markets are a necessary condition for building up resilience to external shocks. The consensus nowadays is that exchange rate  flexibility might help, but it is no silver bullet. Economies need to have good fundamentals and a comprehensive set of policy tools, including macroprudential and capital management measures, to protect themselves adequately from adverse spillovers.Finally, from a multilateral perspective, it seems that the interdependencies between the policies of both the originator and destination countries call for enhanced cooperation. While formal monetary policy coordination would not be feasible in view of central bank mandates, there is scope for enhancing multilateral efforts to deal with adverse spillovers. Having a platform for the exchange of views is extremely valuable in this regard. I am thinking about this high-level policy dialogue between the Eurosystem and the Mediterranean countries’ central banks. I believe that this is the right forum in which these issues can be framed and discussed on a regular basis.By sharing information and views on the global and domestic economic outlook and on the frameworks within which policy decisions are taken, central banks of the Eurosystem and the Southern and Eastern Mediterranean Countries can develop a better understanding of the respective monetary policies. Enhanced transparency makes policy actions more predictable  and facilitates discussions on the mix of policy options to anticipate and address risks in the countries affected.

   A Perspective on the Future of Asia Remarks at the Asia Pacific Initiative Forum in Yokohama Bank of Japan December 8, 2019   Haruhiko Kuroda Governor of the Bank of Japan 
 1  Introduction Good morning Ladies and Gentlemen. It is my great pleasure to join you today at the inaugural meeting of the Asia Pacific Initiative Forum. I am confident that this forum will develop into a central platform where Asian business leaders and policy makers can gather to share insights, forge new partnerships and develop new innovative ideas to tackle global as well as intraregional challenges.  Today, I would like to touch upon some characteristics and future challenges for Asia from a macro perspective. My speech will be based on my experience serving as Vice Minister for International Affairs at the Ministry of Finance in Japan, President of the Asian Development Bank and Governor of the Bank of Japan.  I. An Asian Century I would like to begin by first trying to put the word "Asia" into context. Looking into the etymology of "Asia," one explanation is that it comes from the Akkadian word asu, which means "to go out, to rise," in reference to the sun, thus "the land of the sunrise."1 So a couple of thousand years back, all people or cultures originating from the east were collectively classified into a single category of "Asians" or "Asia." However, the actual diversity of ethnicity, religion and culture across Asia is immense compared with other regions of the world. For example, the number of Asian sovereign states that are members of the United Nations is 48, and there are more than 10 different official languages used in multiple sovereign states. There are also vast differences in the stage of development of Asian states, as the largest country in terms of per capita GDP on a purchasing power parity basis is more than 7 times as large as the smallest one in the region.2  While it is difficult to generalize about Asia, the expression "the Asian Century" is used quite frequently. The phrase expresses Asia's growing global presence, and is used similarly to terms such as the "Pacific" or the "Chinese" century, and also to terms such as the "East Asian miracle" or "Asia's rise."                                                           1 Etymonline.com., "Asia – Origin and meaning of Asia by online Etymology Dictionary." Retrieved November 24, 2019. 2 U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, "The World Factbook," 2018. 
 2  At the same time, the term "Asian Century" evokes a historical narrative of shifting centers of world power such as from Great Britain in the 19th century to the United States in the 20th century. Back in 1904, Halford Mackinder, an English geographer, academic and politician wrote "The Geographical Pivot of History," in which he forecast that the 20th century was going to be the Asian Century. His forecast turned out to be incorrect. However, many envision the 21st century as an Asian century, given the expansion of the Asian economy and the growth of its population. Kishore Mahbubani, a Singaporean academic and former diplomat has argued that the last two centuries of Western domination of world history have actually been an anomaly from history. In the period from A.D. 1 to 1820, the two largest economies of the world were those of China and India.3 More recent data on the economic presence of Asia is shown in Chart 1.  II. Current State of Asia Before I proceed, let me briefly mention some recent facts regarding Asia. Asia has led global growth for the past several decades, and as of 2018, accounts for more than 40% of global GDP.4  The region is home to around 60% of the world’s total population. The share of intraregional trade has been increasing and accounts for 58% of the total trade of all the region's countries. Financial interconnectedness is also deepening. These characteristics are shown in Chart 2.  Regional policy cooperation is taking place through various platforms. ASEAN is the center of regional economic integration in South East Asia, and the scope of its cooperation has widened with the involvement of other countries to form ASEAN+3 and ASEAN+6, and even beyond Asia through arrangements such as APEC. Many Asian countries are members of G20 and their contribution to global policy making is increasing. In the area of central bank cooperation, regional forums such as EMEAP and SEACEN are enhancing the active exchange of views and the sharing of knowledge among members.  The movement of people across borders is becoming much more active as regional integration deepens. This is also reflected, for example, in the regionalization of the media and popular                                                         3 Schibotto, Emanuele, and Gabriele Giovannini, "Singapore's Role in the Asian Century – interview with Kishore Mahbubani," Asian Century Institute, February 12, 2015. 4 International Monetary Fund, "IMF Data Mapper, World Economic Outlook October 2019 (GDP)."  
 3  culture. There is a long-established network of production, distribution and consumption of Chinese-language pop music, opera and films within the Chinese community all around Asia. In the 1990s, Japanese television dramas became a staple of audiences across East Asia. This success encouraged the Korean television industry to actively export its own dramas regionally. These developments have resulted in a loosely integrated regional media and cultural industry in East Asia which has also helped promote intra-Asian tourism and cultural exchange.  III. Asia as Future With the increasing interconnectedness of the region and its growing economic presence, it is not surprising that there are expectations that Asia can and will lead the world. But simply extrapolating from the strong economic performance of recent decades can be misleading. As we well know, economic size alone is not enough to be accepted as a global leader. Looking back at history after World War II and how the major powers have evolved, it clearly shows that it is not just about brute economic or military power. A combination of vision, moral values and respect toward others are also essential.  What do we have to do in Asia to truly harness the potential of this vast and complex region, so that Asia can play an active role at the global stage? Asian countries will need to work further to deepen intraregional collaboration based on mutual recognition and respect while acknowledging the diverse nature of this region. Specifically, further deepening of economic regional interconnectedness will certainly be necessary. Also, a broader perspective to increase joint engagement in the global community on non-economic issues will be important. I would like to touch upon them separately. Enhancing Regional Integration If Asia is to take on a global leadership role, this would require the promotion and maintenance of open and flexible economies and markets. The strengthening of Asian supply chains would also be essential for enhancement of economic interconnectedness. Much has already been achieved on economic integration. For example, in ASEAN, there has been progress in eliminating tariffs, advancing services liberalization, liberalizing and facilitating investment and facilitating skilled labor mobility. However, as shown in Chart 3, compared to Europe, Asia has a lower participation rate in global supply chains. Promoting trade 
 4  liberalization through frameworks such as TPP11 and RCEP would be the way forward, especially in an environment where global trade tensions are high. It is important to promote trade not only in goods but also in services. The region is steadily transitioning from being mainly a production area of the world to the biggest corporate and consumer market in the world. This naturally increases the demand for services in the region as well.  Equally important is coordination on cross-border regulatory and institutional elements within the region. Discussions in ASEAN's Economic Community Blueprint 20255  could provide hints on how to address such cross-border issues. For example, the business community has in the past raised issues regarding the differing requirements and regulations among ASEAN countries with incomplete mutual recognition agreements, and the burdensome processes and inadequate transparency in some member countries. Although substantial progress has been made, differences among members remain in terms of ease of doing business and trading across borders. These challenges are noted in other Asian countries as well. While the EU has been aiming for economic integration through the establishment of a single market, Asian countries, such as the members of ASEAN, have preferred to preserve each country's sovereignty. This is certainly appropriate, reflecting the region's diversity. Having said that, as regional economies become more dependent on each other, more work is necessary to reduce barriers to free trade of goods and services and for direct investment. This would boost intraregional demand as a source of growth. It is also essential to work jointly in developing deep and liquid financial markets to enhance the effective use of regional savings and to invite long-term capital inflows.   As a basis for further strengthening such economic ties, it is also important to patiently strive to deepen fundamental mutual understanding among countries and people in the region. As I mentioned earlier, Asian countries are highly diverse not only in economic aspects such as income, industrial structure and technological progress, but also in many other fields such as religion and culture. For this reason, it is important to foster a stronger sense of trust while respecting each other's unique characteristics.                                                          5 ASEAN's Economic Community (AEC) Blueprint 2025 enlists concrete actions to be taken by 2025 in order to realize the AEC envisaged in ASEAN's Community Vision 2025. 
 5  Engaging with the Global Community Asia must also actively engage in global discussions beyond pure economic issues. For example, according to research by a consulting firm comparing the soft power of different countries, only four countries from Asia are in the top 30,6 as shown in Chart 4.  With around 60% of the global population, Asia has a responsibility to play a constructive role in global issues such as climate change and inequality. Through effective dialogue, ideas and values originating in Asia could provide a positive impetus to the global debate. From this perspective, it is important to continue to actively participate in international discussions and to raise Asian voices through frameworks such as the G20.  As I mentioned, climate change is an area that requires Asia's active contribution. Addressing climate change risk requires a global effort. But, as a region that would be greatly affected by increases in natural disasters, rising sea levels, and damage to agricultural and fishery industry, this is a much more urgent issue for Asia. At the same time, in step with economic growth, carbon dioxide emissions in Asia have increased rapidly, and counted for more than half of total global emissions in 2017.7 It is important to collaborate within the region and with the global community, by for example actively encouraging the introduction and sharing of environment-friendly technologies.  How to take advantage of digital transformation is another area that Asia could play a leading role in the global discussion. Many Asian countries including China, India and Japan are key innovators and manufacturers of digital technology. If countries in the region can coordinate their digital supply chains, the synergies would be significant. From another perspective, most Asian countries face intractable demographic dilemmas. In much of East Asia, fertility has dropped below replacement rates, populations are aging, and workforces declining. Labor-saving technology can help mitigate this demographic challenge and should improve the productivity of East Asian countries.   Conclusion Let me conclude. The globalization that led the development of the global economy after                                                         6 Portland, "The Soft Power 30," 2019. 7 Global Carbon Project, "Global Carbon Budget 2018." 
 6  World War II has slowed recently. Countries have become more inward oriented, and this change has become a major headwind for cross-border financial and economic activities. On the other hand, multilateral efforts are indispensable in tackling many issues ranging from trade to climate change.  Asia is one of the regions that has benefited most from post-war financial and economic globalization. In this age of uncertainty, the search for a new "global order" continues. This brings both challenges and opportunities for the Asian region, and expectations for the region to contribute to the global debate are high. To that end, it is important for Asia to promote further intraregional collaboration based on mutual understanding and respect. Strengthening the bond within Asia will enable the region to contribute to solving global issues. Based on my many years of working with colleagues in Asia, I am confident that the Asian Century will certainly come.  Thank you for your kind attention.  
  Financial Integration and Inclusive Development:  A view from the Mediterranean countries    Central banks, financial inclusion and digitization: Harnessing technology for inclusive growth    Intervention of Mr. Abdellatif Jouahri  Governor of Bank Al-Maghrib      Madrid, December 13, 2019  
2 Governor of the Banco de Espana, President of the European Institute of the Mediterranean, Deputy Secretary General of the Union for the Mediterranean, Dear friends and colleagues Ladies and Gentlemen,  First of all, I would like to thank the organizers, particularly the Governor of the Bank of Spain, Mr. Pablo Hernandez de Cos, and the President of the Executive Committee of the IEMed, Mr. Senén Florensa, for inviting me to participate in this conference.  Taking part in the Mediterranean meetings organized by the Bank of Spain has become, for me, a tradition to be preserved, all the more since we are united by a cooperation agreement.  It is also my pleasure to speak alongside panelists, both colleagues and friends, on a topic of particular interest to us from each side of the Mediterranean. Inclusive development issues have been one of the key concerns for Moroccan public authorities for several years now. With regard to financial inclusion in particular, which engages us as a central bank, we have, together with the Ministry of Finance and stakeholders, just finalized and started implementing a national financial inclusion strategy, whose preparation has progressed for a few years now. Thus, in 2013, we set up the Moroccan Foundation for Financial Education, and introduced, in the 2014 Banking Law, payment institutions with a scope of activity limited to small-value transactions. As a result, several stakeholders 
3 took various and disparate initiatives, which prompted us to federate them to develop a National Financial Inclusion Strategy. To this end, we proceeded from a situation analysis based on objective supply and demand data, which were collected through field surveys, mainly the Findex survey conducted by the World Bank in several countries.    The paradoxical finding which emerged is that, based on indicators such as credit or deposit-to-GDP ratios or the FSAP assessment, Morocco’s financial system proves to be deep if compared internationally, but suffers from significant inequalities in terms of access. To give you some figures, the share of adults holding an account is estimated by the Findex survey at 34 percent at the national level. This proportion ranges from 20 percent in rural areas to 37 percent for urban dwellers, from 17 percent for women to 41 percent for men and from 16 percent for young people under 25 to 33 percent for those aged 25 and over.  Based on these data, it became clear that priority should be given to targeting the most disadvantaged groups in order to reduce the gaps. Besides, as Fintech was experiencing significant growth and was becoming a promising lever, the first measure to undertake was to introduce mobile payment, considering the high mobile phone penetration rate, which reaches 130 percent and allows coverage of almost the whole population. To this end, we have developed, together with the National Telecommunications Regulatory Agency, a national low-cost, secure, interoperable and real-time mobile payment solution. This offer is to be provided not only by banks and telecom operators, but also by payment institutions which formed an alternative network, and which we had begun to license based on strict specifications. 
4 However, the adherence of retail merchants, necessary for a large-scale deployment of this solution, is still low, as that many of them still operate in the informal sector. Subsequently, we were prompted to collaborate with the Ministry of Finance in order to introduce tax incentives in the 2020 Finance Act. Today, we are rather optimistic. These incentives, combined with communication and awareness-raising efforts, will hopefully give a new impetus to this solution and contribute to a greater integration into the formal economy and to a reduced use of cash. Mobile payment has undoubtedly been one of the main levers of financial inclusion in Morocco, but certainly not the only one. We have also strived towards turning microfinance and micro insurance into channels of inclusion. To this end, the applicable amending legal texts have been finalized and are in the process of being approved. At the same time, we continued strengthening and expanding financial education work, bringing together all national stakeholders around the Foundation and drawing on international best practices. More particularly, we worked with the ILO and AFI to develop educational packages, and organized several instructor-training sessions for various professional categories. In this same vein of association and cooperation, we are trying to bring together all stakeholders to reflect on the methods for implementing the Bali Fintech Agenda. In this regard, Bank Al-Maghrib co-organized, last March, a regional conference with the IMF and plans to hold a second one in 2021.  Similarly, our institution held, last November, the Africa Blockchain Summit, meant to share experiences between African countries, stimulate innovation and encourage startups. We hope to take advantage of the latter’s innovations for our own benefit and for the benefit of our ecosystem. The selected 
5 startups have indeed come up with promising solutions to strengthen financial inclusion. That being said, such digital revolution, as we all know, is not only about opportunities, but also about risks and challenges, namely in terms of cybercrime, money laundering and terrorist financing, and personal data protection, etc. This highlights, once again, the need for appropriate regulation. In the banking sector, we, as a central bank, are striving for more agile and appropriate regulation, while offering support to the new actors and ensuring their supervision.   With respect to the fight against money laundering and terrorist financing, the recent MENA-FATF assessment highlighted some shortcomings among financial inclusion non-bank actors. Hence, a compliance program was set up by the authorities with the aim of remedying this situation in the medium term. As regards personal data protection, Morocco has ratified the 108th Convention of the Council of Europe and its Additional Protocol. Since then, it set up a national control unit to ensure proper observation of the various rights (of information, access, rectification and opposition). In this respect, the central bank plays an important role as an interface between this unit and financial inclusion stakeholders. However, this legal framework is likely to evolve in view of the regulatory progress made in this area, particularly at the European Union level. With regard to cyber security risks, Morocco is moving towards developing a strategy for the security of information systems, which would be based on 
6 risk identification to provide specific legal, technical and awareness-raising measures to ensure protection, defense and security. This project is coordinated by the National Defense Administration and the Central Bank also acts as an interface with financial actors. All these developments, particularly the introduction of new actors in the implementation of the national financial inclusion strategy, will have a significant impact on banks' profitability and will put their traditional business models to the test. While these banks may be hampered by their complex architecture and cumbersome organization, the rapid unbundling of banking services to the benefit of non-banking fintechs could result in a substantial loss in their market share. Under these conditions, and taking advantage of technological contributions, many banks have embarked on strategies to develop their services and to diversify their distribution channels. In this respect, a study carried out by Bank Al-Maghrib in 2019 reveals that most banks have concluded contracts with technology start-ups in the form of equity investments and partnerships. However, it should be stressed that this problem is not specific to Morocco, but is more global. Ultimately, the result is a healthy competition that develops and results in improved quality of services, faster transaction execution and lower costs, all to the benefit of the consumer. To sum up, let me say that Morocco has entered a new era in the field of financial inclusion. Attaining the objectives set out in this respect requires effective organization and regular monitoring. As such, Bank Al-Maghrib set up two new structures, dedicated to financial inclusion and to digital 
7 transformation, with a five-year roadmap which takes into account our needs both as a company and as a regulator.  I have no doubt that this issue of financial inclusion has challenged each of our countries represented here, with specific levels of prioritization and implementation methods. However, regardless of the context, the success of such a project requires significant resources, not just financial, but also and primarily human ones. On the southern side of the Mediterranean, important efforts are being undertaken in this direction. However, I would like to underline that the attractiveness exerted by advanced countries on our graduates and our specialized profiles is making our task even more complex, especially in recent years. At Bank Al-Maghrib, for example, we lost about 20 computer engineers in just 18 months. I think that this point also deserves to be discussed and debated at meetings such as this one. Thank you!

 1 I. Economic Activity at Home and Abroad A. Recent Developments in Overseas Economies Let me start with developments in overseas economies.  The global economy has continued to grow moderately, but the pace of growth has been decelerating since the start of 2019. According to the October 2019 World Economic Outlook released by the International Monetary Fund, the global growth rate for 2019 is projected to be 3.0 percent, a lower rate compared to 3.8 percent for 2017 and 3.6 percent for 2018 (Chart 1). The continued deceleration is mainly due to a significant slowdown and stagnation in world trade volume caused by the intensified U.S.-China trade conflict. This has exerted downward pressure on the Chinese economy, which is one of the hubs of global supply chains, and its effects are spreading across the global economy, including Japan.  Looking at developments by region, the U.S. economy has expanded moderately, albeit at a somewhat slower pace. No significant problems have been observed in U.S. economic fundamentals, with solid consumption sustained amid the historically low unemployment rate, and an increase in housing investment mainly due to lower interest rates. The European economy has been in low growth, partly reflecting the effects of the economic slowdown in China, one of the euro area's main trading partners, in addition to confusion over the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union. Emerging economies have shown mixed movements, but in Asian countries -- where economic ties with China are deep -- global trade issues have affected production and exerted downward pressure on growth in these economies. Given the ongoing U.S.-China trade conflict and heightened geopolitical risks worldwide, it is unlikely that uncertainties regarding the outlook for the global economy will be dispelled soon.  Some of these regions are proceeding with policy actions amid growing concerns over the outlook for the global economy. For example, additional easing measures have already been implemented in the United States and Europe, and economic stimulus measures have been taken in China. These policy actions have been effective in underpinning economic activity to a certain extent; however, they are not strong enough to outweigh the impact of the U.S.-China trade conflict, which has been more extensive and prolonged than initially anticipated. 
 2 B. Outlook for Overseas Economies Concerns remain that overseas economies may decelerate even further due to the impact of the intensified and prolonged U.S.-China trade conflict. However, there are potential upside risks as well. For example, economic measures implemented so far may show a greater influence in the first half of 2020 than initially anticipated, and the reorganization of supply chains in response to the trade conflict may accelerate. As I have already mentioned, the current slowdown in global economic growth has been mainly induced by the significant slowdown in world trade volume. Moreover, there is a marked contrast between the manufacturing and nonmanufacturing sectors: while production and exports continue to slow mainly in the manufacturing sector, the nonmanufacturing sector has been maintaining moderate expansion. It seems that the resilience in the nonmanufacturing sector, which accounts for a large share of the global economy, has been underpinning global economic growth.  C. Recent Developments in Japan's Economy Next, I will talk about developments in Japan's economy.  Japan's exports and production continue to show some weakness, mainly in the manufacturing sector, having been affected by the slowdown in overseas economies, particularly China (Chart 2). On the other hand, domestic demand has continued to expand moderately. Business fixed investment has continued to see firm growth, mainly in the nonmanufacturing sector, and private consumption has been increasing moderately, with the employment and income situation improving. Moreover, public investment has recently begun to expand. Developments in the economy from late 2018 show that firm domestic demand has continued to more than offset relatively weak external demand, and the real GDP growth rate registered positive growth for four consecutive quarters (Chart 3). The output gap has also remained positive. Given these developments, it can be assessed that a virtuous cycle from income to spending has continued to operate. Nonetheless, the effects on Japan's economy of developments in the global economy and of the October 2019 consumption tax hike need to be carefully examined for the time being.  
 3 I will elaborate on recent developments in Japan's economy from two aspects, the demand side and the supply side. On the demand side, there is little prospect of a rapid recovery in exports, as the slowdown in overseas economies is expected to continue for the time being. Meanwhile, the moderate increase in domestic demand is likely to be sustainable, as private consumption, business fixed investment, public investment and other sectors have been resilient.  Looking at developments by demand component, private consumption has continued to increase moderately, albeit with fluctuations mainly resulting from weather conditions. This increase has been supported by solid employee income reflecting the increased labor force participation particularly of women and seniors (Chart 4). As for business fixed investment, there has been an increase in not only software investment aimed at saving labor but also investment intended for domestic capacity expansion as well as research and development (R&D) investment with an eye toward future growth (Chart 5). This mainly reflects the fact that Japan's GDP has continued to grow at a pace above its potential, albeit moderately, and the need to meet rapidly increasing inbound demand. Looking at business fixed investment in detail by industry, the share of the nonmanufacturing sector has reached around 70 percent recently. There is some possibility that the adverse impact on Japan's business fixed investment of the slowdown in overseas economies will be limited, underpinned by business fixed investment related to resilient domestic demand. Turning to public investment, investments associated with disaster-related restoration and reconstruction as well as with national resilience have begun to increase and are expected to compensate for a peak-out of demand for construction related to the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games (Chart 6).  Next, I will turn to developments on the supply side. It is important that business fixed investment -- which has been expanding continuously -- positively affects not only demand but also supply, in terms of the enhancement of production capacity. Particularly in industries facing labor shortages, there has been active business fixed investment with the aim of improving labor productivity. This has been raising capital intensity, or capital per worker. While such active investment among some industries acts to induce price rises by raising the potential growth rate, the increase in productivity seems to have been acting as a factor 
 4 constraining upward pressure on prices by easing upward pressure on wages. I will come back to this point later.  D. Outlook for Japan's Economy With regard to the outlook for Japan's economy going forward, economic developments warrant cautious monitoring over the next six months or so, as the consumption tax hike conducted in October is expected to have an impact in the short term -- although its effects seem smaller than those of the previous hike in April 2014 -- and the transition of the global economy to a moderate recovery path is unlikely to take place until around mid-2020.  Under these circumstances, the pace of Japan's moderate economic growth may decelerate in the short term. At the same time, however, such deceleration is unlikely to continue in the medium to long term. This is because, owing to the continuation of monetary easing over the past seven years, there has been significant improvement in the employment situation, prolonged labor shortages have encouraged firms to change their behavior, and a virtuous economic cycle has been operating by means of an increasing trend in business fixed investment. Moreover, with steady business fixed investment in the nonmanufacturing sector, which accounts for a large proportion of such investment, there has been a steady increase in the robustness of Japan's economy to external shock, namely the slowdown in overseas economies. For the time being, it is important to carefully examine developments in the global economy and their effects on Japan's economy. Nevertheless, we should not be overly pessimistic about the outlook. Given that the pace of decline in the working-age population (those aged 15-64) will continue to exceed that in the total population for the time being, labor market conditions are likely to remain tight. In this situation, expansion in business fixed investment -- particularly that intended to address labor shortages -- and firm private consumption are highly likely to be sustained (Chart 7).  According to the Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices released by the Bank of Japan in October 2019, the medians of the Policy Board members' forecasts for the real GDP growth rate are 0.6 percent for fiscal 2019, 0.7 percent for fiscal 2020, and 1.0 percent for fiscal 2021 (Chart 8).  
 5 II. Prices A. Recent Price Developments and Their Background Next, I will turn to price developments.  The year-on-year rate of increase in Japan's consumer price index (CPI) for all items less fresh food has continued to rise moderately within the range of 0.0-0.5 percent (Chart 9). The year-on-year increase has been in positive territory for three years, affirming the improved robustness of the economy to the possibility of falling back into deflation. However, we have not yet reached a situation where the inflation rate is further accelerating and approaching close to the 2 percent price stability target. Gradual changes in Japan's inflation mechanism in recent years may account for this situation, in which the economy is no longer in deflation but is not seeing an acceleration in inflation.  Three factors in Japan's current inflation mechanism are relevant in this context: one factor is exerting upward pressure on prices, namely, the continuing positive output gap; while the other two factors are constraining inflation, specifically, the persistent deflationary mindset of the public and improvements in labor productivity.   First, the output gap -- the factor exerting upward pressure on prices -- has remained consistently positive since the October-December quarter of 2016. In fact, the inflation rate and the output gap have been running in parallel with each other, with a certain time lag. This correlation indicates that the positive output gap has been acting as a factor placing upward pressure on prices.  Let me turn to the two factors constraining inflation. As for the first factor -- namely, the persistent deflationary mindset -- this cost-saving mentality has become deeply entrenched among consumers due to their experience of prolonged deflation, and has been influencing the cautious price-setting stance of Japanese firms. In the formation of inflation expectations, the backward-looking expectation that reflects past inflation rates -- that is, the adaptive formation mechanism -- is more prominent in Japan than the forward-looking expectation that reflects future economic conditions and changes in policy measures. This accounts for the persistent deflationary mindset. 
 6 Another factor constraining inflation relates to improvements in labor productivity, effects of which have been observed since around 2017. While the labor market is close to full employment, upward pressure on wages has not particularly increased. This is partly due to the fact that there was room for restraining wage increases as the labor force participation rate rose in parallel with the intensification of labor shortages; moreover, it is worth noting that, with the anticipation of longstanding labor shortages, firms embarked on labor-saving investments, which in turn resulted in improvements in labor productivity. From the viewpoint of the output gap, a further widening of the gap within positive territory has been avoided by reducing labor input. Improvements in labor productivity have prevented firms from passing increased costs, such as personnel expenses and raw material costs, on to sales prices (Chart 10). In other words, improvements in labor productivity have constrained inflation through the expansion in business fixed investment.  B. Outlook As the inflation mechanism has become more complex, it is not easy to forecast the outlook for prices. First, a positive inflation rate is necessary to overcome the persistent deflationary mindset grounded in the adaptive formation mechanism. Assuming that the output gap remains positive, the key will be predicting the outlook for the remaining factor -- namely, the constraining effects on inflation due to improvements in labor productivity. The rise in labor productivity promoting changes in the economic structure should be taken into account when considering the outlook. That is to say, changes on the supply side not only act as a factor constraining inflation but also raise the growth potential of the economy.  With heightened uncertainty over the outlook for the global economy, the immediate challenge for Japan's economy is to sustain the positive output gap and prevent any halt to the changes in the economic structure that have begun to progress, by maintaining moderate growth supported by steady domestic demand. If these immediate challenges are met appropriately, we should anticipate -- while keeping the economy free of deflation -- a moderate acceleration in the inflation rate when the labor force participation rate eventually stops rising and encourages real wage increases to catch up with the pace of growth in productivity.  
 7 Risks to the outlook for prices also warrant vigilance. If the slowdown in overseas economies continues for longer than anticipated, and the output gap reverses back into negative territory, Japan's economy may face deflation again. As for now, given that the positive output gap is being maintained on the back of steady domestic demand, the Bank should spare no effort in preparing for circumstances where additional policy actions may be necessary, while carefully examining future economic developments both at home and abroad. In order to maintain the inflation momentum, it is important to be fully prepared for the global economy to recover.  III. Monetary Policy A. Current Monetary Easing Policy and Its Basic Framework The basic framework for the Bank's current monetary easing policy introduced in September 2016 is Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) with Yield Curve Control. Under this framework, with the aim of achieving the price stability target under yield curve control -- in which short- and long-term interest rates are controlled -- the Bank sets the short-term policy interest rate at minus 0.1 percent and the target level for 10-year Japanese government bond (JGB) yields at around 0 percent. It also purchases JGBs to facilitate the formation of these interest rates consistent with yield curve control. Subsequently, in July 2018, the Bank introduced forward guidance, and in April 2019, decided on a set of policy measures, including expanding eligible collateral for its provision of credit, to enhance the sustainability of the monetary easing policy. Furthermore, at the most recent Monetary Policy Meeting held in October 2019, the Bank revised its forward guidance with a view to clarifying the need to continue examining the momentum toward achieving the price stability target.  Alongside the implementation of these policy measures, the Bank continues with large-scale monetary easing. In carrying out its policy, I believe it is essential for the Bank to be committed to continuing with monetary easing by examining matters from a broad perspective, including developments in financial markets and the financial system as well as economic activity and prices, while carefully considering the balance between the positive effects and the side effects of continuing monetary easing.  
 8 B. Future Conduct of Monetary Policy The Bank is committed to continuing with the current powerful monetary easing. Let me raise the following as points requiring particular attention in the future conduct of monetary policy: (1) the effects on Japan's economy of the slowdown in the global economy; (2) the balance between the positive effects and the side effects of continuing monetary easing; and (3) the conduct of monetary policy amid changes in the economic structure and in the inflation mechanism.  The first point warrants considerable attention currently in predicting the outlook for Japan's economic activity. If overseas economies slow further and negative effects on Japan's economic activity materialize, it may become necessary to take policy actions. In this case, it will be important that such actions should be decided after examining the scale of the negative effects and how fast they spread.  For example, if the economy faces a crisis, such as that which could threaten the financial system during the global financial crisis, this will lead to a rapid economic downturn through credit contraction. Therefore, decisive actions would be necessary. On the other hand, if the slowdown in overseas economies stemming from trade issues remains moderate, the speed with which it spreads to Japan's economy will also be moderate. Thus, there will be room to take policy actions after carefully examining developments in economic indicators. The issue of side effects is another reason why policymakers should refrain from taking hasty policy actions in the conduct of future monetary policy.  Regarding the second point, namely the balance between the positive effects and the side effects of continuing monetary easing, it is becoming increasingly necessary to pay attention to the side effects on the financial system of continuing with the low interest rate policy. With limited demand for funds among firms, financial institutions' lending margins have been narrowing due mainly to the prolonged low interest rate environment (Chart 11). These institutions are increasing their amount of risk-taking in order to acquire profits. However, due to globally accommodative financial conditions, the number of borrowers or entities in which financial institutions can invest to secure profits commensurate with their risk-taking 
 9 is limited, and the possibility is increasing that risks will materialize and financial institutions' capital adequacy ratios plunge in the event of an economic downturn.   At the moment, the capital adequacy ratios of all types of financial institutions in Japan appear to be sufficient relative to the levels of regulatory requirements. Nevertheless, as the ratios have been on a declining trend, mainly those of regional financial institutions, it is becoming necessary to monitor more closely with the continuation of monetary easing. The Bank will examine risks in the financial system through various means, such as the Financial System Report, as well as on-site examinations and off-site monitoring, and when necessary, encourage financial institutions to address these risks. It will also open dialogue with a wide range of relevant parties, including the Bank's Center for Advanced Financial Technology, to help resolve the challenges facing financial institutions. As for the conduct of monetary policy, it is important for the Bank to make policy decisions in an appropriate manner while carefully examining the side effects of policy measures on the financial system.  Lastly, as for the third point, the relationship between monetary policy and prices is no longer straightforward, as seen, for example, in an improvement in labor productivity accompanying labor-saving investment constraining inflation. As a result, uncertainty in this context is likely to remain high. In what follows, I would like to provide a somewhat detailed explanation of such changes in the economic structure and appropriate monetary policy in response to these changes.  IV. Structural Changes in Japan's Economy and the Role of Monetary Policy I will now describe the structural changes in Japan's economy and the points that have recently come to require attention.  Supported by a policy mix of monetary and fiscal policies that has been sustained over the past seven years, there have been slow but steady structural changes in the economy. These can be largely divided into changes in the industrial structure accompanying globalization, and the establishment of a virtuous cycle stemming from longstanding shortages of labor. These have resulted in other changes in Japan, such as the increased expectation of a rise in the economy's growth potential owing to the expansion of supply capacity, and an increase in 
 10 the robustness of the economy to changes in the external environment. I will touch on each of these points in order, and then explain how monetary policy should be conducted in response to these structural changes.  A. Changes in the Industrial Structure Accompanying Globalization Japanese manufacturers have been expanding their businesses in overseas markets since the beginning of the globalization trend that has lasted for over four decades following the collapse of the Bretton Woods system. Consequently, the share of the nonmanufacturing sector in Japan's GDP, which is a measure of overall domestic production, accounts for about 80 percent. Japan's outward direct investment has expanded rapidly with significant adjustments in foreign exchange rates since the latter half of the 1980s, leading to the establishment of current global supply chains.  Reflecting the structural change of manufacturers' shifting their production sites overseas, the contribution of income generated through outward direct investment and outward portfolio investment, which is the fruit of firms' outward investment, has tended to increase in Japan's current account (Chart 12). At present, Japan's current account surplus accounts for approximately 4 percent of nominal GDP, and this consists mostly of gains from outward direct investment and outward portfolio investment. Japan's nominal gross national income (GNI) -- which is a measure of the nation's nominal GDP plus net income from overseas sources -- is about 4 percent larger than GDP, showing that Japan's economic structure has steadily changed to one in which manufacturers make profits from production overseas.  B. Virtuous Cycle of the Economy amid Longstanding Shortages of Labor Let me now turn to structural changes in Japan's economy. Since around 2017, amid longstanding shortages of labor, some distinctive developments continue to be observed, such as moderate growth of the economy, the positive output gap, non-deflationary price rises, and an increase in business fixed investment. This suggests that the simultaneous progress of these interacting developments has contributed to the sustained operation of a virtuous cycle in Japan's economy.  
 11 The positive output gap has been maintained as labor shortages continue amid a growing elderly population and a declining working-age population, coupled with the expansion of demand induced by monetary and fiscal policies. This seems to have raised the corporate sector's expectations that both the moderate expansion of the economy and labor shortages are likely to continue in the medium to long term. These raised expectations have led firms to the assessment that it would be possible to secure the cost-effectiveness of their investments, including long-term investments, as the positive business environment would be maintained to a certain extent. As a result, fixed investment has expanded, particularly investment aimed at saving labor.  C. Expectations for a Rise in Potential Growth Rate Accompanying the Expansion of Supply Capacity Business fixed investment is one of the components that make up a nation's GDP. In addition to short-term demand, it expands supply by increasing production capacity and improving productivity in the medium to long term. As supply capacity has expanded in Japan along with the structural change of a continuous expansion of business fixed investment, there is the possibility that a moderate increase in the potential growth rate will be induced hereafter, with some time lag.  Looking at recent developments in the potential growth rate, while the contribution of labor input has been decreasing, that of capital stock and total factor productivity (TFP) has started to bottom out (Chart 13). The expansion of business fixed investment, which has continued for the past three years, is starting to induce a supply-side structural change. Together with an increase in R&D investment with an eye toward promoting innovation, if the potential growth rate rises in the future -- in which case the natural rate of interest will also rise, causing real interest rates to fall below the natural rate of interest -- the same level of policy rate will have a greater easing effect.  D. Increased Robustness to Changes in External Demand Another structural change I should point to is the increased robustness of the economy to changes in external demand. Given the established global supply chains, Japanese manufacturers have divided their production at home and abroad as follows: (1) overseas sites 
 12 producing for their own local market and for export to third countries, and (2) Japanese sites producing for Japan's domestic market. This division has likely resulted in a mitigated adverse effect that a slowdown in external demand would have on Japan's GDP through a decrease in exports.  Given the geopolitical background to the U.S.-China trade conflict, it is entirely possible, depending on future developments, that existing global supply chains may be reorganized, particularly with respect to China. Nonetheless, I expect that such reorganization will not greatly affect the decision making of Japanese firms regarding where to establish their production sites -- whether in Japan or abroad, whether for export or for local production. This is because the division of work among production sites at home and abroad has already been established to a certain extent, and it is difficult to imagine any significant decline in domestic business fixed investment, even if overseas production were relocated to a different country. Moreover, it is highly likely that domestic business fixed investment will continue to expand in light of other structural changes, such as firm investment by the nonmanufacturing sector and labor shortages that are expected to continue in the medium to long term.  E. Monetary Policy Supporting Structural Changes in Japan's Economy The fundamental role of monetary policy is to achieve price stability, thereby realizing and maintaining a sound macroeconomic environment. The Bank's monetary policy itself does not have a direct impact in terms of altering Japan's economic structure. However, as the large-scale monetary easing policy has been in place for almost seven years, many indicators suggest that Japan's economy has improved, and prices are no longer in deflation. Even since the start of this year, solid domestic demand has supported a continued moderate expansion, despite the economy being affected somewhat by the slowdown in the global economy caused by the intensified U.S.-China trade conflict.  Increased robustness to changes in external demand has helped sustain Japan's moderate economic growth, even in the face of a continuing slowdown in the global economy. As favorable economic conditions have been maintained, structural changes in the economy have brought about this increased robustness. In other words, being committed to continuing with 
 13 large-scale monetary easing policy has led to improvements in economic activity, thereby indirectly supporting the structural changes in the economy.  Moreover, the current monetary easing policy has been effective owing partly to the stability of the whole macroeconomic policy framework. The government and the Bank have clearly shared a basic understanding of the policy mandate and the division of their roles in conducting the monetary and fiscal policy mix. While monetary policy aims to directly stabilize the economy, fiscal policy aims not only to stimulate the economy as a whole but also to implement a structural policy through such channels as budgetary allocations. It seems evident that both the stabilization of the economy in recent years and the smooth structural changes that have occurred can be attributed to this mix of monetary and fiscal policies, grounded in macroeconomic policy.  Furthermore, it is also important to note from a global perspective that Japan's economy has been generally stable in recent years. At present, there are no large differences in the levels of price targets among major advanced countries, and since the start of the year their monetary policies have tended to be more or less accommodative. Also, as a decade has passed since the global financial crisis, the balance between the size of the central bank's balance sheet and the money supply in each of the major advanced countries has been quite stable (Chart 14). In other words, this could be seen as an indication that the difference in the levels of quantitative easing in major countries has declined. In addition, as Japan's economy continues to be no longer in deflation, there has been a significant decline in the difference between major countries' inflation rates -- which affects the long-term nominal exchange rate in light of purchasing power parity (PPP) (Chart 15). Under these circumstances, financial markets may fluctuate in the short term in reaction to news reports, but in the long run appear to move only within a certain range. This suggests that the similarity of global monetary policies in major countries is constraining market fluctuations, thereby contributing -- together with the increased robustness of the economy to changes in external demand -- to the stabilization of Japan's economy.  
 14 Japan's accommodative monetary policy supports structural changes in the economy by sustaining a policy mix with fiscal policy, and through the similarity of global monetary policies. It also functions as an anchor that constrains fluctuations in financial markets.  Among the concerns that have emerged in light of the U.S.-China trade conflict, there are worries regarding frameworks of international cooperation, which have come under considerable strain. The outlook for global trade issues is a matter for concern. Nevertheless, while Japan's policy mix and global accommodative financial conditions are maintained, I consider the important policy issue for Japan is to sustain the positive output gap and support the changes to the economic structure that have begun by appropriately addressing the slowdown in the global economy and waiting patiently for its recovery.  Thank you for your attention.

Yakiv Smolii: National Bank of Ukraine press briefing - monetarypolicy statementSpeech by Mr Yakiv Smolii, Governor of the National Bank of Ukraine, at a press briefing onmonetary policy, Kyiv, 12 December 2019.*   *   *Dear colleagues,Please be informed that the Board of the National Bank of Ukraine has decided to cut the keypolicy rate to 13.5% per annum effective 13 December 2019.The NBU speeds up the monetary policy easing, as the rapid appreciation of the hryvnia makesinflationary pressures decline faster than expected.What inflation developments followed the last monetary policy meeting?In November, consumer inflation slowed to 5.1% yoy, exceeding our expectations. Insuch a way, the NBU attained the medium-term target of 5%, which was set in 2015.The steady disinflation has been driven by a gradual easing of underlying pressures on prices,reflected in a slowdown of core inflation, and by lower energy prices. Inflation slowed markedlydue to both the strengthening of the hryvnia and an improvement in inflation expectations. Theabove factors neutralized the pressure on prices from robust consumer demand and worseharvest of some vegetables.I would like to emphasize the reasons for the hryvnia appreciation, which has given rise to muchspeculation. In October–November, the excess supply of foreign currency was mainly driven byproceeds from Ukrainian exports, in particular thanks to a record harvest of grain and oil crops,and selling foreign currency coming from borrowings of state-owned companies.In particular, agriculture and metals industry provided 70% of foreign currency supply on theinterbank market in November. Contrary to the common belief, the continued foreign investmentin  hryvnia government bonds did not have a major impact on the foreign exchange market, unlikein the past months.At the same time, the NBU actively purchased excess foreign currency to increase internationalreserves.  Net foreign exchange interventions have totaled more than USD 5.5 billion since thestart of 2019.(Corrected) Besides, our purchases of foreign currency much exceed the inflows fromnonresidents. The nonresident portfolio grew by around USD 4 billion this year. Thus, netpurchases exceeded this amount by more than one and a half billion dollars. This indicates thatthese are not only nonresidents who create the excess supply of foreign currency.What are the future inflation developments?The stronger hryvnia made inflation decline towards the 5% target faster than envisaged in thelatest macroeconomic forecast. For that reason, in January, we will revise and publish the newmacroeconomic forecast, including the future inflation trajectory.There is a cause for optimism. Reaching the staff-level agreement on the new cooperationprogram with the International Monetary Fund is an important milestone in the progress ofstructural reforms in Ukraine as well as in maintaining macrofinancial stability and steadyeconomic growth. 1 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
At the same time, other risks that the NBU took into consideration when making itsprevious monetary policy decision remain in place.In particular, the risk of rising threats to macrofinancial stability persists because of court rulingsand pressure on the NBU. If materialized, these risks could worsen exchange rate and inflationexpectations, and make it harder for Ukraine to access the international capital markets at a timewhen debt repayments are peaking.The following external risks remain relevant:a complete halt of the transit of Russian gas through Ukraineintensified trade tensions and more turbulent global financial marketsan escalation of the military conflict and new trade restrictions introduced by Russia.Therefore, macroeconomic conditions that are more conducive to lower inflation,continued cooperation with the IMF, and the practically unchanged balance of risks haveenabled the NBU to ease monetary policy more quickly.The NBU believes that more active cuts in the key policy rate will not prevent it from maintaininginflation close to its 5% target, while at the same time promoting economic growth. Favorable macroeconomic conditions have given the NBU the green light to take a number ofother steps together with key policy rate cuts.First, the NBU intends to purchase more foreign currency to replenish internationalreserves.With that in mind, the central bank will increase the amount of its planned interventions in theinterbank market to purchase foreign currency from USD 30 to USD 50 million per day for theremainder of the current year and Q1 2020.Second, the NBU has changed its approach to reserve requirements for banks.From March 2020, the NBU will introduce differing reserve ratios for different currencies. Forhryvnia reserves, this ratio will be decreased to zero. For FX reserves, this ratio will be raised to10%. The NBU believes that this will not only contribute to the lower dollarization of deposits butwill also helpdecrease loan rates for households and businesses more quickly.Third, the NBU continues to liberalize the FX market.The e-limit on households’ investment abroad will be increased by two times – to EUR 100,000per year.The Board approved all of the three decisions today at the monetary policy meeting. Moreinformation about these decisions will be made public today on the central bank’s website.What will the NBU’s monetary policy stance be in future?The macroeconomic forecast that the NBU published in October envisages that the keypolicy rate will be cut further, to 8%.A revised macroeconomic forecast will be made public in January 2020. Among other things, theforecast will take into account the impact of consumer demand and FX market conditions onfuture inflation.In addition, the NBU will continue to monitor what  progress is achieved in implementing key 2 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
domestic reforms. These reforms are those that are envisaged in the memorandum ofunderstanding signed by the Ukrainian government and the NBU, and the judicial reform requiredto establish the rule of law in Ukraine.The next meeting of the NBU Board on monetary policy issues will be held on 30 January 2020.Thank you for your attention! 3 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
Jessica Chew Cheng Lian: Empowering financial consumers in thedigital ageWelcoming remarks by Jessica Chew Cheng Lian, Deputy Governor of the Central Bank ofMalaysia (Bank Negara Malaysia), at the BNM-OECD Conference on “Financial Education andFinancial Consumer Protection in Asia-Pacific”, Kuala Lumpur, 11 December 2019.*   *   *As I made my way in to work this morning, I glanced through my smartphone to check on mymonthly bills, how much pocket money my sons had spent over the week and on what. I alsobrowsed for money changers offering the best exchange rates for my next trip. Having all thisinformation available to me literally at my fingertips would have been unthinkable years ago.Today, I can organise my financial matters quickly and conveniently over a 20-minute car ride towork!It is my great pleasure to extend a warm welcome to all delegates to Kuala Lumpur and to theConference on Financial Education and Financial Consumer Protection in Asia-Pacific. We aredelighted to co-host this event in collaboration with the OECD.At risk of repeating what many others have already acknowledged, let me say at the outset thatfinancial education and financial consumer protection have never been more important, or moreconfounding, than in the digital age that is upon us. At stake is our ability to preserve publicconfidence in the financial system, and seize an unprecedented opportunity to come withinstriking distance of at least six of the Sustainable Development Goals: no poverty, zero hunger,good health and well-being, quality education, gender equality and reducing inequality. ThisConference, themed “Empowering financial consumers in the digital age”, aims to help usuntangle and develop sensible responses to the myriad of issues associated with the rapiddigitalisation of financial services.Digital financial services adoption in Asia-PacificThe financial services industry has long been at the forefront of the digital revolution, benefittingfrom efficiency gains, cost savings and wider outreach. For traditional financial institutions, it hasalso been a matter of survival against an onslaught of highly innovative and nimbler competitors.In recent years, industry players – both traditional and non-traditional – have rapidly scaled uptheir use of technology to create better customer experiences by making financial products andservices more accessible, flexible and competitive.As adoption rates rise, online banking, e-insurance and e-payments are quickly approaching atipping point at which they will eclipse physical branches, ATMs and cash as conduits forfinancial transactions. In some markets, this is already a reality. It has been reported that nearlytwo-thirds of consumers in the Asia-Pacific region are active fintech users. The adoption ratesare even higher in trailblazer markets such as China and India, where the share of active fintechusers is estimated to be about 87%. The region as a whole is an active hive of experimentation indigital financial services, supported by favourable consumer demographics, particularly thedigitally savvy youth.In Southeast Asia, digital financial services is estimated to contribute about 5% of the totalrevenue for the financial sector this year. This share is expected to more than double to 11%within the next five years, driven among others by digital lending, investment, remittance andinsurance products. Here in Malaysia, the most recent demand side survey on financial capabilityand inclusion indicated that four in ten Malaysians utilise internet banking services, up from justone in ten as recently as three years before. This trend is expected to intensify, with theexpansion in digital product offerings and growing acceptance of online financial services. 1 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
Building trust and confidenceDigitalisation can also be a powerful force for sustainable financial inclusion. By lowering costsand increasing scale and reach, it has become a means for providing access to essentialfinancial services such as e-payments, micro-insurance and online remittance to previouslyunderserved segments. Other innovations such as banking and insurance aggregators are alsohelping consumers make better financial decisions, in turn, increasing their confidence in usingfinancial services.For a region where socioeconomic disparities are wide, where the rural-urban divide is pervasiveand considerable segments of society are still excluded from the economic and socialmainstream, these developments have enormous potential to transform the current state to onewhere the financial needs of all segments of society are catered to.Several pre-conditions however must exist to realise this potential, and they all have to do withsecuring the trust and confidence of consumers in the digital financial system. This includes aregulatory framework that is appropriate and proportionate, a secure digital financialinfrastructure and incentive systems that are aligned with providers that are both responsive andresponsible.In Malaysia, efforts that are underway to enact a new Consumer Credit Act will further strengthenthe foundations for the development of consumer finance in the digital age. The proposedlegislation is important on several levels. First, it will reinforce fundamental protections providedto consumers in the provision of credit, including that provided by a growing number of non-traditional entities through digital solutions. Second, it will institutionalise inter-agencyarrangements between authorities responsible for regulating consumer credit activities topromote consistent minimum protections and fair treatment of borrowers. And third, it will providestronger assurance of more responsive and coordinated consumer protection arrangements totake into account the fast-evolving financial services landscape going forward.Equally important is a strong focus on financial education to promote financially and digitallyliterate consumers. Safeguarding the interests of consumers without stifling innovation remainsone of the most difficult balances to achieve for regulators. Regulators are constantly trading offconsiderations of privacy against efficiency; fragmentation against competition; access againstrisks of abuse.In the digital age, these trade-offs become impossible without equipping consumers with theinformation, knowledge and tools that they need to protect themselves and make decisions thatare in their own best interests. It is only through a complementary mix of appropriate but notexcessive regulation, and enlightened and confident consumers, that we will find the rightbalance of guiding the development of digital financial services so that it is neither hurried norhampered, and remains sustainable and well-functioning to promote financial stability andinclusive growth.For Bank Negara Malaysia, our regulatory agenda is supported by a long-standing focus onfinancial education. This year, I am pleased to share that this has been elevated to a national-level priority with the launch of Malaysia’s first five-year National Strategy for Financial Literacy. Akey focus of the strategy is helping consumers protect themselves against fraud and exploitation,and embrace innovation more confidently in the digital era. This needs to start with the young, butwithout neglecting those for whom the digital world is both unfamiliar and daunting.Specific challenges in a digital eraLet me just mention a few of the specific challenges that financial services authorities will have tocontend with in the digital era. 2 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
Increasing incidents of data abuse on social media platforms, security breaches andcybersecurity threats can sow mistrust and confidence deficits in digital systems. In ourrespective markets, these incidents are likely to reveal gaps in existing data protection andconsumer protection regimes and the need to explicitly address ownership rights and permitteduses of personal customer information.Prospects of digital profiling, and decisions driven by the use of complex algorithms can alsoresult in financial consumers being unfairly discriminated against or targeted by unsolicited andunscrupulous marketing campaigns. Rather than delivering on its vast promise, digitalisationcould instead become a polarising and divisive instrument. Take the provision of online credit, forexample, the use of algorithm-based online credit scoring tools have led in some cases toassessments that are gender-biased, with female candidates consistently assigned lower creditscores compared to male counterparts of equal financial standing. Behaviourally, there is in factevidence in Malaysia and likely elsewhere, to suggest that the opposite is true.We can and must do better.Proportionate laws and regulations must be in place to hold financial service providersaccountable for establishing effective safeguards against the theft or abuse of personal data, anddiscrimination or unfair practices. The focus on consumer protection needs to shift from justaddressing customer touchpoints, to the consideration of consumer needs much earlier in theproduct design process, in the formulation of distribution strategies or in the setting of risk limits.Predictive models used for decision-making must be subject to regular reviews againstconsumer outcomes and redress channels need to be aligned with the digital experience.Indeed, we should be concerned that while the delivery of financial products and services istaking on increasingly digital dimensions, when something goes wrong, processes forconsumers to seek redress are still heavily manual in nature.As for financial education, I am reminded of the old adage by Sir Francis Bacon: “Readingmaketh a full man, conference a ready man, writing an exact man”. Today’s digital consumer – atleast many of them – has neither the patience nor time to read, confer or write. In fact, this isalmost the entire premise of digital financial solutions – brevity, speed and convenience. Theshort attention spans of financial consumers are further constrained by an overload ofinformation and misinformation.Digital solutions that can efficiently deliver financial education to masses of people, whilesimultaneously providing capabilities to tailor knowledge and information to one’s personalcircumstances (such as through loan affordability calculators), have gained increasing traction.However, the fact that digital interventions are more cost-efficient, accessible and scalable, donot automatically make them any more effective than more traditional interventions in the pastthat have failed to achieve a consistent and lasting impact in changing behaviour.We need to develop reliable insights into behavioural influences that may help or preventconsumers from making good financial decisions. This sounds simple in theory, but is ascomplex as an understanding of human psychology itself. As our understanding evolves, thesolutions that work best are likely to be a messy blend of digital and traditional, as well as mass-market and bespoke, approaches.In navigating these challenges, there is much that we can learn from each other. No one has it allfigured out. We each have successes and failures, and by sharing them, we can help each othermove forward with greater confidence in a world that is constantly unfolding before our eyes withevery new digital experience. We are therefore privileged and grateful to be able to gather such adiverse and distinguished group of speakers and participants to add to our collective body ofknowledge and experience. On that note, let me thank you all again for being a part of this eventhere and I wish you rich and productive discussions ahead. 3 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
